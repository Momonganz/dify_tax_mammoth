GST: A Review A Government discussion document GST: A review. A tax policy discussion document. First published in March 1999 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington, New Zealand. ISBN 0-478-10332-8 PREFACE Since its introduction in 1986, goods and services tax (GST) has been an important part of New Zealand’s tax system. It taxes, at a single rate, most supplies of goods and services in New Zealand, with few exceptions. Internationally, New Zealand’s GST system is acknowledged as a well designed indirect tax, influencing the design of indirect taxes put in place in other countries. The performance of tax legislation is monitored through the Government’s generic tax policy process to ensure that the legislation meets its objectives. As a part of this process, a review of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been carried out, and proposed changes resulting from the review are presented in this discussion document for public consultation. The twelve years since GST was introduced have highlighted areas where change may be needed: to make it easier to comply with, to bring it up to date with developments in the commercial world, and to ensure that its original policy objectives are being met. The Government welcomes the public’s views on these proposals and looks forward to receiving submissions.

It is also a key contributor to Government revenue. 1.2 This discussion document is the product of the first review of GST under the Government’s generic tax policy process, which presents opportunities for public consultation at key stages in the formulation of tax policy. The document sets out proposals to improve the workability of GST for taxpayers and Inland Revenue and to give better effect in some areas to the policy intent underlying GST. It also signals possible future avenues for development and reform of GST. Background The Red Paper (November 1984) 1.3 The intended introduction of a broad-based consumption tax, GST, was announced in the 1984 Budget. A booklet known as the “Red Paper” 1 outlined the economic reasons for the introduction of GST. 1.4 The New Zealand tax system at the time consisted mainly of income tax and a wholesale sales tax which had many exemptions and a number of rates applying to different goods. With its narrow base and the exclusion of services, which represented a growing part of the economy, the wholesale sales tax was not capable of generating significant revenue. 1.5 Tax revenue relied more heavily on the income tax system, which featured rates of up to 66 percent and many rebates and deductions. It was relatively easy to reduce income tax liabilities, and the income tax system did not provide a good foundation for raising additional revenue. 1.6 Therefore the introduction of GST and income tax reforms were seen as significantly reducing the economic distortions created by the tax system, reducing compliance and administrative costs, and improving the ability of the Government to meet its revenue requirements. 1 Goods and Services Tax: A Booklet Explaining Measures Announced in the 1984 Budget, 8 November 1984. Part I: Introduction 4 The White Paper (March 1985) 1.7 The “White Paper” 2 was used to generate public debate on the proposed GST. The White Paper called for submissions on the proposals for the administration of the tax and ways in which those proposals could be improved and simplified. Advisory Panel on the Goods and Services Tax (June 1985) 1.8 An independent advisory panel considered over 1400 public submissions resulting from the White Paper, and reported on these submissions in June 1985. There was general public support for a broad-based, single-rate GST. 1.9 The report focused mainly on making recommendations that would reduce or ease compliance costs in areas such as the basis of accounting for GST, return periods, invoicing requirements and the time of supply. It also suggested ways of minimising the general cash flow impact of GST for certain taxpayers. Most of these suggestions were accepted by the Government. Post-implementation changes 1.10 A number of changes have been made to GST since it was introduced, most being of a remedial nature or for the purpose of reducing compliance costs (for example, the introduction of the hybrid basis of accounting for GST in 1991). Policy objectives 1.11 The primary objective of GST is to raise tax revenue in a manner that imposes the lowest possible costs on New Zealand as a whole. 1.12 To achieve that objective, GST was applied to as broad a range of goods and services as was considered feasible at the time of its introduction, at a uniform low rate. As the White Paper stated, GST was formulated with the intention of: “...bring\[ing\] within its scope the widest range of goods and services supplied in New Zealand ... liability for GST aris\[ing\] every time goods and services are supplied in the course of conduct of a taxable activity.” 3 2 White Paper on Goods & Services Tax: Proposals for the Administration of the Goods and Services Tax March 1985. 3 Ibid, at page 11. Introduction 5 1.13 This broad-based, low-rate approach is intended to reduce the extent to which GST alters consumption decisions in New Zealand. Thus it seeks to reduce the extent to which GST affects consumption of particular goods and services, and alters patterns of consumption by changing the relative prices that consumers must pay for their goods and services. 1.14 The broad base and low rate of GST is also intended to reduce the extent to which GST distorts production and resource use decisions in New Zealand. In particular, the approach adopted seeks to reduce the extent to which GST alters the relative competitive position of a New Zealand business in both the markets for the goods and services it produces, and the markets for the purchases it makes to produce those goods and services. Thus it seeks to reduce the extent to which GST distorts the relative prices that New Zealand businesses are paid for their sales of goods and services, and the relative prices they pay for their purchases. It also seeks to reduce the compliance and administrative costs associated with raising GST revenue. 1.15 Another important objective of GST is to prevent the double taxation of goods and services that are traded between New Zealand and other countries. GST is designed in accordance with the “destination principle”, which seeks to eliminate double taxation by assigning the rights to tax the consumption of traded goods and services to the jurisdiction in which those goods and services are destined to be consumed. Objectives of the review 1.16 Several developments since the introduction of GST make it timely to review the tax. In particular, a number of issues that have arisen suggest the original policy intent of the legislation in some areas is either not being achieved, or is ambiguous and needs clarification. 1.17 The years since GST was introduced have also seen important changes in technology and the business environment which necessitate a review of the law in certain areas. 1.18 The objective of this review is to re-examine GST in light of those developments to determine whether it is possible to achieve further reductions in the costs of raising GST revenue. Specifically, the Government is seeking to develop proposals that will: • reduce the compliance and administrative costs arising from the application of GST; and • limit the scope for erosion of the GST tax base. Part I: Introduction 6 The scope of the review 1.19 As reflected in the structure of this discussion document, the scope of the review covers four broad subject areas: • issues relating to working with GST in practice, including compliance cost savings measures; • issues relating to giving effect to the policy underlying GST; • remedial issues; and • issues relating to the future for GST. Working with GST 1.20 This part of the discussion document deals with issues arising from the application and administration of GST in practice. These are: • Compliance cost issues: the thresholds for compulsory registration and other issues concerning compliance cost reduction measures. • Change in use adjustments: issues arising from the requirement to make adjustments for changes in use. Maintaining the revenue base 1.21 This part of the discussion document examines the potential for GST to create tax avoidance opportunities, and the operation of the general anti- avoidance provision, section 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act). It then discusses four areas where effect needs to be given to the underlying policy of GST: • Second-hand goods input tax credit: the credit for supplies of second- hand goods, particularly land. • Deregistration: the value of a deemed supply on deregistration. • Exported services: the effect of the decision in Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 4 • Deferred settlements: the treatment of deferred payments. Remedial issues 1.22 This part of the discussion document deals with numerous remedial issues, including futures contracts, debt collection, factored debts, going concerns and software. 4 (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. Introduction 7 The future for GST 1.23 This part considers the future scope and application of GST – issues relating to GST on imported services and the desirability of retaining the exemption for financial services. Specific recommendations in these areas are not proposed here because the complexity of the issues will require detailed consultation with those parties that are primarily affected. Application date 1.24 In general, the proposals in this discussion document will apply from the date the amending legislation is enacted. The exception is the proposal in chapter nine relating to services contracted for offshore with a non-resident and subsequently consumed in New Zealand. The Government intends to include this proposal in the next available taxation bill, and the change will take effect from the date that the legislation is introduced into Parliament. Submissions 1.25 The Government invites submissions on the proposals in this discussion document. 1.26 Specific issues on which comment is sought are highlighted at the end of each chapter, although this is not intended to limit the scope of submissions. 1.27 All submissions should be addressed to: GST Review C/- General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON 1.28 Submissions on the proposal in chapter nine should be made by 26 March. Submissions on all other proposals should be made by 30 April. They should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. Submissions received by the due date will be acknowledged. Part I: Introduction 8 Summary of proposals Compliance cost savings measures • Increase the compulsory registration threshold from $30,000 to $40,000. • Provide the Commissioner with the power in certain circumstances to reverse a decision that allows registered persons to change the last day of their taxable period. • Increase the existing $1,000,000 turnover threshold for accounting on the payments basis to $1,300,000. • Remove the existing unrestricted right for local authorities to account for GST using the payments basis. • Increase the threshold when an abbreviated invoice is acceptable to justify the deduction of input tax from $200 to $1,000. Change in use adjustments – compliance issues • Legislate the current administrative methods of allocation (direct attribution, turnover, or special method) for establishing the proportion of taxable and non- taxable use. • Allow registered persons, at their option, to make output tax adjustments on a one-off basis subject to certain conditions. • In relation to one-off output tax adjustments, include a requirement to make further adjustments at the time a significant change in use occurs. • Generally require deemed supplies from a change in use of goods and services to be valued at market value. • Allow period-by-period adjustments to be made annually. • Increase the $10,000 threshold for one-off input tax adjustments for changes from non-taxable to taxable use to $18,000. • Increase the minimum threshold for exempt supplies (over which adjustments must be made) from $48,000 to $90,000. Change in use adjustments – other issues • Limit the input tax credit allowed for changes from non-taxable to taxable use to supplies of goods and services on which GST has been charged and to supplies of second-hand goods. • Ensure that output tax adjustments for any non-taxable use apply to goods and services acquired or produced as well as applied for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Introduction 9 • Determine adjustments for dual purpose goods and services by reference to their use rather than their application. • Ensure that an adjustment is triggered by any change of use (not just a subsequent change of use). • Ensure that fringe benefits provided to past employees (including associated persons) are subject to GST. The general anti-avoidance provision – section 76 • Change from a subjective test of intention to the more objective test of the effect of an arrangement. • Change the test of defeating the intent and application of the Act to that of defeating the “intended application” of the Act. • Include a purpose provision in the Act to assist in clarifying the intended application of the Act. • Clarify that the Commissioner’s specific reconstructive powers in section 76(2) do not limit the general reconstructive power in section 76(1). The second-hand goods input tax credit • Limit the notional credit in relation to supplies of second-hand goods made to an associated person to the lesser of: - the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; or - one-ninth of the purchase price; or - one-ninth of the open market value. Deregistration • Require any deemed supply on deregistration to be valued at market value. Exported services • Exclude from zero-rating the supply of a right to receive a service if any recipient of that service will be in New Zealand at the time it is performed. Deferred settlements • Require GST to be returned on an accrual basis for any supply exceeding $200,000 in value. Financial services exemption • Exclude debt collection services from the definition of “financial services”. • Include financial options in the definition of “financial services”. Part I: Introduction 10 • Provide that non-deliverable futures contracts will be exempt if they are tradeable on a defined market or are traded at arm’s length. • Clarify that deliverable futures contracts will be subject to GST unless the deliverable commodity is exempt. • Treat penalty interest as being in respect of a financial service. • Repeal the proviso in subparagraph (ii) of section 14(a) which excludes goods or services that are not themselves financial services from being financial services. Factored debts • Require registered persons accounting for GST on a payments basis to pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. Going concerns • Require the “going concern” test to be applied when the supply is deemed to be made. • Require a business to be capable of being carried on by a purchaser for it to be transferred as a “going concern”. Exported services: remedial issues • Allow the supply of services in relation to exported goods to be zero-rated. • Include a definition of the phrase “outside New Zealand” in section 11(2)(e) and (fa). The treatment of software • Treat copies of software programs as “goods” and copyright in relation to software programs as “services”. This is not intended to affect the current treatment of imported software under section 12. The definition of “associated persons” • Replace the definition of “associated persons” for GST purposes with the broader definition used in the Income Tax Act 1994. This definition would include: -stronger provisions dealing with trusts; -a level of association between a shareholder and a company at 25 percent rather than 10 percent; -a rule to aggregate the rights held in a company by relatives. • Include people in de facto relationships in the definition of “associated persons” in the GST Act. Introduction 11 Unincorporated bodies: debt priority and members’ liability for GST • Confirm the preferential status of GST debts recoverable from individual members of an unincorporated body. • Ensure that preferential status for unpaid GST debts of an unincorporated body applies if a receiver is appointed other than by court order. • Confirm that the liability of a member of an unincorporated body for GST payable during the time the person was a member extends beyond the period of membership. Personal representatives, liquidators, and receivers • Amend section 58(1A) (specified agent carrying on taxable activity) to include a receiver appointed to control only part of a taxable activity. • Clarify when an agency period terminates. • Allow personal representatives an input tax credit for the GST component of bad debts related to pre-agency period supplies. • Clarify the relationship between section 58(1A) and section 5(2). Other issues • Amend the definition of “taxable activity” so that it includes both a premature ending of a taxable activity as well as a successful completion of a taxable activity. • Amend the definition of “input tax” to allow importers who are acting as an agent for a non-resident to claim an input tax credit for any GST levied under section 12. • Deem the time of supply for suspensory loans to be the time when the loan is made. • Recognise the value of a voucher for services when the voucher is acquired. • Allow the value of a voucher with a face value to be deducted from the gross proceeds of a lottery event. 12 CHAPTER TWO KEY CONCEPTS IN THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT 2.1 GST is intended to apply to the change in value at each point in the production and distribution of goods and services, with the tax being ultimately paid by the final consumer. The GST Act gives effect to this broad objective through a number of key concepts including registered person, goods and services, taxable activity, taxable supply, and the time, value and place of supply. Section 8 is the core provision of the GST Act as it imposes GST by reference to these key concepts. An important aspect of measuring the amount of value added by a supplier is the ability to claim input tax credits for purchases. 2.2 This chapter describes these concepts and their place in setting the scheme of the GST Act. Registered persons 2.3 Section 51 contains the requirements for registering for GST. Registration is required if there is a taxable activity involving taxable supplies of more than $30,000 in a 12-month period. Anyone carrying on a taxable activity under that threshold may also choose to register. 2.4 The registration threshold minimises compliance and administrative costs by directing GST to those suppliers best able to comply with the requirements of the GST Act. Goods and services 2.5 “Goods” is defined in section 2 as all kinds of real or personal property other than choses in action 5 or money. “Services” is defined as anything which is not goods or money. Therefore money is not subject to GST, and choses in action are deemed to be services. These definitions ensure that GST applies to a very wide range of supplies. Taxable activity 2.6 The taxable activity test establishes the boundaries within which GST operates. It is similar to a business test but without the requirement that the activity be carried on for profit. 5 For example, leases of land, use of patent rights, an interest in a partnership, company shares, trademarks and copyrights. Key concepts in the Goods and Services Tax Act 13 2.7 A “taxable activity” is defined in section 6. Whether or not a taxable activity exists depends on whether: • an activity is carried on continuously or regularly; and • it involves, or is intended to involve, supplies to another person for a consideration or payment. Taxable supply 2.8 A “supply” is defined in section 5 to include all forms of supply. A taxable supply is one which is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and meets the other key elements of section 8. Taxable supplies are charged with GST either at the standard 12.5 percent rate or, in certain circumstances, at zero percent. 2.9 Taxable supplies include goods taken from a business by a registered person for private use and assets on hand at the time a person ceases to be registered. This treatment ensures that the principle of final consumption applies to the application of assets outside a taxable activity as well as to supplies to another person as a final consumer. Exempt supplies 2.10 Taxable supplies do not include exempt supplies. These include primarily: • supplies of financial services; • supplies of residential accommodation; and • supplies of donated goods and services by non-profit bodies. Zero-rated supplies 2.11 Section 11 lists the supplies that are charged with GST but at a zero rate. The main zero-rated supplies are exported goods and services. No GST is charged on them because they are not consumed in New Zealand. Exporters can, however, claim input tax credits for the cost of acquiring or producing the exported goods or services. 2.12 For compliance and administrative reasons, zero-rated supplies also include the supply (in specific circumstances) of a going concern between two registered persons. Part I: Introduction 14 Time of supply 2.13 Section 9 contains the rules that deem when a supply of goods or services has taken place. The time of a supply is generally the earlier of the time a supplier issues an invoice or the time the supplier receives any payment. Value of supply 2.14 Section 10 provides that the value of a supply is determined by the amount of consideration given in exchange for a supply. Consideration is generally the money received for the supply or the open market value of any non-monetary consideration received. Supplies between associated persons are deemed to be made at open market value except when the purchaser is entitled to an input tax credit. Place of supply 2.15 GST applies to supplies made in New Zealand. This ensures that only consumption that occurs in New Zealand is subject to GST. The place of supply is determined first by reference to the residence of the supplier. Supplies by residents are deemed to be made in New Zealand. 2.16 Supplies by non-residents are generally deemed to be made outside New Zealand unless, in the case of goods, they are in New Zealand at the time of supply or, in the case of services, they are physically performed in New Zealand. If the goods and services are supplied by a non-resident to a registered person the supply is deemed to be made outside New Zealand unless the supplier and purchaser agree otherwise. Input tax credits 2.17 Registered persons are entitled to claim input tax credits for the GST component of the cost of goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Allowing an input tax credit ensures that only the amount of value added by the registered person is subject to GST. 2.18 An input tax credit is defined in section 2 to include tax charged under section 8. To ensure equal treatment of supplies of new and second-hand goods a notional credit is allowed to registered persons in relation to second- hand goods they acquire from non-registered persons. 2.19 Adjustments are made under section 21 to alter, in effect, the amount of an input tax credit allowed for goods or services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies but applied to another purpose. Key concepts in the Goods and Services Tax Act 15 2.20 Figure 1 shows the application of these key features to a transaction. FIGURE 1: APPLYING THE KEY FEATURES OF GST Does the transaction involve a supply? The transaction is not subject to GST Have either goods or services been supplied? The transaction is subject to GST at 12.5% or zero %. Is the supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity? Is the supply made by a registered person? Is it an exempt supply? Is the supply in New Zealand? Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes No No Yes No No No Part II Working with GST 19 CHAPTER THREE COMPLIANCE COST SAVINGS MEASURES Proposed policy Registration threshold • Increase the compulsory registration threshold from $30,000 to $40,000. Six-monthly taxable period • Retain the existing $250,000 turnover threshold for the six-monthly taxable period. One-month taxable period • Retain the existing one-month taxable period for registered persons with a turnover exceeding $24 million or those who choose to file on this basis. Other taxable periods • Review the two-monthly taxable period to see whether extending the period could reduce compliance costs. Last day of taxable period • Provide the Commissioner with the power to reverse any decision that allows registered persons to change the last day of their taxable period. Payments basis • Increase the existing $1,000,000 turnover threshold for accounting for GST on the payments basis to $1,300,000. • Remove the existing unrestricted right for local authorities to account for GST using the payments basis. Tax invoices • Increase the threshold when an abbreviated invoice is acceptable to justify the deduction of input tax from $200 to $1,000. 3.1 GST is a self-assessed tax in that registered persons are responsible for determining their own tax liability. This is appropriate as they are in a better position than the Government to know their own GST liability. 3.2 The Government acknowledges the costs that GST imposes on registered persons, and this chapter proposes a number of measures to ease that compliance cost burden. Easing this burden does not, however, come without a cost to Government revenue. Part II: Working with GST 20 3.3 Therefore the aims of the reforms proposed in this chapter are to: • maximise compliance cost savings to the widest range of registered persons at the least cost to the tax base; and • ensure that the existing compliance cost savings measures are appropriately targeted. The GST profile 3.4 About 511,000 entities, including individuals, are registered for GST. From these entities over $5,822 million of net GST revenue was raised in the last financial year. 6 A significant portion of this revenue (42.25 percent) is returned from registered persons with an annual turnover exceeding $20 million, although this group represents only 0.33 percent of total registered persons. In contrast, registered persons with an annual turnover under $1 million represent 94.49 percent of total registered persons but return only 26.17 percent of total GST revenue. Table 1 shows the turnover and number of registered persons against the amount and proportion of GST revenue that is collected.

These costs tend to be proportionately higher for taxpayers with a lower turnover. 6 Source: Inland Revenue. All figures are based on IR 101 returns for the period July 1997 to June 1998, excluding GST collected by the New Zealand Customs Service (approximately $2,936 million). Percentages may not add to 100 percent due to rounding. Compliance cost savings measures 21 3.6 Some compliance costs, however, are not directly caused by GST, but are part of general bookkeeping requirements. For example, the time taken to complete a GST return has a direct correlation with the standard to which the accounting records have been maintained. 3.7 Compliance costs are also partially offset by the deferral of the payment of GST collected on behalf of the Government. Minimising compliance costs 3.8 The variety of ways to reduce the compliance costs on smaller entities include: • the threshold under which registration for GST is not required; • their ability to operate a six-monthly return cycle; • their ability to change the last day of a taxable period; • their ability to account for GST on the payments basis; and • the threshold for fully detailed “tax invoices”. 3.9 The remainder of this chapter sets out specific proposals for further reducing compliance costs and tightening the application of the concessions to ensure that they are appropriately targeted. Registration threshold 3.10 Generally, if the supplies made by a person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity exceed $30,000 in any twelve-month period, that person is required to register for GST. 3.11 The point at which any threshold is set is a compromise between the revenue received by the Government and the compliance costs incurred by society in order to generate that revenue. The assessment of whether a particular entity can manage that compliance cost is usually made on the basis of its turnover. 3.12 When GST was introduced the registration threshold was set at $24,000. In 1990 the Government increased the threshold to $30,000, a figure in line with inflation between 1986 and 1990. 3.13 It has been nearly ten years since the threshold was last increased. If the threshold were raised in line with inflation it would be set at around $35,000. The Government proposes to increase the threshold to $40,000. This higher figure has been selected to ensure that the threshold remains current for another five to ten years. This increase will allow 25,000 entities to cease accounting for GST should they so wish. Part II: Working with GST 22 Six-monthly taxable periods 3.14 The six-monthly return period was introduced as a compliance cost savings measure. Currently, registered persons with a turnover of less than $250,000 may account on a six-monthly basis. This means that just over 400,000 entities can account for GST using a six-monthly return. Fewer than half of those eligible (166,000) have taken up this option. 3.15 Registered persons who account for GST on a six-monthly basis, although often having a cash flow advantage, tend to face higher compliance costs. Often the GST revenue they collect on the supply of goods and services is used to meet other expenses, causing difficulties in meeting their GST liability. These registered persons also tend to have poorer standards of bookkeeping. 3.16 More regular filing can have significant benefits in terms of reducing the cash flow impact on registered persons when returning GST, and improving their financial record-keeping. 3.17 Although these are good arguments to shorten the six-monthly taxable period, registered persons under the $250,000 threshold should continue to have the option of six-monthly filing. However, it is not proposed to increase the turnover threshold under which six-monthly filing is allowed. One-month taxable period 3.18 The Government does not propose any change to the one-month period applicable to registered persons with a turnover exceeding $24 million, or those who choose to file on this basis. Alternative taxable periods 3.19 The Government places a high priority on reducing compliance costs for small to medium-sized entities. For this reason the Government invites submissions on whether the standard two-monthly period is appropriate or whether the period should be extended to, say, three months. Last day of taxable period 3.20 Registered persons can select a date seven days either side of the last day of the month before closing off the relevant taxable period (see section 15(7)). 3.21 Some have used this measure to engineer sizeable timing advantages between groups of registered persons who are not necessarily associated. Some purchasers who can influence the behaviour of other entities achieve this timing advantage by extending the last day of their taxable period. Effectively, purchasers are able to anticipate GST refunds without this giving rise to corresponding GST liabilities for the other entities. The larger the transaction the larger the timing advantage becomes. Compliance cost savings measures 23 3.22 In recognition that it is not always possible for some registered persons to harmonise their internal reporting with the last calendar day of their taxable period – because, for example, of industry practice or the expense otherwise involved – section 15(7) will be retained. It is proposed, however, to give the Commissioner the power to reverse any decision made concerning the granting of a change in a registered person’s last day of a taxable period if that registered person cannot provide sound commercial reasons, other than a tax advantage, for maintaining the change. 3.23 If the Commissioner reverses an earlier decision, the registered person must adopt a taxable period that ends on the last day of month in the next taxable period. The payments basis 3.24 Access to the payments basis of accounting for GST is restricted to registered persons with a turnover of less than $1,000,000, local authorities and non- profit bodies. It is also possible for other registered persons to apply to the Commissioner for special consideration. 3.25 Since the introduction of the GST Act, the payments basis threshold has been raised twice. Originally set at $250,000, the threshold was raised to $500,000 with effect from 3 December 1985, the date the GST Act was enacted. The threshold was again raised to $1,000,000, from 1 October 1990, as a result of recommendations from the Taxation Simplification Consultative Committee. 3.26 The present threshold allows up to 480,000 registered persons to account for GST on a payments basis. This represents approximately 94 percent of GST registered persons. 3.27 The continued necessity for a cash basis of accounting needs to be considered in this light and in the context of an increasing use of computer technology to meet internal accounting needs. This means that many entities are substantially more sophisticated than they were ten to twelve years ago. Some aspects of the payments basis have, therefore, been reviewed. The payments basis threshold 3.28 It is proposed to increase the payments basis threshold in line with inflation to $1,300,000. Given the percentage of taxpayers that already have access to the payments basis, however, and the increasing sophistication of accounting systems, the Government will monitor whether future increases to this threshold are warranted. Part II: Working with GST 24 Local authorities 3.29 The unrestricted availability of the payments basis to local authorities was appropriate in the years when local and central government funded their activities by cash appropriation. In 1993 amendments to the Public Finance Act removed the ability of public authorities to be funded by cash appropriation. In 1995 this change was reflected in the GST Act by removing the automatic ability for public authorities to account for GST on a payments basis. 3.30 Similar reform is now occurring within local government. With the enactment of the Local Government Amendment Act (No 3) 1996 local authorities are now required to adopt generally accepted accounting practice. 7 This requires them to adopt an accrual basis for financial reporting purposes. 3.31 To reflect this reform in local government accounting, it is proposed to remove local authorities’ unrestricted ability to account for GST using the payments basis. Non-profit bodies 3.32 Non-profit bodies will still be able to account for GST on a payments basis. This recognises that the majority of non-profit bodies tend to have less sophisticated accounting systems. The Commissioner’s discretion to allow the payments basis 3.33 Registered persons who do not meet the turnover threshold may also be allowed to account for GST on a payments basis under certain circumstances. Section 19A(1)(c) gives the Commissioner the discretion to allow accounting on the payments basis if satisfied that the nature, volume, and value of the taxable supplies made by the registered person, and the person’s accounting system, indicate that it would be appropriate for the person to do so. This discretion will be retained. The tax invoice 3.34 A tax invoice is an invoice that meets the requirements set out in section 24. A tax invoice must be held to verify any input tax credit claim made by a registered person. 7 Refer section 223E(5) of the Local Government Act 1974. Compliance cost savings measures 25 3.35 Section 24(3) requires the following to appear on a tax invoice: 8 (a) The words “tax invoice” in a prominent place: (b) The name and registration number of the supplier: (c) The name and address of the recipient: (d) The date upon which the tax invoice is issued: (e) A description of the goods and services supplied: (f) The quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied: (g) Either - (i)The total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or (ii)Where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of the tax. 3.36 This detail is not always required. If the consideration paid for a supply of goods or services is less than $50 a tax invoice is not needed to claim an input tax credit (section 24(5)). For supplies with a consideration of less than $200 an abbreviated tax invoice may be used to claim an input tax credit (section 24(4)). An abbreviated tax invoice does not require the name and address of the recipient nor the quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied. 3.37 The Government is aware that some registered persons are experiencing difficulties in acquiring the correct documentation from some suppliers. In some cases they are incurring penalties because they make input tax credit claims that do not meet the documentation requirements in section 24. 3.38 Section 24 gives the Commissioner the flexibility to determine that if there are, or will be, sufficient records to establish the particulars of a supply of goods and services, a “tax invoice” may not be required, or some of the statutory requirements under section 24 may not be necessary. 3.39 Because the “tax invoice” is Inland Revenue’s primary method for verifying input tax credit claims, it is not proposed to amend the statutory requirements in section 24. Even so, the detail required in section 24(3) may not be necessary for all transactions above $200. The Government proposes, therefore, that the current $200 threshold under which an abbreviated “tax invoice” may be used be raised to $1,000. 3.40 The proposed new threshold is intended to reduce the compliance cost burden of the requirement to hold detailed tax invoices for small, but regular, items of expenditure. 8 These requirements are modified with respect to “buyer created” invoices, “modified” invoices and second-hand goods (refer sections 24(2), 24(6A) and 24(7)). Part II: Working with GST 26 3.41 It is not proposed to adjust the current $50 threshold under which a tax invoice is not required. Although the amount of revenue involved in a transaction of less than $50 is small, the large volume of these transactions means that the revenue risk of any increase to this threshold is significant. Although taxpayers must substantiate all claims, the benefits derived from increasing this threshold would not outweigh the Government’s exposure to incorrect input tax credit claims. Specific issues for consultation • Whether (and, if so, how) the two-monthly period should be extended. Would a three-monthly period be appropriate? • Compliance difficulties faced by taxpayers in relation to the current tax invoice requirements. 27 CHAPTER FOUR CHANGE IN USE ADJUSTMENTS – COMPLIANCE ISSUES Proposed policy • Legislate the current methods of allocation (direct attribution, turnover, or special method) for establishing the proportion of taxable and non-taxable use in the GST Act. • Allow registered persons, at their option, to make output tax adjustments on a one-off basis. The one-off adjustment would be made: -for goods and services that replace goods and services with an existing pattern of use, at the time of acquisition on the basis of the use of the replacement goods and services over the past 12 months; and -for other goods and services with no pattern of use, provisionally at the time of acquisition and recalculated after 12 months’ use. • In relation to one-off output tax adjustments, include a requirement to make further adjustments at the time a significant change in use occurs, which may be either: -a change in principal purpose; or -a change in use of, say, 20 percent or more. • Generally require that deemed supplies on a change of use be valued at market value. • Allow registered persons, at their option, to make adjustments annually rather than for each taxable period or on a one-off basis. • Increase the $10,000 threshold for one-off input tax adjustments for changes from non-taxable to taxable use to $18,000. • Increase the minimum threshold for exempt supplies (over which adjustments must be made) from $48,000 to $90,000. 4.1 A registered person can claim input tax credits for goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. In some cases goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are used partly or entirely for another purpose (either at the time they are acquired or some later time) such as for a private or exempt purpose. Conversely, goods and services acquired principally for a non-taxable purpose may be used in making taxable supplies. Part II: Working with GST 28 4.2 The GST Act deems the non-taxable use of goods and services acquired by a registered person principally for a taxable purpose to be a taxable supply by the registered person, and output tax is charged accordingly. 4.3 If goods and services are acquired principally for a non-taxable purpose a registered person is not entitled to an input tax credit. If those goods and services are used for a taxable purpose, however, the GST Act allows an input tax credit to reflect that taxable use. Objective of change in use adjustments 4.4 The principal objective is to ensure that input tax credits reflect the extent of the taxable use of goods and services. This is achieved by making adjustments to output tax or input tax if the original intended use of the goods and services changes or if the goods and services are acquired for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. 4.5 The requirement to make output tax adjustments ensures that tax is borne by the final consumer when there is private or exempt use of goods or services. For example, the private use of goods or services acquired by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies represents a supply of goods or services to the registered person in his or her private capacity and, as such, should be subject to GST. 4.6 Although these principles are generally well understood, the legislation does not clearly specify how the calculations are to be made, which creates high compliance costs. This chapter proposes a number of changes to reduce these costs. The apportionment approach 4.7 The current GST treatment of goods or services applied for dual purposes is to allow or deny an input tax credit depending on the principal purpose for which goods or services are acquired, and deem any application to the non- principal purpose to be a supply (the adjustment approach). An alternative approach (the apportionment approach) would be to provide that any non- taxable use is reflected in an apportionment of the initial input tax credit at the time of supply on the basis of the intended continuing use of the goods or services for each activity. Change in use adjustments – compliance issues 29 Other jurisdictions 4.8 The Canadian GST regime adopts an apportionment approach. Input tax credits are apportioned on the basis of intended use. Changes in use are taken into account only for capital property, with a distinction made between real and personal property. • Capital real property: An input tax credit is allowed to the extent that the real property is applied for a taxable purpose. Any significant change (more than 10 percent) triggers a deemed supply. • Capital personal property: A full input tax credit is allowed if the property is acquired primarily (more than 50 percent) for a taxable purpose. Changes in use are taken into account only if there is a change in the primary purpose. 4.9 The United Kingdom’s VAT legislation also provides that if goods and services are used partly for a taxable purpose and partly for a non-taxable purpose, input tax credits are apportioned. If a registered person's intentions regarding the use of goods or services change within six years of the original acquisition, an adjustment is made. The New Zealand position 4.10 The adjustment approach used in New Zealand is difficult to apply in some circumstances and has resulted in considerable litigation. The apportionment approach may appear to be a simpler and more accurate approach to the calculation of input tax, but it has considerable complexities. First, it assumes that intended continuing use can be predicted. Second, the treatment on disposal may be complex as it is unclear whether apportionment should be calculated on the respective amounts of taxable and non-taxable use on acquisition, on disposal, or in the intervening period. Canada and the United Kingdom have incorporated detailed rules to make these calculations. 4.11 In addition, by not deeming a supply to occur when goods and services are used for non-taxable purposes, apportionment rules do not reflect the principle that GST is borne by the final consumer. The Government considers that this key principle should be retained but the compliance costs imposed by the current requirements need to be reduced. The remainder of this chapter discusses the current adjustment rules and the proposals for dealing with this and related issues. Current adjustment rules 4.12 The existing legislation is sufficiently broad to permit two methods of adjustment: • calculating the estimated non-taxable or taxable use and making a one- off adjustment; or Part II: Working with GST 30 • making adjustments in every taxable period in which goods and services acquired principally for making taxable supplies are used in making non-taxable supplies or vice versa. Example A motor vehicle purchased for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is subsequently used (say, 49 percent) for private purposes. The cost of the vehicle was $20,000. The adjustments required for the deemed supplies under each of the interpretations above would be: (i)20,000 x 49% = $1088.89 as a one-off adjustment 9 (ii)20,000 x 18% x 49% = 294/9 = $32.67 per two-monthly taxable period 6 Note: 18 percent is the income tax straight-line depreciation rate for the motor vehicle. 4.13 Inland Revenue's policy 9 is that, for goods and services used partly for taxable and partly for non-taxable purposes, a deemed supply occurs in each taxable period in which the goods and services are used for non-taxable purposes. 4.14 However, various Taxation Review Authority cases have held that the adjustment required under the GST Act is a one-off adjustment calculated on the basis of the original input tax credit. 10 4.15 Inland Revenue's requirement to make period-by-period adjustments is based on the underlying policy intent and the assumption that the words “to the extent” in the relevant provisions, section 21(1) and section 21(5), refer to application over time. 4.16 Under section 10(8) the value of the deemed supply is calculated as the lesser of cost or open market value. In relation to period-by-period adjustments, the supply of the goods or services is being valued, not the goods or services themselves. Therefore the “cost” is not the original cost to the registered person, but the cost of supplying the goods and services. To approximate this value a income tax straight-line depreciation rate is used. The open market value is the cost of hiring an asset, not the cost of acquiring it. 4.17 If there is a total and permanent change in use of goods and services a one- off adjustment based on the purchase price or production cost may be made. A one-off adjustment may also be made for goods that cost $10,000 or less. 9 As set out in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 6, No. 11, April 1995. 10 For example, Case N39 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,333. Change in use adjustments – compliance issues 31 4.18 Adjustment percentages may alter. Unless goods or services are used 100 percent for another purpose, continuing adjustments reflecting the change in use are required. For example, a registered person purchases a fax machine. On acquisition, the business use is 80 percent and private use is 20 percent. A full input tax credit is claimed and adjustments are made for the 20 percent private use. After the fax machine has been owned for a year, it is used 40 percent for business and 60 percent for private use. The registered person must make private use adjustments for the 60 percent of private use. Allocation between taxable and non-taxable supplies 4.19 To calculate change in use adjustments it is necessary to establish the proportion of the use of goods and services in relation to taxable and non- taxable supplies. Inland Revenue’s policy 11 is that there are three possible methods of allocation: • direct attribution; • the turnover method; and • a special method. Direct attribution 4.20 Direct attribution involves allocating the cost of goods and services to taxable and non-taxable supplies on the basis of actual use. Apportionment percentages established for income tax purposes would generally be acceptable for GST purposes. Turnover method 4.21 If the cost of goods and services cannot be directly attributed, the proportion of taxable and non-taxable use can be calculated on a turnover basis. 4.22 This method applies only for exempt use. The formula for the turnover method is: Total value of exempt supplies for taxable period=percentage of supplies Total value of all supplies for taxable period which are exempt Special method 4.23 If the direct attribution or turnover methods are not suitable, a registered person may agree with Inland Revenue to use another method of allocation. 11 GST Guide – A guide to working with GST, GST 600, December 1997, pages 51-66. Part II: Working with GST 32 Legislating the methods of allocation 4.24 At present, the rules on methods of allocation are administrative guidelines only. To provide more certainty, the methods could be set out in legislation. 4.25 The Government welcomes comments on this proposal and on any difficulties in using the prescribed methods or gaining approval to use a special method. One-off adjustments 4.26 Requiring registered persons to make adjustments in every taxable period creates compliance costs. In some cases the GST payable can be disproportionately low compared to the compliance costs involved in calculating the adjustments. Change from taxable to non-taxable use 4.27 The Government proposes to allow registered persons to elect to make one- off output tax adjustments for all goods and services applied to a non-taxable use. The $10,000 threshold in section 21(1) under which one-off adjustments can currently be made would be removed. 4.28 The one-off adjustment would be made: • for goods and services that replace goods and services with an existing pattern of use, at the time of acquisition on the basis of the use of the replacement goods and services over the past 12 months; and • for other goods and services with no pattern of use, provisionally at the time of acquisition and, to increase the accuracy of the adjustment, recalculated after 12 months’ use. 4.29 In relation to those goods and services for which period-by-period adjustments are currently made, transitional legislation would be required to ensure that the one-off calculation takes into account any previous adjustments that have been made. 4.30 Registered persons may prefer to continue to make period-by-period adjustments rather than making a one-off adjustment. Therefore it is proposed that the one-off output tax adjustment be optional. 4.31 A difficulty with one-off adjustments is that they anticipate that goods or services will be used for exactly their expected life span. That is, the private use is clawed back on the whole GST cost on acquisition, as opposed to only one-ninth of the annual depreciation. Change in use adjustments – compliance issues 33 Example A delivery van costs $22,500 and is used 40 percent for a non-taxable purpose. A one-off adjustment is made ($2,500 x 40 percent = $1,000) regardless of whether the registered person holds the van for one year or for ten years. Change from non-taxable to taxable use 4.32 There is less evidence of compliance cost concerns in relation to input tax adjustments allowed under section 21(5). In any event, one-off input tax adjustments could create a significant avoidance opportunity. Therefore the period-by-period adjustments should continue to apply, but the current $10,000 threshold under which one-off input tax adjustments can be made will be increased in line with inflation to $18,000. Subsequent changes in use 4.33 Another difficulty with one-off adjustments is that goods and services may last for many years, during which time the proportion of their taxable and non-taxable use may vary significantly. Therefore a mechanism is needed to cater for any changes in use after the acquisition of goods and services. If the taxable use increases, an input tax credit would be allowed to reflect the extent of the change. If the taxable use decreases, output tax would correspondingly be payable. 4.34 It is proposed that an adjustment be required at the time a significant change in use occurs, which may be either: • a change in principal purpose; or • a change in use of, say, 20 percent or more. 4.35 Both options give rise to compliance and administrative costs, but these should be in most cases less than existing costs. The Government welcomes comment on which of the options for change in use adjustments is preferred. Example: adjustment for change in use of 20 percent or more A registered person purchases a computer system for $45,000. The computer system is to be used 80 percent for making taxable supplies and 20 percent for private use. In the first taxable period the full input tax credit is $5,000 and the registered person makes a one-off adjustment of 20 percent x 5,000 = $1,000, reducing the input tax credit to $4,000. In the next taxable period, the computer system is used 60 percent for making taxable supplies and 40 percent for private use. The registered person must pay output tax of 20 percent (the change in application) x $5,000 (the original input tax credit claimed) = $1,000. Part II: Working with GST 34 Change in use adjustments by property developers 4.36 If a building acquired by a property developer is let for residential purposes before its sale the principal purpose of acquiring the building has not changed because the building is still held for the purposes of resale, although it is also used for an exempt purpose. Because the initial input tax credit must be adjusted to recognise the change in use, the practice is to require an adjustment to be made in each taxable period that the property is let. 12 No change to this practice is proposed. Annual adjustments 4.37 To reduce compliance costs further, the Government also proposes to allow registered persons to elect to make adjustments annually to coincide with the time an income tax return is due. 4.38 Annual adjustments would reduce the compliance costs incurred by registered persons with both GST and income tax filing obligations, although not all registered persons (such as some non-profit bodies) file income tax returns. 4.39 The Government welcomes comments on the compliance cost savings of allowing annual adjustments in substitution for period-by-period or one-off adjustments. Value of deemed supplies 4.40 The valuation rules used throughout the Act should be as consistent as possible. Chapter eight (Deregistration) proposes that market value be adopted for deemed supplies on deregistration so that such supplies are comparable to those made on an arm’s length basis. 4.41 As the change in use adjustment approach is intended to reflect the value of the “supply” by registered persons to themselves, it is proposed that the deemed supply be treated as made at market value, other than in the situation discussed in paragraph 4.44. This is a change from the current option of valuing at the lesser of cost or open market value. 4.42 The Government invites submissions on this issue, particularly on any compliance cost concerns in relation to assets where the cost option may be more commonly used. 12 See “GST – section 21 and property developers who rent out property for residential purposes” Tax Information Bulletin Volume Five, No. 8, January 1994. Change in use adjustments – compliance issues 35 4.43 Any one-off adjustment made at the time goods and services are acquired on the basis of market value would be the same as if cost were used. (This assumes that the cost of the asset reflected its market value on acquisition.) 4.44 In relation to change in use adjustments subsequent to a one-off adjustment, however, it is proposed that the recorded cost of the goods and services be used to value the deemed supply. This means that the initial input tax credit would be adjusted to reflect the new proportions of taxable and non-taxable use. Treatment on disposal 4.45 The treatment of supplies of goods and services used in a taxable activity should be the same regardless of whether or not adjustments have been made during the period of ownership. The only exception should be when there has been a change to the principal purpose for which the goods or services were originally acquired. Therefore full output tax should be charged on taxable supplies in all cases. Consistently with GST being a tax on final consumption, it is likely in any event that any level of non-taxable use would result in a supply of a lesser value (and thus a lower GST impost) than if the goods had been used entirely for taxable purposes. The threshold for exempt supplies 4.46 A registered person is not required to make an adjustment for goods and services used for an exempt purpose if the value of exempt supplies does not exceed specified thresholds. 4.47 Under section 21(1) an adjustment is not required if, over a 12-month period, the value of exempt supplies does not exceed the lesser of: • $48,000; and • 5 percent of the total taxable and exempt supplies. 4.48 The threshold has not been amended since GST came into force. The Government proposes to increase the level to $90,000 to reflect the inflationary effects since 1986. Part II: Working with GST 36 Specific issues for consultation • Any difficulties in using the prescribed methods or gaining approval to use a special method. • The proposal to allow one-off adjustments, and in particular if a one-off adjustment is made whether subsequent changes should be made to reflect: - a change in principal purpose, or - a change in use of, say, 20 percent or more. • The compliance cost savings of the proposal to allow registered persons, at their option, to make adjustments annually rather than for each taxable period or on a one-off basis. • Any compliance concerns with the proposed requirement that deemed supplies on a change of use generally be valued at market value. 37 CHAPTER FIVE CHANGE IN USE ADJUSTMENTS – OTHER ISSUES Proposed policy • Limit the input tax credit allowed for changes from non-taxable to taxable use to supplies of goods and services on which GST has been charged and to supplies of second-hand goods. • Ensure that output tax adjustments for any non-taxable use apply to goods and services acquired or produced as well as applied for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. • Determine adjustments for dual purpose goods and services by reference to their use rather than their application. • Ensure that an adjustment is triggered by any change of use (not just a subsequent change of use). • Ensure that fringe benefits provided to past employees (including associated persons) are subject to GST. 5.1 This chapter discusses a number of issues in relation to section 21 of the GST Act to clarify the scope and calculation of change in use adjustments. Input tax credit for changes in use 5.2 Section 21(5) allows an input tax credit for goods and services not acquired principally for taxable purposes that are also used for taxable purposes. The provision appears to operate more broadly than intended to allow an input tax credit if goods and services are used for making taxable supplies irrespective of whether GST has previously been imposed (either by way of output tax or a general price uplift) in relation to the goods and services. 5.3 The input tax credit is restricted to goods and services acquired or produced after 1 October 1986. This assumes that the introduction of GST resulted in a cost to the registered person. Therefore it is proposed that the credit allowed under section 21(5) be limited to goods and services for which an input tax credit was not allowed for the sole reason that they were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Following this approach, the input tax credit under section 21(5) would be restricted to acquisitions of goods and services on which GST has been charged and supplies of second-hand goods. Part II: Working with GST 38 “Goods and services applied” 5.4 Section 21(1) refers to goods and services applied by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies which are subsequently applied for another purpose. 5.5 In 1987 the word “applied” was substituted for the phrase “acquired or produced”. Section 21(1) previously required an adjustment to be made for the non-taxable application of goods and services acquired or produced by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Because it was not possible to register for GST until 3 December 1985, goods or services purchased before that date were not subject to the adjustment. 5.6 Further, as taxable supplies are those subject to GST, it was also possible that goods and services purchased before 1 October 1986 and after 3 December 1985 did not fall within the scope of the provision. 5.7 The 1987 amendment severed the link with the definition of “input tax”, which requires goods and services to be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Goods and services may be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and never actually be applied for that purpose. For example, a property developer may acquire residential property for development purposes but let the property without ever actually applying it in the development activity. 5.8 Section 21(1) would be clearer if it referred to goods and services “applied, acquired or produced by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies”. “Applied” or “used” 5.9 Section 21(1) refers to goods and services applied for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies which are subsequently applied for another purpose. Similarly, section 21(5) refers to goods and services for which no input tax deduction is claimed which are subsequently applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 5.10 The purpose to which goods and services have been “applied” is difficult to measure. For example, a property developer who buys a residential property for resale might let the property in the interim. The property could be regarded as wholly applied to the letting activity as well as wholly applied to the development activity. 5.11 The word “used”, on the other hand, could lead to a more objective assessment of the purpose to which particular goods or services are put. It is proposed, therefore, that the word “used” be substituted for the word “applied” in the second and third places it is used in section 21(1), with corresponding changes to section 21(2) and section 21(5). Change in use adjustments – other issues 39 Subsequent application 5.12 Under section 21(1) a deemed supply occurs when goods and services applied for a taxable purpose are subsequently applied for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. 5.13 If interpreted literally the use of the word “subsequently” could mean that input credits in relation to services or goods wholly consumed in the taxable period they were acquired would never require adjustment under section 21(1). A corresponding issue arises under section 21(5). 5.14 These provisions should be clarified by removing the word “subsequently”. This would better reflect the requirement for an adjustment to account for any application of goods and services for a purpose other than the principal purpose. Employee benefits 5.15 Output tax must be paid when goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are provided as fringe benefits to employees. 5.16 Some benefits are subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT) but not GST. This arises because section 21(3) deems a supply to occur when a registered person provides a fringe benefit to any other person and “that other person is employed under a contract of service by that registered person”. 5.17 An FBT liability arises for fringe benefits provided by an employer to “a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received ...a source deduction payment”. Because of the limitation in section 21(3) to contracts of service, fringe benefits provided to past employees or their associates are not subject to GST. 5.18 It is proposed that the reference to persons employed under contracts of service be removed from section 21(3) to better align the deemed supply rules with the FBT rules. Other issues 5.19 Table 2 lists minor clarifications and corrections needed in section 21. Part II: Working with GST 40 TABLE 2: MINOR CLARIFICATIONS AND CORRECTIONS IssueProposed solution Section 21 could give rise to an unintended output tax liability for services provided by employees. For example, employee services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies for which no input tax credit is available. Some employee services are then used in relation to exempt supplies. The anomaly will be corrected by specifying that sections 21(1) and 21(5) do not apply to services provided by employees. Section 21(1) can be activated to the detriment of a registered person by a legislative amendment that makes a supply exempt (for example, service occupancy agreements are exempt from 19 December 1989) and therefore triggers a section 21 adjustment. Section 21(1) will be amended to provide that it does not apply if the deemed supply has arisen because of a change in the legislation. It is not clear whether the thresholds in section 21 are GST inclusive or exclusive. The thresholds in section 21 will be amended to clarify that they are GST inclusive. There is inconsistency in relation to section 21(3B) (adjustments for non-deductible entertainment expenditure) and the time of supply depending on whether income tax returns are filed early or on time. To minimise compliance costs, the time of supply should be the same time as when the income tax return is due. Section 21(3B) will be amended to provide that the time of supply is the earlier of the time the income tax return is due or is furnished. Section 21(5) applies if no deduction has been made for goods and services acquired or produced after 1 October 1986. The subsection will apply to goods and services acquired or produced on or after 1 October 1986, the date on which the GST Act took effect. There is a drafting error in section 21(6) (the re-application of goods and services to a taxable activity). Section 21(6) refers to “goods and services deemed to be supplied to a person under section 5(3)”. It should refer to “goods and services deemed to be supplied by a person under section 5(3)” and will be amended accordingly. Part III Maintaining the Revenue Base 43 CHAPTER SIX THE GENERAL ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISION – SECTION 76 Proposed policy • Change from a subjective test of intention to the more objective test of the effect of an arrangement. • Change the test of defeating the intent and application of the GST Act to that of defeating the “intended application” of the Act. • Include a purpose provision in the Act to assist in clarifying the intended application of the Act. • Clarify that the Commissioner’s specific reconstructive powers in section 76(2) do not limit the general reconstructive power in section 76(1). 6.1 Tax avoidance opportunities under the GST Act are created by boundaries including those between taxable and non-taxable transactions and between registered and non-registered persons. 6.2 Ideally, to remove tax avoidance opportunities these boundaries would be removed. This is not possible, however, for compliance cost and administrative reasons, so anti-avoidance provisions are necessary. Policy intent 6.3 Specific anti-avoidance provisions should be the principal means of countering GST avoidance. Because taxpayers can use various measures, including the valuation rules, to structure transactions in ways that will give them tax advantages, specific anti-avoidance provisions are necessary. An example of such a provision is section 10(3), which deems supplies between associated persons to be made at market value. 6.4 An argument raised against some specific anti-avoidance provisions is that their application can extend to more than avoidance arrangements. Their advantage, however, is that they rely on objective criteria rather than a subjective view of the arrangement, so they tend to be more certain in their application. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 44 6.5 The general anti-avoidance provision, section 76, was intended to be a “back stop” provision used to fill the gaps that specific anti-avoidance provisions did not cover. It was intended to counteract any abuse of the types of tax advantages inherent in GST, but it does not fully achieve these objectives. This chapter, therefore, proposes a number of changes to make the provision more effective. The section 6.6 Section 76 gives the Commissioner the power to disregard, for GST purposes, any “...arrangement \[that\] has been entered into between persons to defeat the intent and application of this Act, or of any provision of this Act...” Problems with the avoidance test 6.7 Several problems with section 76 preclude its application in all but the most obvious cases of avoidance. These problems result from both the wording of the section and from the nature of GST and transaction taxes in general. “Entered into to defeat” 6.8 Section 76 uses a subjective test of the person’s intention in entering into an arrangement, stating that avoidance occurs if the arrangement is “...entered into ... to defeat the intent and application of the Act...” 6.9 Section 76 is worded in such a way that the Commissioner must demonstrate that it was the person’s subjective intention to defeat the intent and application of the Act. 6.10 In addition, looking at the interpretation of other subjective intention tests in taxation law, notably section CD 4 (Personal Property) of the Income Tax Act, 13 it is arguable that the intention to defeat the Act must be the dominant intention of the person. Section 76, by providing that the person must enter an arrangement “to defeat” the Act, assumes that tax avoidance was the dominant intention. 6.11 This subjective test of dominant intention means that it is difficult to show that an arrangement is an avoidance arrangement. Arrangements that can be shown to be motivated by commercial or family reasons, even if the tax advantage to be gained was a significant but perhaps not dominant factor, may not fall within the scope of section 76. 13 As interpreted by the Court of Appeal in CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346. The general anti-avoidance provision – section 76 45 “Intent and application” 6.12 Section 76 does not attack a prohibited effect, but a prohibited intention – the intention of defeating the intent and application of the Act. Once this intention has been established, any tax advantage flowing from it can be counteracted, but a tax advantage without this intention is not void. 6.13 An arrangement can be voided only if it defeats the “intent and application” of the Act. The phrase is not defined, nor does the Act have a purpose provision, so the meaning of “intent and application” must be inferred from the scheme of the Act itself. 6.14 This is a problem because in many circumstances the general scheme of the Act is clouded by exceptions and boundaries which create uncertainty as to the true “intent and application” of the Act. “Defeat the intent and application” 6.15 For section 76 to apply, the transaction must be entered into to defeat both the intent and the application of the Act. This causes particular problems in the context of GST, since the vast majority of transactions that could be called tax avoidance rely not on defeating the Act, but are intentionally structured so that the provisions of the Act apply to give a favourable GST treatment. Proposed reform Objective test 6.16 It is proposed to change the wording of section 76(1) so that any arrangement that has the effect (or an effect) of avoiding tax is covered by the section. This will lower the currently high evidentiary barriers to the application of the section. Intended application 6.17 The use of the phrase “defeat the intent and application” in the section as it is currently worded means that many arrangements that could reasonably be adjudged to be tax avoidance are not, since they do not defeat the Act’s application. 6.18 Changing the test from defeating the intent and application of the Act to defeating the “intended application” of the Act will go some way to ensuring that adherence to the letter of the law will not by itself save an avoidance arrangement from being voided. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 46 A purpose provision 6.19 The phrases “intent and application” and “intended application” highlight a possible need in the Act for a purpose provision to assist in clarifying the intended application of the Act. A purpose provision would assist in the interpretation of the Act in situations such as those described by McKay J in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Alcan New Zealand Ltd, when interpreting an Act where the words of the Act are: “...capable of more than one meaning and the object of the legislation is clear, the words must be given “such fair, large and liberal construction” as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act ... One should always have regard to the total context of the words used and to the purpose of the legislation in order to arrive at the meaning intended. This does not mean some forced meaning to fit a preconceived idea of purpose ... The true meaning must be consonant with the words used, having regard to their context in the Act as a whole, and to the purpose of the legislation to the extent that this is discernible.” 14 6.20 Any purpose provision would be based on the fundamental principle underlying GST – that it intends to tax, in a non-distortionary manner, consumption in New Zealand through the amount of value added by registered persons. Beyond this broad principle, however, the purpose of the Act and how it is represented in the scheme of the Act becomes less clear. Where boundaries and exemptions occur in the Act the relationship between them and the fundamental principle of GST must be clarified. 6.21 The Government invites submissions on what a purpose provision in the GST Act should contain. Applicability of case law dealing with sections BG 1 and GB 1 (section 99) 6.22 There are conceptual differences between GST and income tax, and differences in the avoidance tests in the GST Act and the Income Tax Act (which will continue to exist in the reworded section 76). For example, as the Court of Appeal stated in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Refining Co Ltd: “It is fundamental to the GST Act that the tax is levied on or in respect of supplies. It is not a tax on receipts or on turnover; it is a tax on transactions...” 15 6.23 However, the broad principles underlying general anti-avoidance provisions – for example the meaning of “effect” and how an effect is established – are applicable both to GST and income tax. 14 (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175 at 11,178 – 11,179. 15 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 at 13,193. The general anti-avoidance provision – section 76 47 6.24 Therefore taxpayers and Inland Revenue should receive guidance, and gain some certainty, concerning the application of section 76 from case law dealing with sections BG 1 and GB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976). The Commissioner’s reconstructive powers Policy intent 6.25 Section 76(1) gives the Commissioner the power to adjust the amount of GST payable by, or refundable to, any registered person affected by an arrangement voided by section 76, in such manner as the Commissioner considers appropriate to counteract any tax advantage obtained. This power can be exercised even if the registered person was not a party to the avoidance arrangement. 6.26 In addition to this general power to adjust GST liabilities, the Commissioner has four specific powers under section 76(2) to deem: • anyone who has participated in any arrangement in any way to be a registered person; • any supply of goods and services affected by, or part of, any arrangement to have been both supplied by any registered person and supplied to any registered person – whether or not the supply was a taxable supply; • any goods and services to be supplied in the taxable period in which they would have been supplied but for any avoidance arrangement; and • any supply of goods and services to have been made at, or the consideration for the supply to be given at, open market value. 6.27 The exact scope of these powers, and their effectiveness in counteracting tax advantages, is somewhat uncertain. 6.28 The policy intention behind the Commissioner’s powers is, however, clear – any tax advantage flowing to any person, whether or not that person is a party to an avoidance arrangement, is to be counteracted. Issue 6.29 The hierarchy of the Commissioner’s powers under the current formulation of reconstructive powers is blurred. The relationship between the broad power to counteract tax advantages in subsection (1) and the specific powers in subsection (2) is not clearly set out. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 48 6.30 The fundamental principle to be applied to reconstructions is that any tax advantage to any person is to be counteracted. To this end subsection (1) provides the Commissioner with a general counteracting power, and subsection (2) contains specific examples of the Commissioner’s powers within this general power. Proposed reform 6.31 It is proposed to amend subsection (2) of section 76 to clarify that the powers contained in it do not in any way limit the Commissioner’s broad power of reconstruction under subsection (1). Specific issue for consultation • What should a purpose provision in the GST Act contain? 49 CHAPTER SEVEN THE SECOND-HAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDIT Proposed policy • Limit the notional credit in relation to supplies of second-hand goods made to an associated person to the lesser of: -the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; or -one-ninth of the purchase price; or -one-ninth of the open market value. • If second-hand goods have been acquired from an associated person previously registered for GST (and who has paid output tax on deregistration), the amount of the notional credit allowed should be, as under the current law, one-ninth of the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value. A proposal to require output tax on deregistration to be paid by reference to market value is discussed in the next chapter. 7.1 If a registered person acquires second-hand goods from a non-registered person a notional input tax credit is allowed for the amount of the tax fraction (one-ninth) of the consideration paid. 7.2 The notional input tax credit has been used by some registered persons to claim large GST refunds in various circumstances, including for goods on which GST has not previously been paid. In some cases it appears that second-hand goods are sold to an associated person primarily to claim a second-hand goods input tax credit. This chapter discusses proposals for reform in relation to supplies of second-hand goods. Policy intent Allowing a notional credit 7.3 The 1985 White Paper proposed a modification to the general definition of “input tax” to ensure comparability between the treatment of new and used goods. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 50 7.4 If a registered person acquires new or second-hand goods from a GST registered person the GST component is shown on the tax invoice 16 and can be claimed as an input tax credit. 7.5 If a registered person purchases second-hand goods from a non-registered person the supply is not subject to GST. The registered person may claim one-ninth of the purchase price as a notional input tax credit, however, provided sufficient records of the supply are kept. 17 7.6 Allowing a credit avoids the double taxation that would arise on the resale of goods already subject to GST when acquired by the non-registered supplier. In other words, the credit limits the GST paid by the final consumer to the amount of value added by registered persons. The meaning of second-hand goods 7.7 The second-hand goods credit was intended to apply to goods commonly regarded as second-hand, such as used motor vehicles, household furniture and appliances. 7.8 The original definition of “second-hand goods”, repealed in 1988, read: “In relation to any goods acquired by any registered person, means goods that have previously been used, or acquired for use, or held for use, by any other person.” 7.9 Exclusions for fine metal and livestock were added in 1986 and 1989 respectively to provide certainty and remove avoidance opportunities. 7.10 Several court cases have involved second-hand goods credits for land. In some of these cases the courts have held that the credit for second-hand goods is allowed but without specifically deciding that land is second-hand goods. Some doubts have been cast on whether land is really “second- hand”. 18 7.11 The Court of Appeal in LR McLean 19 noted that there is nothing in the purpose or scheme of the Act that would justify ignoring the ordinary meaning of the words “second-hand goods”. 16 Alternatively, the GST component can be calculated from the “GST inclusive” amount. 17 Section 24(7) specifies the type of information that must be provided (including a description of the goods, the date of the supply, and the name and address of the supplier). 18 Bathgate DJ in Case L108 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,608: “ ‘Second-hand’ is not a word used to describe the character of land that has been previously farmed or used in some way or other by predecessors in title or occupation.” 19 LR McLean and Co Ltd and Ors v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. The second-hand goods input tax credit 51 7.12 The ordinary meaning of “second-hand” was described by Barber DJ as: “...used or treated or stored by a previous owner in such a manner that it can no longer be regarded as new.” 20 7.13 The Concise Oxford Dictionary (9th ed.) definition of “second-hand” in relation to goods is “having had a previous owner; not new”. 7.14 “New” is defined as “made, discovered, acquired, or experienced recently or now for the first time, in original condition; not worn or used”. 7.15 Although title to land is capable of prior ownership, it is not “used” in the sense of ordinary consumption having occurred. Options for change 7.16 Three broad approaches to countering avoidance opportunities in relation to credits for second-hand goods are discussed in this chapter: • a review of the treatment of land specifically; • the replacement of the current notional credit scheme with a margin scheme; and • limiting the amount of the notional credit allowed in certain circumstances. Options for the treatment of land Exclude land from the definition of second-hand goods 7.17 As discussed earlier, it was intended that the second-hand goods credit would apply only to sales of goods commonly considered to be second-hand. 7.18 Therefore one option is to exclude land from the definition of second-hand goods. This would preclude registered persons from claiming a second-hand goods input tax credit for non-taxable supplies of land. However, they would still be required to charge output tax on any subsequent sale of that land, so denying the input tax credit could result in double taxation. 20 Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 at 3,147. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 52 Example (excluding land from the definition of second-hand goods) In 1990 A (a non-registered person) buys farm land for $200,000. Output tax is paid but no input tax credit is allowed. In 1995 A sells the land to B (a registered person) for $300,000. No output tax is charged because A is not a registered person, and because land is excluded as a second-hand good, no input tax credit is allowed to B. In 1999 B sells the land to C (a non-registered person) for $360,000. Output tax is charged because B is a registered person, but no input tax credit is allowed. Result: Both A and C pay GST in relation to the land. There is no offsetting input tax credit. Exempt land from GST 7.19 The original proposed treatment for the sale of land was set out in the White Paper: “In recognition that land is not “consumed” in the normal sense, transactions involving the supply of land, excluding buildings, will not be subject to GST.” 21 7.20 The Advisory Panel on GST accepted the conceptual logic of not subjecting the sale of unimproved land to GST but identified some “very considerable practical difficulties”. 7.21 These difficulties primarily concerned the need for apportionment rules to differentiate between land and improvements. Submissions made at the time GST was introduced suggested that to obviate the need for such rules land should be subject to GST. Those submissions were accepted by the Government of the day. 7.22 In the Coveney case 22 the Court of Appeal ruled that the consideration for the supply of land used in a taxable activity and a dwelling and its curtilage on that land 23 could not be apportioned. Because the land in that case was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies a full input tax credit was allowed. 7.23 Legislation overturning this decision was enacted in 1995. Apportionment between land and a dwelling and its curtilage is now a feature of the GST Act. Therefore the original reasons for not introducing an exemption for land no longer apply to the same extent. 21 White Paper on Goods & Services Tax: Proposals for the Administration of the Goods and Services Tax March 1985, at page 36. 22 CIR v NW Coveney; CIR v JF Dooley; CIR v NP Swain & Anor (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193. 23 The land on which the dwelling stands and the surrounding land used for domestic purposes. The second-hand goods input tax credit 53 7.24 Treating land sales as exempt supplies, however, is inconsistent with the Government’s objective of a broad-based tax with minimal exemptions. A margin scheme for supplies of second-hand goods 7.25 Suppliers of goods in a second-hand market largely act as intermediaries between purchasers and sellers acting in a private capacity. The United Kingdom’s VAT system includes a margin scheme that recognises this and ensures that double taxation is not in effect imposed on goods that have previously borne VAT when sold as new. 7.26 Under the United Kingdom’s margin scheme a registered person may opt to charge VAT on eligible goods based on the profit margin instead of the value of the supply. If an item is sold for less than the purchase price no VAT is charged. If the scheme is not used no input tax deduction is available, and VAT must be charged on the full sale price. 7.27 Eligible goods are: • works of art, antiques or collectors’ items (for example, postage stamps, collectors’ pieces of historical interest); • motor vehicles; and • second-hand goods (tangible moveable property other than precious metals or precious stones that is suitable for further use). 7.28 Generally, land is not subject to VAT in the United Kingdom. 7.29 A “global accounting scheme” applies because of the low-value, large- volume goods some suppliers handle and the impracticality of keeping detailed records of purchases and sales. Under the global accounting scheme, VAT is calculated on the difference between the total purchases and sales of eligible goods in each VAT period rather than on an item-by-item basis. 7.30 A margin scheme has a number of practical difficulties, such as the documentation required to trace the supply of eligible goods. These would impose high compliance costs. Although a margin scheme is not the preferred option, the Government welcomes comment on whether the current second-hand goods credit should be replaced with a margin scheme similar to that operating for VAT purposes in the United Kingdom. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 54 Limit the credit in relation to supplies between associated persons (the preferred option) 7.31 An input tax credit is triggered by the sale of second-hand goods from a non- registered to a registered person. It is common for such sales to be made to associated persons in circumstances where the effective ownership or control does not change. 24 7.32 The definition of input tax provides that if the supplier and purchaser are associated persons the consideration for the supply is deemed to be the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value of the supply. This counters any over-inflation of the price in order to increase the value of the credit. If the purchase price exceeds the open market value, a credit of one-ninth of the open market value of the supply is allowed. 7.33 The Government’s preferred option is to limit the amount of the credit allowed in these circumstances to the lesser of: • the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; or • one-ninth of the purchase price; or • one-ninth of the open market value. 7.34 Accordingly, if the open market value of the supply is less than the original cost (assuming GST was charged on the original supply) the amount of the credit would remain the same as that allowed under the current legislation. In comparison, if the open market value exceeded the original cost the credit would be less than that currently allowed. Therefore this proposal would affect only goods that appreciate in value, such as land. 7.35 This approach means that the GST treatment is the same as if the supplier, having acquired the goods for non-taxable purposes, had applied the goods in a taxable activity instead of selling them to an associated person. In these circumstances an input tax credit for the change in use would be allowed under section 21(5). That provision allows a credit of one-ninth of the cost of goods acquired or produced after 1 October 1986 that are not acquired for taxable purposes but are subsequently applied for taxable purposes. 7.36 Assuming this option were adopted, the full GST cost incurred by the supplier would be allowed as a credit to the associated purchaser in relation to goods acquired after 1 October 1986. For goods acquired before that date the cost would not have included a GST element, and an input tax credit should not, therefore, be allowed. 24 Chapter sixteen (The Definition of “Associated Persons”) discusses the proposed changes to the current definition of “associated persons”. The second-hand goods input tax credit 55 7.37 The next chapter discusses proposed changes to the value of a deemed supply on deregistration. It is proposed to value all such supplies at market value rather than, as currently, at the lower of cost or open market value. The increased output tax liability for assets that have appreciated in value would reduce the overall tax advantage in on-selling an asset after deregistration in order to trigger a second-hand goods input tax credit. Therefore in these circumstances the amount of the second-hand goods credit should be the same as that currently provided, that is, the lesser of the purchase price or open market value. Specific issues for consultation • Which of the following options is preferable? –Review the treatment of land to: - exclude land from the definition of second-hand goods; or - exempt land from GST. –Replace the current scheme to allow a second-hand goods input tax credit with a margin scheme. –Limit the credit in relation to supplies between associated persons to the lesser of : - the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; or -one-ninth of the purchase price; or -one-ninth of the open market value. • The Government’s preferred option is to limit the credit for transactions between associated persons. What issues (in addition to those outlined) does this raise? 56 CHAPTER EIGHT DEREGISTRATION Proposed policy • Require any deemed supply on deregistration to be valued at market value. 8.1 Registered persons may apply to deregister if their taxable activity ceases or the value of their taxable supplies falls below the registration threshold. Alternatively, deregistration may be initiated by the Commissioner if a registered person is not carrying on a taxable activity. 8.2 Any goods and services forming part of the assets on hand at the time of deregistration are deemed to be supplied in the course of the taxable activity. The value of the supply is deemed to be the lesser of the cost of the goods or services, including any GST, or their open market value. 8.3 This chapter proposes that supplies that are deemed to occur on deregistration be valued in all cases at market value. Policy intent 8.4 The 1985 White Paper proposed that the value of a deemed supply on deregistration be the cost of the goods to the registered person making the supply. 8.5 The Advisory Panel on GST considered that valuing the supply at cost was inappropriate as the goods could have declined in value following their use in the taxable activity. The Panel proposed that the tax depreciated cost be used in relation to capital assets. 8.6 The current rule that the value be the lesser of cost or open market value is based on the assumption that goods and services might also decrease in value. 8.7 The purpose of the deregistration rules can be regarded as to either to: • recapture the amount of the input tax already claimed on assets that are part of a taxable activity; or Deregistration 57 • ensure that output tax is paid on the deemed transfer of an asset out of a taxable activity as well as on supplies made to another person. 8.8 The better view is that on deregistration, registered persons in effect make a supply to themselves in their private capacity and thus as a final consumer. Arrangements involving second-hand goods 8.9 As discussed in this chapter, on deregistration, output tax is payable on the lesser of the cost or open market value of goods held by a registered person (under section 10(8)). If the goods are then on-sold to a registered person, a second-hand goods input tax credit may be claimed for one-ninth of the purchase price, or, if the parties are associated, one-ninth of the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value. If the cost option is used on deregistration significant gains may arise from the sale of goods which appreciate in value, such as land. 8.10 The scope for both associated and non-associated parties to take advantage of this mismatch needs to be addressed. Proposed reform Value supply at market value 8.11 The Government proposes to require GST charged on deregistration to be based on the market value of the goods and services at that time. This would ensure that the output tax liability reflected the value that had been added by the registered person. It would also ensure that supplies by registered persons to themselves and to another person had equivalent GST treatments. 8.12 This change would affect only deemed supplies of goods that have increased in value – such as land. The output tax liability of a deregistered person in relation to goods and services that have declined in value would remain unchanged. 8.13 The GST Act provides no guidance on acceptable criteria for determining a market value. This can create compliance and administrative difficulties for taxpayers and Inland Revenue alike. Therefore it may be useful to consider developing a definition of “market value” drawing on precedents such as the arm’s length principle used in the transfer pricing rules (section GD 13(6) of the Income Tax Act). Comments on this issue are invited. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 58 Specific issues for consultation • What compliance cost concerns would arise if deemed supplies on deregistration were valued at market value? • Should the meaning of the term “market value” be more clearly defined in the Act? 59 CHAPTER NINE EXPORTED SERVICES Proposed policy • Exclude from zero-rating the supply of a right to receive a service if any recipient of that service will be in New Zealand at the time it is performed. 9.1 The aim of GST is to tax consumption in New Zealand. For services, this is achieved by taxing the supply of services if they are physically performed in New Zealand. It is possible, however, to zero-rate a supply of services physically performed in New Zealand but contracted for with a non-resident who is outside New Zealand. This result is inconsistent with the aim of GST. 9.2 This chapter discusses the manner in which GST is imposed on supplies of services, how the decision in Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 25 leads to a departure from this rationale, and options for realigning the legislation with the original policy intent. Policy intent The destination principle 9.3 The broad aim of GST is to tax at a single rate all final consumption that takes place in New Zealand. This is known as the “destination principle” and means that all supplies of goods and services in New Zealand, regardless of whether they are supplied to New Zealand residents or tourists, are taxed at the standard rate of 12.5 percent. The taxation of services: the application of the destination principle 9.4 The destination principle in relation to services is reflected in the GST Act by reference to the “place of supply”. The place of supply rules are based on the residence of the supplier. If the supplier is a New Zealand resident, 26 the supply is deemed to be made in New Zealand, although services physically performed by a New Zealand resident outside New Zealand are zero-rated. 25 (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. 26 Persons, including companies and unincorporated bodies, are resident in New Zealand if they carry on an activity in New Zealand and have a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 60 9.5 If the supplier is a non-resident, supplies of services are deemed to be made outside New Zealand unless the services are physically performed by the non-resident in New Zealand. When such supplies by a non-resident are made to a registered person those supplies may, because of the neutral revenue effect, be treated as made outside New Zealand unless otherwise agreed between those parties. 9.6 Therefore the performance of services in New Zealand is subject to GST, and services performed outside New Zealand are outside the scope of GST. Services supplied to non-residents outside New Zealand 9.7 Section 11(2)(e) is aimed at ensuring that services performed in New Zealand that would otherwise be subject to GST at the standard rate are zero-rated when the consumption of those services occurs outside New Zealand. Specifically, it zero-rates services provided to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. The provision then excludes certain services that are directly related to land and moveable personal property in New Zealand, and restraints of trade relating to business in New Zealand. 27 This is because of the closer relationship these services may have with consumption in New Zealand. 9.8 It was not contemplated at the time GST was introduced that section 11(2)(e) would apply to services consumed in New Zealand but contracted by a non- resident outside New Zealand. Nevertheless, that was the outcome of the Court of Appeal decision in Wilson & Horton. The Wilson & Horton decision 9.9 Wilson & Horton concerned the zero-rating of advertising services that were supplied to a non-resident in relation to advertisements published in The New Zealand Herald. The Court of Appeal held that the zero-rating provisions, in particular section 11(2)(e), were directed to the contractual arrangements between the supplier and the recipient. Any benefits that accrued in New Zealand arising from the advertising were disregarded because of the indirect relationship that the benefits had with the contract between Wilson & Horton and the non-resident. 9.10 As such, the court found that the words “for and to” in section 11(2)(e) were a composite phrase. “For” does not mean “beneficially for”; it simply emphasises “to”. 27 The exceptions do not apply to services rendered to temporary imports, such as ships, aircraft and goods covered by section 166 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. Exported services 61 9.11 Therefore if services are contracted with a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time of supply, section 11(2)(e) may zero-rate the supply under that contract, regardless of any benefits that may be enjoyed in New Zealand. (This is provided the services are not supplied directly in connection with land or moveable personal property in New Zealand or are otherwise excluded.) 9.12 This interpretation can, in a number of situations, allow the zero-rating of services that are consumed in New Zealand when the contract is made with a non-resident who is outside New Zealand. Examples • An educational institution offers a training course to non-residents. A non-resident firm pays the educational institution to make 20 places on the course available to employees of the non-resident firm. The employees must come to New Zealand to attend the course. The supply between the educational institution and the non-resident firm is likely to be zero-rated. • A non-resident health provider contracts with a New Zealand resident doctor to provide specialist health services in New Zealand. Any patients requiring the specialist treatment are brought to New Zealand. The doctor invoices the health provider for any services rendered. Since the contract is with the non-resident health provider, the services are likely to be zero-rated, even though the patient is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. • A resident tourist operator issues rights for several nights’ accommodation in a New Zealand hotel to a non-resident travel wholesaler. These rights are bundled by the travel wholesaler into a New Zealand travel package in which the accommodation is redeemable by the presentation of a travel voucher. Because the contract for supply is between the tourist operator and the overseas travel wholesaler, the supply is likely to be zero-rated, even though redemption of those rights (the accommodation) occurs in New Zealand. 9.13 The common element in these transactions is that a New Zealand resident arranges with a non-resident (who is outside New Zealand at the time of supply) to physically perform services that will be provided to a third party in New Zealand. This result is contrary to the policy aim of imposing GST on consumption in New Zealand. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 62 Options for change 9.14 Although Inland Revenue has followed the Court of Appeal’s decision, 28 the Government proposes that the legislation be aligned with the original policy intent. There are two possible ways of achieving this. The first is to amend the place of supply rules. The second is to amend the zero-rating provisions. Place of supply rules 9.15 The place of supply is determined in New Zealand first by reference to the residence of the supplier. In the case of non-residents the test is where the services are physically performed. 9.16 The place of supply rules can be represented in other ways. One way is to provide a detailed list of where services are deemed to be supplied, as has been done in the United Kingdom and other European Union jurisdictions. 9.17 Nevertheless, the current approach has the advantage of enabling the place of supply to be defined by way of exclusion rather than inclusion and thereby ensures that the legislation provides a place of supply rule for all supplies. Zero-rating provisions 9.18 A preferable approach is to amend the zero-rating provisions relating to the treatment of exported services. The options for doing so include amending the zero-rating provisions to exclude the supply of services that although: • supplied to a non-resident, also benefit a person in New Zealand; • supplied to a non-resident, are physically performed in New Zealand; or • involves a right to the service being supplied to a non-resident, also involves any recipient being present in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. 9.19 These options are described below. Benefit 9.20 As noted by the Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton, any requirement to consider where the actual benefit of a service is enjoyed would raise major complications from a practical perspective. It would require a supplier to look beyond the purchaser of the supply (the person who has contracted and paid for it) to determine who is actually benefiting from the supply. A complicating factor is that a resident supplier would be required to seek this information from a non-resident and it could, therefore, be difficult to obtain 28 See the public binding ruling “GST – advertising space and advertising time sold to non-residents”, BR Pub 96/10 in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 8, No. 8, page 13. Exported services 63 and verify. Therefore this option, although more clearly focused on the place of consumption, is not feasible. Physical performance 9.21 The second option is to exclude from the zero-rating provisions the supply of services that, although supplied to a non-resident, are physically performed in New Zealand. However, this could apply more widely than is desirable in view of the broad aim of GST to tax consumption in New Zealand. For example, the supply of professional services such as legal or accounting services to a non-resident would not be zero-rated because the physical performance of those services occurs in New Zealand. It is also arguable that this approach would disadvantage New Zealand suppliers in the international market. Recipient of service in New Zealand (preferred option) 9.22 The Government’s preferred option is to distinguish clearly between the receipt of the right to the service and the receipt of the service itself. This would involve excluding from the zero-rating provisions the supply of a right to receive a service if any recipient of that service will be in New Zealand at the time it is performed. This would remove the practical difficulties noted in Wilson & Horton and the potentially distortionary effect of a test based on physical performance in New Zealand. 9.23 Therefore if the intended recipient of the services will be in New Zealand at the time the services are performed, the services would be subject to GST at the standard rate. Conversely, if the recipient is outside New Zealand at that time those services would be zero-rated. 9.24 For individuals, presence in New Zealand is a straightforward matter. For companies and other non-individuals it will be necessary to distinguish between a presence in New Zealand that is linked to the supply and a presence that is merely incidental to the supply. This issue is discussed in chapter fourteen (Exported Services: Remedial Issues). Application date 9.25 As noted earlier, the Government intends introducing legislation to address the issue in the next available taxation bill, with the legislation to apply from the date of introduction. Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 64 Specific issues for consultation • The proposal to exclude from zero-rating the supply of a right to receive a service if any recipient of that service will be in New Zealand at the time it is performed. • The alternative options for removing the zero-rating treatment of such supplies. 65 CHAPTER TEN DEFERRED SETTLEMENTS Proposed policy • Require GST to be returned on an accrual basis in relation to any supply exceeding $200,000 in value. 10.1 Since GST came into effect it has been possible in relation to transactions involving two registered persons using different bases of accounting for GST to claim an immediate input tax credit but defer the payment of output tax. Because of the tax avoidance opportunities this creates it is proposed to modify the application of the payments basis of accounting. This chapter discusses proposed reform in this area. Policy intent 10.2 The primary rule for determining when GST is recognised by a registered person on a supply of goods or services is the earlier of invoice or any payment. Taxpayers on a cash or payments basis of accounting, however, need to recognise a GST liability only when payment is received for a supply of goods or services. The payments basis was introduced to facilitate compliance with GST, and is directed at registered persons whose turnover consists of high-volume but low-value sales. Deferred settlements 10.3 An indefinite timing advantage can be created when a registered person who accounts for GST on a payments basis makes a supply to a registered person who accounts on an invoice basis. The payments basis supplier provides the invoice basis purchaser with a tax invoice. The purchaser promptly claims an input tax credit on the basis of the tax invoice, but payment is significantly deferred. The supplier, who accounts for GST on the payments basis, does not return any GST until payment is made. 10.4 Substantial GST refunds are being made in relation to deferred property settlements. Although in most cases settlement is deferred for only 12 to 24 months, some settlements have been deferred for periods as long as 10 to 30 years, at times with little apparent commercial justification other than that of a GST timing advantage. The Government is concerned at the revenue loss created by these transactions. This revenue loss arises not only from the deferral of revenue resulting in the loss of the time value of money but also Part III: Maintaining the revenue base 66 from the increased possibility that output tax from the supplier may not be returned because payment is never received. Proposed reform Restrictions on using the payments basis 10.5 The obvious weakness in the legislation that is exploited by deferred property settlements is the interaction between registered persons who account for GST on an invoice basis and registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis. It is proposed to modify the application of the payments basis by requiring that GST be returned on an accrual basis (under either the invoice or hybrid methods) in relation to any supply exceeding $200,000. 10.6 Transactions in excess of $200,000 will be readily identifiable, and a person making a supply of this value should have adequate records of the transaction to account for it on an accrual basis. Section 76 10.7 To prevent registered persons from entering into arrangements to avoid the $200,000 threshold by splitting a supply of goods or services between a number of entities or transactions it is proposed to amend section 76 to give the Commissioner a specific power to consolidate those entities or transactions. Specific issue for consultation • The proposed threshold for accounting on an accrual basis in relation to a taxable supply and any compliance concerns with the proposal. Part IV Remedial Issues 69 CHAPTER ELEVEN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES EXEMPTION Proposed policy • Exclude debt collection services from the financial services exemption. • Include financial options in the financial services exemption. • Provide that non-deliverable futures contracts will be exempt if they are tradeable on a defined market or they are traded at arm’s length. • Clarify that deliverable futures contracts will be subject to GST unless the deliverable commodity is exempt. • Treat penalty interest as being in respect of a financial service and, therefore, exempt. • Repeal the proviso in subparagraph (ii) of section 14(a) which excludes goods or services that are not themselves financial services from being “financial services”. 11.1 This chapter deals with issues relating to the definition of “financial services” in section 3 of the GST Act. If a service falls within the definition it qualifies as an exempt supply under section 14(a). 11.2 Financial services are exempt from GST because of the practical difficulties involved in identifying the amount of value added by suppliers of financial services, since the margin that is charged by the supplier is hard to separate from the total funds transferred. 11.3 The broad policy underlying the definition of “financial services” is to encompass services provided under agreements involving the exchange of money or substitutes for money, such as shares. In contrast, agreements that involve the supply of a commodity should generally be included in the GST base. 11.4 This chapter highlights areas where change is needed to ensure that the intended scope of the definition, and therefore the scope of the exemption, is maintained. The need for such changes is inevitable as there will always be innovations in the financial services area that could not have been contemplated when the definition was originally enacted. Part IV: Remedial issues 70 Debt collection Policy intent 11.5 The collection of interest, dividends and principal was made an exempt supply in 1986 by inserting section 3(1)(ka) into the GST Act. The mere receipt of money is outside the scope of the Act, since money is expressly excluded from the definitions of “goods” and “services”. If money were included, a single transaction would result in two taxable supplies – the supply of money and the supply of goods or services. 11.6 Since that amendment was made, debt collection services have generally been considered to be an exempt supply, as stated in Public Information Bulletin 164. Issue 11.7 The supply of debt collection services should be a taxable supply because more than the mere receipt of money is involved. Thus the rationale for exempting the collection of interest, dividends and principal does not apply. 11.8 Because a commission is usually charged for debt collection services, valuation issues that underpin the need for the exemption for “financial services” should not be a significant concern. 11.9 It is also considered that debt collection is not reasonably incidental to the actual supply of debt securities and credit contracts. For example, services provided in relation to drafting a mortgage agreement could be seen as being incidental to the supply of a debt security, whereas debt collection services for the repayment of arrears is a step removed from that, and can be seen as a separate transaction. Proposed reform 11.10 It is proposed to change the reference in section 3(1)(ka) from “collection” to “receipt”. For the avoidance of doubt, section 3 will be further amended by inserting a new subsection specifically excluding the activity of debt collection from the definition of “financial services”. Derivatives Policy intent 11.11 The broad policy underlying the definition of “financial services” is to encompass services under contracts involving the exchange of money or substitutes for money (such as shares). In contrast, contracts that involve the supply of a commodity should generally be included in the GST base. The financial services exemption 71 11.12 The only reference to financial derivatives in the definition of “financial services” is in section 3(1)(k), which includes in the definition the provision or assignment of a futures contract through a futures exchange. The terms “futures contract” and “futures exchange” are not defined in the Act. 11.13 When the definition of “financial services” was first formulated in 1985 it was assumed that any new financial derivatives developed would fall within the term “futures contract” and would, therefore, be exempt from GST. 11.14 It is uncertain, however, whether some derivatives, such as options, can in fact be described as futures contracts and, therefore, whether they are exempt from GST. 11.15 The use of the term “futures contract” also incorrectly assumes that all futures contracts are of the same nature, so should be treated in the same way for GST purposes. 11.16 It is also arguable that the requirement that a futures contract be provided or assigned through a “futures exchange” is too restrictive. Financial options Issue 11.17 The buying and selling of financial options on recognised markets has been treated by taxpayers as an exempt activity under section 3(1)(k), since all that is being supplied is the right either to buy or sell a given amount of a specified commodity on a specified date. This is an acceptable policy result because an option is comparable to a futures contract. 11.18 Nevertheless, the technical nature of a financial option is distinct from a futures contract. Unlike the holder of a futures contract, the option holder is not obliged to exercise the rights or obligations under the contract. This technical distinction between futures contracts and financial options is recognised under the accrual rules in the Income Tax Act. Proposed Reform 11.19 It is proposed to amend section 3(1) to specify that financial options are included in the definition of “financial services”. This amendment would prevent a strained interpretation being taken of the term “futures contract”, thus helping to guard against any unintended broadening of the financial services definition. Part IV: Remedial issues 72 Deliverable and non-deliverable futures contracts Issue 11.20 Futures contracts fall into two categories: • contracts that provide for the delivery of a commodity (deliverable contracts); and • contracts that do not provide for the delivery of a commodity (non- deliverable contracts). 11.21 The present definition of “financial services” does not specify any distinction between deliverable and non-deliverable contracts. All that is required under section 3(1)(k) is that a “futures contract” be traded on a futures exchange. 11.22 When a futures contract is non-deliverable, all that is being traded is a financial service, and no underlying commodity is exchanged. A deliverable contract, in contrast, involves the trade of an underlying commodity and is, therefore, equivalent to a contract for the supply of goods or services. 11.23 If the distinction between non-deliverable and deliverable futures contracts were recognised, non-deliverable contracts would continue to be exempt from GST, since all that is being traded is a pure financial service. Deliverable contracts would be exempt only if the underlying commodity being traded – for example, foreign currency – were exempt. Proposed reform 11.24 It is proposed that non-deliverable contracts be exempt from GST, since all that is being traded is money or a substitute for money. On the other hand, deliverable contracts will be exempt only if the underlying commodity being traded is exempt. Futures exchanges Issue 11.25 The requirement that a futures contract be traded through a futures exchange ensures that there is a genuine market trading in derivatives, and that there are arm’s length terms of trade so avoidance opportunities are minimised. 11.26 Without the market requirement, the price for a derivative might not reflect its true value. Taxpayers might be able to claim greater input tax credits by manipulating the relative values of their exempt and taxable supplies. The lack of a market requirement could also create opportunities for taxpayers to recharacterise taxable supplies of commodities (contracts for the sale of goods or services) as exempt supplies under a derivatives contract. The financial services exemption 73 11.27 Moreover, the lack of a formalised market could make it difficult, from an audit perspective, to track transactions in derivatives. 11.28 The GST Act does not include a definition of “futures exchange”. In the past, Inland Revenue’s Technical Rulings described a futures exchange as an exchange regarded by the commercial community as a futures exchange. The lack of a definition has created uncertainty as to the meaning of the term. Because arm’s length transactions can occur outside a recognised exchange, the reference to a futures exchange is also arguably too restrictive. 11.29 Both the Securities Amendment Act 1988, in its use of the term “authorised futures exchange”, 29 and the Income Tax Act, in its definition of a “recognised exchange”, 30 provide some guidance as to possible definitions of suitable markets and factors to be taken into account in formulating an arm’s length principle. Proposed reform 11.30 It is proposed to insert a requirement in the definition of “financial services” that derivatives be traded on a defined market or otherwise be traded at arm’s length. Penalty interest 11.31 If a purchaser fails to make payment under a contract the supplier may, if the contract permits, charge the purchaser interest for the use of the money and to induce payment. The interest is generally called penalty or default interest. Issue 11.32 The nature of penalty interest is conceptually indistinguishable from that of other forms of interest, which the Act exempts under section 3(1)(ka). 11.33 The provision of a credit contract 31 and certain services relating to credit contracts are within the definition of “financial services” and thus exempt from GST. However, penalty interest charged under a contract does not necessarily make the contract a “credit contract”, so penalty interest may be subject to GST when the underlying supply is taxable. Proposed reform 11.34 It is proposed to exempt penalty interest from GST. 29 Section 37. 30 Defined in section OB 1 for the purposes of sections CF 3, CG 17, OD 5, and the definitions of “market value” and “on-market acquisition”. 31 As defined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981. Part IV: Remedial issues 74 Exemption for financial services – section 14(a)(ii) Issue 11.35 Section 14(a) exempts from GST the supply of goods and services that are “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the supply of “financial services”. The section was amended in 1989 as a result of the Court of Appeal decision in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Databank Systems Limited. 32 In that decision it was held that a company supplying computer processing services to trading banks providing financial services to its customers was itself supplying “financial services”. Therefore the company’s supplies were exempt. 11.36 Subparagraph (ii) of section 14(a) excludes from being a financial service goods or services that are not themselves “financial services”. The provision was inserted so that, in the words of the Privy Council reversing the Court of Appeal decision in the Databank case, “...exemption is not afforded to ‘a person’ who is ‘involved’ in ‘an activity’ which ‘results in’ the supply of financial services...”. 33 The Privy Council also stated that if the Court of Appeal decision was reversed subparagraph (ii) “would cease to be necessary”. 34 11.37 The Privy Council did reverse the Court of Appeal decision, holding that Databank merely provided services which enabled its client banks to provide financial services. The supplies in question were neither financial services in themselves nor reasonably incidental to such a supply because they were not provided by the same person. Subparagraph (ii) is, therefore, no longer necessary. 11.38 Subparagraph (ii) also creates ambiguity, since there is an uncertain relationship with the preceding reference to the supply of any other goods or services that are reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of “financial services”. Proposed reform 11.39 It is proposed to repeal subparagraph (ii) of section 14(a). 32 (1989) 11 NZTC 6,093. 33 CIR v Databank Systems Limited (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 at 7,232. 34 Ibid 7,236. 75 CHAPTER TWELVE FACTORED DEBTS Proposed policy • Require registered persons accounting for GST on a payments basis to pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. 12.1 Debt factoring involves the sale of debt to a third party. It can be an integral part of the cash and liquidity management of a business. The person selling the debt may be prepared to receive a lesser, but certain, sum immediately rather than wait for a possibly greater, but uncertain, sum in the future. 12.2 When a debt is factored, there are three main parties: • the “assignor” – the supplier of the goods or services; • the “debtor” – the person who is liable to pay for the goods or services; and • the “factor” – the person who buys the debt from the assignor and has the right to receive payment from the debtor. 12.3 This chapter discusses three issues relating to the GST treatment of debt factoring: • whether there should be a difference in the treatment of registered persons who account for GST on an accrual (invoice or hybrid) basis and those who account on a payments basis; • the tax advantages that can arise as a result of recharacterising credit sales as exempt supplies of debt; and • the fact that accrual basis taxpayers may have to pay GST on the full consideration for the supply, irrespective of the fact that full payment is not received. Difference between the accounting bases 12.4 Debt factoring is generally a financial service and, as such, is an exempt supply. However, section 3(4) of the GST Act excludes debt factoring as a financial service if the result of the assignment would be that output tax is not payable on the underlying taxable supply. This means that when a debt is factored the application of GST to the supply of debt will differ according to whether the assignor is on a payments or accrual basis of accounting. Part IV: Remedial issues 76 Accrual basis 12.5 If the assignor is on an accrual basis, any output tax liability on the assignment of debt will have arisen before the assignment. The assignment of debt is an exempt supply, but GST is payable on the full value of the underlying supply, irrespective of whether full payment is received. For example, a microwave oven is sold to a consumer for $1,000. The fact that the debt created by the consumer is subsequently sold to a third party for $900 does not affect the value of, and hence the GST payable on, the original supply. The value of the taxable supply is still $1,000, not $900. Payments basis 12.6 If the assignor is on a payments basis, output tax must be paid on any amount received for that debt before the assignment and any amount received on the assignment. This means that GST is not payable on the discount component of a factoring transaction. Using the example above, GST must be returned on the consideration received on the assignment ($900) rather than on the value of the taxable supply ($1,000). Inland Revenue’s previous policy 12.7 Inland Revenue’s previous policy, 35 aimed at ensuring equity between taxpayers on different accounting bases, was to allow a bad debt adjustment for debts factored by registered persons accounting for GST on an accrual basis. The bad debt adjustment reduced the registered person’s GST liability by one-ninth of the amount by which the debt was discounted. 12.8 The Taxation Review Authority in Case T27, 36 which concerned the sale of debts from credit card sales, indicated that this practice was incorrect, since the debt factored in that case was a good debt, not a bad debt. As a result, Inland Revenue has withdrawn this policy. 37 Recharacterising credit sales 12.9 Under Inland Revenue’s previous policy, debt factoring could have effectively allowed registered persons to convert taxable supplies of goods and services into exempt supplies. This was possible because the sale of debt is generally an exempt financial service. Although this problem has to some extent been resolved for accrual basis taxpayers, the issue remains in relation to registered persons that account for GST on a payments basis. 35 As stated in Public Information Bulletin 164. 36 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188. 37 Tax Information Bulletin Volume 10, No. 5, May 1998, page 23. Factored debts 77 Payment of GST on amounts not received 12.10 The Government acknowledges the argument that it could be disadvantageous for registered persons to factor debt if no bad debt deduction is available. However, it is difficult to deal legislatively with the problem of assignors of debt having to pay GST on amounts not received at the point of assignment without introducing other problems. They include making it easier for taxpayers to recharacterise credit sales as debt, creating a risk for the debt factor of an increased imposition of GST, and significant compliance costs. 12.11 Accordingly, the preferred approach is to leave it to the assignor and factor to agree as to whether the GST paid by the assignor should be discounted or otherwise taken into account in setting the price at which the debt is factored. Proposed reform 12.12 To re-establish parity between the two accounting bases and remove opportunities for recharacterising credit sales, it is proposed to require assignors on the payments basis to pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. 78 CHAPTER THIRTEEN GOING CONCERNS Proposed policy • Require the going concern test to be applied when the supply is deemed to be made. • Require a business to be capable of being carried on by a purchaser for it to be transferred as a going concern. 13.1 Under section 11(1)(c) the supply of goods between registered persons as a going concern is zero-rated. 13.2 Changes to the legislation in 1995 substantially improved the operation of the provision. Even so, some uncertainties remain, especially as to when the test is to be applied and the meaning of “going concern” – as evidenced by the Court of Appeal decision K R Pine v Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 38 This chapter proposes remedial changes to address these uncertainties. Policy intent 13.3 The original purpose behind zero-rating supplies of going concerns was: • to eliminate the cash-flow cost to purchasers of going concerns in financing the GST for the period between making payment and receipt of the GST refund; • to reduce the risk of fraud when a vendor charges GST on sale of a business but retains the GST component; and • to ensure parity with the treatment of sales of shares, which are exempt financial services. 13.4 In 1995 three changes were made: • A definition of “going concern” was inserted in section 2(1). • Section 11(1)(c)(ii) was inserted, providing that a sale of a taxable activity can be zero-rated only when both parties to the sale agree that it is the sale of a going concern. 38 (1998) 18 NZTC 13,570. Going concerns 79 • Section 78E was inserted, allowing a registered person who has zero- rated the supply of a taxable activity to increase the consideration payable if the supply is not in fact a going concern. 13.5 These reforms have worked well in practice, and have gone a long way to alleviating compliance and administrative costs in this area. Some uncertainties remain, however, and they should be resolved. Issues Timing of test 13.6 The current wording of section 11(1)(c)(i) creates uncertainty as to when the going concern test is to be applied, by using the phrase “supply to a registered person of a taxable activity, that is, or is to be, transferred”. 13.7 Cases dealing with the pre-1995 provision, such as Belton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 39 and K R Pine, have stated that the test is to be applied at settlement. 13.8 Whether a taxable activity is supplied as a going concern was intended to be determined at the time of supply – generally the earlier of invoice or payment. 40 The time of settlement or transfer is not relevant to determining the status of the supply, although the taxable activity must continue to be carried on by the vendor until the time of transfer for the supply to be zero- rated. 13.9 The time of supply appears to be the better time at which to apply the going concern test. The time of supply will generally be when the parties enter into an agreement to transfer a taxable activity. It will also be the time at which the parties consider whether the taxable activity is a going concern. 13.10 In addition, this approach provides consistent treatment between deferred settlements and other transactions. Receipt of a going concern 13.11 The policy intent behind the going concern provisions was that the taxable activity must be received as, and capable of being operated as, a going concern by the purchaser for the zero-rating provisions to apply. The taxable activity must be capable of seamless operation during its transfer, although it is not necessary that the purchaser in fact operate the taxable activity after its transfer. 39 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,403. 40 As stated in Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 6, No. 12, May 1995, page 31. Part IV: Remedial issues 80 13.12 The majority of the Court of Appeal in K R Pine, however, held otherwise. 13.13 In that case a registered person sold a taxable activity of commercial leasing to another registered person whose partnership had been the tenant of the commercial property. The partnership had, however, been terminated by agreement before the purchase of the lease, and the purchaser had become the lessee. 13.14 On purchase of the taxable activity, the purchaser’s legal estates as lessor and lessee merged and, therefore, at law, the purchaser could not carry on the taxable activity as a going concern. 13.15 The majority of the Court of Appeal, however, held that the transfer of a going concern had still occurred, stating that it did not matter that a taxable activity could not be operated as a going concern. The test was the form of the taxable activity supplied by the vendor, and in K R Pine the vendor had supplied a going concern. Proposed reform 13.16 It is proposed to amend the “going concern” provisions by: • applying the test for a “going concern” at the time of supply; and • requiring that the purchaser be able to continue the activity that has been supplied by the vendor for it to qualify as a going concern. 81 CHAPTER FOURTEEN EXPORTED SERVICES: REMEDIAL ISSUES Proposed policy • Zero-rate the supply of services in relation to exported goods. • Insert a definition for the phrase “outside New Zealand” in section 11(2)(e) and (fa). • Zero-rate services that are supplied directly in connection with a temporary import when supplied to a New Zealand resident. 14.1 This chapter looks at a number of remedial issues involving cross-border transactions including: • the treatment of services performed in relation to exported goods; • the meaning of the phrase “outside New Zealand” in section 11(2)(e) and (fa); and • the treatment of services supplied in relation to temporary imports. Services in relation to exported goods 14.2 Services provided to a non-resident, including those supplied in relation to exported goods, are not zero-rated if they are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property in New Zealand. However, if the value of the services were included in the price of the goods they could be zero-rated. Although substantially the same supply is being made, this anomaly requires registered persons to structure transactions to achieve zero-rating. 14.3 Currently, it is permissible to zero-rate the supply of services in relation to exported goods in limited circumstances only. These include under sections 11(2)(a) to (ac), when the services involve the arranging of transportation and insurance or the actual transportation and insurance of goods for export. Also included under section 11(2)(ca) are services to a non-resident supplied directly in connection with temporary imports entered under section 116 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. In either case this treatment can be justified because the goods are almost certain to leave New Zealand, so the services will ultimately be consumed outside New Zealand. Part IV: Remedial issues 82 14.4 This treatment does not extend to situations where a registered person in New Zealand supplies services in relation to exported goods to an offshore importer. For example, a New Zealand fruit grower exports 1,000 crates of fruit. The offshore recipient wants to ensure the quality of the fruit and so contracts a New Zealand horticultural firm to inspect the fruit independently and prepare a report. In this situation the services performed by the horticultural firm are in connection with moveable personal property in New Zealand and so cannot be zero-rated. This is not appropriate since the services are consumed outside New Zealand. Therefore it is proposed to zero-rate the supply of services that are performed directly in connection with goods that are, or will be, entered for export, provided the recipient of those services is outside New Zealand at the time of supply. 14.5 The application of sections 11(2)(a) to (ac) will need to be reviewed in light of this proposal. This is because the supply of ancillary services, although supplied directly in connection with exported goods, may not be supplied to a recipient who is outside New Zealand at the time of supply. Using the example above, if the New Zealand horticultural firm subcontracted another entity to provide transportation services (such as the loading and unloading of the goods destined for export) the services supplied by the subcontractor should not be zero-rated because they are received by a recipient who is inside New Zealand. “Outside New Zealand” 14.6 Under section 11(2)(e) services supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand may be zero-rated subject to restrictions, including those relating to land and moveable personal property situated inside New Zealand. 14.7 Applying the term “outside New Zealand” to individuals is relatively easy. If they are physically inside New Zealand, they cannot be “outside New Zealand”. 14.8 The situation with companies and unincorporated bodies, however, is more difficult. If a non-resident company has a branch in New Zealand it is arguable that supplies to the non-resident company that are not linked to the New Zealand branch’s taxable activity cannot be zero-rated because the company is not “outside New Zealand”. There is also potential uncertainty as to the application of zero-rating if a supply is made to a company based outside New Zealand which has a minor presence only in New Zealand. 14.9 It is proposed to clarify the phrase “outside New Zealand” in section 11(2)(e) to ensure that supplies to a non-resident company or unincorporated body are zero-rated if their presence in New Zealand is not linked to the supply. This treatment will also extend to section 11(2)(fa) (services relating to intellectual property rights). Exported services: remedial issues 83 Goods and services provided in connection with goods in transit and temporary imports 14.10 Sections 11(1)(ba) and 11(2)(ca) zero-rate the supply of goods and services used to repair temporary imports. 14.11 Although goods used to repair temporary imports can be zero-rated whether provided to a resident or a non-resident, repair services can be zero-rated only if they are provided to a non-resident. This can create compliance costs by requiring the supplier to charge two rates of tax (12.5 percent and zero percent) for a single supply to a resident involving charges for labour and parts. 14.12 To reduce compliance costs, the GST treatment of services relating to temporary imports should mirror that of goods. It is proposed to zero-rate all services supplied as part of the repair of temporary imports. For example, if a New Zealand-owned boat that normally operates in the Cook Islands is put into dry dock in New Zealand for repairs to its propulsion system any services involved in the repair would be zero-rated if the boat is temporarily imported. 84 CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE TREATMENT OF SOFTWARE Proposed policy • Treat copies of software programs as “goods” and copyright in relation to software programs as “services”. This is not intended to affect the current treatment of imported software under section 12. 15.1 Generally, there is no need to distinguish between the supply of goods and the supply of services because the domestic supply of both goods and services by a registered person is subject to GST. 41 A distinction is often required, however, for cross-border transactions and in determining whether an input tax credit is available for second-hand goods. Software is a particular area of concern. This chapter looks at the nature of software programs and makes proposals to clarify the treatment of transactions involving the supply of software programs. It also comments on the applicability of the second-hand goods input tax credit to software. Software programs: goods or services? 15.2 Software programs can be supplied in two forms. The first form of supply is by way of media such as disc, magnetic tape, and compact disc. The second form of supply is by electronic pulse. Software in the latter form can be delivered to a computer through the Internet, by way of a telephone or cable network, or by satellite. 15.3 The classification of software programs as either goods or services can create different GST results. For example, imported goods are subject to GST but imported services are not. A notional input tax credit is available for goods that are second-hand, but not for services. Services to non-residents that are to be zero-rated must satisfy several conditions, including that they are not supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property in New Zealand. 15.4 Problems may also arise with respect to used software programs. Because software can vary in form it may be uncertain whether on disposal it should be treated as new or second-hand goods or as the supply of services. 41 “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property, but does not include choses in action or money. “Services” means anything that is not goods or money. By exclusion, since choses in action are not “goods”, but “services”. The treatment of software 85 The nature of software programs 15.5 Over the last couple of decades various courts have attempted to classify software programs as goods or services. Initially, the more prevalent view was that software was intangible property usually in the form of “know how”, and was therefore a service. However, issues related to sales tax and certain consumer protection legislation have led to the current predominant view appearing to be that copies of software programs are tangible property. The courts have emphasised that it is the transfer of software programs onto a physical medium such as a disk, tape or compact disc that determines its nature as being goods. 15.6 In St Albans City and District Council v International Computers Limited, 42 it was held that software was “goods” for the purposes of the United Kingdom sale of goods legislation. The court concluded the customised software program acquired by St Albans was “goods”, noting that the software was defective and in breach of the terms as to quality and fitness for the purpose implied under the 1979 Act and 1982 Act. The court commented that a computer disk fell within the meaning of “goods”, but the copyright in a computer program did not. 15.7 In another case, South Central Bell Telephone Company v Barthelemy, 43 it was held that software becomes “tangible personal property” when it is physically manifested in a recorded form. The court held that the mode of delivery did not affect this outcome. Intellectual property rights in relation to software programs 15.8 The Taxation Review Authority in Case T28 44 considered in some detail whether the supply of a business package by an unregistered person to a registered person was goods and, if so, whether those goods were second- hand. The business package consisted of a provisional patent, registered trademark and computer programs. 15.9 Barber DJ considered that the supply of the business package, in particular the provisional patent and the registered trademark, was the supply of a chose in action and was thereby excluded from the definition of “goods”. He also considered the supply of the computer program in the package was not the supply of “goods” but was the supply of intellectual property in the form of “know how”. Naming these components as “a business package” did not convert them into goods. Consequently, a second-hand goods input tax credit was not available. 42 (1996) 4 All ER 481 (Court of Appeal Civil Division). 43 643 So.2d 1240 (La 1994), Louisiana Supreme Court. 44 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,197. Part IV: Remedial issues 86 Proposed reform 15.10 It is proposed that the supply of copies of software programs be specifically included in the definition of “goods”, and the supply of copyright in relation to software programs be included in the definition of “services”. 15.11 In South Central Bell Telephone Company and St Albans, the supply related to the sale of “goods”, being software programs. Case T28 involved the supply of a chose in action in the form of copyright. The supply of copyright in a software program and the supply of a copyrighted article such as a copy of a software program are distinguishable; in the latter there is no transfer of copyright rights. 15.12 The supply of a mass marketed software program product (commonly referred to as “shrinkwrapped software”) often includes a licence. These licences may allow the purchaser to make further copies as necessary for use within the purchaser’s business. These kinds of rights are commonly referred to as “site” or “network” licences. They should not change the nature of the supply as one of goods. 15.13 This distinction between the supply of copyright and the supply of a copyrighted article is not intended to affect the current treatment of imported software under section 12. 15.14 Software physically imported into New Zealand is considered to be “goods” and liable to duty (in this case GST) collected by the New Zealand Customs Service under section 12 of the Act. GST is levied on the price paid or payable for the imported software package. However, for valuation purposes, if the value of the contents (the message or data) is declared or invoiced in a manner which distinguishes it from the value of the carrier medium, the legislation allows Customs to deduct the value of the contents from the price paid or payable. Customs will then levy GST only on the value of the carrier medium, plus the cost of freight and insurance incurred in bringing the goods to New Zealand. 45 Second-hand goods and software 15.15 If a registered person purchases a copy of a software program from an unregistered person the issue of the availability of the second-hand goods input tax credit arises. The registered person must give careful consideration as to what is being acquired. 45 Second Schedule, cl 3(1)(c) of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. This method of valuation is a requirement under the World Trade Organisation General Agreement on Trade and Services, to which New Zealand is a signatory. The distinction between content and media does not apply to imported sound, cinematic or video recordings. The treatment of software 87 15.16 If the purchase relates to the supply of copyright rights it is not the supply of second-hand goods but the supply of a chose in action. Therefore a second- hand goods input tax credit would not be available. 15.17 Conversely, if the registered person purchases a copyrighted article, a second-hand goods input tax credit would be available if the copy of the software program in question would ordinarily be considered to be second- hand. That is, the goods have been used or cannot otherwise be considered to be new. 15.18 Chapter seven (The Second-Hand Goods Input Tax Credit) considers the meaning of “second-hand” and sets out proposals concerning the availability of the credit. 88 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE DEFINITION OF “ASSOCIATED PERSONS” Proposed policy • Replace the definition of “associated persons” for GST purposes with the broader definition used in the Income Tax Act. This definition would include: -stronger provisions dealing with trusts; -a level of association between a shareholder and a company at 25 percent rather than 10 percent; and -a rule to aggregate the rights held in a company by relatives. • Include people in de facto relationships in the definition of “associated persons” in the GST Act. 16.1 “Associated persons” for the purposes of GST are: • two companies if there is a group of persons with aggregate voting interests or market value interests (or another form of control) of at least 50 percent in each company; • a company and anyone who holds at least 10 percent of the voting or market value interests of the company, either: -individually, or -with a spouse and/or infant children, or a trustee for the person/spouse/children; • two people one of whom is the spouse or child (or the trustee of the spouse or child) of the other; • a relative by blood to the fourth degree, by marriage, or adoption; • two persons one of whom is the trustee of a trust under which the other has benefited or is eligible to benefit; • a partnership and anyone who is: - a partner in the partnership, or - associated with a partner in the partnership; • a company and anyone who is associated with a person associated with the company. The definition of “associated persons” 89 16.2 This definition is largely based on that used for the land provisions of the Income Tax Act (section OD 8(4)). 16.3 The current definition of “associated persons” in the GST Act is deficient in relation to some trust arrangements and does not apply to de facto relationships. Nor does it deal adequately with nominees. This chapter proposes legislative changes to address these deficiencies. 16.4 Furthermore, the definition treats as associated persons individuals who have a minor level of association with a company (a voting or market value interest of 10 percent or more). This percentage is no longer appropriate, given changes to the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules. Application of the “associated persons” definition in the GST Act 16.5 The GST Act contains a number of rules that apply to supplies of goods and services between associated persons, particularly when the consideration is not equivalent to the open market value of the supply. In that case the value of the supply is deemed to be its open market value. The income tax definitions 16.6 Apart from being used for GST purposes, the section OD 8(4) “associated persons” definition is confined to land transactions. The definition of “associated persons” in section OD 8(3), developed in 1988 (after the enactment of the GST Act) for the international tax rules, has much broader application, being used for the international tax rules and other rules including depreciation and the tax liability of companies left with insufficient assets. 16.7 The section OD 8(3) definition addresses many of the deficiencies in the definition used for land transactions and in the general associated persons definition in section OD 7. Proposed reform 16.8 Ideally, the “associated persons” definitions throughout the Inland Revenue Acts should be based on a standard definition. Until that can be achieved, however, the GST Act should be strengthened to ensure that transactions between related parties are treated as if they were made at arm’s length. Part IV: Remedial issues 90 Strengthening the existing definition 16.9 Incorporating the section OD 8(3) “associated persons” definition into the GST Act would introduce the following relationships into the GST definition: • a trustee of a trust and a settlor of that trust; • a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust if there is a common settlor of both trusts; and • two persons who habitually act in concert. (This would need to be modified to relate to supplies subject to GST.) 16.10 The definition used in the international tax rules, however, does not contain a rule to aggregate the rights held in a company by relatives. Therefore it is proposed that a rule similar to the aggregation rule in section OD 7(2) be included in the GST Act. That provision deems rights held by a nominee (defined to include a relative) to be held by the principal as well as the nominee, as if they were one person. 16.11 The existing “relatives” and “trustee-beneficiary” tests in the GST Act definition will be retained. Replacing the 10 percent threshold 16.12 A deemed supply arises under section 21(3) in relation to fringe benefits that are subject to FBT. The value of the deemed supply is the same as the taxable value of the fringe benefit calculated under the FBT rules in the Income Tax Act. 16.13 Before 1 April 1989 “major shareholders” were excluded from the FBT rules. The term “major shareholder” broadly included anyone with a 10 percent or greater shareholding in a company. 16.14 However, the definition of “associated persons” specifically included a company and a person holding a 25 percent or greater interest in the company. Therefore supplies made to employees with shareholdings of between 10 percent and 25 percent could be made at less than cost (including no cost), and recipients would thus have paid less GST than they should have on that consumption. They also escaped GST on the value of any fringe benefits. This gap in the GST base was addressed by a change in 1986 to the definition of “associated persons” so that it included a company and a shareholder with a 10 percent or greater interest in that company. The definition of “associated persons” 91 16.15 The definition of “major shareholder” in the Income Tax Act was repealed in 1988 with effect from 1 April 1989. This means that shareholder employees, regardless of their shareholding, are now subject to FBT in the same manner as other employees. 46 For this reason the 10 percent threshold in the company-shareholders test in the definition of “associated persons” in the GST Act should be removed and replaced with the 25 percent threshold used in the general associated persons definition. Extension to de facto relationships 16.16 The De Facto Relationships (Property) Bill seeks to extend the treatment of property in the Matrimonial Property Act to de facto relationships. The definition of “spouse” also includes de facto relationships in certain income tax contexts. 16.17 De facto relationships should also be recognised in the GST Act because there is a sufficient connection between the parties to justify the application of the associated persons rules. 46 In certain circumstances an employer may elect to treat non-cash benefits as a dividend rather than as a fringe benefit subject to FBT. 92 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN UNINCORPORATED BODIES: DEBT PRIORITY AND MEMBERS’ LIABILITY FOR GST Proposed policy • Confirm the preferential status of GST debts recoverable from individual members of an unincorporated body. • Ensure that preferential status for unpaid GST debts of an unincorporated body also applies if a receiver is appointed other than by court order. • Confirm that the liability of a member of an unincorporated body for GST payable during the time the person was a member extends beyond the period of membership. 17.1 Section 42 provides that the Commissioner is a preferential creditor in relation to GST that is unpaid at the time of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership. This ranking is due to GST being effectively held in trust for the Crown and is consistent with the treatment of unpaid PAYE. 17.2 Section 57(3) provides that members of unincorporated bodies are liable jointly and severally for all tax payable by the body while they are members. The estate of a deceased member is severally liable for any unpaid liabilities of the member. 17.3 This chapter proposes minor legislative changes to clarify the recovery of GST debts of an unincorporated body and the extent of a member’s liability for GST. Debt priority Individuals adjudged bankrupt 17.4 Part IX of the Insolvency Act 1967 deals with the distribution of assets of an individual who has been adjudged bankrupt. Section 104 of that Act sets out how the money received by the official assignee from the realisation of the property is to be applied. Ten categories of payments are listed in order of priority. The fifth category consists of various amounts including PAYE, student loan repayments, ACC payments and customs duty. Unincorporated bodies 93 17.5 Each of these amounts has priority ranking immediately after the preferential debts relating to employee claims. 17.6 Although there is no express reference to GST in the Insolvency Act, section 104 is subject to other enactments. Section 42(2)(a) of the GST Act provides that any unpaid GST also ranks immediately after preferential employee claims. Companies in liquidation or receivership 17.7 In relation to a company in liquidation, section 42(2)(b) provides that GST debts have the ranking set out in the Seventh Schedule of the Companies Act 1993. The Schedule lists certain amounts as having priority after employee claims but before amounts under a floating charge or amounts in respect of an unsecured debt. These are GST, PAYE, non-resident withholding and resident withholding tax deductions and customs duty. 17.8 This ranking also applies in the case of the appointment of a receiver. Unincorporated bodies 17.9 Section 42(2)(c) was inserted in 1990 to recognise the situation where the court appoints a receiver to manage the business activities of a partnership, trust or unincorporated society. The GST debts of these entities rank similarly to those of individuals and companies. Issues 17.10 Two issues have arisen in relation to the recovery of GST debts of an unincorporated body: • Paragraph (c) applies only on the appointment of a receiver. If an unincorporated body – say, a partnership – becomes insolvent and a receiver has not been appointed, the only situation in which preferential status for GST could be provided is if the individual partners are adjudged bankrupt. Paragraph (a) applies to individuals, although it is arguable that paragraph (c), specifically enacted to cover unincorporated bodies, creates an adverse inference against the application of paragraph (a). • A mortgagee or other debt holder, as well as a court, may initiate the appointment of a receiver. The current application of section 42(2)(c) to receivers appointed by court order only may, therefore, be unintentionally limited. Part IV: Remedial issues 94 Proposed reform Recovery of GST from individual members 17.11 It is proposed that section 42(2)(a) be amended to confirm the preferential status of GST debts recoverable from individual members of an unincorporated body. 17.12 For partnerships a distinction would be drawn, as in section 82 of the Insolvency Act 1967, between the joint estate and the separate estate of the bankrupt partner. The joint estate would be applied in the first place in satisfaction of the debts due by the bankrupts jointly. The separate estate would be applied to satisfy any shortfall in the joint estate after it has been applied to any debts the partner incurred in his or her non-partnership capacity. Type of receivership 17.13 To ensure that the application of the legislation is not unintentionally limited, the reference to court appointments in section 42(2)(c) should be removed. A general reference to receivers, to encompass any form of appointment, is proposed. A member’s liability for GST Issue 17.14 A member of an unincorporated body is defined in section 57(1) as a partner, a joint venturer, a trustee, or a member of any unincorporated body. 17.15 Inland Revenue has experienced difficulties in recovering unpaid GST from retired trustees. There is an argument that joint and several liability applies only for the period of membership. Therefore on a trustee’s retirement the liability rests with the new or remaining trustee/s. Proposed reform 17.16 The intention of section 57(3) is that a member’s liability is referable to the taxable period/s in which that person was a member of an unincorporated body, and the liability is not extinguished by ceasing to be a member. The Commissioner should, therefore, have recourse for payment to the person acting as trustee when the GST liabilities were first payable. To remove any doubt it is proposed that section 57 be amended to confirm that a member’s liability extends beyond the period of membership for GST payable (including any penalties) during the time the person was a member. 95 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES, LIQUIDATORS AND RECEIVERS Proposed policy • Amend section 58(1A) (specified agent carrying on taxable activity) to include appointments of receivers to control only part of a taxable activity. • Clarify when an agency period terminates. • Allow personal representatives an input tax credit for the GST component of bad debts related to pre-agency period supplies. • Clarify the relationship between section 58(1A) and section 5(2). 18.1 Section 58 provides that the “specified agent” of an “incapacitated person” personally carries on the taxable activity of the incapacitated person during an “agency period”, so has all the obligations and liabilities of a registered person carrying on the taxable activity. Without the section persons making taxable supplies on behalf of others might not be liable to account for GST. 18.2 An incapacitated person is defined as “a registered person who dies, or goes into liquidation or receivership, or becomes bankrupt or incapacitated”. A specified agent is defined as “a person carrying on any taxable activity in a capacity as the agent, personal representative, liquidator, or receiver of an incapacitated person”. 18.3 This chapter deals with four areas where clarifications to section 58 are required: • partial receiverships; • the termination of an agency period; • bad debt deductions; and • the relationship between section 58(1A) and section 5(2). Partial receiverships 18.4 A receiver is appointed in relation to property, rather than in relation to a debtor. Thus a debenture holder may appoint a receiver to administer the assets secured by the debenture. Part IV: Remedial issues 96 18.5 However, section 58(1A) deems a specified agent to be a registered person carrying on the taxable activity of an incapacitated person. This implies that the receiver has control over the entire taxable activity and, therefore, makes the specified agent liable for all GST obligations in relation to a taxable activity, not just those relating to the property which is the subject of the receivership. Termination of agency period 18.6 Section 58(1) defines the “agency period” as: ...the period beginning on the date on which a person becomes entitled to act as a specified agent carrying on a taxable activity in relation to an incapacitated person and ending on the earlier of- (a) The date on which some person other than the incapacitated person or the specified agent is registered in respect of the taxable activity; or (b) The date on which the person ceases to be a specified agent in relation to the incapacitated person: 18.7 When both a receiver and a liquidator are appointed it is not always clear whether the appointment of the liquidator terminates the agency period of the receiver. Continuity of taxable activity 18.8 Section 26 provides relief from bad debts by allowing an input tax credit for the GST component of an amount written off as a bad debt. Because goods or services to which the debt relates would have been supplied to the debtor by the incapacitated person, and the latter is no longer carrying on the taxable activity, it is unclear whether the specified agent is entitled to a deduction under section 26. Relationship between section 58(1A) and section 5(2) 18.9 Section 5(2) provides that if goods that are owned by a debtor are sold by or for a creditor, those goods are deemed to be supplied in the course of the debtor’s taxable activity. 18.10 This provision could conceivably apply to the sale of assets by a receiver, deeming them to be supplied by the debtor, contrary to section 58(1A), which was intended to deem the supply to have been made by the receiver. Personal representatives, liquidators and receivers 97 Proposed reform Partial receiverships 18.11 It is proposed that section 58(1A) be amended to encompass appointments of receivers to control only part of a taxable activity. This will limit the specified agent’s GST obligations to those arising from taxable supplies made in relation to the part of the taxable activity subject to the receivership. Termination of agency period 18.12 This issue will to some extent be resolved by the amendments relating to partial receiverships, since an agency period can relate to the situation in which both a liquidator and a receiver are appointed, with each party having GST obligations in relation to the taxable supplies they make. 18.13 If on liquidation a receiver continues to act as a specified agent in relation to all property, section 58 will apply only to the receiver. Continuity of taxable activity 18.14 In enacting section 58 it was intended that a specified agent be entitled to claim input tax credits on behalf of the incapacitated person for supplies made before the agency period began. In effect the specified agent is acting as an agent for the incapacitated person in respect of pre-agency period supplies, yet acting as a principal in relation to agency period supplies. 47 18.15 To give better effect to the policy intent it is proposed to amend section 26 to allow specified agents to claim input tax credits for pre-agency period supplies. Relationship between section 58(1A) and section 5(2) 18.16 It is arguable that section 58(1A) would override section 5(2), since it is a more specific provision. Therefore assets supplied by a receiver would be deemed to be supplied by the receiver as specified agent, not by the incapacitated person. However, for the avoidance of doubt and to aid clarity, section 58(1A) should be amended to provide that it overrides section 5(2). 47 A specified agent is not personally liable for pre-agency period debts; instead section 42 applies. 98 CHAPTER NINETEEN OTHER ISSUES Proposed policy Termination of a taxable activity • Amend the definition of “taxable activity” so that it includes a premature ending of a taxable activity as well as a successful completion of a taxable activity. Goods imported by agents • Amend the definition of “input tax” to allow an importer who is acting as an agent for a non-resident to claim an input tax credit for any GST levied under section 12. Suspensory loans • Deem the time of supply for suspensory loans to be the time when the loan is made. Vouchers for services • Recognise the value of a voucher redeemable for services when the voucher is acquired. Vouchers as prizes • Allow the value of a voucher with a face value to be deducted from the gross proceeds of a lottery event. 19.1 This chapter looks at a number of other technical issues. Termination of a taxable activity 19.2 Under section 6(2) anything done in connection with the termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. This provision ensures that GST applies to supplies made in completing a taxable activity as well as to supplies made as part of normal trading activities. As discussed in chapter eight (Deregistration), because the completion of a taxable activity by a registered person is regarded as involving a taxable supply, an output tax liability should arise. 19.3 Under section 51(1)(c) a person who carries on a taxable activity does not have to register if the registration threshold is exceeded because of unusual circumstances such as the sale of a substantial capital asset. Other issues 99 19.4 In Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Drummond and Ors 48 the High Court found that the objectors’ forestry activity had ceased earlier than planned for a number of reasons outside the objectors’ control. By satisfying the conditions of section 51(1)(c) the objectors were not required to register for GST. 19.5 The court suggested that an activity is terminated only when it has run its intended full course. A supply made because of a premature conclusion of a business would be made on “cessation” of the activity rather than its “termination”. Therefore the application of section 6(2) may be unintentionally limited to the completion of a taxable activity in the ordinary course of events. 19.6 It is proposed to amend section 6(2) by inserting the word “cessation”, so that the provision applies to both a premature ending of a taxable activity as well as to a successful completion of a taxable activity. Input tax credits for goods imported by agents 19.7 Goods that are imported into New Zealand are subject to GST under section 12. The importer may claim an input tax credit for the GST if the goods were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The Taxation Review Authority in Case T35 49 held that the word “acquired” meant that legal title to the goods had to pass to the importer. This can have adverse consequences for an importer who acts as agent for a principal who is outside New Zealand – for example, for the purposes of consumer warranty agreements with a non-resident manufacturer. 19.8 It is proposed that the definition of “input tax” be amended to allow a GST refund when goods are imported into New Zealand but are not actually acquired by the importer. This would be subject to meeting appropriate record-keeping requirements. Suspensory loans 19.9 The time of supply in respect of a suspensory loan is unclear. A suspensory loan is a loan made by a public authority to encourage certain types of activity. If the conditions under the loan are met, the loan converts into a grant. If the conditions are not met, the loan must be repaid. 19.10 When a loan is made, it is arguable that the recipient is receiving a financial service and, therefore, the supply is exempt. Again, if the conditions under the loan are not fulfilled and the loan must be repaid, no taxable supply occurs. 48 (1998) 18 NZTC 13,745. 49 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,235. Part IV: Remedial issues 100 19.11 Conversely, it is arguable that the expected outcome of the suspensory loan is in substance a grant with conditions attached and, as such, it should be treated as a taxable supply from the outset. 19.12 Both arguments have merit, although it is likely to be more efficient from the taxpayer’s perspective to pay the GST when the loan is granted. Therefore it is proposed to deem the time of supply for suspensory loans to be when they are made and not when they convert into a grant. If a suspensory loan does not convert into a grant, the recipient would be entitled to claim an adjustment for the GST previously returned. Vouchers, stamps and tokens Timing of output tax 19.13 Vouchers, stamps and tokens (vouchers) involve two supplies. The first supply is when they are acquired, and the second when they are redeemed for goods or services. Whether or not a voucher has a face value determines which supply is subject to GST. 19.14 Vouchers with a face value (except postage stamps) are subject to GST at the time of redemption, since section 10(16) disregards the acquisition of vouchers. 50 This avoids double taxation. 19.15 Vouchers without a face value and postage stamps are subject to GST on acquisition. Section 10(17) deems the supply of goods and services resulting from redemption to have a nil value. This also prevents double taxation. Vouchers for services 19.16 The legislation requires that output tax on a progressively redeemable voucher with a face value be returned as the voucher is used. This is because the legislation recognises the value of such vouchers when they are redeemed for goods or services. Since these vouchers can be used many times, the supplier will incur costs in progressively returning GST. 19.17 It is proposed, therefore, to amend section 10 to deem supplies of services in relation to vouchers to occur at the time of acquisition. This is consistent with the existing treatment of postage stamps. 19.18 The existing treatment for the redemption of vouchers for goods will be retained. 50 If the consideration paid for the token exceeds its face value, GST should be returned on the difference between the consideration paid and the face value of the token at the time the token is sold. Other issues 101 Vouchers as prizes 19.19 When goods and services are given away as prizes in a lottery, the lottery organiser may deduct as input tax the GST paid in respect of those prizes. When money is offered as a prize, section 10(14) provides that the prize money may be deducted from the gross proceeds of the lottery event. In this way lotteries offering cash and non-cash prizes are treated equally. 19.20 When a voucher such as a book token is given as a prize, however, the lottery organiser has not paid any GST: the supply on acquisition is disregarded, so the ordinary procedure of claiming input tax credits does not apply. In addition, since vouchers are not money, the lottery organiser cannot rely on section 10(14). 19.21 It is proposed to amend the legislation to correct this anomaly and allow the value of a voucher to be deducted from the gross proceeds of a lottery event. Part V The Future for GST 105 CHAPTER TWENTY TAXING IMPORTED SERVICES 20.1 Unlike imported goods, most imported services are not subject to GST, except for freight and insurance services associated with imported goods. This treatment largely reflects the limited volume of imported services that existed when GST was introduced, as well as the practical difficulties associated with levying and collecting GST on them. At the time GST was introduced, most services, except for transportation services, were consumed in the jurisdictions in which they were produced in view of the legal and technological constraints that either prevented international trade in services or made it uneconomic. 20.2 Since the introduction of GST, however, several developments have promoted a considerable growth in the volume of services being imported into New Zealand. Deregulation of the telecommunications and financial services markets in New Zealand, coupled with rapid advances in communication and computer technology, mean that it is now possible to consume a wide range of services in New Zealand that have been produced offshore. 20.3 This chapter examines the problems created by these developments and some of the possible solutions to those problems that have been tried in other jurisdictions. Problems arising from the current treatment of imported services 20.4 As discussed in chapter one (Introduction), the primary objective of the GST system is to raise tax revenue in a manner that imposes the lowest possible cost on New Zealand as a whole. 20.5 Ideally, the GST system should not affect the decisions of domestic consumers and producers. In practice, however, the absence of GST on imported services does distort consumption and production decisions. 20.6 This absence encourages domestic consumers to substitute imported services that are not subject to GST for domestically produced services that are subject to GST. In other words, it encourages inefficient patterns of consumption by discouraging the consumption of domestically produced services in favour of imported services. 20.7 The absence of GST on imported services also tends to encourage inefficient patterns of production and resource use in New Zealand. In particular, it discourages the domestic production of services, since domestic producers may not be able to pass on the GST cost to consumers, who are able to switch to imported services that are not subject to GST. It also discourages Part V: The future for GST 106 the use of domestically produced services by some New Zealand businesses. Domestic producers who are either unable to claim input tax credits, or are unwilling to incur the compliance costs associated with claiming those credits, will tend to substitute imported services for domestically produced services. 20.8 Some practical examples of these distortions in patterns of consumption, production and resource use are highlighted below. Example 1 20.9 Advances in telecommunications and computer technology have increased the range of imported services available to private individuals in New Zealand. A New Zealand consumer who wants to purchase architectural, legal or other advisory services now faces the choice between purchasing them from domestic suppliers, or from overseas producers who offer to supply them via the Internet. 20.10 If those services are purchased from domestic producers they are subject to GST. By contrast, if they are purchased from offshore suppliers and downloaded via the Internet they are not subject to GST. 20.11 The absence of GST on such imported services distorts patterns of consumption in New Zealand. It does this by lowering the price of those imported services in relation to services produced in New Zealand. This encourages New Zealand consumers to substitute imported architectural and legal services for domestically produced services. The magnitude of this change in the pattern of consumption will depend on the extent to which consumers think those imported services are substitutable for domestically produced services. The greater the degree of substitutability, the greater the shift towards imported services. 20.12 The absence of GST on imported services also distorts patterns of production and resource use in New Zealand. The ability of New Zealand consumers to import such services free of GST prevents New Zealand producers of those services from passing on the full burden of the GST to consumers. This makes it more difficult for those producers to compete in the markets for their products and affects their ability to acquire resources. Example 2 20.13 Advances in technology also mean that it is now possible for New Zealand businesses to import services that in the past would have had to be supplied by domestic producers. A New Zealand financial institution wanting to overhaul its existing software systems now faces a choice between obtaining the necessary services from domestic providers or importing them. Taxing imported services 107 20.14 If the financial institution decides to obtain those services from a New Zealand programmer who is a registered person, GST will be charged on the software development. However, if the services are being used to overhaul the financial institution’s treasury operations, it cannot claim an input tax credit for those services because treasury operations are exempt from GST. By contrast, if the financial institution, assuming it is registered for GST, contracts with a non-resident programmer who performs the services either outside New Zealand or inside New Zealand, the services may not be subject to GST since the supply may be deemed to occur outside New Zealand. 20.15 The absence of GST on imported programming services has the potential to distort the resource use decisions of financial institutions that may need to purchase programming services. In particular, it lowers the price of imported programming services in relation to domestically produced services for those financial institutions that are either unable to claim input tax credits, or are unwilling to incur the additional compliance costs associated with claiming them. 20.16 The absence of GST on imported programming services also distorts patterns of production and resource use in New Zealand. In particular, it means that domestic programmers may not be able to pass on the full burden of the GST to businesses that use their services. This places domestic programmers at a competitive disadvantage in the markets for both their outputs and their inputs. Example 3 20.17 Deregulation of the telecommunications market in New Zealand, when coupled with advances in telecommunications technology, has encouraged the emergence of competition not only from other domestic service providers, but also from international providers offering call-back services. 20.18 New Zealand consumers wanting to place an international call may now choose between domestic service providers and international providers, who once called, will call them back and connect them to an international number. 20.19 The absence of GST on imported call-back telephone services may encourage consumers to substitute imported call-back telephone services for domestically produced services. The extent of this distortion in patterns of consumption depends upon how substitutable New Zealanders consider call- back services to be for domestically produced services. In particular, it will depend on the extent to which consumers must incur additional compliance costs in order to use call-back services. The lower the compliance costs associated with using a call-back service, the greater the potential bias towards using imported rather than domestically produced services. Part V: The future for GST 108 20.20 The absence of GST on imported call-back services would also distort patterns of production and resource use in New Zealand. In order to stay competitive with imported call-back services, New Zealand telecommunications companies would be forced to lower their prices, thereby eroding their ability to pass on the full burden of the GST levied on the international call services they supply to New Zealanders. This means that the GST system would impose a relatively higher rate of tax on the value added by domestic telecommunications companies. This would reduce their ability to compete not only in the market for their products, but also in their ability to purchase resources. Double and non-taxation 20.21 Another important objective of the GST system is to prevent the double taxation of goods and services that are traded between New Zealand and other jurisdictions. 20.22 It is relatively easy to prevent the double taxation of goods. Most jurisdictions, including New Zealand, zero-rate the export of goods and impose GST or VAT on imported goods. It is more difficult, however, to prevent the double taxation of services because the import and export of services may not be accompanied by any physical movement between jurisdictions. 20.23 Double taxation can arise when the supplier’s jurisdiction charges GST or VAT on the basis of the supplier’s place of establishment and the recipient’s jurisdiction taxes according to the recipient’s place of establishment. There are no double tax agreements, as there are for income tax, to determine who has the principal right to impose GST or VAT on a supply of goods or services. Non-taxation can arise when the recipient’s jurisdiction does not tax imports and the supplier’s jurisdiction zero-rates the supply because consumption occurs outside its jurisdiction. 20.24 The OECD is gathering information on internationally traded services that are potentially subject to double taxation and those that are not subject to taxation at all. New Zealand is participating in this research. 20.25 Associated with the taxation of international goods and services is the issue of distinguishing goods from services. This has become topical internationally, because of the increasing ability to send and receive commodities (such as literature, music and video) in a digitised form through the Internet. Differences in definitions of “goods” and “services” can create different tax consequences, especially for those jurisdictions that determine the place of supply according to the nature of the supply, rather than the residence of the supplier. 20.26 Although issues of classification have not so far been a major problem under New Zealand law, the discussion on the treatment of software programs in chapter fifteen (The Treatment of Software) demonstrates that New Zealand is not immune to these problems. Taxing imported services 109 20.27 The Government invites comment on whether digitised commodities should be treated as “goods” or, whether New Zealand should treat them as “services”. Comment is also invited from exporters and importers on any circumstances in which supplies have been potentially subject to double taxation. Compliance and administration costs 20.28 Although the taxation of imported services has the potential to reduce current distortions in patterns of consumption, production and resource use, it also raises some challenging administrative and compliance issues. 20.29 In 1985 the decision not to impose GST on imported services resulted from concerns that the revenue derived from GST on imported services would not exceed the costs incurred by business and the Government in collecting that tax. Most of these costs are involved in the level of enforcement that would be required to impose GST successfully on all services imported by registered and unregistered persons. 20.30 It has been the experience of other jurisdictions, however, that GST or VAT can be successfully imposed on certain types of imported services, particularly telecommunication services. Possible solutions to the problems caused by the non-taxation of imported services are discussed below. Possible solutions Reverse charge 20.31 Some countries, including Canada and the member states of the European Union, apply what is known as a “reverse charge” on imported services. Under a reverse charge system, services imported by a registered person in the furtherance of a taxable activity are deemed to be supplied by that person. The registered person must self-assess GST but can claim an input tax credit to the extent that the services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. A similar obligation is imposed on suppliers of exempt goods and services and in some countries, such as Canada and Switzerland, on private individuals. In these circumstances an input tax credit for the self-assessed GST would not generally be available. 20.32 A reverse charge mechanism has the advantage of reducing, to some degree, production distortions created by the preference exempt suppliers may have for internationally provided services over domestically provided services. 20.33 However, a reverse charge also has a number of disadvantages including whether it can be effectively applied to supplies of imported services to private individuals. A further concern is that the potential absence of invoices or similar documentation could create difficulties in administering a reverse charge. Part V: The future for GST 110 Register offshore non-resident suppliers 20.34 An alternative to using a reverse charge is to change the current place of supply rules so that an obligation to register for GST is imposed on offshore non-residents when they supply services for use in New Zealand. 20.35 As mentioned in chapter nine (Exported Services), in New Zealand the place of supply is determined by reference to the residence of the supplier. In the case of non-residents the test is where the services are physically performed. In other jurisdictions, such as the members of the European Union, the place of supply is determined by reference to the “establishment” of the supplier. These rules are based on the principle that the majority of supplies will be made in the GST or VAT jurisdiction in which the supplier resides. 20.36 These rules do not generally require offshore non-residents to charge GST or VAT when they supply services within the taxing jurisdiction. This could be addressed by introducing a place of supply rule that is based on the effective use of goods or services supplied within the taxing jurisdiction. 20.37 A major difficulty with an effective use test is determining where the service is in fact used. This is generally feasible if the service that is supplied is not transferable from one jurisdiction to another. For example, services in relation to land are less easily transferred to another jurisdiction, whereas services in the nature of, say, insurance, can be effectively used in a number of jurisdictions. 20.38 A test of effective use could be targeted to apply to certain types of imported services, such as telecommunications. Although this may remove some of the difficulties that a general rule may create, it could confuse the general application of the place of supply rules. 20.39 In addition, imposing GST in this manner could raise significant compliance concerns for non-residents liable to charge GST or VAT, and problems for New Zealand in enforcing its taxation laws offshore. Origin principle 20.40 A further theoretically possible solution would be to apply the “origin principle”. Rather than taxing supplies according to their destination (as under the “destination principle” adopted by New Zealand), the origin principle imposes tax according to the origin of supplies, and at the GST or VAT rate of the originating jurisdiction. This means that exports are taxed according to the rate of the jurisdiction of origin, but imports are zero-rated. 20.41 This system of indirect taxation can be used when there is a close concentration of countries with comparable GST or VAT systems. However, the practical considerations necessary to implement an origin principle approach to taxation are prohibitive. This is because to operate under the principle requires the almost identical incidence of the tax to fall equally on all consumers and businesses in all of the participating jurisdictions. Taxing imported services 111 20.42 It is often perceived that the European Union operates under this principle. With respect to supplies to non-registered consumers within the European Union this is generally true, although supplies between businesses are not taxed under this principle. Instead taxation is applied by using a reverse charge mechanism that applies to both services and goods supplied within the European Union. The application of indirect taxation in this manner is not an “origin” system in the strict sense of the word, but is more representative of an attempt to move toward a single internal market. Taxing imported services – conclusions 20.43 The Government is committed to maintaining a broad-based GST. As part of this commitment it is essential to ensure that the international boundaries that determine whether consumption occurs in New Zealand are well defined and accommodate continuing technological and commercial developments. Because the taxation of imported services involves the need to address potential double-taxation and non-taxation, New Zealand would be in a difficult position, as would other countries, if it were to impose reforms unilaterally. As such, the Government is keeping a watching brief on developments in the European Union and the OECD. 20.44 Work is under way in the OECD to determine which international services are likely to be exposed to anomalous taxation consequences, with a view to releasing guidelines for the treatment of supplies made though the Internet and by the telecommunications industry. The Government will consider these developments and will implement these guidelines if they are considered desirable, or when multilateral action is required to improve the effectiveness of the world’s GST or VAT systems. Such reforms will be discussed with interested parties as part of the generic tax policy process. Specific issues for consultation • In what circumstances have exporters and importers found that their supplies of goods and services have been potentially subject to double taxation? • What compliance cost concerns are suppliers of international services currently experiencing? • Should digitised commodities be treated as “goods” or “services”? • Should New Zealand introduce a reverse charge mechanism or other method of taxing imported services? 112 CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE FINANCIAL SERVICES 21.1 Making any specific recommendations concerning the desirability of retaining the present exemption of financial services is a complex matter outside the scope of this review of GST. The Government does, however, propose to undertake a longer-term review of the treatment of financial services. 21.2 Even so, there is an immediate need for the definition of “financial services” to better reflect the policy of excluding transactions involving the supply of money or money substitutes. Consequently, this discussion document contains a number of remedial proposals such as the exclusion of debt collection services and deliverable futures contracts from the definition. The Government welcomes submissions on the proposals in chapter eleven (The Financial Services Exemption) and on any other aspects of the financial services definition that may be causing concern. Taxing value added 21.3 Applying GST to supplies of financial services is difficult because of the complexities involved in identifying and measuring the value that is added by the supply. This is because the added value is often not separately identifiable in the charges made by financial intermediaries (including banks, finance houses, life insurers and fund managers) for the services they supply. 21.4 Amounts charged for supplies of financial services usually consist of a mixture of fees, commissions and interest rate margins. Interest rate margins may include pure interest (which represents the time value of money), a pure risk premium, and cost recovery and fees. 21.5 The value added by a financial institution which should be subject to GST is in cost recovery and fees, less any relevant capital costs. Identifying this component for specific transactions is difficult. 21.6 In the absence of an effective tax on margins, taxing only fees and commissions for financial services could simply result in a change to charging structures. Financial services 113 Current GST treatment of financial services in New Zealand 21.7 Financial services provided in New Zealand are exempt from GST. This means that input tax credits cannot be claimed for the costs of producing such services, and output tax cannot be charged on the sale price. Exported financial services may be zero-rated, meaning input tax credits can be claimed for the costs of producing such services, but tax is charged on the sale price at a zero rate. Effects on financial intermediaries 21.8 The exemption of financial services creates a number of distortions that affect the manner in which financial intermediaries operate. This in turn affects relative prices faced by consumers for financial services. 21.9 International experience has shown that the fact that financial intermediaries cannot claim a large proportion of their input tax credits means that they are likely to prefer imported services and other supplies that do not attract GST. They may also seek to minimise their GST exposure by vertically integrating necessary production functions. 21.10 This behaviour affects the price of financial services. Financial intermediaries that find it difficult to purchase GST-free supplies will attempt to pass on the GST they incur to their customers. However, this exposes them to the risk that the price charged for their financial services is higher than that charged by a competitor. With respect to financial services, the competition arises not only from domestic sources but also from international suppliers that may not face the effects of GST on their purchases. 21.11 Because exemption distorts the choices that financial intermediaries make, the definition of “financial services” in section 3 is designed in such a way that it does not specifically refer to financial institutions, but affects all businesses that supply some form of financial service in New Zealand. 21.12 This boundary between exempt and taxable supplies also creates substantial compliance costs in the form of allocating operating and direct costs between the two types of supply. Effects on consumers 21.13 Exempting financial services also creates distortions in the investment decisions that are made by consumers. From a private consumer's point of view, financial investments tend to be cheaper than investments in other property, such as commercial buildings, because GST is not payable on the former. Businesses, on the other hand, can find that financial investments are more expensive than other forms of investment because the business cannot claim input tax credits. Part V: The future for GST 114 “Tax cascades” 21.14 Exempting financial services also creates what is known as a “tax cascade” if a financial institution passes on the GST cost of its inputs through higher prices. The higher price for the financial service increases the operating costs of the purchaser. If the purchaser is required to charge GST when selling its goods and services this price will also be inflated. The severity of the cascade depends on the number of times exempt financial services are used before a sale to a final consumer takes place. Zero-rating and full-invoicing approaches to taxing financial services 21.15 Zero-rating and full-invoicing are possible alternatives to exemption within the existing GST framework. Zero-rating 21.16 Zero-rating would extend the current treatment of exported financial services to all financial services supplied from or in New Zealand. Input tax credits could be claimed for the costs of producing all financial services, and tax at a zero rate would be charged. 21.17 This approach would eliminate some of the inefficiencies created by exemption and would make domestic suppliers of financial services more competitive with offshore institutions in the New Zealand market. However, zero-rating would be very costly to the Government and could create an incentive for over-investment in the financial sector. It is, therefore, not a realistic option. Full-invoicing 21.18 Under full-invoicing, input tax credits would be claimed for the costs of producing all financial services, and 12.5 percent output tax would be charged on their supply. 21.19 The choice for registered persons between domestic and international sources of finance would be a neutral one because input credits would be available on the cost of obtaining funds domestically. Final consumers, however, would face very strong incentives not to borrow from domestic financial intermediaries. Instead final consumers would be motivated to obtain debt finance offshore. Consequently, domestic financial institutions would be heavily disadvantaged in supplying final consumers. 21.20 In addition, many private investors would be required to register for GST because they would then exceed the GST registration threshold. Interest rates and share prices would increase by 12.5 percent. Financial services 115 21.21 The major difficulties, however, would be in distinguishing capital flows from flows of financial services and determining in all cases where the international boundary lay. Options for taxing the value of financial services 21.22 As noted earlier, the main difficulty in the financial services area is valuing the service. A discussion of options for valuing financial services follows. Taxing fees 21.23 Charging GST on commission and fee income involves the risk of fees and commissions becoming integrated into the general margin for a transaction should that result in a more favourable treatment. Taxing margins 21.24 An alternative form of taxing financial services involves taxing, at the appropriate rate of GST, financial institutions on the wages that they pay and their annual profits. This method of taxation is used in Israel. Rather than imposing VAT on a transaction-by-transaction basis, this form of taxation uses the financial intermediary's annual income tax return. VAT is payable on profit (which is deemed to be the taxable income figure disclosed in the financial intermediary's tax return less any dividends received) plus the amount of wages paid for the year. 21.25 Another method of taxing margins using annual financial statements involves taxing the margin between the revenue earned from supplying financial services and the costs directly attributable to supplying those services. 21.26 Although Israel does not allow financial intermediaries to claim notional input tax credits for any GST incurred in supplying financial services, in theory input tax credits could be allowed under both methods. 21.27 Issues with such a method include the treatment of annual tax losses, how to treat fixed assets (if input tax credits are allowed) and supplies of exported financial services. Cash-flow 21.28 The cash-flow method avoids the problem of identifying the margin on individual transactions, by bringing all cash flows from financial transactions (except those involving a company’s own equity) into the tax net. Transactions with non-residents are ignored (effectively zero-rated) and non- financial transactions are subject to GST in the usual manner. Part V: The future for GST 116 21.29 The mechanism requires the banking system to pay tax on deposits it receives and allows an input tax credit for approved loans. Businesses, conversely, pay tax on loans received and receive credits for repayments. These effects cancel each other out. Repayments of loans are similarly cancelled out by the offsetting reduction in deposits. Interest paid on deposits (credited) offsets most of the interest charged on the loans (tax due), which has the benefit of excluding the time value of money from the tax base. The final tax is effectively the tax rate multiplied by the bank’s margin after deducting its cost of funds. For individual transactions the net effect is the same as if the added value had been separately identified, invoiced and tax paid. 21.30 Under this approach the present value of tax payments would be the same as the standard method of applying GST if no uncertainty existed in the capital markets. To the extent actual returns differed from expected returns, added value would be under-taxed or over-taxed. 21.31 Problems with the cash-flow methods include adjusting for tax-rate changes (including the introduction of the system), the cash-flow implications of taking out a loan (paying tax on the amount drawn down and getting a credit on repayment) and the calculation requirements. The cash-flow method has been developed through work commissioned by the European Union, and further work should identify whether these problems can be overcome. 21.32 The Government is monitoring these developments in the European Union and elsewhere where there has been some movement towards the application of value-added taxes to the supply of financial services.

Tax improvements for business 2 Interest deductions for companies A Government discussion document Hon Bill English Rt Hon Sir William Birch TreasurerMinister of Finance Minister of Revenue Interest deductions for companies; a Government discussion document (Tax improvements for business 2) First published in September 1999 ISBN 0-478-10335-2 PREFACE This discussion document proposes helping companies by completely removing the significant uncertainty surrounding the claiming of interest deductions. It also removes the major compliance costs companies sometimes incur to ensure their interest is deductible. The real beneficiaries are likely to be medium-sized companies, who are often surprised by the detail of present law. This measure will encourage companies to focus their energies on more productive activities that benefit New Zealand, rather than on the minutiae of the tax laws and the need to structure their affairs. The package presented here is an appropriate balancing of increasing certainty, reducing compliance costs and protecting the tax base. Accordingly, some foreign controlled companies may find they are affected by the stronger thin capitalisation cross-border rules proposed. Although this will increase their compliance costs, overall there will still be a significant reduction. We believe this package of proposals will be met with enthusiasm, and we look forward to receiving submissions.

But how much of that interest expenditure can be deducted for tax purposes has long been an area of uncertainty for them, since the law itself often lacks clarity. As a result, companies frequently structure their dealings in such a way as to ensure that the interest expense they incur can be deducted, which leads to increased compliance costs and economic inefficiencies. 1.2 This discussion document sets out proposals for clarifying and simplifying the rules for companies on interest deductibility. These proposals are consistent with the ‘5 steps ahead’ package and with the proposals set out in the companion to this discussion document, Less taxing tax. 1.3 We seek submissions on these proposals as part of the normal policy development process. Background 1.4 This is one of two Government discussion documents dealing with aspects of tax simplification, whether it is a matter of simplifying tax administration, or the law relating to specific areas of taxation. 1.5 The issue of interest deductibility has also arisen in the course of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, itself a simplification measure. The rewrite process began in 1994 with the reordering and renumbering of the Act. Since then, new core provisions have been inserted into the Act, and the rewrite of Parts C, D and E is under way. The aim of the rewrite is to make the legislation more accessible through better structuring, clearer expression, and the use of a ‘plain language’ drafting style as far as possible. 1.6 A necessary part of rewriting the Act is to remove ambiguities of expression and meaning. To do this it is necessary to establish exactly what is intended in certain areas of the law. Interest deductibility is one such area. The proposals 1.7 The discussion document sets out a package of proposals designed to simplify the interest deductibility rules and thus reduce compliance costs for companies, while tightening the thin capitalisation rules to increase their effectiveness. Introduction 2 Summary of proposals Interest incurred by companies is to be fully deductible unless the thin capitalisation or conduit allocation rules apply, in which case they take precedence. This rule is to apply to all companies except qualifying companies and companies that derive exempt income other than exempt dividends. As a complementary measure, the threshold for the thin capitalisation ‘safe harbour’, the debt-to-asset ratio that determines whether companies may be affected by the thin capitalisation rules, is to be lowered from 75 percent to 66 percent. The core rule – that the New Zealand ratio is acceptable if it is less than 110 percent of the worldwide ratio – is unchanged. Foreign investments of New Zealand branches of non-resident companies that do not yield gross income will not be regarded as New Zealand assets for thin capitalisation purposes. 1.8 The Government is examining interest deductibility rules for other taxpayers (qualifying companies, companies that derive exempt income other than exempt dividends, individuals and trusts). There is concern about the proper application of the private and domestic boundary and about the apportionment of expenses incurred to derive exempt income. These concerns may take some time to resolve. 1.9 The private and domestic boundary for companies other than qualifying companies is at present effectively buttressed by the dividend rules. These rules do not apply to the same extent to qualifying companies. 1.10 In the meantime, the advantages of progressing with company interest deductibility rules are such that they should proceed. The eventual rules for other taxpayers should not cause the company rules to be changed. 1.11 The Government invites submissions on the merits of these proposals and on the detailed discussion that led to them. Issues on which submissions are particularly sought are highlighted at the end of each chapter, although this is not intended to limit the scope of the consultation. Introduction 3 SUBMISSIONS The closing date for submissions is 26 November 1999. Submissions should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations and be addressed to: General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON 4 CHAPTER 2 CURRENT LAW 2.1 This chapter briefly sets out the current law in relation to interest deductions, highlighting the various tests taxpayers must pass in order to obtain a deduction, and the major boundaries within the rules. The three limbs 2.2 Excluding specific rules, 1 three general rules govern interest deductibility. According to section DD 1(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994, for interest expense to be deductible it must be: • payable in deriving gross income, or • necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, or • payable by a group company to acquire shares in another group 2 company. 2.3 Essentially, these rules require borrowings to be traced to associated assets or a business or an investment in a group company, so the interest on those borrowings can then be tested for deductibility. Further, amounts that are expenditure under the accrual rules are generally deductible only under these interest deduction rules. The first limb 2.4 Until 1985 the predecessor of the ‘payable in deriving gross income test’ was essentially the test for interest deductibility (excepting group companies – see below). A number of New Zealand and overseas cases have interpreted this test. The key New Zealand cases are set out below. Pacific Rendezvous 2.5 In Pacific Rendezvous 3 the taxpayer, a motel owner, wanted to increase the value of the motel before selling it. The taxpayer borrowed money to finance the expansion of the motel. The new units were rented out, producing gross income. Inland Revenue allowed only 25 percent of the interest expenditure to be deducted for tax purposes. 1 Such as the forestry interest deductibility rule, section DL 1(3)(c). 2 At least 66% owned. 3 (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146(CA). Current law 5 2.6 On appeal, the court held that because all the capital was used to produce gross income, all of the interest expenditure was deductible. The court found that the use of the borrowed funds determines the deductibility of the interest expenditure. The fact that the underlying dominant purpose in borrowing the money was to make capital gains was not material. If all the money has been used to earn gross income, the interest is deductible without further inquiry as to whether any capital gains may also be made. Brierley 2.7 The case Brierley v CIR 4 involved a similar issue. The taxpayer sought an interest deduction for money borrowed to purchase shares in a publicly listed company. The taxpayer received from the company gross income of $15,000, and ‘capital’ (but not exempt) dividends of $451,000. The Commissioner apportioned the interest expenditure between the gross income and the other income. 5 2.8 The Taxation Review Authority confirmed the Commissioner’s assessment. The Court of Appeal held that all the interest expenditure was deductible. All the borrowed funds had been used to derive gross income. The fact that the underlying purpose may have also been to derive ‘capital’ income was not relevant. 2.9 The Commissioner has accepted the decisions of cases like Pacific Rendezvous and Brierley in developing the underlying principles for determining the deductibility of interest expenditure. In Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 3 No. 9, June 1992, the Commissioner stated that the deductibility of interest will depend on whether the borrowed money is used in gaining or producing gross income in the period in which the deduction is claimed, or in the future. Public Trustee 2.10 The Public Trustee v C of T 6 case involved an estate that had assets that produced gross income. The estate was required to pay death duties but did not have sufficient cash to meet the payment. To avoid selling any assets, the trustee borrowed money to fund the payment. 2.11 The court held that the interest expenditure relating to the preservation of the income-earning assets was an allowable deduction. The court found there was a sufficient nexus between the interest expenditure and the income- earning process because the borrowed money was used for the purpose of preserving the income earning capacity of the estate. 4 (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184. 5 Capital gains are neither gross income nor exempt income, even though they are income in an economic sense. 6 \[1938\] NZLR 436. Current law 6 The second limb 2.12 The business test was added in 1987, with effect from 1985. It provides that interest is deductible if it is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. It was added to the interest deductibility tests to coincide with the introduction of the accrual rules. Most expenditure deemed to be incurred in respect of a financial arrangement was deemed to be interest expenditure. Without the addition of the business limb, it was perceived there could be problems in obtaining deductions for expenditure from financial arrangements in some circumstances. 2.13 Discussion continues as to whether and, if so, by how much the second limb extends the ambit of the first limb. The third limb 2.14 Interest incurred by a group company to acquire shares in another group company is deductible. This rule supposedly applies despite the fact that any resultant dividends may be exempt income. 2.15 Groups of companies frequently structure their transactions to utilise this rule to ensure the interest they incur is deductible. For example, assume a New Zealand company borrowed funds for a construction project which had a long lead time. Given the historical doubts that have been raised concerning interest deductibility (see the next chapter) and in order to obtain certainty, the company frequently applied the borrowed funds to subscribe for shares in a wholly owned subsidiary which in turn carried out the project. 7 2.16 Subject to the limits to interest deductibility imposed by the thin capitalisation and conduit rules, corporate taxpayers can and almost always do structure their affairs to ensure that all interest expense that they incur is deductible, albeit while suffering compliance and structuring costs. Boundaries to the current law 2.17 A number of boundaries apply or could apply to interest deductions. With interest deductions, like most areas of income tax law, these boundaries can create both uncertainty and the opportunity for tax avoidance. These uncertainties are discussed in the next chapter. 7 There is now a considerable body of opinion which holds there is no question that in this example, interest on direct borrowings is deductible. Current law 7 Capital gains 2.18 Capital gains are neither gross income nor exempt income, even though they are income in an economic sense. New Zealand case law makes it clear that interest which is associated with the derivation of gross income is fully deductible even if a capital gain is also made. (See, for example, the Brierley case.) Capital expenditure 2.19 The question as to whether interest can constitute capital expenditure and, if so, what are the consequences, has frequently been debated. Under current law this question is clearly not an issue because, even if it is capital expenditure, it is still deductible. This is because the section BD 2(2) capital expenditure prohibition does not apply when the expense is explicitly deductible. The exempt income boundary 2.20 Some company receipts, which are income in an economic sense, are not subject to tax because they are exempt income. Frequently such receipts will constitute gross income of the ultimate shareholders (as will distributed capital gains) when they are passed on to those shareholders. 2.21 In particular, dividends received by a company from wholly owned New Zealand resident subsidiaries and from non-resident companies 8 are generally exempt income as is most income derived by local and regional authorities. Exempt dividends are addressed in this document, but consideration of interest expense and its relationship to other exempt income has been deferred. 2.22 The exempt income expenditure apportionment rule in section BD 2(2)(b) applies to the interest deductibility rules. Thus, at least for interest deductions under the first two limbs of section DD 1(b), apportionment for exempt income may be required depending on the circumstances. 2.23 However, this apportionment rule must be read in context. Given the explicit and unilateral nature of the third limb of the interest deductibility rule, a nonsense would be created if the exempt income rule applied to overturn third limb deductions. There is no doubt as to the intended interpretation – the exempt income apportionment rule is not intended to override third limb deductions. 8 Although these latter dividends are generally subject to a withholding regime known as ‘foreign dividend withholding payments’. Current law 8 The international boundary 2.24 The thin capitalisation rules and conduit interest allocation rules both deal with inbound investment. 9 These rules are intended to have the effect of limiting interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base in circumstances where excess interest expense is being incurred in New Zealand. 2.25 These rules and further cross-border issues are discussed in detail in chapter 6. The private and domestic boundary 2.26 Interest expense incurred on money borrowed to fund private and domestic expenditure, such as a private mortgage, is not deductible under New Zealand law. Concern as to the strength of the boundary between what is and what is not private is the main reason for not proposing more general reform of the interest deductibility rules until this issue has been fully analysed. 2.27 This matter is dealt with in more detail in chapter 8. 9 Investment by non-residents into New Zealand. 9 CHAPTER 3 NEED FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE PRESENT LAW 3.1 This chapter overviews the main problems with the existing law, especially as it relates to business taxpayers. It highlights the compliance costs, uncertainty and economic inefficiencies that can arise as a result of firms structuring their affairs to ensure the interest expense they incur is deductible. Compliance costs and economic inefficiencies 3.2 One of the objectives of taxation is to raise revenue in the most efficient manner possible. An efficient tax system is one that minimises the distortions to economic decision-making, thus minimising the costs to the nation as a whole. Taxation causes businesses, for example, to adopt a less efficient pattern of production than would otherwise exist in the absence of taxation. This re-allocation of resources away from the preferred pattern of production is referred to as a ‘deadweight cost’ of taxation. 3.3 In relation to the interest deductibility rules for business taxpayers, deadweight costs arise because companies allocate resources to restructuring transactions and business operations to obtain a deduction for interest expense. For example, it is common practice to use the group company interest deductibility test to ensure that interest is deductible. The costs for companies of such structuring are not only the costs of complying with the law, but also the move away from a more efficient pattern of production that would exist in the absence of the need to so structure their affairs. The result is a loss of outputs to the taxpayer and to the economy as a whole. Uncertainty 3.4 There is a degree of uncertainty concerning the current tax treatment of interest deductions. It is an area that affects, to some extent, every business in New Zealand. Recent overseas court cases and domestic commentaries on the issue have highlighted this uncertainty. These commentaries include: • the Valabh Committee’s 10 Final Report. • Rewriting the Income Tax Act – Parts C, D and E, a Discussion Document (published in September 1997). • Inland Revenue Rulings Unit’s Interest Deductibility, issues paper no 3 (released in September 1998). 10 The Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, appointed in 1989 and chaired by Mr Arthur Valabh. The Final Report was issued in 1992. Need for clarification of the present law 10 The Valabh Committee’s Final Report 3.5 This report questioned whether it is possible to restrict company interest deductibility effectively. It also suggested that the tracing rules on which the present interest deductibility rules are based are fundamentally flawed because of the fungibility of debt and equity. This is further discussed in chapter 5. 3.6 The Valabh Committee’s report predates the thin capitalisation and conduit taxation rules as well as the interest deductibility issues paper. The subsequent introduction of the thin capitalisation and conduit rules (which are based on pro rata apportionment) is consistent with the Valabh Committee’s views. Rewriting the Income Tax Act – Parts C, D and E, a Discussion Document 3.7 This discussion document raised questions on whether interest is deductible in relation to funds borrowed to finance capital expenditure. The Income Tax Act contains a rule that generally prohibits the deduction of expenditure of a capital nature. The discussion document suggested that making interest deductions subject to this rule would not have any practical impact. This suggestion caused a significant taxpayer reaction. 3.8 After analysing the submissions, and given recent overseas developments, the Government believes the law should be clarified so as to provide further certainty to taxpayers. Interest Deductibility, Issues Paper no 3 3.9 This paper is a precursor to a proposed draft Inland Revenue public ruling. It analysed, under current law, relevant (and sometimes conflicting) scenarios in an attempt to find a consistent set of rules for interest deductibility. It considered: the deductibility of interest in relation to money borrowed and used: • By a company to repurchase shares. • By a company to pay dividends. • By a partnership to return capital contributions. • By a partnership to pay profits to partners. • By any taxpayer to pay income tax and use-of-money interest. • By a company to make a payment to share in a company’s losses (a ‘subvention payment). 11 11 At page 3. Need for clarification of the present law 11 3.10 The paper calls these borrowings ‘indirect borrowings’ because ‘the funds are not used directly in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income or not used directly in the taxpayer’s business which is carried on for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s income.’ 12 It concluded that so long as the taxpayer had net assets, interest incurred on these indirect borrowings is deductible, subject to an apportionment based on asset value when the taxpayer also holds assets that produce exempt income, or are private or domestic in nature. 3.11 The paper also raised the issue of refinancing of debt but did not deal with it in detail. It suggested that interest on any refinanced debt should be dealt with in the same way as indirect borrowings, regardless of the original purpose of the original debt. 3.12 The paper’s interpretation of the current law, and in particular the suggestion on refinanced debt, differs from the interpretation of many practitioners on what the law is and from what past practice has been. The interpretation has no authority until (and unless) Inland Revenue formalises it by issuing a ruling. Overseas cases 3.13 Recent overseas court cases have not helped to clarify the law in New Zealand. Following the decisions in Steele v FC of T 13 (the Federal Court decision, which has now been overturned by the High Court) Wharf Properties Ltd v Commr of Inland Revenue of Hong Kong, 14 it was unclear whether there is a new principle that interest deductions are not available until income is derived, or whether the cases were simply decisions on the facts. 3.14 In the Australian case of Steele the Federal Court found that a business had not commenced. Given the explicit language of the decision, however, it may have been difficult to accept that the result would have been different had the business commenced. Since the taxpayer won the appeal, this problem does not arise. Steele, as eventually decided, now supports the argument that, for Australian tax purposes and in appropriate circumstances, interest expense that relates to capital projects is deductible. 3.15 The Hong Kong legislation under which Wharf Properties was decided differs from New Zealand’s in that its capital prohibition explicitly overrides its interest deduction provision. Consequently, it is not likely that this decision would be followed by our courts. Submission point 3.16 Is reform of the interest deductibility rules for companies necessary? 12 At page 3. 13 (1997) 35 ATR (1997) and \[1999\] ITCA 7. 14 \[1997\] BTC 173. 12 CHAPTER 4 CONCEPTS UNDERLYING INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY 4.1 How should interest expense incurred by taxpayers be treated in principle? Should all interest expense be deductible for income tax purposes, or should deductions be restricted to certain types of interest expense? This chapter discusses these fundamental issues for the purpose of determining whether there is an ‘in principle’ case for restricting deductions to certain types of interest expense. 4.2 In reforming the rules governing the deductibility of interest expenditure, the Government aims to improve both the efficiency and the equity of the tax system. Interest deductibility under a comprehensive income tax 4.3 Under a comprehensive taxation system, taxpayers should be allowed to deduct all interest expenditure as it accrues, without needing to establish their purpose in incurring the debt. This was illustrated by the Valabh Committee in its Final Report. 15 Assume that a taxpayer’s only wealth is the right to a payment of $121 payable in two years’ time and that the market rate of interest is 10%. This implies that the payment is worth $100 at the beginning of year 1 and $110 at the end of that year. To finance, say, $10 of consumption in year 1, the taxpayer borrows that sum at the beginning of year 1 at an interest rate of 10%. Assuming that actual consumption in year 1 is $10, the taxpayer’s Haig-Simons income in that year is $10 plus the change in the taxpayer’s wealth. Wealth at the beginning of year 1 was $100. At the end of the year it is the value of the asset of $110 less the value of the debt outstanding of $11 (i.e. principal of $10 plus interest of $1), giving wealth of $99. Hence, the change in wealth over the year is -$1. Haig-Simons income in year 1 is therefore consumption of $10 less the wealth change of $1, giving income of $9. Now consider how income for tax purposes would need to be defined to achieve the same result. The taxpayer’s only source of income is the income accruing on the payment due. In year 1, this is $10. To match the taxpayer’s Haig-Simons income of $9, a deduction would need to be allowed for the taxpayer’s interest expense of $1. 15 At page 61. Concepts underlying interest deductibility 13 4.4 This conceptual analysis suggests that where all accretions in wealth are taxed (that is, Haig-Simons income), all interest, including private and domestic interest, should be deductible. For various practical and policy reasons, however, it is unlikely that all accretions in wealth will ever be subject to income tax. Interest deductibility given current New Zealand law 4.5 New Zealand’s income tax rules are not comprehensive. Assets that generate a mixture of ‘non-taxable gains’ 16 and gross income are taxed more lightly than assets that generate only gross income. 17 Other assets, such as private dwellings, are outside the tax base altogether. Accordingly, it does not automatically follow that the ‘first best’ tax treatment of interest expenditure is the best approach in practice. Over-investment in tax-preferred assets as a result of uneven taxation 4.6 Uneven taxation of returns to different investments encourages over- investment in more lightly taxed assets. For example, suppose there are two equally risky assets in the economy. Returns to asset A are taxed at 50 percent and returns to asset B are taxed at 30 percent. The opportunity cost of capital – the after-tax amount that would otherwise be earned by investing in a bank account – is, say, 5 percent. As long as investors have sufficient capital, they will acquire assets A and B and, therefore, at least conceptually, increase the price of both A and B, to the point where the after-tax return to both assets is 5 percent. At this point the pre-tax rate of return to asset A is 10 percent and the pre-tax rate of return to asset B is 7 percent. 4.7 National income – to which both the tax paid return and the tax contribute – would be higher if the last dollar invested in asset B was instead invested in asset A. This shortfall in national income would not have occurred if all gains were taxed at the same rate or in the absence of tax, since in either case investors seeking to equalise after-tax rates of return to alternative investments would, in the process, have automatically equated before-tax rates of return. Offsetting over-investment by denying interest deductions 4.8 It is often argued that restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenditure may mute the incentive provided by the differing effective tax rates, by making it less attractive to borrow to invest in tax-preferred assets. For instance, to the extent that investment in rental housing might be viewed as being tax-preferred because ‘capital gains’ are not gross income, limits on the deductibility of interest expenditure may restrict over-investment in rental housing. 16 For example, capital gains. 17 For example, a bank deposit. Concepts underlying interest deductibility 14 4.9 In practice, however, restricting deductions for interest expenditure will only reduce investment in tax-preferred assets if investors do not have enough of their own money to buy these assets. Further distortions caused by progressive tax rates 4.10 In a system with progressive tax rates we would expect to see high-rate taxpayers preferring lightly taxed (or un-taxed) assets, since the tax preference gives a greater tax saving to them than to low-rate taxpayers. They will continue to invest in these assets until the return from them is driven down to be equal to the return available on fully taxed assets. This can be illustrated using an example adapted from the Valabh Committee’s Final Report. 18 Assume that • fully-taxed assets produce a pre-tax rate of return of 10% and that this is also the pre-tax rate of interest; • there are two tax rates – 30% and 20%; and • returns from a particular asset are unexpectedly made tax exempt. Once the exemption is introduced, all investors but particularly the high-rate taxpayers will be induced to invest in the exempt asset. By forcing up the price of the asset, the cost of inputs, etc and therefore forcing down returns, the rate of return on the exempt asset will fall. If the high-rate taxpayers are the marginal investors, the rate of return on the exempt asset will fall to 7%. At that point, there is no incentive for high-rate taxpayers to invest further in the asset, whether or not they obtain a deduction for interest on borrowings to invest in the asset. Similarly, there is no incentive for low-rate taxpayers to invest in the asset since they can obtain an 8% post-tax rate of return on the fully- taxed asset. Hence, restrictions on interest deductibility would not achieve anything, and would not reduce the investment in the exempt asset. Where, however, equity-financed investment by high-rate taxpayers is insufficient to drive the rate of return down to 7%, the low-rate taxpayers will be the marginal investors and the rate of return on the exempt asset will settle at 8%. If there are no restrictions on interest deductibility, then high-rate taxpayers will have an incentive to borrow to invest in the exempt asset since their post-tax cost of borrowing is 7% and the rate of return on the exempt asset is 8%. The rate of return on the exempt asset will then be driven down to 7% because of the additional debt-financed investment by high-rate taxpayers. In the process, the low-rate taxpayers will be induced to dispose of their exempt assets because they can obtain a higher rate of return (8%) on the full-taxed asset. Overall, the aggregate investment in the exempt asset will be increased, since this is what caused the rate of return to fall from 8% to 7%. In this case, therefore, allowing an interest deduction for investment in the exempt asset will increase aggregate investment in the asset. 18 Pages 64-65. Concepts underlying interest deductibility 15 Non-monetary benefits 4.11 Personal assets such as owner-occupied housing differ from business assets in that they generate both monetary returns (capital gains) and non-monetary returns (for example, the benefits of home ownership), neither of which is taxed. Indeed, with many personal assets there is usually no prospect of a monetary return. For example, most cars are sold at a loss. 4.12 Because none of the returns on these personal assets are taxed, the size of the tax preference on these assets is larger than on those assets that return a mix of taxed and untaxed income. Not only is the preference received larger, but because there is no taxable element, there is no need to apportion interest between the taxed and untaxed amounts in the event of interest deductibility restrictions. These factors combine to make interest deduction restrictions an effective and low-cost mechanism for reducing over-investment in these assets. Submission points 4.13 This chapter suggests that, conceptually, an argument can be made that all interest should be deductible under a comprehensive tax system. However, because New Zealand does not have a comprehensive tax system, the situation is far less clear. 4.14 For example, the argument that denying interest deductibility can ameliorate any incentive to over-invest in tax-preferred assets depends on the market impact of substitutable equity financed investment. In practice this will be difficult to determine. 4.15 However, it seems that for assets where no part of the return constitutes gross income (such as private house or car ownership) the case for denying interest deductibility is stronger. 4.16 Therefore the approach to interest deductibility rests on various practical aspects that impinge on efficiency and equity, in particular: • the implications of money being fungible; • the compliance costs of trying to limit interest deductions; and • the effects of uncertainty when the law is unclear. 16 CHAPTER 5 METHODS OF RESTRICTING INTEREST DEDUCTIBILITY 5.1 Interest deductibility restrictions could be imposed in a number of ways. This chapter examines three possible methods of doing so and the next chapter considers the reasons such restrictions might be appropriate. Tracing rules 5.2 The current rules dealing with interest deductions can be described as adopting a tracing approach. This involves identifying what money has been borrowed by a taxpayer and determining how that money has been applied. Interest expense is deductible to the extent funds have been used to produce gross income or in carrying on a business, but is not deductible otherwise. 19 5.3 There are two problems with the tracing approach: • Particularly with larger taxpayers (and especially for corporate groups with layers of companies), it is just not possible to trace the use to which borrowed funds are put. • When it is possible to trace the use to which borrowed funds are put, the rule is often arbitrary and may produce entirely different results for taxpayers with identical portfolios and financing arrangements. The practical outcome is that the tracing approach ‘bites’ only with respect to taxpayers who do not know how to, or cannot, plan around it. For those taxpayers who can plan around the tracing rules, the present legislation merely creates greater compliance costs. The difficulty of tracing how money has been spent 5.4 The Tax Education Office offered the following observations on the practicality of tracing rules: 20 As a practical matter, there are of course real difficulties in ‘tracing’ borrowed funds for many taxpayers. This is because many taxpayers (particularly companies) operate bank accounts in which on any given day funds come in from a number of sources and go out to a number of sources. As an operational matter accounts of this type are frequently operated on the basis that money is fungible, i.e. it does not matter which money is used for what, the key is that the overall balance is in line with the taxpayer’s commercial guidelines. If borrowed money is placed in an account of this type, it may be difficult or impossible to ‘trace’ how the borrowed money is applied. 19 Except under the group company interest deductibility test, which arguably still requires tracing. 20 TEO Newsletter No 103, 23 June 1995. Methods of restricting interest deductibility 17 5.5 Suppose, for instance, that on the same day that borrowed funds of $100 are deposited in a bank account, $400 from other sources is also deposited. The next day, five amounts of $100 are withdrawn, four of which are applied to purposes that would enable an interest deduction, and one of which would not. It is just not possible to trace the use of the borrowed funds in this example. 21 It seems to be just as difficult to trace the use of funds through a large group of companies. Inequitable results 5.6 When tracing is possible, it may have inequitable results, at least to the extent that taxpayers do not take advantage of the usually straightforward opportunities that are available to plan around tracing rules (albeit at a cost). 5.7 Consider, for example, a couple who entered into a loan of $100,000 to buy their residence, which is valued at $100,000. Interest paid on the mortgage would not, of course, satisfy any of the deductibility tests. Now suppose they win $100,000 in Lotto and take either of two courses of action: athey repay $50,000 of their loan and buy $50,000 worth of shares in a listed company; or bthey repay the loan in full, then borrow (using their house as security) $50,000 with which they purchase shares in a listed company. 5.8 Under either approach the couple ends up with a ‘portfolio’ worth $150,000, comprising a house worth $100,000 and shares worth $50,000, which is financed with $100,000 ‘equity’ 22 and $50,000 debt. However, the two approaches have different tax consequences: • Under approach (a), none of the interest expenditure on the remaining loan balance of $50,000 is tax-deductible: the purpose for which the money was borrowed was to acquire the house, which does not produce gross income. 23 • But under approach (b), all of the interest on the new loan of $50,000 is tax-deductible: the purpose for which the money was borrowed was to acquire the shares, which does produce gross income. 21 An old case in England, Clayton’s Case \[(1816) 1 Mer 572\] provides authority that for accounts such as in this example a FIFO basis of applying receipts against withdrawals is appropriate. The New Zealand courts have accepted this rule (Bank of New Zealand v Development Finance Corporation of New Zealand \[1988\] 1 NZLR 495 (CA) and Hotdip Galvanisers (Christchurch) Ltd (in liq) & ANOR v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,679). This is clearly an arbitrary rule. 22 That is, the individual’s own money. 23 See TRA case H10 (1986) 8 NZTC 160 for this fact situation. Methods of restricting interest deductibility 18 5.9 Another example is that of a couple who live in an equity-financed house worth $100,000 and own a fully debt-financed rental property, also worth $100,000. Interest on the loan is fully tax deductible. They decide to move into the rental property and instead rent out their former residence. As a consequence, the interest on the loan is no longer tax-deductible. 5.10 Both before and after the move, the couple have a portfolio worth $200,000, half of which generates gross income. This is financed with $100,000 debt and $100,000 equity. Before moving, they are able to deduct all their interest expenditure; after moving, none of their interest expenditure would be deductible. 24 Stacking rules 5.11 The idea behind stacking rules is quite simple – they ‘order’ income and expenditure so as to provide a deduction for interest only where there is sufficient income or assets to satisfy the test. Stacking rules can follow two broad approaches: • Under the first type of stacking rule, interest expenditure would be deductible only to the extent it exceeded deemed ‘income’ from assets outside the taxation base (for example, notional rent or the non- monetary benefit from the owner-occupied house), or the debt outstanding exceeded the value of assets outside the tax base (for example, the value of the owner-occupied house). • Under the second type of stacking rule, all interest expenditure would be deductible to the extent it did not exceed gross income, or the debt did not exceed the value of assets inside the tax base. 5.12 The problem with the first type of stacking rule is that it too can create perverse results. Consider a taxpayer who owns a fully equity-financed exempt asset (for example, a private house) worth $200,000 and who wishes to borrow money at a 5 percent interest rate to acquire a debenture which costs $50,000 and generates a rate of return of 6 percent. The tax rate is 33 percent. Under the first type of stacking rule, interest will not be deductible on the borrowed funds (because the notional rent would exceed the interest expense, or the debt would be less than the value of the house). 5.13 The second type of stacking rule also has problems in practice. In particular, it may lead to inequitable outcomes when some sources of income, such as income from life insurance and superannuation products, are not attributed to taxpayers even though tax has been paid. Taxpayers earning income from these sources will be disadvantaged compared with taxpayers who save through equities and financial arrangements if the value of, or the income from, the life insurance and superannuation products is not included in the interest deductibility calculation. 24 See TRA cases N63 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,483 and R8 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,049 for similar fact situations. Methods of restricting interest deductibility 19 5.14 Further, to the extent a taxpayer’s debt is less than the value of that taxpayer’s assets that are inside the tax base (or the interest expense is less than gross income), the taxpayer receives an incentive (the tax deduction) to borrow, even if the funds are used to acquire or enhance non-taxable assets (for example, to trade up the dwelling). This could result in a misallocation of assets. Pro rata allocation rules 5.15 Two types of ‘pro rata’ allocation rules appear to be possible: • Under the first type of pro rata rule, taxpayers would be permitted to deduct a percentage of their interest expense equal to the ratio of gross income to total income. 25 • Under the second type of pro rata rule, taxpayers would be permitted to deduct a percentage of their interest expenditure equal to the ratio of assets within the tax base to total assets. 5.16 Pro rata rules avoid some of the problems associated with tracing rules by explicitly dealing with the issue related to the fungibility of money – taxpayers cannot avoid the pro rata rules by judiciously ensuring borrowed funds are matched against assets that produce gross income. These rules also present problems, however, when it comes to implementation since: • The appropriate measure of ‘total income’ is economic income. However, there are obvious difficulties associated with accurately measuring economic income from all assets and, in particular, the benefits derived from the ownership of private assets (which is a key factor in not taxing economic income). • A similar problem arises in determining asset values. • Most assets return a mixture of gross and non-taxable income. • Complex consolidation rules would be required to counter taxpayers’ incentives to segregate in separate entities assets which do not produce gross income from assets which do. 25 In this context, total income could include capital gains, exempt income and notional income (for example, the benefits from owning your own house). Methods of restricting interest deductibility 20 5.17 Pro rata rules are in many ways similar to stacking rules and can create similar inequitable results. 5.18 Both the thin capitalisation and conduit interest allocation rules use the pro rata method despite these problems. The Government has accepted that in these circumstances the disadvantages are not sufficient to rule out the use of the pro rata rule. Taxpayers seem to have accepted this. Submission points 5.19 None of these possible allocation rules for restricting interest deductions is problem-free. This means a trade-off must be made between the benefits arising from denying interest deductions and the potential problems arising from restrictions on interest deductions. In the end, however, any restrictions the Government places on interest deductions are likely to be by way of one or a combination of the rules discussed above. 5.20 In the New Zealand corporate environment, where there are frequently layers of companies, any apportionment rule will have to use consolidation to be effective. This eliminates tracing as a viable option and leaves stacking or pro rata allocation. Of these choices, pro rata allocation seems to be generally the more appropriate because, although it is still arbitrary, it better reflects the economic reality of the position of the company or group of companies. 5.21 This leaves the question of interest deductibility to be decided on a case-by- case basis, taking into account the strength of the reason for non- deductibility, the question of whether an appropriate rule can be devised, and the compliance costs of imposing such a rule. 21 CHAPTER 6 THE DESIRABILITY OF APPORTIONING COMPANY INTEREST EXPENSE 6.1 It might be perceived in a variety of circumstances that it could be appropriate to subject companies’ interest expense to apportionment or allocation rules. These include cases where: • Capital gains are derived that are not taxed. • The interest is arguably capital expenditure. • Exempt dividends are derived. • Non-residents invest into or through New Zealand companies (to ensure the interest expense borne by the New Zealand tax base is appropriate to the circumstances). Capital gains 6.2 As illustrated in chapter 2, New Zealand does not require apportionment of interest expense when a capital gain is derived, so long as gross income is also derived. Chapter 4 indicates that it is sometimes argued that because capital gains are not gross income, the overall cost of the tax system (that is, economic distortions) may be reduced if expenses incurred in deriving them were not deductible. However, it then goes on to suggest that this depends on the impact of equity financed investment, which will be difficult, if not impossible, to determine. 6.3 If it were decided, however, that it is desirable to deny interest deductions on money borrowed which is used to generate capital gains, doing so would not be easy to achieve. The associated problems include: • Some form of apportionment based on income would be required. • The compliance cost of annual valuation to ascertain unrealised holding gains would be large. • If annual unrealised gains did not form the basis of apportionment, it would have to be on realisation (possibly with retrospective adjustment to prior years’ interest expense). • Consolidation would be required to prevent interest expense being distanced from the assets that could yield the gain. • Capital losses would have to be dealt with. The desirability of apportioning company interest expense 22 6.4 The hurdles imposed by the technical problems and the associated compliance costs suggest it will be impracticable to develop a rule. Further, there is no evidence that any rule is likely to lead to more efficient and equitable outcomes. Interest as capital expenditure 6.5 From an economic perspective it can be argued that interest incurred is not capital — it does not add to the value of whatever asset it finances. The frequently cited example is that of interest being incurred while a hotel is being built. The value of the hotel does not increase merely because it is debt funded rather than equity funded. Exempt income 6.6 The group companies interest deductibility rule excepted, apportionment of interest expense is required under the Income Tax Act when it relates to the derivation of exempt income. There are two main sources of exempt income for companies: • dividends from wholly owned group companies; and • dividends from ownership interests in foreign companies. 6.7 Other income can also be exempt (for example, income derived by a charity or most income of a local authority). Consideration of interest expense that relates to these types of exempt income is beyond the scope of this discussion document. 6.8 Again, apportionment of interest is only relevant when taxpayers need to borrow. Taxpayers may have sufficient equity to undertake investments that yield exempt income without borrowing. Dividends from wholly owned group companies 6.9 Under current New Zealand tax law, dividends from wholly owned group companies are exempt income. In the early 1990s the general inter-corporate dividend exemption was limited to dividends from wholly owned group companies. 6.10 This reduced the relevance of the group companies interest deductibility rule to the cost of financing shares in wholly owned subsidiaries (and to certain foreign companies – see the next page). However, its current importance to taxpayers should not be understated. The desirability of apportioning company interest expense 23 6.11 From an economic perspective, a group of wholly owned companies can be regarded as one economic entity. Under such an analysis, all intra-group transactions (such as the payment of intra-group dividends) can be ignored. 26 The presumption is then made that the group’s third party expenditure is incurred to derive the group’s income. If all this income is gross income (intra-group transactions, especially dividends, having been eliminated), all related expenditure should be deductible. 6.12 Therefore there is no reason to restrict interest deductibility to the extent it is incurred to derive exempt dividends from New Zealand-resident wholly owned group companies, so long as the income of those companies is gross income. This logic provides the rationale for the current group companies interest deductibility rule and confirms that in these circumstances apportionment is not required. Dividends from foreign companies 6.13 The other significant source of exempt income is dividends received by a New Zealand company from a foreign company. In a number of cases the underlying income is brought into the New Zealand tax base through the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund rules. However, because any resultant impost on companies generally results in withholding payment account credits, it may loosely be regarded as also being exempt income. 6.14 The CFC rules and, so long as the investment is a non-portfolio investment, foreign dividend withholding payment rules generally allow credits for underlying tax. These credits cause an examination of associated interest expense to be relevant. 6.15 The complex interaction of the various groups of outbound investment rules and New Zealand’s expense deductibility rules is best illustrated by example. The examples in the Appendix indicate that when foreign tax credits (actual or deemed) are being claimed and the overseas income is not being distributed to shareholders, there might be inappropriate incentives to locate interest expense in New Zealand. 6.16 In principle, New Zealand would be better off if an interest allocation rule discouraged overallocation of interest expense to the New Zealand tax base. A rule could be designed to ensure that New Zealand companies and their CFCs each incurred an ‘appropriate’ amount of the overall interest expense. Consolidation of all entities associated with each New Zealand company would be required to ensure any apportionment rule could not be readily circumvented. 26 Obviously for tax purposes they are not ignored, except for the dividends (unless the consolidation rules are used). The desirability of apportioning company interest expense 24 6.17 The conduit interest allocation rules, which do rely on consolidation, could be modified to fill this role. It might be difficult, however, to target them to situations where foreign tax credits (actual or deemed) are being claimed and the overseas income is not being distributed to the shareholders. 6.18 The issue is whether such a rule would be in New Zealand’s best interests, given the compliance costs involved and its possibly arbitrary nature. We have significant doubts that such a rule could reasonably be imposed on many New Zealand owned companies. Further, an interest allocation rule could be perceived as clawing back the advantages yielded by the underlying foreign tax credit rules. Considerable work would have to be undertaken before such a rule could be seriously considered and, at this stage, the Government has other priorities. Non-residents investing into, or through, New Zealand companies 6.19 New Zealand has perceived that there is a need to ensure that entities at least partially owned by non-residents do not inappropriately load interest expense against the New Zealand tax base. There are two sets of rules that are intended to prevent this. These are the: • thin capitalisation rules; and • conduit interest allocation rules. 6.20 These are detailed below. Thin capitalisation rules 6.21 The thin capitalisation rules were enacted in December 1995, to complement the transfer pricing 27 and branch income and expense apportionment 28 rules. Their policy aim is to prevent non-resident controlled groups allocating excessive debt to their New Zealand operations, relative to their worldwide operations. 6.22 New Zealand’s tax rules, in common with rules internationally, create a bias for non-residents to invest into New Zealand by way of debt rather than equity. The thin capitalisation rules, by placing a cap on the amount of interest deductions available in New Zealand, limit the extent to which the tax bias will determine a non-resident’s form of investment into the country. 27 Section GD 13. 28 Section FB 2. The desirability of apportioning company interest expense 25 6.23 The thin capitalisation rules are based on ‘pro rata’ allocation rules and effectively require a consolidation of the New Zealand entities and of the worldwide entities controlled by a non-resident. They work by comparing the debt-to-asset ratio of the New Zealand entities to that of the ‘controller’s’ worldwide debt-to-asset ratio. If the New Zealand ratio is less than 110 percent of the worldwide ratio the apportionment rules are not triggered. 6.24 As a means of reducing compliance costs, taxpayers are not subject to the thin capitalisation rules if the New Zealand group’s debt is less than 75 percent of its assets. This is known as the ‘safe harbour’. 6.25 The effect of the rules has become a test of whether a taxpayer’s debt is below what is perceived by taxpayers to be the ‘acceptable’ (and arbitrary) 75 percent threshold, rather than the more appropriate question of whether an excessive amount of a worldwide group’s debt has been allocated to New Zealand. 6.26 If New Zealand is to move toward freer deductibility of interest expense, the thin capitalisation rules will play an important role in ensuring that non- residents cannot deduct interest expense that has no real connection with New Zealand. 6.27 The fungibility of debt and equity can make it difficult to trace whether particular debt has been applied to New Zealand operations. For this reason, the role of the thin capitalisation rules become more important, to prevent the misallocation of debt to New Zealand. Because the thin capitalisation rules are based on the pro rata allocation method they explicitly address fungibility of debt and equity. The safe harbour 6.28 To ensure that the thin capitalisation rules are sufficiently robust in light of the interest deductibility proposals it is proposed that 66 percent be the thin capitalisation safe harbour. 6.29 The 75 percent safe harbour threshold was set conservatively. It was intended to eliminate most companies from the practical effect of the rules based on debt levels at that time. However, it was not intended to become the de facto thin capitalisation test, or to signal that the Government considered 75 percent to be the appropriate level of debt for New Zealand operations. 6.30 Decreasing the safe harbour to 66 percent would force more companies to meet the primary policy test of the thin capitalisation rules (the 110 percent test). Although this might increase compliance costs for some companies, however, 66 percent is a conservative threshold – it is higher than the commercially normal level of debt for non-finance sector companies operating in New Zealand. The desirability of apportioning company interest expense 26 6.31 In other countries the trend has been towards lower safe harbour thresholds. For example, Australia has reduced its threshold from 75 percent to 66 percent with effect from the 1997-98 income year. 29 The recent Canadian business taxation review has recommended reducing Canada’s safe harbour threshold from 75 percent to 66 percent. The threshold in the United States is 60 percent. A reduction in the New Zealand safe harbour threshold would, therefore, not be out of line with comparable overseas countries. 6.32 Reducing the safe harbour threshold to 66 percent would bring it into line with the threshold for the conduit interest allocation rules. This may allow some of the complexities in the conduit interest allocation rules to be removed. New Zealand assets 6.33 A particular quirk of the present system is that it regards all assets of a New Zealand entity as being New Zealand assets, even though some of those assets might be outside the New Zealand tax base. For example, the New Zealand branch of a non-resident company might be ‘allocated’ investments in companies in other countries. Although this would increase the quantum of assets regarded by the thin capitalisation rules as being New Zealand assets, and therefore the borrowing capacity of the branch, no income from these investments would be subject to New Zealand tax under New Zealand and international tax rules. 6.34 An option would be to amend the thin capitalisation rules so that these branch assets are not regarded as New Zealand assets. The conduit taxation rules 6.35 ‘Conduit’ investment is investment by a non-resident into a foreign company with the investment being channelled through a New Zealand subsidiary. 6.36 New Zealand imposes tax on the worldwide income of the New Zealand subsidiary, which can include the income of the foreign subsidiary, even though the foreign subsidiary (and hence its income) is ultimately ‘owned’ by the foreign investor. The term ‘conduit taxation’ is used to refer to this taxation by New Zealand of the foreign income derived by a New Zealand company on behalf of its non-resident shareholders. 6.37 Key features of the conduit rules include: • The taxation of a New Zealand company on income derived from certain foreign companies is relieved, to the extent the company is owned by non-resident shareholders. 29 Albeit, at this stage, it only deals with debt from ‘foreign controllers’. The desirability of apportioning company interest expense 27 • A pro rata based interest allocation rule allocates interest between the New Zealand company and the foreign companies on the basis of debt- to-asset ratios. This rule applies to the extent conduit relief does, or could, apply. Again, consolidation of the various entities is required. 6.38 With the exception of amendments that might be made to align the conduit interest allocation rules with the proposed reduced thin capitalisation threshold, the Government does not propose any changes to the conduit rules. Compliance costs 6.39 These two sets of rules help to ensure that when non-residents are involved, an appropriate amount of New Zealand taxation is paid. They focus on the measurement of New Zealand source income and test its appropriateness. Although it is acknowledged that both sets of rules are compliance cost intensive, they are both targeted at entities which have some non-resident ownership. Therefore a certain level of skills and capability can be presumed. 6.40 Further, it must be remembered that the conduit rules offer taxpayers tax relief. The conduit interest allocation rule, although compliance cost intensive, is regarded as a necessary buttress to the conduit rules. Submission points 6.41 The analysis above concludes that interest apportionment is not appropriate when: • Capital gains are also derived. • Interest could be regarded as capital expenditure. • Or exempt dividends are derived from wholly owned New Zealand companies. 6.42 Although interest apportionment might conceptually be desirable where there is outbound investment 30 that attracts foreign tax credits, such rules would be difficult to design and cumbersome. It is possible that any benefit would be offset by the economic and other costs of such restrictions. Inevitably any rules would be arbitrary, with resultant adverse effects on patterns of investment, and would impose significant compliance costs. 6.43 It is appropriate, however, to maintain and enhance the interest apportionment and allocation rules (the thin capitalisation and conduit rules) that can apply when there is inbound investment. 30 Investment out of New Zealand. The desirability of apportioning company interest expense 28 6.44 In particular, it is proposed to reduce the thin capitalisation safe harbour from 75 percent to 66 percent and to limit the investments that branches can regard as being New Zealand assets for thin capitalisation purposes. 6.45 The Government welcomes submissions on these points. 29 CHAPTER 7 PROPOSED TREATMENT OF COMPANY INTEREST EXPENSE 7.1 Because it is not possible for larger companies to trace the use to which borrowed funds are put, little can be achieved at the company level by imposing onerous tracing rules to govern interest expense. As can be seen from chapters 5 and 6, alternative methods of restricting interest deductions (stacking or pro rata) also present their own problems. 7.2 Given these problems, the Government believes that gains, if any, made from attempting to apportion New Zealand resident companies’ interest expense for exempt dividend income or capital gains are more than offset by the economic and other costs of such restrictions. Inevitably any rules would be arbitrary, with resultant adverse effects on patterns of investment. Further, the compliance costs that effective apportionment rules would impose would be significant (if such rules could even be devised). 7.3 Accordingly, it is proposed that company interest be deductible, subject to the thin capitalisation and conduit allocation rules. 31 In this context, interest includes ‘use-of-money’ interest payable in respect of taxation and accrual rules expenditure that is regarded as interest under section DD 1(b). 7.4 The Government believes it can and should move ahead on reform of the company interest deductibility rules because companies (other than qualifying companies) do not pose the same risk as other business entities of private expenditure being recharacterised as business expenditure. The deemed dividend rules in relation to company distributions mean that almost any transfer of wealth to shareholders will be gross income as a dividend. Avoidance concerns in relation to company structures revolve not around the private and domestic boundary, but the international boundary. These concerns were discussed in the preceding chapter. 7.5 Because of concerns over the private and domestic boundary, the Government is not yet in a position to consider what the rules should be for other taxpayers such as individuals, trusts and qualifying companies. 7.6 Further, there are a number of problems with allowing the interest deductibility proposal to apply to incorporated societies and the like, and to local authorities and other companies that derive exempt income (other than exempt dividends). 31 The general anti-avoidance rule will continue to apply. Proposed treatment of company interest expense 30 7.7 For companies, the proposed reform outlined in this document will improve the efficiency and equity of the income tax system by: • simplifying and clarifying the interest deductibility rules; • increasing taxpayer certainty; and • reducing compliance costs. 7.8 The Government is aware that concern may be expressed that this proposal may allow inappropriate interest deductions. We do not believe that the proposal will have this effect in practice, given that the general anti- avoidance, thin capitalisation and conduit interest allocation rules will apply, and considering the robustness of the dividend rules. However, the outcome will be regularly monitored. Submission points 7.9 Do readers agree that the proposed rule will lead to simplified and more certain interest deduction rules, and therefore increased certainty and reduced compliance costs? 7.10 How significant are these advantages? 7.11 Do readers agree with the core interest deduction proposal? 7.12 Should the Government be concerned about inappropriate interest deductions being allowed under the proposal? Or should the Government consider other ways to increase certainty and reduce the compliance costs associated with interest deductibility? 31 CHAPTER 8 FUTURE INTEREST DEDUCTION ISSUES 8.1 A number of issues have not been addressed in this discussion document. Because of the size of the project, the Government has made the decision to do it in two parts. The Government is continuing to analyse a number of issues, which are briefly discussed below. Before any further changes are made there will be appropriate opportunities for consultation. Private and domestic boundary 8.2 Interest expense incurred on money borrowed to fund private and domestic expenditure, such as a private mortgage, is not deductible under New Zealand law. It is often difficult, however, to trace how borrowed money has been used. Because of this, some taxpayers, such as the self-employed, may be able to recharacterise private interest expenditure as deductible business expenditure. Any relaxation of the rules relating to interest expenditure could, therefore, increase opportunities for taxpayers to obtain a deduction for what is essentially private and domestic expenditure. 8.3 By way of a simple example, consider a self-employed person privately using a work vehicle financed by way of an increased business overdraft. It is almost impossible in this situation to determine accurately how much of the interest paid on the overdraft relates to business expenditure and how much relates to private consumption. 8.4 The boundary between companies and their shareholders is buttressed by comprehensive dividend rules. Thus almost any distribution of value to a shareholder is deemed to be a dividend, so is gross income of the shareholder. For this reason, we believe a relaxation of the rules relating to interest deductions for companies, as opposed to businesses in general, presents significantly fewer problems in relation to the private and domestic boundary. 8.5 The Government intends to undertake further work on the private and domestic boundary and consider the deductibility of interest expense for taxpayers other than companies (that is, qualifying companies, individuals and trusts) in light of that work. Incorporated societies 8.6 From a tax perspective, incorporated societies and the like are companies. One important characteristic is that, typically, at least some, if not most or all, of their income is exempt (such as that of an amateur sports promoter). Future interest deduction issues 32 8.7 Thus simply allowing interest deductibility seems to be inappropriate. The Government wishes to consider further what interest deductibility rules should apply to such entities. Local authorities 8.8 A significant portion of the income of local authorities (which the Income Tax Act regards as companies) is exempt. Again, it seems to be inappropriate to allow unilateral interest deductibility. Submission point 8.9 Submissions on these or any other issues are welcomed. APPENDIX 35 APPENDIX DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN COMPANIES The following examples consider interest apportionment in respect of non-conduit outbound investment. The table provides calculations to support each of the examples. Example 1 – Tax havens New Zealand resident individuals (Shareholders) invest in a New Zealand company (Hold Co) which then acquires a controlled foreign company resident (CFC) in a tax haven. Borrowings are required. Presume that Shareholders, Hold Co and CFC derive sufficient net income to ‘utilise’ any interest they incur (that is, Shareholders and Hold Co have income other than what they receive by way of dividends from Hold Co and CFC respectively). Given the assumptions, from a New Zealand taxation perspective it does not matter whether the interest is incurred in CFC, Hold Co or by Shareholders. The total amount of tax payable in New Zealand is the same. The income of Hold Co and CFC is consolidated for taxation purposes and there are no underlying tax credits to complicate the analysis. 32 32 This conclusion would be different if the shareholders were not New Zealand resident - the conduit rules would apply to appropriately locate the interest expense.

By CFCBy Hold CoBy Shareholders Appendix 36 Example 2 – Underlying tax credits, but all income is distributed to Shareholders Now presume that CFC is resident in a grey list country that has an effective tax rate of 33%, and that the income of CFC and Hold Co is all distributed to Shareholders. So long as CFC has sufficient income, Shareholders’ return and the New Zealand tax take are maximised if CFC incurs the interest. This is because CFC’s tax liability (which is effectively treated as an expense upon ultimate distribution of its income to Shareholders) is minimised by the interest deduction. Put another way around, Hold Co maximises its imputation credits in relation to its and CFC’s income by ensuring the interest is incurred by CFC.

So long as there is sufficient income to utilise the interest expense it doesn’t matter which party incurs it. This could cause the parties to be indifferent from a taxation perspective as to where the interest expense is located. However, if CFC’s income is then distributed to Shareholders in a subsequent year, their return and the New Zealand tax take are maximised if the interest was located in CFC (for the same reasons as in Example 2: if the interest is located in Hold Co its income is less and therefore it has less imputation credits) The analysis above considers only the CFC and dividend rules. In practice, the analysis is further complicated by other taxation factors such as the potential effect of the CFC loss ring fencing rules, thin capitalisation rules, overseas tax rates and by non-taxation factors such as currency exposure. From a New Zealand taxation perspective it is the indifference as to the location of the interest expense in example 3 that potentially presents a problem The nub of the issue is that, conceptually, New Zealand should not provide interest expense deductions related to income that is not subject to New Zealand taxation. To the extent there are underlying foreign tax credits (actual or deemed), the income of CFC does not enter the New Zealand tax base until it is distributed by Hold Co.

Tax improvements for business 1 Less taxing tax A Government discussion document Hon Bill English Rt Hon Sir William Birch TreasurerMinister of Finance Minister of Revenue Less taxing tax; a Government discussion document (Tax improvements for business 1) First published in September 1999 ISBN 0-478-10334-4 PREFACE This discussion document looks at ways of helping businesses to put more time and energy into their business and less into meeting, and worrying about, their tax obligations. The goal is to help New Zealand’s businesses expand and prosper. The Government’s objective is major simplification of the tax system – the small business equivalent of the recent measures removing the need for wage and salary earners to file a tax return. This document represents the start of that process. Although the Government is committed to simplification, significant improvement will not be easy. The variety of businesses, their approaches to tax compliance and changing technology makes for a complex exercise. The consultation by the Government, outlined in the discussion document, highlights this. It also makes clear the need for reforms, especially in the area of provisional tax. Compliance costs are a burden imposed on all business taxpayers. To reduce this burden, in the best way possible, we need the contribution of businesses and their advisers. We look forward to receiving submissions.

This discussion document presents for public consideration a series of simplification measures that constitute a further step towards this objective. 1.2 The Government is aware of the concerns of small businesses regarding tax requirements. These concerns include potential exposure to penalties that are perceived to be harsh, the complexity of calculating tax liabilities and return filing requirements. 1.3 The 1999 income year is the last year that salary and wage earners need to file IR 5 income tax returns. This is a significant simplification step with widespread effect. The Government has been exploring ideas that could lead to a similar reform for small businesses. The objectives include reducing exposure to interest and penalties, reducing the complexity of information required, streamlining tax filing and payments and reducing the need for taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue. 1.4 Such simplification, if it is achievable, will be a complex task requiring careful rethinking of how we can collect tax and appropriate information more efficiently. There are likely to be trade-offs between certainty, simplicity, fairness, revenue and accuracy that have to be considered. 1.5 Further, although salary and wage earners are a relatively homogeneous group, small businesses are a very diverse group. They have many different legal structures (for example, company, trust, partnership, sole trader), are involved in a vast range of different activities and can therefore be subject to different tax rules. 1.6 The focus of this discussion document is the enhancement of aspects of the existing tax system. Its scope, therefore, is modest. It aims to achieve worthwhile reductions in the complexity of the current tax payment system and reduce the costs associated with payment, while ensuring the integrity of the tax system and its administration. 1.7 The Government will continue to work on ideas for a simpler method of calculating and paying tax, particularly for small business. We welcome the views of taxpayers, their advisers and other interested parties on how we can achieve this. Introduction 2 Benefits of tax improvement 1.8 The specific benefits expected to arise from the measures outlined in this discussion document include: • a fairer application of late payment penalties; • reduced compliance costs through narrowing the application of use-of- money interest in cases where the benefits are considered to be outweighed by the costs; • increased consistency and certainty in payment processes; and • simpler and more streamlined payment processes. Operational issues raised by Institute of Chartered Accountants 1.9 As part of the Government’s continuing consultation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand raised a number of operational issues that impose significant compliance costs, which it is discussing with Inland Revenue. Examples of the issues raised include: • Inland Revenue’s issuing of a statement relating to a period with no details other than a notation that the period has not yet been finalised; • the fact that no notification is provided to taxpayers or their agents when refunds are being held in Inland Revenue’s account review system for more than 30 days; and • problems with the calculation of use-of-money interest. 1.10 Inland Revenue acknowledges that the issues raised are important and is working urgently to address them. Inland Revenue and the Institute have undertaken work to document these problems and identify and schedule solutions. Summary of reforms 1.11 A summary of the reforms proposed in this discussion document follows: Obligation to pay tax on time (chapter 4) • Reduce the incremental penalty for late payment of tax from 2 percent a month to 1 percent a month. • Apply the initial late payment penalty either seven days after the due date or at the rate of 1 percent on the due date and 4 percent seven days later. Introduction 3 • Extend to one month the 15-day use-of-money interest ‘grace period’ following issue of a statement. Fairness and clarity of treatment for those with overdue tax (chapter 5) • Extend the existing serious hardship and financial difficulty relief provisions to all taxes. • Extend the existing instalment arrangement provisions to all taxes and provide for remission of incremental penalties each month as taxpayers comply with their arrangement. • Increase the threshold above which approval from the Minister of Finance is required for an instalment arrangement or hardship remission from $50,000 to $100,000. Aligning tax payment dates (chapter 6) • Streamline payment of taxes so that most payments will be paid on one day each month, on either the 5th, 20th or the last working day of each month. • Tax payments due on a non-working day become payable on the next working day. Simplification of fringe benefit tax (chapter 7) • Remove the requirement to pay small amounts of fringe benefit tax by applying the current $75 per quarter per employee threshold to all classes of fringe benefit. (The maximum exemption would remain limited to $450.) • Remove use-of-money interest charged on FBT paid annually. This is likely to increase the use of the option to pay FBT once a year. • Include the payment of GST on the value of fringe benefits in the FBT return. Simplification of provisional tax (chapter 8) • Raise the individual threshold for the ‘safe harbour’ from use-of-money interest from $30,000 residual income tax to $35,000, thus reducing the number of individuals liable for use-of-money interest. • Remove the ‘reasonable care’ standard, leaving the ‘gross carelessness’ standard for all taxpayers who estimate provisional tax and have less than $35,000 residual income tax. (It would stay at $30,000 if the proposal above is not adopted.) • Allow taxpayers to elect into the withholding payment regulations. Introduction 4 Review of information required in tax returns (chapter 9) • A review will be undertaken of information provided to Inland Revenue, to remove duplication and ensure that unnecessary information does not have to be provided. Application date of proposals 1.12 Inland Revenue has major administrative commitments over the next 12 months, including the implementation of the tax simplification changes applying to salary and wage earners, the Parental Tax Credit, changes to Family Assistance, and operational improvements. Many of the initiatives outlined here will also require a major departmental commitment, and that cannot begin until legislation arising from this discussion document is enacted. 1.13 Given these factors, and the need to align new tax policy initiatives with the start of a tax year, the Government considers the earliest application date for most of these measures would be 1 April 2001. Key questions 1.14 Before making final decisions on whether to proceed with the various tax improvement measures discussed here, the Government wishes to seek the views of interested people. Key areas in which the Government seeks feedback are: • whether the areas of concern outlined here are the most significant as regards tax compliance costs; and • whether the tax improvement measures considered in this discussion document should be adopted. SUBMISSIONS Submissions should be addressed to: The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Submissions should be made by 26 November 1999. They should include a brief summary of their major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue to contact those making the submission to discuss their submission if required. 5 CHAPTER 2 CONTEXT OF THESE REFORMS 2.1 The last decade has seen extensive reforms of both tax policy and tax administration in New Zealand. These reforms include a broadening of the tax base, the implementation of various social policy measures through the tax system, modernisation of the tax administration, and an increasing obligation on taxpayers to assess their own tax liability and comply with the law voluntarily. 2.2 Although the reforms have provided significant benefits by way of a more efficient and equitable tax system, they have also created problems. They have increased the number of payments taxpayers must make, the complexity associated with calculating those payments, and the extent to which these obligations are effectively enforced. 2.3 The Government is seeking to reduce the ‘costs’ of these reforms for individuals and businesses. These costs may take the form of monetary and non-monetary costs. Monetary costs comprise the value of the time involved, the fees paid to professional tax advisers, and incidental costs incurred. Non- monetary costs include psychological costs such as stress. 2.4 It is inevitable that any tax system will impose these compliance costs. The challenge is to have an efficient tax system that keeps to an absolute minimum the total costs it imposes. 2.5 The desire to minimise the costs imposed by the tax system has resulted in a number of inquiries over the last year. In particular, concerns about the current payment rules have been raised in numerous forums. For example, both the Commerce Committee, in its Inquiry into Compliance Costs for Business, and the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance discussed the issue of aligning tax payments to reduce compliance costs. Taxpayers and tax practitioners have also raised concerns about the existing tax payment system. Recent reviews of the tax system Commerce Committee Inquiry into Compliance Costs for Business 2.6 Parliament’s Commerce Committee conducted an inquiry into compliance costs imposed on business. Amongst the recommendations in its November 1998 report was for Inland Revenue to undertake: Context of these reforms 6 ...detailed analysis and consultation with the objective of streamlining payment dates and payment forms for small to medium sized enterprises. 2.7 The Government undertook to consider issues relating to aligning payment dates as part of its response to the Committee’s report. This discussion document represents the response to the Committee’s concerns in relation to payment streamlining and the provision of duplicated or unnecessary information to Inland Revenue. Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance 2.8 The Government announced the establishment of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in March 1998. The Committee’s terms of reference broadly required it to consider and make recommendations on tax compliance costs and the robustness of the tax system against avoidance and evasion. The Committee reported to the Treasurer and the Minister of Revenue in December 1998. 2.9 This discussion document includes a number of the Committee’s recommendations for tax simplification. They were to: • consider the amalgamation of the due dates for payment of tax; • standardise the treatment of payments that fall due on a non-working day; • remove use-of-money interest from those who choose to pay FBT annually; • reduce the incremental penalty for late payment of tax from 2 percent a month to 1 percent; • apply the initial late payment penalty incrementally; and • include GST on fringe benefits in the FBT return rather than the GST return. 2.10 The Committee made a number of other simplification recommendations which the Government is still considering. Finance and Expenditure Committee Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department 2.11 Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee received over 180 public submissions and over 50 hours of oral presentations. The Government presented to the Committee a submission addressing the policy and administrative issues raised with it. Context of these reforms 7 2.12 In relation to the matters raised in the submissions, the Government considered two categories of policy response were appropriate: • changing some areas of compliance and penalty policy through the normal generic tax policy process, as announced in the ‘5 Steps Ahead’ package; and • specifically including a number of minor policy issues in the forthcoming review of the compliance and penalties legislation, which also will follow the normal policy development process. Recent tax simplification measures 2.13 Until this year about 1.2 million New Zealanders filled in an IR 5 income tax return showing the income they received during the year and the rebates they were claiming. This took each of them an average of one hour. About 50 percent of them needed some help to complete their form – half an hour’s worth, on average. That added up to 1.5 million hours each year devoted to filling in the nation’s IR 5 tax returns. 2.14 The Government has adopted measures which eliminate the IR 5 tax return by using information provided to Inland Revenue by third parties, such as employers and banks, and improvements in the way that information is provided. 2.15 The measures outlined in this discussion document represent a step towards similar simplifications that will be of benefit to small businesses. The Government’s ‘5 Steps Ahead’ package 2.16 A number of changes to the compliance and penalties rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being considered as part of the Government’s ‘5 Steps Ahead’ package. The aim is to make the rules more flexible, reduce the penalties imposed on taxpayers who pay just a few days late, and ensure that essentially honest taxpayers are not excessively penalised. The changes are to: • Explicitly extend the serious hardship, financial difficulty and instalment arrangement provisions to all types of tax. • Increase the threshold requiring approval from the Minister of Finance for hardship remissions and instalment arrangements from $50,000 to $100,000. • Reduce the incremental penalty for late payment of tax from 2 percent a month to 1 percent a month (an idea initially raised by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance). Context of these reforms 8 • Apply the initial late payment penalty incrementally (also first raised by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance). • Cancel incremental penalties before completion of an instalment arrangement if the taxpayer involved is complying with that arrangement. Taxpayers who enter instalment arrangements should be given certainty with regard to these arrangements, and a partial failure to comply with an instalment arrangement should not result in a disproportionate penalty. 2.17 These possible changes should be considered through the usual process of consultation, to ensure they are well-designed. For this reason they have been included in this discussion document. Technology 2.18 The Government is also concerned that the processes specified by the tax system might be a barrier to the development of new ways for businesses to meet their tax obligations, perhaps by way of improvements in technology. The Government welcomes submissions on whether there are legislative changes that would remove such barriers. 9 CHAPTER 3 CONSULTATION 3.1 As part of its continuing commitment to tax simplification, the Government has been consulting with taxpayers and their representative bodies about the problems taxpayers face in complying with the law and how compliance costs can be reduced. 3.2 This consultation raises more issues than can be addressed in this discussion document. The purpose of this chapter is to confirm that the consultation that has already taken place has correctly identified the key issues the Government needs to address. 3.3 The Government will be continuing this consultation process and working to identify ways to address the concerns raised. The remainder of this chapter discusses the key issues that have been raised so far. General themes from consultation 3.4 Three key themes have emerged from the consultation undertaken by the Government. 3.5 First, simplification for business taxpayers is unlikely to come from eliminating the forms businesses have to complete. The major problems for business taxpayers do not lie in filling in the forms, but in the amount of work required to obtain the necessary information to calculate tax liabilities. 3.6 The second theme is that, for tax purposes, businesses are not a homogenous group like salary and wage earners. Any consideration of tax-related problems of businesses must span a variety of different entities with vastly different processes and systems. All businesses can have problems with the same tax or tax process, but the perspective of larger businesses is generally very different from that of the self-employed contractor. It is critical to consider the different perspectives when identifying potential solutions to the problems. A single solution is likely to have markedly different impacts on different types and sizes of business. 3.7 One of the key differences between businesses is their degree of tax knowledge. There are two extremes. At one end of the spectrum are the businesses whose operators are able to manage the tax requirements of the business. This may only involve having a cash-book that is kept up to date and engaging an accountant to complete annual tax returns. Nevertheless, their affairs are ‘tax organised’. At the other end of the spectrum are those whose tax affairs are ‘disorganised’ and who consequently have difficulty meeting their tax obligations. Consultation 10 3.8 The degree of tax organisation is not a comment on non-tax aspects of the business. For example, a business may be very profitable but be ‘disorganised’ in its tax affairs. 3.9 The final theme is the high psychological costs some specific taxes and elements of the tax system impose on taxpayers. Many of the issues businesses feel strongest about concern tax rules which they neither like nor perhaps understand, such as the depreciation rules, which in fact impose relatively low compliance costs. In other words, there is a strong link between a taxpayer’s view of an aspect of the tax system and the perception of the burden that aspect places on the business. Specific concerns Provisional tax 3.10 Taxpayers have raised a range of issues that relate to the way in which provisional tax is calculated and interest is applied. The critical issues are: • the lack of accuracy when paying on the basis of last year’s tax plus 5 percent; • the complexity involved in applying the estimation option; • the potential interest costs if the estimation is incorrect; and • the fact that provisional tax does not take account of seasonal income patterns. 3.11 Most individuals who pay provisional tax do not have to pay use-of-money interest. Their payments are based on the previous year’s tax liability plus 5 percent and they are within the $30,000 residual income tax ‘safe harbour’. A concern is that these payments do not reflect the current year’s income. Business activity can be highly volatile, and financial performance can vary significantly from year to year. This can result in provisional tax payments being at variance with the individual’s actual tax liability. 3.12 Individuals who know that their provisional tax payments will not accurately reflect their income tax liability may choose to estimate their liability. This enables them to make provisional tax payments they believe more accurately reflect their income tax liability for that year. Two problems arise, however, when they use the estimation option: • It does not provide a general ‘safe harbour’, so use-of-money interest will be applied to any difference (greater than $100) between the provisional tax paid and residual tax liability for the year. Consultation 11 • The estimation of future income is complex, particularly for businesses that have no routine income source (such as contractors) or when fluctuating economic conditions have a significant impact on revenue. 3.13 A consistent message from businesses is that it is extremely difficult to estimate profit up to a year ahead. The penalties and use-of-money interest that could apply when provisional tax liability is incorrectly estimated add to the psychological burden this process places on businesses. Although the estimation can be changed up until the final provisional tax payment date, interest on any variance is calculated and applied back to the first provisional tax payment date. Therefore a business may receive higher than expected income in the final period but any variance, of provisional tax payments to income tax liability, is applied back to the first provisional tax payment date. A number of individuals commented that they considered the application of use-of-money interest in this case to be a significant ‘penalty’. 3.14 Although estimating income may give a business the opportunity to align provisional tax liability with anticipated profits, the provisional tax rules assume that this profit will be earned evenly across the year, so the three payments are of equal value. In many instances income and expenditure patterns are not even across the year. This, again, reflects concerns that the payments required under the provisional tax system do not match the income- earning process, therefore causing cash flow problems in some cases. Income tax year-end requirements 3.15 Determining taxable profit can be an onerous activity for businesses, particularly those with little accounting knowledge, poor accounting systems or limited resources to apply to the task. Whereas many businesses keep reasonable cash records, preparing end-of-year accrual accounts can be difficult to understand and to do. Adjustments for small businesses usually include at least capital purchases and sales, depreciation, trading stock valuation, private use adjustments, and adjustments for creditors and debtors. 3.16 The adjustments are usually the issues that require small businesses to hire an accountant. Small businesses have indicated a preference for a simplified system that they could understand and undertake themselves with a reasonable degree of certainty that they had calculated their liability accurately. 3.17 The annual income tax process requires a business to complete full accrual- based financial accounts. For some of these businesses, particularly self- employed people and partnerships, financial management is achieved through cash flow records, and financial statements are produced only for tax purposes. Other institutions, such as banks, are placing less emphasis on the requirement to produce annual financial statements of performance and position. Consultation 12 Goods and services tax 3.18 The responses from businesses during consultation indicated that they believed they had few problems with GST and considered it relatively easy to comply with. This was particularly evident from those whose affairs are ‘tax organised’. 3.19 Many businesses indicated that the requirement to calculate and file GST returns regularly assisted with their understanding of the process. Problems they did face with GST related to making minor errors, such as arithmetical mistakes, or one-off transactions that increase the complexity of the return for that particular period. Calculating and remembering to pay GST on fringe benefits is also a frequent problem. Fringe benefit tax 3.20 Taxpayers’ lack of understanding of the purpose of fringe benefit tax (FBT), together with their perception that it is pervasive, significantly affect their perceptions of the compliance costs associated with it. Nevertheless, some of the requirements for complying with FBT are complex. Many of these complexities again require smaller businesses to make use of an agent to meet their obligations. Payments 3.21 Problems associated with the timing of payment of tax elicit opposing views from different groups of taxpayers. One group is concerned about the number of payments that have to be made in a month. That group would prefer just one payment date for all taxes due in that month, even though this would mean a larger payment. Another group would rather make a series of smaller, more frequent payments. A problem for this group is that tax payments often do not align with the receipt of income, thereby causing cash flow problems. 3.22 Some business taxpayers are interested in paying tax on a more commercial basis. For example, many businesses are interested in more technology-based solutions for payments, but others do not use the electronic options already available. This may be because they prefer the cash flow benefits that arise from sending a cheque that will take three days to get through the mail and be processed. Consultation 13 Compliance and penalties rules 3.23 The businesses spoken to all had problems with the compliance and penalties legislation. Although many of them had never had to pay penalties, the possibility of incurring the penalties and interest has generated increased compliance costs. Many businesses, particularly medium-sized to large businesses, have complained about the amount of effort and cost involved in putting in place effective control procedures to ensure mistakes are not made. 3.24 The feedback received on the compliance and penalty rules is that they are inflexible. Many of those consulted considered the interest rates inappropriate. A number of comments related to the lack of consideration of compliance history when considering penalties. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks submissions on: • whether the Government has correctly identified the principal compliance costs faced by businesses; and • other compliance cost concerns not identified above. 14 CHAPTER 4 OBLIGATION TO PAY TAX ON TIME 4.1 In a tax system based on self-assessment, taxpayers have three key obligations: to assess their own tax liability, to file their tax returns on time, and to pay the tax on time. Late payment penalties are intended to enforce a fundamental obligation – the payment of taxes by their due date. 4.2 Setting penalties too low would probably cause significant delays in the Crown’s receipt of tax payments. This would reduce the fairness of the tax system and place a greater burden on complying taxpayers to the extent they would have to cover any shortfall in payment. 4.3 However, late payment penalties that are too high also cause problems. They unduly punish failure to comply, increase debt problems and discourage voluntary compliance by reducing the fairness of the tax system. Excessive penalties also place pressure on processes used to mitigate imposition of the penalty, such as disputes procedures and remission requests, thus increasing both compliance and administrative costs. 4.4 As part of its ‘5 Steps Ahead’ programme the Government announced there was scope to make the payment rules more flexible and reduce the penalties imposed on taxpayers who pay just a few days late. Background 4.5 The obligation to pay tax on time is supported by: • a 5 percent penalty if the due date for the payment of the tax is missed; • incremental penalties of 2 percent of the tax outstanding each following month. 4.6 These penalties have generally applied from 1 April 1997. They are not deductible for tax purposes. 4.7 The initial late payment penalty is to enforce the due date given that failure to pay on time imposes costs both on the Government through delay in the receipt of revenue, and the tax administration in having to undertake action to encourage payment. 4.8 The incremental late payment penalty is the principal method by which the Government ensures a continuing incentive for taxpayers to pay overdue tax. The incremental penalty also ensures that complying taxpayers can see that non-compliance is punished. Obligation to pay tax on time 15 4.9 These penalties are supported by the application of use-of-money interest on outstanding debts. The rate is currently 10.59 percent on unpaid tax. The interest charged is to compensate the Crown for the deferral of the payment of the tax. Any interest charged may be deductible for tax purposes provided the general deductibility provisions are met. 4.10 Because these penalties, together with use-of-money interest, are the principal method by which the Government ensures payment of tax, the result must provide a significant incentive to pay. As a start, the combined penalty and interest must exceed the borrowing cost faced by taxpayers; otherwise some may decide to defer payment. It must also contain a culpability component so that complying taxpayers can see that non-compliance is punished. 4.11 Administrative alternatives to imposing penalties for late payment, such as managing extended instalment arrangements, court action and bankruptcy action, are more expensive, both for the tax administration and the judiciary. Moreover, the delays inherent in these approaches reduce the equity and integrity of the tax system by rewarding non-compliance. 4.12 The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance endorsed the reasons for the late payment penalty, and considered it inappropriate to depart from giving taxpayers incentives to pay their tax on time. The Committee considered, however, that: • The penalty should have less of an impact and the 5 percent penalty should not apply to taxpayers who fail to pay on time if they correct that error within a few days of the due date. • The Government should consider reducing the incremental late payment penalty from 2 percent to 1 percent per month. Appropriate enforcement of due dates for payment of tax 4.13 The Government proposes: • reducing the incremental penalty for late payment of tax from 2 percent to 1 percent a month; • applying the initial late payment penalty incrementally; and • extending to one month the 15-day use-of-money interest ‘grace period’ following the issue of a statement. Obligation to pay tax on time 16 Reducing the incremental penalty for late payment of tax from 2 percent to 1 percent a month 4.14 The objective of the incremental late payment penalty is to provide a clear, continuing incentive to comply. 4.15 Of concern to the Government is whether the incremental penalty is higher than that necessary to ensure the fairness and integrity of the tax system. In other words, can the penalty be lowered while still ensuring voluntary compliance by taxpayers? 4.16 Comparison with the private sector treatment of trade creditors shows Inland Revenue charges more, in total, including use-of-money interest, than the private sector. A trade creditor who fails to pay is usually charged 1.5 percent to 2 percent a month, depending on the specific arrangement. This equates to between 18 percent and 24 percent a year. This expense would be deductible to a business. 4.17 The level of interest charged by trade creditors provides a useful basis of comparison because there is generally no intention in the ordinary course of business to extend credit without additional security being provided. Thus when a taxpayer does not pay on time, the Crown is in a similar position to a trader. 4.18 A reduction in the incremental penalty from 2 percent to 1 percent a month would mean the annualised charge for non-payment of tax due, including use- of-money interest, would be approximately 30 percent a year. The Government considers a rate a few percent higher than that of trade creditors appropriate because: • Non-paying taxpayers would be inclined to pay trade creditors over Inland Revenue if the rates were identical. • It ensures there is a penal element, recognising that the penalty is imposed on taxpayers who fail to meet one of their fundamental tax obligations. • The Government has limited control over those who choose to ‘borrow’ from the Crown by not paying their tax. 4.19 On these grounds the Government has concluded that the incremental late payment penalty should be reduced from 2 percent to 1 percent a month. Obligation to pay tax on time 17 Late payment penalties under different rules Applying the initial late payment penalty incrementally 4.20 An initial 5 percent penalty applies when the due date for payment passes. The concern expressed to the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s Inquiry into the Powers and Operation of the Inland Revenue Department was that this penalty is substantial and excessive when applied to basically honest taxpayers who have failed to comply by only a few days. A number of submissions to that Committee raised the idea of delaying the imposition of the late payment penalty for, say, 30 days. The issue was also considered by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, which recommended a delay of a ‘few days’ before imposing the 5 percent penalty. 4.21 The Government has identified two approaches to a more phased application of the initial late payment penalty. When considering these options it should be borne in mind that: • The objective is still to enforce the due date for payment of the tax. A result that merely sees tax deferred by all taxpayers for a period does not address the issue of providing flexibility. The effective payment date is likely to become the ‘norm’, with taxpayers considering themselves unfairly penalised if they missed that ‘norm’ by one day. 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Due date Month 1Month 2Month 3Month 4Month 5Month 6Month 7Month 8Month 9 Month 10Month 11Month 12 Percentage penalty Previous rules Proposed rules Current rules Trade Creditor 2% Obligation to pay tax on time 18 • Any option which results in significant deferral of payment imposes costs on the Government which eventually have to be borne by all taxpayers in some form. • The current remission provisions will be retained. 4.22 One approach is simply to defer the application of the initial late payment penalty for seven days. In other words, the late payment penalty would apply seven days after the due date for the payment of the tax. Seven days would give taxpayers time to correct their mistake or approach Inland Revenue if they faced difficulties. 4.23 Advantages of this approach are that it provides a period during which taxpayers who miss the due date can correct that failure at low compliance and administrative cost. The obvious risk with this approach is the concern expressed above, that lack of enforcement of the due date might mean that the ‘norm’ becomes paying taxes on the day before the late payment penalty applies. 4.24 The benefit to taxpayers is that they would gain a short tax deferral, rather than a lenient treatment of small errors. If a late payment penalty were imposed, the case for remission would be more difficult than at present because the taxpayer would have to establish why payment was a full seven days late, even though the taxpayer had missed the ‘norm’ date by only one day. 4.25 Another option would be to apply the initial 5 percent late payment penalty, but incrementally. Under this option the due date would be supported by a 1 percent penalty, with a further 4 percent penalty imposed seven days later. 4.26 The advantage is that there would still be an incentive to pay on the due date. Because the initial penalty would be reduced from 5 percent to 1 percent, however, the penalty on a taxpayer who missed that date would not be large. But if the taxpayer did not pay within the seven days, a further 4 percent penalty would apply. After seven days the taxpayer would be in nearly the same position as arises under the current rules. 4.27 It is anticipated that by providing some relief to the application of the initial late payment penalty, there should be fewer applications for remission. A disadvantage of this latter approach, however, is that the 1 percent penalty might still cause taxpayers to believe they have been unfairly treated for failing to pay on the due date. Therefore they would still incur compliance costs to get this penalty remitted, and Inland Revenue would incur administrative costs considering the merits of remission. The Government would welcome submissions on this point. Obligation to pay tax on time 19 Extending the 15-day use-of-money interest ‘grace period’ to one month 4.28 A ‘grace period’ applies to use-of-money interest when Inland Revenue has issued a statement for taxes due and the amount due is paid within 15 days of the date of the statement. This grace period allows taxpayers to use the interest calculation on the statement and means they do not have to recalculate it. 4.29 It is proposed to extend the interest ‘grace period’ to one month. This will reduce the compliance costs associated with a payment that is paid late, but within a reasonable time, because taxpayers will not have to calculate their interest liability on a daily basis. There will be associated administration savings by Inland Revenue. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks submissions on: • whether reducing the incremental penalty from 2 percent to 1 percent would adversely affect voluntary compliance; • the approaches to providing flexibility around the tax payment dates discussed in this chapter; • extending to one month the 15-day use-of-money interest ‘grace period’ following the issue of a statement; and • other approaches to enforcing the payment dates that might also provide some flexibility. 20 CHAPTER 5 FAIRNESS AND CLARITY OF TREATMENT FOR THOSE WITH OVERDUE TAX 5.1 One of the Government’s objectives is to achieve clear, simple and certain tax legislation. This objective is of special relevance to taxpayers facing financial difficulties or serious hardship. A treatment perceived by taxpayers to be understandable and predictable would reduce anxiety and stress and might, in some cases, ensure the survival of businesses in difficulties. Background Serious hardship – section 176 5.2 Section 176 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows Inland Revenue to release taxpayers from their liability to pay income tax and to alter their assessment as necessary for that purpose. This provision applies to amounts of income tax and fringe benefit tax only. 5.3 Inland Revenue must be satisfied that serious hardship exists or, in the case of a deceased taxpayer, that the recovery of the income tax owing would cause serious hardship to the beneficiaries of an estate. The discretion is exercised in such a manner ‘....as to maximise the net present value of any recovery or likely recovery from the taxpayer of any current and future tax amounts.’ Financial hardship – section 177 5.4 Under section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Inland Revenue has discretion to remit income tax or fringe benefit tax if a taxpayer is in financial difficulties. The net present value calculation used for section 176 also applies to this provision. A taxpayer’s application for relief must be in writing. Any relief granted may be cancelled if misleading information or further information renders the original grant of relief inappropriate. Instalment arrangements – section 177 5.5 An instalment arrangement is an agreement between a taxpayer and Inland Revenue about the period within which the taxpayer will pay tax owing. Fairness and clarity of treatment for those with overdue tax 21 5.6 The current position under section 177 is that Inland Revenue may enter into an instalment arrangement if a taxpayer is in financial difficulties and if doing so would maximise the net present value of revenue collection. The provision is restricted to income tax and fringe benefit tax. However, Inland Revenue’s authority to collect revenue in section 156 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, in conjunction with the ‘care and management’ provisions, allows instalment arrangements to be accepted for other types of taxes. Increased certainty of treatment 5.7 The Government has been concerned for some time about possible deficiencies in these provisions. The serious hardship provision has remained largely unchanged since its inception back in the 1930s. The financial hardship provision, introduced in the late 1980s, was intended to address debt forgiveness issues arising from the accrual rules. 5.8 Neither set of hardship provisions was reviewed when the current compliance and penalties legislation was introduced. 5.9 The Government considers the following amendments may be appropriate: • Serious hardship and financial difficulty provisions. The existing provisions, which apply only to income tax and fringe benefit tax, should be explicitly extended to all taxes, including GST and PAYE. At present, an administrative write-off mechanism is used to achieve a similar result. • Instalment arrangements. Taxpayers who enter into instalment arrangements should be given certainty with regard to these arrangements, and a partial failure to comply with an instalment arrangement should not result in a disproportionate penalty. Further, these provisions should explicitly apply to all types of tax. • Approval threshold. The threshold above which approval from the Minister of Finance is required for an instalment arrangement or hardship remission should be raised from $50,000 to $100,000. 5.10 Consideration of the submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s Inquiry into the Powers and Operation of the Inland Revenue Department identified a number of minor but complex amendments and improvements that could be made in this area. These issues will be considered as part of the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation, scheduled to begin later this year. Fairness and clarity of treatment for those with overdue tax 22 Extension of hardship and financial difficulty provisions to all tax types 5.11 At present, the serious hardship and financial difficulty provisions can be applied only to a taxpayer’s income tax or fringe benefit tax liabilities. 5.12 The policy rationale for this is that income tax and fringe benefit tax are the taxpayer’s personal liabilities, whereas taxes such as PAYE are held in trust by the taxpayer for the Crown. It is the taxpayer’s duty to withhold these taxes and then forward them on to Inland Revenue. In theory, therefore, withheld taxes should not fall into arrears and thus should not require remission or relief. 5.13 In practice, however, taxpayers also face serious hardship and financial difficulties in meeting their tax obligations for taxes other than income tax and fringe benefit tax. In these cases Inland Revenue uses an administrative write- off mechanism to provide a measure of relief. 5.14 The current application of the hardship provisions and the write-off rules can lead to inconsistency of treatment and increased compliance and administrative costs associated with the lack of clarity. 5.15 The Government considers that a general application of the serious hardship and financial difficulty provisions has merit. Instalment arrangements 5.16 The Government proposes two amendments to the current instalment arrangement provisions. 5.17 The first is extending instalment arrangements to all types of tax, as proposed for the hardship remission provisions discussed earlier. 5.18 The second is adopting a more flexible instalment arrangement policy. Currently, only on successful completion of an instalment arrangement can incremental late payment penalties be cancelled. In other words, the current incremental penalty of 2 percent each month continues to accrue on the tax owed, with those penalties remitted only at the end of the instalment arrangement. 5.19 If a taxpayer defaults in any way on payments during the term of an arrangement, the whole arrangement is cancelled and all accumulated incremental penalties that would otherwise have been cancelled on full compliance are reinstated. The effect is that a partial, possibly small, failure to comply with the provisions of an instalment arrangement results in a disproportionate penalty. This becomes more obvious when a taxpayer fails to comply in some way near the end of an instalment arrangement, leading to a significant accumulation of incremental penalties. Fairness and clarity of treatment for those with overdue tax 23 5.20 The Government considers this position inequitable and proposes that each month that a taxpayer complies with an instalment arrangement the incremental penalties in relation to that month be remitted. This approach: • actively rewards taxpayers for their compliance; • prevents undue penalties if taxpayers fail to comply, and although they may be penalised for that failure, the penalty should not be excessive; and • is easier for taxpayers to understand than the current approach. Ministerial approval threshold in cases of serious or financial hardship 5.21 The hardship provisions require Inland Revenue to seek the approval of the Minister of Finance to remit, refund or enter instalment arrangements for amounts of more than $50,000. The only time this is not necessary is when a ‘class of case’ (an exemption for classes of taxpayers who meet rules set by the Minister) has been approved. 5.22 The Minister’s role is designed to provide an assurance that Inland Revenue is appropriately applying the hardship provisions in the most significant cases. The requirement to seek approval has a number of disadvantages, however: • The process can be a time-consuming procedure that causes stress and anxiety for taxpayers who are waiting for approval. • Delays often affect a taxpayer’s economic circumstances and may act to reduce revenue collection. • This approach blurs the separation of Inland Revenue’s statutory role of day-to-day tax administration from the Minister’s role of political oversight. 5.23 Balancing these factors, the Government considers it appropriate to increase the threshold from $50,000 to $100,000. This has the advantage of maintaining the current check on Inland Revenue’s application of these provisions, in the most significant cases, while allowing most cases to be dealt with expeditiously. 5.24 This proposal also reflects the fact that the discussed extension of these provisions to all tax types may increase the number of requests the Minister of Finance may receive. Fairness and clarity of treatment for those with overdue tax 24 SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks submissions on: • extending the existing serious hardship and financial difficulty provisions to all types of tax, thus increasing the certainty of treatment of taxpayers; • extending the existing instalment arrangement provisions to all types of tax and providing for remission of incremental penalties each month as a taxpayer complies with the arrangement; • increasing the threshold above which approval from the Minister of Finance is required for an instalment arrangement or hardship remission from $50,000 to $100,000; and • other changes that might be considered as part of the reform of the remission and instalment arrangements. 25 CHAPTER 6 ALIGNING TAX PAYMENT DATES 6.1 The Government is concerned that numerous due dates for returns and payment of taxes cause unnecessary compliance costs for businesses. In line with the recommendations of both the Commerce Committee and the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, the Government is reviewing payment and return dates and encourages public discussion and submissions on these topics. 6.2 This chapter outlines a number of different options for aligning payment dates, setting out the main advantages and disadvantages of these options, and discusses their relative merits. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of separating returns and payments. Background 6.3 Returns and payments are generally due together (with the exception of income tax payments and returns). However, different types of taxes are due on different days: • PAYE is paid either monthly on the 20 th of the month following the PAYE deduction or, if the aggregate of PAYE and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax deductions exceeds $100,000, on the 20 th of the month and the 5 th of the following month. • GST is paid either monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly and is due on the last working day of the month following the end of the taxable period. • FBT is paid either quarterly on the 20 th of the month following the end of the quarter, annually on 31 May following the end of the income year, or is aligned with the taxpayer’s balance date and due on the taxpayer’s terminal tax date. • Provisional tax is paid on the 7 th of the fourth, eighth and twelfth months of an income year, and terminal tax is due, for March balance date taxpayers, on the 7 th of the eleventh or thirteenth month after balance date. Aligning tax payment dates 26 6.4 Taxpayers who pay PAYE, FBT, GST, provisional tax and terminal tax generally make 19 to 44 tax payments and 16 to 41 returns of information each year. 1 Compliance costs 6.5 Both the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance and the Commerce Committee explained that the compliance cost benefits of amalgamating payment dates are uncertain and cannot be determined without consultation. What are advantages for some taxpayers will be disadvantages for others, and positive and negative compliance cost impacts will need to be balanced. 6.6 Efficiencies may be gained if taxpayers address all their tax obligations at one time, make one payment to cover all liabilities, and have fewer contacts with Inland Revenue. Moreover, one constant payment date would reduce the likelihood of a taxpayer forgetting to pay tax and having a late payment penalty imposed. It might also be possible to offset refunds that arise in relation to one type of tax against a liability from another type of tax. 6.7 The main disadvantage of aligning payments is that it has significant potential to create cash flow difficulties for businesses with inadequate financial management or accounting systems. The schedule for payments would change from frequent small payments to fewer but larger payments. Although the alignment options discussed in this chapter would have a net overall effect of delaying tax payments, the time-value use of that money to taxpayers might well be outweighed by the effect of large payments on their cash flow. 6.8 The Government is also concerned that the extent of any simplification from aligning payments might be limited because many tax calculations are necessary regardless of the due dates for payment of the tax. For example, as illustrated by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, employers must deduct PAYE each pay-day from wage and salary payments, irrespective of the date on which it is paid to Inland Revenue. 6.9 If one person has the responsibility for managing all the affairs of the taxpayer, aligning payment dates should result in savings as documents and files would only need to be accessed once. However, if different people handle different types of tax (for example, a payroll officer, the person responsible for GST and perhaps the accountant) there may be less advantage from aligning payment dates. 1 Either 12 or 24 PAYE returns and payments; between 2 and 12 GST returns and payments; either 1 or 4 FBT returns and payments; three provisional tax payments, one terminal tax payment and one income tax return. Aligning tax payment dates 27 6.10 Finally, completing and filing returns together for more than one type of tax and making a single amalgamated payment would require additional calculations to ensure that the total tax liability equalled the tax payment. Furthermore, the work of preparing these cumulative returns is peaked rather than spread. 6.11 Choices in payment due dates would result in significant compliance costs for taxpayers. Resources continually expended in working out and implementing the most effective current tax payment strategy would more appropriately be spent on taxpayers’ business activity. Therefore the Government considers that any change to payment dates should be applied to all taxpayers or none at all. 6.12 Overall, the Government considers the degree of reduction in compliance costs that would be achieved by aligning payment dates is uncertain and would differ from taxpayer to taxpayer. Compliance cost savings would most likely occur for small to medium-sized businesses that rely heavily on external tax accounting support, although they would face greater cash flow risks. Taxpayers with effective accounting and budgeting systems would be able to minimise the cash flow risks identified and take advantage of deferred due dates. Options for reform 6.13 The Government has considered the options of aligning payment dates so that all payments due in a given month would become due on either the 5 th , the 20 th or the last working day of each month. Given the importance of the collection of PAYE to the management of the Crown’s cash flow, large employers would still be required to make two PAYE payments each month. 6.14 The appendix contains an illustration of the effect on cash flow of amalgamating tax payments for a taxpayer who pays PAYE, GST, FBT, provisional tax and terminal tax. Option 1: Payments due on 5 th of the month 6.15 All payments (other than the second PAYE payment each month from large employers) would be aligned to the closest 5 th of each month. PAYE and FBT payments by small employers would be moved from the 20 th of the month to the 5 th of the following month. Provisional tax and terminal tax payments would be moved two days earlier, from the 7 th of the month to the 5 th of the same month. GST payments would be delayed from the last working day following the end of the GST period to the 5 th of the following month. Aligning tax payment dates 28 6.16 The significant changes from adopting this option are that PAYE and FBT payments by small employers and all GST payments would be delayed. This option creates the least variation from the current schedule of payments and corresponds to one of the current PAYE due dates for larger employers. Moreover, given that most businesses pay expenses near the end of each month, aligning payments to a date near the beginning of the month has the potential to cause the least fluctuation in cash flow. If it is decided to align payment dates, this is the Government’s preferred option. Option 2: Payments due on 20 th of the month 6.17 Payments (other than the first PAYE payment each month from large employers) would be aligned to the closest 20 th of each month. 6.18 The significant changes from adopting this option are that GST payments would be delayed by about 20 days, from the last working day of the month following the end of the GST period to the 20 th of the month following that month. Provisional tax and terminal tax payments would be delayed from the 7 th to the 20 th of the month. This option has the advantage of being aligned with 12 current due dates for PAYE. Option 3: Payments due on the last working day of the month 6.19 Under this option all payments would be due on the last working day of the month (except the first PAYE payment for large employers, which would be due on the 15 th of the month). 6.20 Significant changes under this option would be that: • All PAYE payments and quarterly FBT payments would be delayed by approximately 10 days. • Provisional tax, terminal tax and FBT calculated on an income year basis would be payable sooner, moving from the 7 th of the relevant month to the last day of the previous month. 6.21 Although this option aligns payments with current due dates for GST, it does not align payments with either of the two current PAYE payment due dates. It creates the greatest change from the current payments schedule and has the further disadvantage that it creates a varying due date. Because Inland Revenue cannot process all returns received by the end of the day payments are due, uncertainty for the Government’s estimates of revenue also arise to the extent of those unprocessed returns. Aligning tax payment dates 29 Returns and other administrative matters 6.22 Returns for individual tax types would still need to be completed and filed for the appropriate period. The only change that would ensue from aligning payment dates is that the separate returns would be filed together on the same day. In the future it may be possible to replace individual single-page returns with a multi-page return that includes information required for each type of tax due in the return period. Because of the work already done to streamline GST, FBT and PAYE returns there may not be significant scope to eliminate the amount of information requested, although some opportunities may arise. 6.23 Collecting revenue and processing returns is a major component of Inland Revenue’s duties. Any change to the payment system would significantly affect the way Inland Revenue functions. Processing cumulative returns and amalgamated payments would cause significant work peaks. It is also likely that Inland Revenue’s work in auditing and answering inquiries would peak to a greater extent than it does now. Inland Revenue currently receives amalgamated payments of PAYE, student loan repayments, child support contributions, ACC and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax. Separating and prioritising a greater number of amalgamated payments into their individual tax types would also increase Inland Revenue’s workload. Separating returns and payments 6.24 At present, payments and returns for PAYE, GST and FBT are due together. Provisional tax and terminal tax are due separately from the income tax return. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance recommended considering separating the flow of information from the payment of tax. 6.25 The principal merit of separating returns from the payment of tax is that it may be possible to reduce the number of returns that have to be filed. For example, one possibility could be that a taxpayer registered for GST might pay GST on a two-monthly basis but make an annual GST return. 6.26 In the Government’s view, separating returns and payments would not enable returns to be filed earlier than they are at present. 6.27 The main disadvantage of separating payment of tax from returns is that if information were provided to Inland Revenue less frequently it might delay the identification of differences between assessments by taxpayers and Inland Revenue’s audit. This delay could result in an accumulation of penalties and use-of-money interest. Another disadvantage of separating returns from payments is the lack of certainty for the Government in determining the amount of revenue due in a taxable period. Aligning tax payment dates 30 6.28 The Government is also concerned that separating returns from payments may increase compliance costs. Given that the underlying calculations have to be carried out to determine the amount payable at the time payments are due, deferring the return but not the payment would cause double handling and therefore increased compliance costs. 6.29 On balance, the Government considers that the disadvantages to be gained from separating returns from payments for GST, PAYE and FBT seem to outweigh the advantages of doing so. However, the Government encourages consideration of the matter and, in particular, whether there would be other benefits in separating payments and returns. Payments due on a non-working day 6.30 Payments that are due on a non-working day are accepted as being paid on time if they are received by the next working day. The Government agrees with the recommendation of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance that legislating for this administrative practice would reduce uncertainty in payment processes, thereby reducing compliance costs. 6.31 Including GST payments in either option 1 or option 2, discussed earlier in this chapter, would mean that if GST became due on a non-working day, like all other payments of tax it would be payable on the next working day. At present, GST is always due on the last working day of the relevant month. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks submissions on: • what other benefits and costs would arise from separating returns and payment of tax; • which factors are the most significant in determining whether compliance costs will be reduced by aligning payment dates; • which of the three options for aligning payment dates offers the greatest net benefit; and • other changes that could be considered as part of the review of payments. 31 CHAPTER 7 SIMPLIFICATION OF FRINGE BENEFIT TAX 7.1 Fringe benefit tax (FBT) is levied on non-cash benefits provided to employees to ensure that an appropriate level of tax is paid on what is effectively income to an employee. Although this tax is necessary on equity grounds, as well as to protect the tax base from employees receiving their income in kind rather than in cash, the Government wishes to minimise the compliance costs associated with it. 7.2 The measures proposed in this section are intended to make the payment of fringe benefit tax both more flexible and certain, especially for smaller employers. Background 7.3 FBT is payable at a rate of 49 percent on the value of fringe benefits provided to employees and shareholder-employees by an employer. This rate was set so employers face the same tax cost in providing fringe benefits that they would in making an equivalent taxable payment to employees on the top 33 percent marginal tax rate. Expenditure incurred in providing fringe benefits is generally deductible in determining the employer’s taxable income, as is the fringe benefit tax itself. The main categories of fringe benefits are: • subsidised or free motor vehicles; • low or nil interest loans; • employer contributions to sick, accident or death benefit funds, some superannuation funds, and specified insurance policies; and • other unclassified benefits, such as subsidised or free goods or services. 7.4 An exemption from fringe benefit tax is provided to a limit of $75 per employee per quarter. This exemption is capped at six employees, meaning a maximum quarterly exemption of $450. If the threshold is exceeded, FBT is payable on the full value of the benefit. The exemption applies only to unclassified fringe benefits, not other types of benefits such as use of a motor vehicle. 7.5 When the annual level of gross PAYE deductions and specified superannuation contribution withholding tax deductions does not exceed $100,000 for all employees in the business, an employer may elect to pay FBT annually. Simplification of fringe benefit tax 32 7.6 Use-of-money interest is charged to offset any payment deferral advantage associated with annual payment. This ensures that this annual payment option is chosen for compliance cost reasons rather than simply to defer tax payment. Simplification of FBT 7.7 The Government is considering the following improvements to FBT: • removing the requirement to pay small amounts of FBT; • removing the use-of-money interest charged on FBT paid annually; and • including the payment of GST on the value of fringe benefits in the FBT return. Removing FBT from small value fringe benefits 7.8 Approximately 3,500 employers pay FBT on small-value fringe benefits, as shown in the table. E MPLOYERS PROVIDING QUARTERLY TAXABLE FRINGE BENEFITS BETWEEN $1 AND $450 June 1997September 1997 December 1997 March 1998 All categories3,4723,6403,5733,624 7.9 There may be scope to extend the current exemption to all classes of fringe benefits. Extending this exemption would mean that employers who provide fringe benefits (other than unclassified benefits) whose total value is less than $450 a quarter would no longer be required to account for FBT. 7.10 Employers who currently provide only unclassified benefits not exceeding $450 a quarter would not have their position changed. 7.11 The advantage of this measure is that it would reduce compliance costs by allowing the threshold to apply to all classes of fringe benefits. This would mean that employers paying small-value fringe benefits outside the unclassified benefit category would no longer be liable for fringe benefit tax. Simplification of fringe benefit tax 33 7.12 The disadvantage of this measure is that employers unable to provide unclassified fringe benefits could begin paying small-value fringe benefits simply as a way to pay employees tax-free rather than for genuine business reasons. The Government does not consider this risk significant because of the limit of $75 of benefits per quarter per employee and the overall cap of $450 per quarter. 7.13 The Government concludes that this measure would act to reduce the compliance costs imposed on employers in relation to small-value fringe benefits. Removal of use-of-money interest charged on FBT paid annually 7.14 The Government is compensated for the deferral associated with employers choosing to pay FBT annually by imposing a use-of-money interest on the deferred payments. 7.15 This ensures that the decision to file and pay annually is not made simply to defer payments. Research undertaken by Inland Revenue, however, shows that taxpayers see the use-of-money interest provisions as complex and a disincentive to file annual returns. Currently, only 500 out of 12,000 eligible taxpayers pay FBT on an annual basis. 7.16 This low number could be caused by: • The use-of-money interest system itself imposing compliance costs. • Taxpayers being uncomfortable having an unquantified (at least until after year end) liability accumulating interest. 7.17 The combination of these factors appears to discourage the use of an option which has the potential to reduce compliance costs for small businesses. This in turn means a potentially useful simplification option measure is not used to its full potential. Therefore the Government proposes to remove the use-of- money interest charge from those who choose to pay fringe benefit tax annually. Including the payment of GST on the value of fringe benefits in the FBT return 7.18 Employers are required to account for GST as appropriate on the fringe benefits they provide. This is because the provision of the benefit is regarded as a supply for GST purposes. This adjustment for the GST due is carried out on the GST return. In other words, to complete a GST return employers must refer to the value of benefits provided in their FBT return and determine the value of output credits associated with the fringe benefits. Simplification of fringe benefit tax 34 7.19 There may be potential to move the payment of the GST from the GST return to the FBT return, thus reducing the risk that this adjustment is overlooked. It would also reduce the need for employers to keep records to ensure that they correctly account for GST on fringe benefits they provide. It may also simplify accounting procedures, because, like fringe benefit tax itself, GST on fringe benefits is an expense. 7.20 This change was recommended by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, who noted that it is common for taxpayers to omit the GST on fringe benefits from their GST returns. They suggested that although it may be the taxpayer’s fault, the tax system should be designed to minimise the possibility of this type of omission. The Committee supported a legislative correction to this problem. 7.21 To place the extent of this problem in context, although a small matter, this omission is the seventh most common discrepancy identified by GST audits. 7.22 Incorporating the associated GST into the FBT return would result in small compliance cost savings for the approximately 25,000 taxpayers currently required to account for GST on the fringe benefits they provide. More importantly, it removes the risk of an employer forgetting to include the payment in a GST return and incurring penalties for that oversight. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks submissions on: • removal of the requirement to pay small amounts of fringe benefit tax by applying the current $75 per quarter per employee FBT threshold to all classes of fringe benefit; • removal of use-of-money interest charged on FBT paid annually; • including the payment of GST on the value of fringe benefits in the FBT return; and • any other simplification measures which could apply to fringe benefit tax. 35 CHAPTER 8 SIMPLIFICATION OF PROVISIONAL TAX 8.1 The purpose of the provisional tax system is to ensure that taxpayers make regular payments of tax on income that is not subject to some form of withholding tax, such as PAYE. 8.2 In the Government’s view, it should be possible to make a number of changes to the provisional tax system that will act to mitigate, but not completely resolve, the concerns raised by those consulted. The intention of these changes is to reduce the impact of use-of-money interest and the compliance and penalties rules. Background 8.3 About 250,000 taxpayers pay provisional tax. They range from taxpayers with a single rental property to multi-national companies. 8.4 Provisional taxpayers can choose between two methods of calculating their provisional tax: the estimation method, or the standard method of using last year’s residual income tax 2 plus an ‘uplift factor’, currently 5 percent. In both cases a final terminal payment may be required once the taxpayer completes the end-of-year return and the tax liability is determined. 8.5 Individual taxpayers whose residual income tax is less than $30,000 and who use the standard method of calculating provisional tax are generally excluded from use-of-money interest on provisional tax payments. This is known as the ‘safe harbour’ from use-of-money interest. 8.6 Other taxpayers are subject to use-of-money interest on underpayments and overpayments. Simplifying provisional tax 8.7 The Government is considering three possible provisional tax simplification measures: • raising the ‘safe harbour’ threshold for individuals from $30,000 to $35,000 of residual income tax; 2 Tax liability less any tax credits, such as for PAYE or RWT deducted. Simplification of provisional tax 36 • removing the ‘reasonable care’ standard for all provisional taxpayers whose residual income tax is less than $35,000 (or $30,000 if the change discussed above is not made); and • allowing taxpayers to choose to have tax deducted under the withholding payment regulations. Raising the safe harbour use-of-money threshold 8.8 Consultation has identified that many taxpayers, especially smaller business taxpayers, consider the provisional tax system hard to understand, inequitable in its application and difficult to comply with. To mitigate this the Government proposes to raise the residual income tax threshold over which use-of-money interest applies. 8.9 The compliance cost advantage of raising the threshold is that it would reduce the need for taxpayers to estimate income, so would provide greater certainty in calculating provisional tax. 8.10 The disadvantage of this measure is its fiscal cost, although the Government considers the compliance cost benefits outweigh the fiscal cost. Removal of ‘reasonable care’ standard in case of estimation of provisional tax 8.11 Consultation shows that many smaller taxpayers do not like the provisional tax estimation option because: • Use-of-money interest applies. • They fear the possible penalties. At present, taxpayers can attract a penalty for ‘lack of reasonable care’ in making an estimate, possibly ‘gross carelessness’ and, if intent to underestimate is proven, evasion. The imposition of these penalties is considered as part of an Inland Revenue audit. 8.12 The automatic penalty that used to apply to underestimates of provisional tax was repealed two years ago. This alone considerably simplified estimating provisional tax. 8.13 It may be possible to further reduce the concerns of small businesses by reducing the risk associated with estimation. This could be done by setting a threshold under which taxpayers would be liable for penalties on an estimate only if they were grossly careless in making the estimate. Simplification of provisional tax 37 8.14 The benefits of this measure are that: • It would reduce the concern taxpayers face when estimating their income. • More taxpayers might estimate their liability, making their provisional tax payments during the year more accurate. Apart from the direct benefit of more accurate payment, many taxpayers would have freed-up funds to invest in their business during the year. 8.15 An appropriate threshold requires balancing the potential impact on Government revenue through deferred payments and increased certainty of treatment for taxpayers. Bearing these factors in mind, the Government concludes that a reasonable care penalty threshold should cover the bulk of taxpayers while ensuring that the tax paid by larger taxpayers was still covered by a requirement to estimate reasonably. Thus if the measure to raise the individuals’ safe harbour threshold is supported by submissions, all taxpayers with less than $35,000 residual income tax liability (or $30,000 if the ‘safe harbour’ threshold is not extended) would have to be at least grossly careless in estimating before attracting a shortfall penalty. Voluntary election into withholding payment regulations 8.16 The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 specify levels of withholding which apply to various types of income. If a payment for a service is not covered by these regulations, no withholding tax applies. Such income is subject to the usual provisional and terminal tax rules. 8.17 These regulations could be amended to allow taxpayers to: • elect into the regulations (should both the payer and the payee agree); • choose which withholding rate to apply should they elect into the regulations. 8.18 The advantage of this measure is that it would provide an option for taxpayers not currently covered by the withholding rules to gain the benefits of having their tax deducted at source. These benefits include not having to pay provisional tax and paying tax on income as it is earned. 8.19 The Government is concerned that the number of taxpayers who may use this option may be small, thus not justifying the compliance and administrative costs associated with establishing it. The Government would welcome submissions on this point. Simplification of provisional tax 38 8.20 Although the measure would reduce the compliance costs faced by those currently paying provisional tax, there would be an increase in costs for those required to withhold the tax and pay it to Inland Revenue. The Government considers this cost is outweighed by the benefits to the payee. The payer would be compensated by the benefit of holding the money deducted until it has to be paid to Inland Revenue. Finally, if the payer were already in the PAYE or withholding payment systems, the marginal cost involved in withholding tax in these further cases would probably be small. 8.21 When using this option the payee would be required to ensure that a reasonable withholding rate applied. 8.22 The Government is concerned that this option could be used to manipulate provisional tax payments. This could be done, for example, by electing an accurate withholding rate one year and then leaving the scheme the next year and returning to the provisional tax system, which would result in artificially low payments of provisional tax for that year. 8.23 To address this concern it seems appropriate that taxpayers using this option would be subject to use-of-money interest if they become liable to pay provisional tax. Alternatively, there could be a limit on the lowest withholding rate that could be elected, such as 20 percent. The Government requests submissions on this issue. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks submissions on: • increasing the threshold for the individuals’ safe harbour from use-of-money interest from $30,000 residual income tax to $35,000; • removing the reasonable care standard for all taxpayers with less than $35,000 (or $30,000) residual income tax; • allowing taxpayers to elect into the withholding payment regulations; • whether those who use this option should be liable for use-of-money interest if they become a provisional taxpayer and whether there should be limitations on the appropriate withholding rate; and • any other simplification measures which could apply to provisional tax. 39 CHAPTER 9 REVIEW OF INFORMATION ON TAX RETURNS 9.1 The Government wants to ensure that taxpayers need provide only necessary information on tax returns, and that they provide it only once. This should also apply to associated forms such as disclosure and election forms. 9.2 The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance discussed the issue of information provision and recommended that: ...the department should consider reviewing each of the purposes of the tax return to decide whether the return remains the most appropriate vehicle for these functions. It may be that the tax return could simply be a pay-in slip, with the other purposes of a tax return being dealt with independently. 9.3 The law now requires taxpayers to provide Inland Revenue with information necessary for it to assess taxpayers’ tax liability. Except in the case of wage and salary earners, who now receive income statements when appropriate, this means that taxpayers are required to provide not only a statement of their tax liability, but also the underlying accounting summaries, such as IR 10s. For example, small companies may provide the same information, such as interest income, twice, once in the return and a second time on the IR 10 form. Likewise, trustees are sometimes required to provide information that is unnecessary or duplicated elsewhere. 9.4 Although under self-assessment taxpayers have the obligation to calculate their own tax liability, tax returns are still required for a number of other reasons. These include for forecasting Government revenue, costing policy proposals, and audit and other enforcement purposes. Statistics New Zealand and other government agencies may also use the information. Information provided for these purposes would still be required. 9.5 For these reasons the Government considers a review of information requirements may only lead to small reductions in compliance and administrative costs. SUBMISSIONS The Government seeks submissions on: • information provided to Inland Revenue which taxpayers consider may be duplicated or in some way unnecessary; • comments on potential simplifications that could be made to disclosure and election forms. APPENDIX 43 APPENDIX ALIGNING TAX PAYMENTS The effect on cash flow of aligning tax payments will vary from taxpayer to taxpayer according to: • what taxes they pay; • seasonal fluctuations in income and expenditure; • how large their individual payments are; • whether they are a small employer or a large employer; and • whether they are eligible for extensions of time to make payments. Cash flow example Figures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate the cash flow effect on a hypothetical ‘average’ small business taxpayer of the three payment date options discussed in chapter 6. This taxpayer is a small employer who pays GST, FBT, provisional tax and terminal tax. The taxpayer has to make payments during the year of $79,000, made up of: • $28,000 for GST; • $20,000 for provisional tax (current year); • $9,000 of terminal tax (from previous year’s income); • $19,000 for PAYE (paid monthly); and • $3,000 for FBT. The taxpayer’s PAYE, GST and FBT liability is spread evenly during the year. GST is paid two-monthly on a category A basis, and the taxpayer has an extension of time to pay terminal tax. The taxpayer currently makes six payments of $4,666.66 for GST, three payments of $6,666.66 for provisional tax, twelve payments of $1,583.33 for PAYE, four payments of $750 for FBT and one payment of $9,000 for terminal tax. The figures show the due dates and payment size of current payments compared with the amalgamated payments resulting from each of the alignment option. The position of the payments on the vertical axis show when payments are due each month. The size of the bar of each payment is proportional to the amount of tax that would be paid.

They were from: Ernst & Young (1W) IHC New Zealand Incorporated (2W) Denham Martin & Associates (4W) Toyota Finance New Zealand Limited (5W) Tranz Rail Holdings Limited (6W) W M Patterson (7) Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (9W) Inter Church Working Party on Taxation (10) KPMG (11W) Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ) (12) New Zealand Law Society (13) Simpson Grierson (14W) PricewaterhouseCoopers (16W) Royal New Zealand Foundation for the Blind (19W) Presbyterian Support (Northern) (21W) Arthur Andersen (22W) Rudd Watts & Stone (23W) Of these submissions five related solely to the tax consequences of debt forgiveness to a family trust. Officials recommend that the provisions that exclude income arising from the forgiveness of debt in family situations be more accurately defined. It is also proposed that this concession apply irrespective of whether a charity is a beneficiary of a family trust. The changes should address the concerns raised by these submitters. ICANZ, the Law Society and Rudd Watts & Stone provided comprehensive submissions on a range of policy and drafting issues associated with the tax rules relating to financial arrangements. The remaining submissions were, by and large, issue specific. There was no major criticism of any one aspect of the new accrual rules. Where there are a number of different submissions on the same topic the submissions appear as a group. Minor drafting changes are set out at the end of this section. 4 DEBT FORGIVENESS AND FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS 5 Issue: Scope of “natural love and affection” exception Clause 21Section EH 49 Submission (2W - Hanning Connor (on behalf of its client IHC New Zealand Incorporated) (IHC); 10 - Inter Church Working Party on Taxation (ICWPT); 19W – BDO Chartered Accountants (on behalf of its client the Royal New Zealand Foundation for the Blind) (RNZFB); 21W - Presbyterian Support (Northern) (PS)) The proposed section EH 49 should be amended to clarify that a family trust that includes a charity as a beneficiary is not automatically outside the ambit of the “natural love and affection” exception. Comment The proposed section EH 49 will apply only in a trust situation if the creditor has “natural love and affection” for the beneficiaries of the trust. The provision does not specify whether the “natural love and affection” must exist between all, most or only some of the trust’s beneficiaries. The lack of detail in this area results in uncertainty for a trust that includes a charity as a beneficiary. This is because it is unclear whether a person can have “natural love and affection” for a charity. Thus, if the correct interpretation of the provision requires “natural love and affection” to exist for all of the trust’s beneficiaries, and a charity is included as a beneficiary, it is unclear whether the trust will qualify under the exemption. Indeed, a draft Inland Revenue public ruling (PU0009) suggests that the ambit of the current exemption (section EH 4(6)) does not include trusts that include a charity as a primary beneficiary. All the submitters share the concern that the lack of clarity in this area will result in a significant disincentive for people to include charities as beneficiaries of family trusts. This, it is argued, will lead to charities receiving less money from donations and gifts. The “natural love and affection” exception is aimed at distributions that are genuine gifts. Debt forgiven to trusts that have charities as beneficiaries is as much a gift as debt forgiven to trusts that have family beneficiaries. Furthermore, charities are tax- exempt. Therefore it is recommended that the general submission be accepted. However, the submitters suggest different approaches for achieving this aim in the legislation. ICWPT and RNZFB suggest that the legislation clarify that a creditor can have “natural love and affection” for a charity. Indeed, RNZFB maintains that a creditor 6 can name a charity as a beneficiary because of the “natural love and affection” that the creditor has “...for the group of people that the organisation cares for or for the cause \[the organisation\] supports”. The problem with this approach is that it is the charitable organisation itself rather than the cause that is named in the trust deed. Thus, while it may be argued that a person can have “natural love and affection” for the cause, it is difficult to maintain that a person can have “natural love and affection” for the organisation itself. Thus officials consider that, instead of deeming “natural love and affection” to exist for a charity, it is preferable to clarify that the inclusion of a charity as a beneficiary is an exception to the general rule that the creditor must have “natural love and affection” for the beneficiaries of the trust. (This is also the approach suggested by IHC and PS.) RNZFB go on to suggest that the exception be extended to include not only charities but also non-profit bodies and organisations entitled to a rebate under section KC 5 (rebate in respect of gifts of money). During consultation ICANZ also expressed the view that the proposed exception for charities should be extended to include non- profit bodies. However, officials consider that the exception should be limited to organisations and trusts carried on for “charitable purposes”. This limitation will ensure not only that the named beneficiary is an organisation or trust that is not carried on to benefit private individuals, but also that it exists for the benefit of an appreciably large section of the community. This public benefit requirement will ensure that settlors cannot receive a private advantage by naming a particular organisation in the trust deed. Therefore it is proposed that section EH 49 be amended to make an exception for trusts that name charities as beneficiaries. In other words, the fact that a trust includes a charity as a beneficiary would not, in itself, be sufficient to deny the trust the benefit of the exemption. Recommendation Officials consider that the general recommendation of submitters be accepted. That is, the legislation should clarify that the fact that a trust includes a charity as a beneficiary would not, in itself, be sufficient to deny the trust the benefit of the “natural love and affection” exemption. However, the recommendation of RNZFB and ICANZ that the exception be extended to include non-profit bodies and (in the case of RNZFB) organisations entitled to a rebate under section KC 5 should be declined. 7 Clause 21Section EH 49 Submissions (4W - Denham Martin and Associates (DM); 7 - W M Patterson; 12 - ICANZ; 13 - New Zealand Law Society (NZLS)) The concern that the proposed section EH 49 does not clarify those family trusts that are within the ambit of the exemption. While submitters suggest various solutions, they all request legislative clarification of this rule. Comment As the proposed section EH 49 is currently worded, it will apply if the creditor of a trust forgives a debt to the trust because of the “natural love and affection” that the creditor has for the “beneficiaries of the trust”. The submitters consider that it is arguable that the use of the words “beneficiaries of the trust” will require the creditor to have “natural love and affection” not only for all specified beneficiaries but also all future beneficiaries that may be added either by a power of appointment or the exercise of a discretion. Given that virtually all current trusts have either a specific or statutory power of appointment, the submitters argue that the proposed section EH 49 potentially removes most current family trusts from the ambit of the exemption. The policy underlying the exemption is to remove proximate family arrangements from the ambit of the debt forgiveness rules. While officials agree that the proposed section EH 49 requires clarification, the problem in this area is to draft a rule that, in all the different situations that can arise, correctly distinguishes between proximate family and commercial arrangements. Solutions suggested by submitters NZLS suggests that the provision could be clarified by allowing a trust to take advantage of the exemption provided that the creditor forgives the debt because of the “natural love and affection” that the creditor has “for one or more of the beneficiaries of the trust”. Officials consider that this proposal does not correctly distinguish between proximate family and commercial arrangements. That is, it is conceivable that an exemption drafted in this way could include within its ambit a trust the primary focus of which was commercial. Both ICANZ and DM suggest that the exemption should apply provided that, at the time the forgiveness is effected, the creditor has “natural love and affection” for the 8 “primary beneficiaries” of the trust. DM considers that the “primary beneficiaries” of a trust would be determined by reference to criteria such as past distributions. In addition, DM suggests that the provision should clarify that a trust that includes a company as a “primary beneficiary” should not be able to take advantage of the exemption. Officials are of the view that the suggested “primary beneficiary” test will not bring the required certainty to this area. That is, it will always be arguable whether or not a beneficiary is a “primary beneficiary”. Officials agree, however, that the provision should clarify that a trust that names a company as a beneficiary should not qualify under the exemption. While settlors may have “natural love and affection” for a company’s shareholders, they cannot have “natural love and affection” for the company itself, which is a separate legal entity distinct from its shareholders. DM offers an alternative solution that would include “debts owed in infra family circumstances, including debts owed by family trusts” within the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” and thereby outside the scope of the accrual rules. The problem that officials see with this approach is that it does not address the issue of what is meant by either “infra family circumstances” or “family trust”. Indeed, as discussed above, the challenge in this area is to draft a rule that, in all the different situations that can arise, correctly distinguishes between a proximate family and a commercial arrangement. Mr Patterson considers that the lack of clarity in this area arises not only from the scope of the words “beneficiaries of the trust” but also from the use of the term “natural love and affection”, which he considers imprecise and incapable of definition. He suggests that all remission of debt by a natural person that is, in effect, a gift should be subject to gift duty under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 rather than income tax under the accrual rules. According to the proposed definition of “gift” 1 it would not matter whether the recipient of the benefit was a natural person, a trust or a company. This, he suggests, would remove the need for the “natural love and affection” exception. Officials consider that this approach would undermine the policy underlying both the debt remission rules and, indeed, the accrual rules. An amount forgiven under a debt, being an economic gain to the debtor, should be treated as income. Any deviation from this principle should take the form of a narrow exception aimed at genuine non- 1 “...a release by a natural person of a debt owed to that natural person by another person or trust with intent thereby to diminish the value of his own estate and to increase the value of the assets of that other person or trust”. 9 commercial situations. The proposed definition of “gift” would include commercial transfers as well as gifts within families and, therefore, represents a significant deviation from this principle. “Natural love and affection” is a term used in deeds and other legal documents to denote the motive for a gift arising from a relationship. Although it is accepted that the term is incapable of precise definition, it is a phrase that is sufficiently flexible to distinguish appropriately between proximate family and commercial arrangements as society changes and develops. It is envisaged that its meaning in specific circumstances will be clarified both by case law and Inland Revenue rulings. Proposed solution Officials agree with the general theme of the submissions and accept that the proposed section EH 49 should clarify those trusts that are within the ambit of the exemption. It is considered that the main problem with the provision as it is currently drafted is that the scope of the phrase “beneficiaries of the trust” is unclear. Officials agree that this creates uncertainty for: • trusts where the trustee has the power to appoint beneficiaries for whom the settlor does not have “natural love and affection”; • discretionary trusts with a class of discretionary beneficiaries amongst whom there is an entity for whom the settlor could not have natural love and affection; and • trusts that name a charity as beneficiary. The solution officials propose is that the amended section EH 49 should require “natural love and affection” to exist between the settlor and all of the trust’s specified beneficiaries. Power of appointment The rule would also provide that the fact that a trustee had the power to appoint beneficiaries (under the trust deed or the general law) for whom the creditor did not have “natural love and affection” would not, in itself, mean that the trust could not take advantage of the exception. However the trust would cease to qualify under the exemption at the point at which a trustee exercised the power of appointment and appointed a beneficiary for whom the creditor did not have “natural love and affection”. 10 Discretionary trusts This rule would apply in the same way to a discretionary trust. That is, the trust would cease to qualify under the exemption at the point at which the trustees specify a discretionary beneficiary for whom the creditor did not have “natural love and affection”. Ordering rule At the point at which a beneficiary for whom the creditor did not have natural love and affection was specified the trust would be taxed on future debt forgiveness. Under this scenario the trust would also be taxed on the aggregate of past debt forgiveness to the extent that it had not already been distributed to beneficiaries. This is necessary in order to counter a situation whereby a beneficiary for whom the creditor does not have “natural love and affection” (such as a company) is appointed after the debt forgiveness programme is complete and receives the benefit of an asset created from tax-free debt forgiveness. There would also need to be a mechanism to determine whether the amounts that the trust has received from debt forgiveness are still contained in its funds and assets. This is because the trust may have already made a number of distributions to its beneficiaries, and the trustee could argue that these distributions have been made from amounts of forgiven debt. Officials, therefore, propose a rule that deems the order in which past distributions to beneficiaries are made. The rule would provide that, when the beneficiary is specified or appointed, all past distributions are deemed to be made: first, out of funds and assets other than debt forgiveness; and second, out of amounts received from debt forgiveness. Charities For the reasons outlined on pages 5-6 officials consider that a trust should not fail to qualify for the exemption because it specifies a charity as a beneficiary. Companies For the reasons outlined above officials consider that the provision should clarify that a trust cannot take advantage of the exemption if it specifies a company as one of the trust’s beneficiaries. Consultation Officials have consulted with ICANZ and NZLS on this approach. 11 ICANZ support the solution proposed by officials with the exception that, in its view, the exception for charities should be extended to non-profit bodies (discussed on page 6). NZLS considered that officials should give some thought to a solution based on a $27,000 exemption for remission income received by any entity, whether or not “natural love and affection” exists between the creditor and the debtor. This is similar in substance to Mr Patterson’s submission and, for the same reasons outlined above, officials do not favour its adoption. NZLS were also concerned that the solution proposed did not attempt to clarify the meaning of “natural love and affection”. Officials accepted that this was a concern but explained that it would be practically impossible to define accurately all the situations where “natural love and affection” can exist. On the specifics of the proposed rule, NZLS gave its qualified support to the approach taken by officials. However, NZLS did express concern that the proposed ordering rule may give rise to compliance costs. In addition, NZLS considered that the trigger for a trust failing to qualify under the exemption should be the point at which the beneficiary for whom the settlor does not have “natural love and affection” received a distribution rather than the point at which the beneficiary was named. Officials do not consider that this proposal should be accepted because it could result in a timing advantage to some taxpayers and, therefore, a loss of revenue for the Government. This would occur in a situation where a settlor forgave debt to a commercial trust and that trust made no distributions for a number of years. While the trust would be taxed on the aggregate of past debt forgiveness when it eventually made a distribution, the amount would not take account of the time that the trust has had the advantage of the non-taxed remission income. Officials and NZLS recommend that NZLS should be involved in the final drafting of the proposed rule. Recommendation That the general submission be accepted so that the provision clarifies those family trusts that are within the ambit of the debt forgiveness exception. 12 Clause 21Section EH 49 Submissions (12 - ICANZ; 13 - New Zealand Law Society (NZLS)) The proposed section EH 49 should be extended to Division 1 financial arrangements. Comment The Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 will introduce a new set of accrual rules (Division 2) into the Income Tax Act. The Division 2 rules will apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after the Act receives Royal assent. 2 The proposed section EH 49 clarifies the scope of the exception for debt forgiven out of “natural love and affection” and is contained in Division 2. It confirms that the exemption is available to a trust provided that the creditor has “natural love and affection” for the beneficiaries of the trust. After considering a number of submissions officials have recommended that this rule be further amended so that it clarifies how it applies to trusts where the trustee has the power to appoint, discretionary trusts, and trusts that include a charity as a beneficiary. Given its placement in Division 2, the new rule (as currently drafted) will not apply to existing (Division 1) debt forgiveness programmes. However, if the new rule applies only to Division 2 financial arrangements it will mean that a trustee wanting to take advantage of its added certainty will be required to make an election under the proposed section EH 14 and apply the Division 2 rules to all its financial arrangements. Under the proposed section EH 14(5) this would require the calculation of a transitional adjustment for all the trustee’s financial arrangements. ICANZ argues that this will put an unnecessary burden on a large number of smaller less sophisticated taxpayers. Officials agree with this submission. Therefore, it is considered that the new rule should also apply to trusts that forgive an amount owing under an existing financial arrangement on or after the date upon which the Act receives Royal assent. 2 Clause 21, proposed section EH 16 13 Recommendation That the new debt forgiveness exception apply to creditors that forgive an amount owing under an existing financial arrangement on or after the date upon which the Act receives Royal assent. 14 OTHER POLICY ISSUES 15 EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Issue: Application date for the excepted financial arrangement exclusion for “hire purchase agreement for livestock or bloodstock” Clauses 20 and 108Section EH 11 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The exclusion from the accrual rules of hire purchases of livestock or bloodstock should be backdated to 1 April 1993. Comment Hire purchase agreements entered into after 1 April 1993 are subject to the accrual rules. However, it is clear from the definition of “hire purchase agreement” and section FC 9 that hire purchase agreements of bloodstock or livestock were to remain outside the scope of the accrual rules. This is consistent with the treatment of leases of bloodstock or livestock under the specified lease and the finance lease rules. The bill inserts in the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” in Division 2 an exclusion for “hire purchase agreement for livestock or bloodstock”. An amendment should be made to the definition of “excepted financial arrangement” in Division 1 to exclude “hire purchase agreements for livestock or bloodstock” from the accrual rules. The amendment should apply from 1 April 1993 (the date hire purchase agreements were removed from the “excepted financial arrangement” definition), unless a taxpayer has treated the hire purchase as a financial arrangement in a return of income already filed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 16 Issue: Election for new Division 1 excepted financial arrangements Clause 20Section EH 11(1) “excepted financial arrangement” Submission (12 – ICANZ) Taxpayers should be able to elect that Division 1 financial arrangements entered into before enactment of this bill that are added to the list of excepted financial arrangements can continue to be treated as financial arrangements. Comment Certain additions to the list of excepted financial arrangements will apply from 1986, when the accrual rules came into effect, unless a taxpayer has taken a contrary position in tax returns already filed. The additions to the list are: • an interest-free loan repayable on demand and denominated in New Zealand dollars; • an employment contract; • an interest in a group investment fund; • an interest in a partnership or joint venture; • travellers’ cheques; and • a warranty for goods or services. The additions to the list were made retrospective because many of these arrangements were not intended to be accounted for under the accrual rules. However, if taxpayers have entered into transactions between the date the last return of income was filed and prior to enactment of this legislation on the basis that the accrual rules apply it is fair to allow the parties to account for the transaction under the accrual rules. This ensures that business decisions are not compromised by the change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 Issue: Election to treat classes of excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements Clause 21Sections EH 21 and EH 22 Submission (12 - ICANZ) Taxpayers should be entitled to treat classes of “listed” excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements. Comment Section EH 21(1)(b), (p), (q), (t) and (u) exclude small prepayments, short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services, short-term options, travellers’ cheques and small variable principal debt instruments, respectively, from the accrual rules. These exclusions are provided for compliance cost reasons. A person holding only these financial instruments need not apply the accrual rules. However, there are circumstances under which the exclusion may, in practice, impose high compliance costs on taxpayers. This is the case where a person has other similar types of financial instruments that are subject to the accrual rules. For example, where a person has to apply the accrual rules for some agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services, the requirement to isolate agreements with small amounts of prepayments could impose additional compliance costs. To cater for this situation the bill allows a person to elect to treat all excepted financial arrangements under section EH 21(1)(b), (p), (q), (t) or (u) as financial arrangements. The submission requests that taxpayers have the option to treat a class of excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements. This would enable taxpayers to treat different classes of the same type of excepted financial arrangement differently - whether on the basis of currency, term or both. For example, taxpayers could elect to treat travellers’ cheques denominated in US dollars as a financial arrangement, and those in other currencies as an excepted financial arrangement. This classification would be inconsistent with the policy objective of reducing compliance costs. Taxpayers might also engage in tax minimisation behaviour by electing to apply accrual rules to certain classes of excepted financial arrangements to their advantage. 18 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Guarantees and definition of excepted financial arrangement Clause 21Section EH 21 Submission (12 - ICANZ) An additional excepted financial arrangement should be included in the definition of excepted financial arrangement to relieve a guarantee for private and domestic purposes. Comment ICANZ propose that a guarantee of an excepted financial arrangement also be an excepted financial arrangement. The bill does not introduce any policy changes in relation to guarantees or security arrangements. Policy work is continuing in this area to determine the best method of accounting for such arrangements. This submission would best be considered as part of that project. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Revocation of election to treat excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements Clause 21Section EH 22 Submission (12 - ICANZ) A new subsection should be added to section EH 22 which permits a person who has made an election to treat an excepted financial arrangement as a financial arrangement to revoke that election. 19 Comment Under Division 1 a person can revoke an election to treat a short-term trade credit as a financial arrangement. The right to revoke elections has not been reflected in the Division 2 legislation. An ability to revoke elections should be available to cater for changing business or accounting practice. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Excepted financial arrangements that are used for private or domestic purposes Clause 21 Submission (12 - ICANZ) A new subsection should be added to the accrual rules so that no income or expenditure should arise under the Income Tax Act if a taxpayer uses an excepted financial arrangement for private or domestic purposes. Comment A number of financial arrangements that were previously within the ambit of the rules are now to be treated as excepted financial arrangements for example, travellers’ cheques, foreign currency loans by cash basis persons for private and domestic purposes. These arrangements have been excluded from the accrual rules as they impose heavy compliance costs, for example, in record keeping and applying the accrual methods. The arrangements were not excluded on the basis of whether or not income or expenditure should be deductible or assessable. This is a much wider issue. The intention is that the non-accrual provisions applying to income and expenditure will also apply to excepted financial arrangements. The Income Tax Act already has restrictions in deductions for expenditure or loss to the extent that it is of a private or domestic nature. Whether or not a gain constitutes income should be determined 20 using the rules set down in case law over many years or by consideration of the specific items to be included in gross income set out in Part C of the Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 ASSIGNMENTS AND DEFEASANCES Issue: Partial assignments and defeasances of financial arrangements Clause 21 Section EH 19(2) Submission (12 – ICANZ, 23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) Apportionment should be contemplated under section EH 19(2) to prevent the whole financial arrangement becoming excluded as a result of a partial transfer of rights and obligations under a financial arrangement. (ICANZ) Section EH 19(2) can be read to provide that a financial arrangement which under its terms contemplates from day 1 that certain rights will be disposed of absolutely will not be a financial arrangement. (Rudd Watts & Stone) Comment The submissions indicate that section EH 19(2) can be interpreted in different ways. Officials suggest the legislation be clarified to more accurately reflect its purpose. The provision contemplates a situation where there are two arrangements. The first is a financial arrangement or an excepted financial arrangement and the other is the assignment or defeasance that transfers some or all of the rights or obligations to a third party. The intended effect of the provision is to ensure the person disposing of the rights or obligations should not, as a result of entering into the arrangement to transfer those rights or obligations, become a party to a new financial arrangement. The submissions suggest that in some cases where there is a partial transfer of rights or obligations or where the assignment is contemplated at the outset of the arrangement the new rules will exclude the underlying financial arrangement from the accrual rules. The ICANZ submission gives an example of a bond issue under which a person assigns the coupon payment rights while retaining the principle repayment rights. In this case, the submission suggests the whole “arrangement” is excluded from the accrual rules. This is not the intention of the legislation and could result in financial arrangements that should be within the accrual rules being excluded. With a partial transfer, the underlying transaction should still be subject to the accrual rules. The accrual method used may be the yield to maturity method or, if this cannot 22 be applied because the consideration has been varied, a method prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In this case the relevant determination is Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but the provision be drafted more clearly to better reflect the policy intent. Issue: Assignments and defeasances with deferred consideration Clause 21Section EH 19 Submission (Matter raised by officials) An absolute assignment or legal defeasance with deferred settlement should not be excluded from creating a financial arrangement. There should be a provision to capture the deferred settlement part within the accrual rules. Comment Arrangements that transfer rights to income or obligations under a debt but allow the consideration to be deferred may contain a time value of money component. Such arrangements should be subject to the accrual rules. Absolute assignments with deferred settlement An absolute assignment is an arrangement where the assignor has completely transferred all of its rights in relation to the underlying financial arrangement. For an assignment to be absolute, the entire interest of the assignor and the income transferred has to be completely and unconditionally under the control of the assignee. The submission contemplates an assignment where the assignor assigns an income stream to the assignee but the assignee does not settle immediately. An assignment with a deferred settlement is unlikely to be unconditional until the assignor has received the full settlement for the assignment. This type of arrangement, therefore, may not qualify as an absolute assignment. It should be made clear. 23 Legal defeasance Under the bill, a legal defeasance is defined as a defeasance in which the release of a party to the financial arrangement from the primary obligation of the financial arrangement is either – (a) acknowledged formally by the creditor; or (b) acknowledged formally by a duly appointed trustee or agent of the creditor; or (c) established by legal judgement. Under the proposed definition a legal defeasance need not be settled immediately so long as the original creditor acknowledges that the debt has been transferred. For example, the original debtor (the defeasor) could enter into a defeasance agreement with a counterparty to defease the debtor’s obligations but the agreement may provide for a settlement of the defeasance agreement at a later date. If the creditor duly acknowledges the release of the debtor (defeasor) from obligations under the original debt, the defeasance becomes a legal defeasance. This type of arrangement, while qualifying as a legal defeasance, does in fact create a financial arrangement. A defeasance arrangement with deferred settlement possesses all the characteristics of a financial arrangement as set out in the proposed definition of financial arrangement (see section EH 19) and should be treated as such. Recommendation That the legislation be amended to ensure that assignments or defeasances where settlement is deferred are subject to the accrual rules for both parties to the agreement. Issue: Exemption from performing a base price adjustment where there is an absolute assignment Clause 21Section EH 43(3) Submission (22W – Arthur Andersen) For certainty it would be desirable to have a provision exempting a person who has an obligation to pay amounts under a financial arrangement that has been absolutely assigned from calculating a base price adjustment. 24 Comment The bill treats the creditor in a defeasance situation as a party to a continuing arrangement. The approach accords with the substance of the transaction because, from the creditor’s point of view, the only change is in the party making the payments. A specific provision is necessary because legal defeasances are executed by way of novation. Under a novation the original arrangement between a debtor and a creditor is extinguished and a new arrangement entered into. The agreement of all three parties to the arrangement is necessary. Assignments of income, on the other hand, are not normally entered into by way of novation. A parallel provision to that applying to defeasances is not, therefore, required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption for original creditor to perform a base price adjustment when the debt is legally defeased by the debtor Clause 21Section EH 43(3) Submission 1 (Matter raised by officials) The original creditor to a debt should be exempt from calculating a base price adjustment only when a debt is transferred by defeasance if the terms of the new arrangement are substantially similar to the terms of the arrangement defeased. Comment Section EH 43(3) provides that the original creditor of a debt which has been legally defeased does not perform a base price adjustment at the time the original creditor acknowledges that the debtor has been released from the obligations under the original arrangement. This is because the original creditor, while providing the necessary acknowledgement to release the debtor from the obligations, may not be an active party to the legal defeasance arrangement. It assumes that the creditor’s right to income are not amended materially. 25 Under a legal defeasance the creditor will remain entitled to the consideration under the same terms as provided by the original arrangement but payment is from the defeasance counterparty. Section EH 43(3) is needed to ensure that the creditor’s position is not affected by the action of the debtor who has legally defeased a debt. The definition of legal defeasance does not preclude the creditor having a significant involvement in the defeasance arrangement. At law, a legal defeasance by the debtor creates a new financial arrangement for the creditor. For tax purposes, if the creditor is an active participant in the process and the only modification to the terms, other than the party responsible for meeting the obligations, of the new arrangement is a change to the party responsible for meeting the obligation, then the base price adjustment should apply. Recommendation That section EH 43(3) apply if the only change, as a result of a defeasance, is to the party obliged to repay the debt. Submission 2 (Matter raised by officials) Section EH 43(3) provides that the original party to an arrangement which is defeased does not do a base price adjustment at the time of the defeasance. The party will still perform a base price adjustment eventually but it is unclear what the consideration to be taken into account in that base price adjustment should be. Comment Section EH 43(3), while ensuring that the creditor does not perform a base price adjustment at the time a debt has been legally defeased by the debtor, does not go far enough. At law, the effect of a defeasance is to bring the debt between the parties to an end. It is replaced by a new debt. The legislation, however, for the reasons stated above, says that no base price adjustment is required for the defeased debt, as the creditor’s involvement in the legal defeasance is a passive one. Nevertheless, the original arrangement has ceased to exist. Therefore a provision that states that the creditor must continue to account for the original debt as if it had not been defeased is required. In addition, the legislation must ensure that the creditor takes into account all the consideration under the arrangements when the base price adjustment is eventually calculated. 26 Recommendation That section EH 43(3) be amended to ensure that when the creditor does a base price adjustment of a debt that has been legally defeased, the debt is treated as if the defeasance had not occurred and the cashflows under both the original and new debt are included in the base price adjustment. Issue: Application date for rules associated with assignments and defeasances Clauses 20 and 21 Submission (22W - Arthur Andersen; 23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The proposed treatment for Division 2 financial arrangements regarding the consequences of legal defeasances and absolute assignments should apply to Division 1 financial arrangements if the assignment or defeasance occurs after the date of Royal assent. (Arthur Andersen) Holders of financial arrangements should not have to perform a base price adjustment on the legal defeasance of a Division 1 financial arrangement. (Rudd Watts & Stone) Comment The application dates associated with the accrual rules are intended to give flexibility to taxpayers. The “new” accrual rules as set out in Division 2 apply to arrangements entered into on or after the date this bill receives the Royal assent. The general application date is therefore determined by the date of entry into an arrangement. The rule is prospective so that arrangements entered into on the basis of the existing provisions are not disturbed. Taxpayers do, however, have the option of moving all financial arrangements onto the new rules if they perform a transitional calculation under section EH 14. The submissions request that all or some of the rules in Division 2 relating to assignments and defeasances also apply to Division 1 financial arrangements. One reason given is that there is no policy reason for this not to occur. The other reason is that the debt parking anti-avoidance provision is applied on this basis and therefore the generally pro-taxpayer defeasance rules should be similarly applied. 27 These reasons are not compelling. First, taxpayers can use the rules set out in Division 2 if they choose to make a transitional adjustment for all financial arrangements. This will mean that there is a trade-off between any compliance costs associated with the transition and the tax costs or benefits associated with applying the new rules generally. Second, the debt parking rules are an exception to the general application provision. Other changes to legislation in Division 2, some of which may have unfavourable effects on taxpayers, will not apply to transactions already entered into. Third, the amendments for assignments and defeasances are linked with other key aspects of Division 2, in particular the definition of financial arrangement and the base price adjustment. Enabling the rules to apply to Division 1 arrangements without also amending related sections may be impractical. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 BAD DEBTS Issue: Bad debts occurring between associated parties Clauses 20 and 21Sections EH 5 and EH 51 Submission (13 - New Zealand Law Society) A lender whose loan to an associated person goes bad should be entitled to a deduction if either: • the bad debt loss is deductible on ordinary capital/revenue principles; or • at the time the associated person has assessable income as a result of debt remission. Comment The review of the accrual rules did not specifically address issues associated with the treatment of bad debts arising from financial arrangements. Bad debt deductions were recently reviewed. The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1993 confirmed that the accrual rules operate as a code for deduction of bad debts arising from financial arrangements and confirmed that deductions between associates were inappropriate. The prohibition against the deduction of associated person bad debts was part of the accrual rules when they were first enacted. At that time it was considered that the non-arm’s length relationship between the borrower and the lender could create avoidance opportunities if bad debt deductions were permitted. In 1992, the Valabh Committee recommended that the accrual rules be modified to allow persons in the business of lending money deductions for losses of principal in respect of loans to associated persons. The Government did not accept the proposals of the Valabh Committee that the accrual rules be modified because: • It would make it easier for business lenders to capitalise their subsidiaries with debt instead of equity, thereby allowing any losses from the investment to be deductible while gains would not be included in income. • The common law test as to whether a loan that goes bad was on revenue account (that is, a bad debt deduction would be allowed) or on capital account (that is, no bad debt deduction would be allowed) is difficult to apply in practice. 29 • A change could also provide scope for taxpayers to claim double deductions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Allowable deductions – bad debts Clauses 20 and 21Sections EH 5 and EH 51 Submission (12 - ICANZ) The reference to “the person” in section EH 5(2)(a) should be removed as it inappropriately restricts bad debt deductions in certain circumstances. Comment The effect of this submission would be to allow a recipient of a financial arrangement to claim a deduction for a bad debt where the income from the financial arrangement was accrued by an earlier holder. This would apply in particular to a financial arrangement held by an executor or administrator of a deceased estate. The provisions in this bill treat a financial arrangement as being transferred on the date of death of a party to a financial arrangement and on distribution of a financial arrangement to a beneficiary under a will. Crystallisation of tax at death recognises that there has been a real transfer of ownership from a deceased taxpayer to the estate. The transfer ensures that any gain or loss associated with the financial arrangement is calculated from the market price at the time of transfer, not the original cost to the transferor. Allowing a provision to be enacted which enables an executor to take a bad debt deduction because a previous holder returned income from an asset during the period it is held is inconsistent with these amendments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 30 FINANCE LEASES Issue: Application of sections FC 8A to FC 8G Clause 28Sections FC 8A to FC 8G Submission (12 - ICANZ) It is unclear whether sections FC 8A to FC 8G apply to all leases or only to finance leases. If the sections apply only to finance leases they should be clarified with a specific reference to finance leases, or they should be prefaced with the comment that the sections apply only to finance leases. Comment Sections FC 8A to FC 8G apply only to finance leases. Leases entered into after the implementation date that are not finance leases (that is, operating leases) are dealt with under section EO 2A. Leases entered into before the implementation date are dealt with under the specified lease rules or under section EO 2. To ensure it is clear that sections FC 8A to FC 8G apply only to finance leases, sections FC 8B, FC 8C(2) and FC 8E should be amended with specific references to finance leases. (The remaining sections already contain references to finance leases.) Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Finance leases Clause 28 Submission (13 - New Zealand Law Society) In some cases it is only with the benefit of hindsight that it can be ascertained whether a lease is a finance lease. If a lease is a finance lease and this is determined part-way through the lease term, when should the necessary adjustments be made? 31 Comment The Law Society asks when adjustments should be made if a taxpayer determines that a lease is a finance lease during the lease term. It gives the example of a lease for which, when entered into, there is no expectation by the parties that the lease asset will be transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term. Therefore the lease is not treated as a finance lease but as an operating lease. Circumstances then change and the lease is terminated and the lease asset is acquired by the lessee. The Society considers that it is then clear that the lease is a finance lease under paragraph (a). Therefore adjustments to the expenditure and income for prior years are necessary. We disagree with the example given. Paragraph (a) is only intended to include leases under which the lease asset transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term. If at the beginning of the lease it is not contemplated that the lease asset will transfer to the lessee at the end of the lease the lease does not meet the test in paragraph (a). One of the aims of the finance lease definition is certainty. When taxpayers enter into a lease they should generally be able to ascertain whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the finance lease definition are drafted so that it is clear from the outset whether these factors will be characteristics of the lease. However, under paragraph (c) it is possible that with the benefit of hindsight that a taxpayer could determine that a lease is a finance lease. For example, if there are two or more consecutive or successive leases of the same lease asset to the same lessee and the Commissioner treats those leases as one lease, the lease is for 75% or more of the asset’s estimated useful life, and the second, or subsequent lease, was not contemplated when the first lease was entered into, it is only with the benefit of hindsight that the taxpayer can determine that the lease is a finance lease. If a taxpayer determines that a lease is a finance lease during the lease term, we consider that rather than re-assessing prior year returns any necessary adjustment should be made in the income year that the taxpayer determines that the lease is a finance lease. Accordingly, we recommend that a provision targeted at such leases be inserted into the finance lease rules to allow taxpayers to make adjustments in the income year in which they determine that their lease is a finance lease. Recommendation An amendment is necessary allowing taxpayers to make adjustments in the income year they determine that their lease is a finance lease. 32 Issue: Definition of “finance lease” Clause 47(2) Submission 1 (6W – Tranz Rail; 11W – KPMG) Taxpayers should have the option to elect into the new finance lease regime where a lease has financing characteristics, in particular if a lessee has the option to purchase the lease asset at the end of the lease term for market value. Comment Under paragraph (b) of the proposed “finance lease” definition, a lease is a finance lease if under the lease the lessee or an associate of the lessee has the option of acquiring the lease asset for an amount that is likely to be substantially lower than the lease asset’s market value on the date of acquisition. The submissions propose that if the lessee has the option to acquire the lease asset at market value at the end of the lease term the lease should also be a finance lease. We disagree. The finance lease definition is based on the definition in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 18. In that definition a lease is classified as a finance lease if the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership to the lessee. The accounting standard then goes to list characteristics of a lease that could classify it as a finance lease. The proposed definition of finance lease in section OB 1 is based on some of those characteristics. We have removed ambiguities and attempted to make the definition as certain as possible for people entering into leases. The discussion document Taxation of Financial Arrangements noted that “... \[l\]eases that are financing arrangements are essentially similar to deferred property settlements and, therefore, should be within the accrual rules.” If the lessee has the option of acquiring the lease asset for market value at the end of the lease term the lessee is not “financing” the purchase of the lease asset through the lease. Lessees get no financial benefit from leasing the asset if they purchase the lease asset at the end of the lease term, so the lease should not be a finance lease. However, if one of the conditions of the lease was that the lease asset transferred to the lessee (as opposed to the lessee having the option to purchase the lease asset) at the end of the lease for market value the lease would fall within paragraph (a) of the finance lease definition. If a lease does not fall within the finance lease definition lease it is an operating lease. Section EO 2A deals with the deductions available to a lessee under an operating 33 lease. Over the term of the lease the deductions under the finance lease rules and under section EO 2A are the same, but under the finance lease rules the deductions for the lessee are accelerated. This is because the lessee can deduct interest on a yield to maturity basis, and because the lessee, not the lessor, is treated as owning the lease asset the lessee is entitled to a deduction for depreciation. Even if the lessee has the option of purchasing the lease asset for market value at the end of the lease there is no guarantee that the lessee will purchase the lease asset. Suppose the lessee treats the lease as a finance lease and then does not purchase the lease asset. The deductions available to the lessee over time are the same except the timing of those deductions has been accelerated under the finance lease rules. We are opposed to taxpayers having the option to treat what we consider are non- financing transactions as finance leases. In their submission KPMG note that the elective process has worked successfully elsewhere in the accrual rules. They give the example in section EH 10 which allows taxpayers to elect to treat short-term trade credits as financial arrangements. However, short term trade credits are excluded from the accrual rules for compliance cost reasons, while operating leases are excluded from the accrual rules because they are not a financing transactions and are not similar to deferred property settlements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (5W – Toyota Finance New Zealand Limited) The finance lease definition should be based on an asset’s “estimated useful life”, rather than its “remaining estimated useful life”. Comment Paragraph (c) of the proposed “finance lease” definition requires the lease term to be for 75% or more of the lease asset’s remaining estimated useful life. In its report Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime the Valabh Committee recommended that leases with financing characteristics be included within the scope of the accrual rules. This draft of the finance lease definition referred to “remaining useful life of the lease asset”, and in turn we adopted similar words. “Estimated useful life” is used in the depreciation rules. An asset’s depreciation rate is based on the asset’s estimated useful life. The estimated useful life of an asset is 34 the period over which the asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or used in carrying on a business in New Zealand. “Remaining estimated useful life” would introduce a new concept that is inconsistent with the depreciation rules. It would be difficult to determine when an asset was first depreciated, and the use of the term would also potentially widen the scope of the “finance lease” definition to include the lease of an asset if the asset is older than its estimated useful life. If the asset was already as old as its estimated useful life, any lease would be treated as a finance lease, even if the lease was for a single day. This is an absurd result. Identical leases of the same types of assets would be treated in different ways, depending on the age of the leased assets. This would be difficult to comply with for lessors who are entering into leasing transactions on a daily basis. For the compliance cost reasons set out above we recommend that the definition refer to “estimated useful life” rather than “remaining useful life”. We also recommend that “estimated useful life” be linked to the estimated useful life as determined by the Commissioner when setting depreciation rates. Otherwise taxpayers could inappropriately determine their own “estimated useful life” for leased assets under the finance lease rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 3 (5W - Toyota Finance New Zealand Limited) The finance lease definition should apply if the lease term is more than 75% of the estimated useful life, not 75% or more. Comment Paragraph (c) of the “finance lease” definition applies if a taxpayer leases an asset for 75% or more of the asset’s estimated useful life. 75% of an estimated useful life is usually a round figure. For example, if an asset’s estimated useful life is four years, 75% of the estimated useful life is three years. Lease terms are usually for standard periods. Therefore it is more practical for the 35 finance lease definition to apply to leases of more than 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Outstanding balance Clause 47 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A definition of “outstanding balance” should be inserted in section OB 1 for the purpose of section FC 8C. Comment “Outstanding balance” is used in section FC 8C to describe the value for which a lease asset is treated as transferred when a lease terminates early. “Outstanding balance” is defined in section OB 1 for the specified lease rules. The definition should be amended to cover finance leases. For the purpose of the finance lease rules the term should refer to the amount of the loan outstanding, together with any interest or penalty provided for under the lease that is owing at the date the lease terminates. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 36 TECHNICAL AND DRAFTING ISSUES 37 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Issue: Branch equivalent income Clause 11 Submission 1 (12 - ICANZ) The proposed section CG 11(5) should be clarified so that the “consideration for a financial arrangement”, as calculated under that provision, is used in the calculation of income and expenditure in relation to the financial arrangement in all subsequent years. Comment The purpose of section CG 11(5) is to calculate the consideration for a financial arrangement where a foreign company does not have attributed foreign income or loss in a preceding period. The consideration for the arrangement is relevant for calculating the amount of income or expenditure and the base price adjustment in all years that the company is a party to the arrangement (provided the company remains subject to the controlled foreign company rules). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 2 (23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) It is not apparent why section CG 11(5)(a) has been repealed but not replaced. Comment It was not intended that section CG 11(5)(a) be replaced. As set out in the discussion document Taxation of Financial Arrangements, chapter 18, paragraph 18.16, the definition of “acquisition price” in section CG 11(5)(a) does not give the correct result when an arrangement matures or is transferred and a base price adjustment is calculated The current provision provides that the acquisition price is the value of that arrangement at the end of the immediately preceding period. This means the acquisition price will fluctuate from year to year. 38 If a person had attributed foreign income in a previous period the consideration for the financial arrangement should be that calculated under the accrual rules or the new section CG 11(5). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date for section EH 4(9)(c)(iv) Clause 20Section EH 4(9)(c)(iv) Submission (23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The proposed section EH 4(9)(c)(iv) should only apply to debts sold at a discount on or after the date the bill receives the Royal assent. Comment Section EH 5A applies to debts sold at a discount on or after the date the bill receives the Royal assent. Under section EH 4(9)(c)(iv) a financial arrangement is deemed to be remitted where the financial arrangement is a debt that is sold at a discount to a person associated with the debtor under the circumstances described in section EH 5A. The submitters recommend that section EH 4(9)(c)(iv) apply only to debts sold at a discount on or after the date of Royal assent. However, the section applies only under the circumstances described in section EH 5A. Under section EH 5A(1) the section applies to a financial arrangement that is a debt which is sold at discount to a person associated with the debtor on or after the date the bill receives the Royal assent. Section EH 4(9)(c)(iv) can only apply to debts sold at a discount on or after the date the bill receives the Royal assent. Therefore the legislation already provides for the outcome sought in the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 39 Issue: Meaning of “holding or dealing” Clause 21Section EH 5(2) Submission (12 - ICANZ) Section EH 5(2) refers to a person “holding or dealing” in financial arrangements. Clarification of what is meant by “holding or dealing” is required. Comment The words “holding” and “dealing” are used in many other provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. For example, “holding” is used in section CF 2, which sets out the meaning of the term “dividends”, and “dealing” is used in section CD 1(2)(b), which applies to taxpayers who sell land and whose business is dealing in land. The words are not defined elsewhere in the Act, and we consider that defining these terms is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Purpose provision Clause 21Section EH 17 Submission (23 - Rudd Watts & Stone) The purpose provision should make reference to the fact that the accrual rules have removed the capital/revenue distinction in respect of financial arrangements. Comment Purpose provisions are concerned with why the law was enacted. They are intended to assist taxpayers appreciate the general intention of the particular part. There should be no conflict however between the purpose provision and a later specific provision. The accrual rules did remove the capital/revenue distinction for financial arrangements but it has not been fully eradicated. It remains, for example, in relation to bad debts. It is not considered appropriate to include reference to the 40 capital/revenue distinction in the purpose provision as it may conflict with later provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of accrual rules to non-resident trustees of a non-qualifying trust Clause 21Section EH 18(1)(c) Submission (23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) Non-resident trustees of non-qualifying trusts are, as a matter of policy, outside the New Zealand tax net and therefore should not be subject to the accrual rules. Comment Non-residents are not subject to the accrual rules. However, under the trust rules a trust settled by a New Zealand resident is subject to tax on its world-wide income irrespective of the residency of the trustee of the trust. In order to ensure amounts derived from outside New Zealand are subject to the accrual rules section HH 4(3A) of the Income Tax Act 1994 specifically deems non-resident trustees to be resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the accrual rules. There are exceptions to the general rules that non-resident trusts settled by a resident are subject to tax as if they were residents. These are set out in section HH 4(6). The amendment in this bill is to ensure that the New Zealand sourced income of the non-resident trustee from financial arrangements is also treated as if the trustee were a resident where the settlor is a New Zealand resident, that is, the accrual rules should apply. This is consistent with the general scheme of the trust rules. Section EH 18(1)(c), however, will apply to all non-resident trustees, so is too broad. The requirement for non-resident trustees to account for financial arrangements under the accrual rules should apply only if they are treated as if they were residents under the trust rules. 41 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Composite financial arrangements Clause 21Section EH 20 Submission (12 - ICANZ) Section EH 20, which deals with composite financial arrangements, should be simplified by removal of the words “income” “gain” “loss” and “expenditure”. Comment Section EH 20 exists to enable any amounts solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement that is part of a composite financial arrangement to be excluded from the accrual rules. The submission suggests replacing the words “income” “gain” “loss” or “expenditure” with the words “any amount” in order to simplify the legislation. The current provision replicates section EH 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The references to an amount of “income, gain, loss or expenditure” were reviewed as part of the core provisions and retained. They reflect the wording in the original accrual legislation. The words reflect both the “net” and “gross” concepts embodied in the Income Tax Act and enable the amounts solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement to be calculated in a number of ways. This may be appropriate given the different types of composite financial arrangements that could be subject, in part, to the accrual rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 Issue: Cash basis concession Clause 21Section EH 24 Submission 1 (12 – ICANZ) Expenditure should offset income in the cash basis person concession in section EH 24(1)(a). Comment As currently drafted, the cash basis concession applies to natural persons if the absolute value of income or expenditure from financial arrangements is $100,000 or less in an income year. The submission recommends that expenditure should offset income in the cash basis person concession. The cash basis concession was intended to apply to small and, therefore, unsophisticated taxpayers who could not be expected to incur the costs of complying with the more complex aspects of the accrual rules. It was not intended that those taxpayers with large amounts of both income and expenditure should be exempt from the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (12 - ICANZ) The meaning of the term “absolute value” should be clarified. Comment To determine whether they are cash basis persons, taxpayers must calculate the “absolute value” of their income and expenditure from financial arrangements under section EH 24. “Absolute value” in sections CG 11(5) and EH 24(1) means the arithmetical sign of the result of the calculation or the components of the calculation, as the case may be, are ignored. The words “absolute value” are used to ensure that income does not offset the expenditure. The submission recommends that the term “absolute value” should be defined. 43 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 3 (9W - Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The threshold for income and expenditure should be increased to $120,000, being 12% of $1,000,000. This would provide consistency with the current regime. Under the existing law the income threshold represents approximately 12% of the face value threshold. Comment Section EH 24 provides an exemption from the spreading provisions for cash basis persons. They do not have to apply the accrual rules if the absolute value of their income and expenditure from financial arrangements, calculated under the accrual rules, in an income year added together is $100,000 or less. The submission recommends that this threshold be increased to $120,000. When the accrual rules were introduced in 1986 a 12% nominal return on debt would have been the norm. We consider that in today’s economic environment 10% is generous and therefore the threshold should remain at $100,000. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 4 (Matter raised by officials) Section EH 24(1)(b) should refer to “absolute value” rather than “total value”. Comment The cash basis person provision, section EH 24, refers to the “total value” of financial arrangements. To prevent taxpayers offsetting their financial arrangements the section should refer to “absolute value”. If it is not amended a taxpayer with $10,000,000 of assets and $10,000,000 of liabilities might be able to account on a cash basis, which is not appropriate. The cash basis rules should apply to low dollar value financial arrangements only. 44 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 5 (Matter raised by officials) The formula in section EH 24(3) should be amended so that accrual income refers to “income which would be derived under the accrual rules for the period....if the person were not a cash basis holder”. Comment Section EH 24(3) sets out the formula to determine if a person’s deferred income and expenditure exceeds the required threshold in section EH 24(2). One of the variables in the formula is accrual income. Currently the variable is defined as “income derived under the accrual rules for the period...” without any qualification as to the status of the person during that period. The complication arises in the current wording because a person may not be required to apply the accrual rules during that period, so the term “accrual” income in that formula may be taken as zero. This would be the wrong result. The formula compares what would have been income under the accrual rules with the cash basis income regardless of the actual status of the person. The same problem applies in the definition of accrual expenditure in the formula. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Meaning of purchase price Clause 21Section EH 23 Submission (12 – ICANZ, 23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) Under section EH 23 property transferred under a financial arrangement will be treated elsewhere in the Act as being transferred for its purchase price. Purchase price is not defined. It should be clarified what is meant by purchase price. 45 Comment Proposed section EH 23 sets out the relationship between the accrual rules and the rest of the Act. In particular section EH 23(3) deals with property transferred under the accrual rules and the value of the property is treated as being transferred for under other provisions of the Act. As currently drafted the provision refers to purchase price. Purchase price is not defined. The provision should refer to the value of the property or services as determined under section EH 45(3). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Method of measuring accrual income and expenditure Clause 21Section EH 30-37 Submission (12 - ICANZ) Consideration should be given to removing the existing method of calculating accrual income and expenditure and replacing it with a different method which treats financial arrangements in a similar way to trading stock. Comment This proposal suggests an alternative way that income and expenditure from financial arrangements can be accrued. It suggests that this could reduce the number of determinations on issue and simplify this area of tax law. The main methods of calculating income or expenditure from a financial arrangement are the yield to maturity method and straight line method. The legislation does not elaborate on how to calculate income or expenditure using these methods. The detail of the methods are set out in determinations. Taxpayers can use other methods of accrual provided they are applied to all financial arrangements in a class, are consistent with methods used for financial reporting and the results are not materially different from those obtained using the methods required by legislation. The methodology suggested could therefore be applied under current rules if the results obtained are not materially different from those obtained using the yield to maturity method. 46 Officials agree that the accrual determinations need to be reviewed as a result of the amendments contained in this bill, the rewrite of the Income Tax Act and changes in the methods used to accrue financial arrangements denominated in a foreign currency. The methodology suggested by ICANZ would best be considered as part of the ongoing work undertaken by Inland Revenue on accrual determinations. Recommendation That the submission be considered in more detail as part of a review of the accrual determinations. Issue: The relationship between the proposed sections EH 31(2) and EH 34-37 should be clarified Clause 21Sections EH 31 - 37 Submission (23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) Proposed section EH 31(1) provides that, subject to section EH 32 (straight line method) and EH 33 (market valuation method), a party must use the YTM method “unless the Commissioner accepts an alternative method.” The requirements of an alternative method to yield to maturity are set out in section EH 31(2). Sections EH 34,35,36 and 37 then set out other possible methods, not all of which necessarily comply with the proposed section EH 31(2). The relationship between the provisions should be clarified. Comment Section EH 31(2) sets out the criteria taxpayers must consider if they want to use an alternative method to the yield to maturity method. Sections EH 34 to EH 37 only apply if a person cannot use the yield to maturity method and cannot or does not choose to use the market valuation method. These methods are not required nor intended to meet the criteria in EH 31(2). Officials therefore do not consider that the relationship between the provisions needs clarification. 47 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deemed transfers at market price Clause 21Section EH 42 Submission (Matters raised by officials) The bill has not provided for deemed consideration where a financial arrangement is transferred on the death of a taxpayer. It is not necessary to provide that distribution in specie is an event that will trigger a base price adjustment. This is clearly a transfer. Comment Section EH 42 provides for the circumstances under which a base price adjustment should be performed. The base price adjustment is a wash-up calculation typically performed at the end of the term of a financial arrangement to ensure that all realised gains and losses under a financial arrangement are subject to tax. In performing the base price adjustment, a taxpayer will take into account the amount of consideration received and paid in relation to the financial arrangement. Under most of the circumstances provided for in section EH 42, the amount of consideration received and paid can be determined because an arm’s length transaction actually occur (i.e. a sale or transfer, or a financial arrangement matures). The current act deems a transfer to occur when a resident becomes a non-resident. The discussion document Taxation of Financial Arrangements proposed that a transfer of financial arrangement should also be deemed to have occurred, at market, in the following situations: • at the time a financial arrangement is distributed in specie; or • at the time of death of a party to the financial arrangement; or • at the time the trustee to the deceased person’s estate distributes a financial arrangement to a beneficiary. 48 It was also proposed in the discussion document that deemed transfers are to occur at market value. Market value is preferred over other valuation methods because it is independently verifiable and represents the most reliable estimate of the value of the financial arrangement on the date of the deemed transfers. This policy has not been reflected in the bill. This should be corrected. In addition, section EH 42(3) which relates to in specie distributions can be deleted as it replicates section EH 42(1)(a). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exceptions from performing a base price adjustment Clause 21Section EH 43 Submission 1 (12 – ICANZ, 9W - Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The time limit for temporary residents who are cash basis persons and therefore exempt from performing a base price adjustment should be aligned with the time limit for temporary residents in the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. Comment Proposed section EH 43(1) excludes temporary cash basis persons from the requirement to do a base price adjustment when they become non-resident if this occurs on or before three years of the date they became resident. For example, someone who becomes a resident of New Zealand for tax purposes on 1 November 1999 is not required to do a base price adjustment when they stop being resident, so long as this occurs before 1 November 2002. Section CG 15(2)(f)(iv) is also an exemption for temporary residents. The section excludes from the foreign investment fund rules interests held by natural persons if they had an interest in the fund before becoming resident in New Zealand for the period that falls before the first day of the fourth income year succeeding the income year in which they first became a resident of New Zealand. For example, those who become resident on 1 November 1999 do not have to calculate their FIF income on any FIF they held from 1 November 1999 to 31 March 2003. 49 The submission recommends that the time limit test for the exemption from doing a base price adjustment if the taxpayer becomes non-resident should be aligned with the time limit for temporary residents in the FIF rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 2 (9W - Deliotte Touche Tohmatsu) Temporary residents should not be required to perform a base price adjustment for any financial arrangement that they are a party to on becoming resident and that matures while they are temporarily resident in New Zealand. Comment Taxpayers are subject to the accrual rules when they become a New Zealand resident. They must perform a base price adjustment when any of their financial arrangements mature, because any gain or loss from the financial arrangement is realised. Also, if a financial arrangement matures within three years of someone becoming resident it is difficult to determine whether that person is a temporary resident until he or she becomes non-resident. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Base price adjustment Clauses 21Section EH 44 Submission (13 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed EH 44, the base price adjustment, includes reference to amounts remitted by law. The inclusion of the reference to remission by law represents a change from the existing position. 50 Comment This change is intended. The current provision refers to “any amounts that have been remitted by the person”. If a debt has been forgiven by operation of statute it has not been forgiven “by the person”. This means the base price adjustment could give an allowable deduction to holders for what is effectively a bad debt. Bad debts should be subject to the bad debt provisions in section EH 51. The change was noted in the discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements, chapter 11, paragraph 11.27. Recommendation That it be noted that the reference to remission by operation of law is a deliberate change from the existing provision. Issue: Deductibility of expenditure from financial arrangements Clause 21Section EH 44(2) Submission (12 – ICANZ, 16W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) An automatic deduction for investors in a financial arrangement should be restored. (ICANZ, PWC) Legislation should be enacted to confirm that a deduction can be claimed for a loss incurred on a financial arrangement where there was a possibility that a taxable gain could have arisen at the time the arrangement is entered into. (PWC) Comment The discussion document and the resulting legislation propose the removal of the holder/issuer distinction. This was proposed because the distinction is not relevant for many derivative arrangements such as forward contracts and options and it is not always certain or obvious which party to an arrangement is an issuer and which is a holder. It is acknowledged that removing the holder/issuer distinction will simplify the application of the accrual rules. The main area of concern arising from this change is the removal of the automatic deduction (a deduction not subject to a “nexus with income” or business test) available under the accrual rules for some parties to financial arrangements. 51 Submitters claim that extending the interest deductibility test to all parties to a financial arrangement to determine whether an expenditure or loss is deductible creates too much uncertainty particularly in the area of hedging contracts which are passive investments. This issue, however, relates to the nature of the interest deductibility test and the case law and interpretations that have developed around it. The ICANZ submission recognises that a deduction may be secured under the general provision using similar arguments to those accepted by the Court of Appeal in Inglis v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,180. The accrual rules calculate the quantum of gains and losses. The core provisions and the common law determine what is included in income and what costs are deductible. In most cases accrual expenditure will be deductible either under the general provisions because there is a nexus with the income earning process, the business test is satisfied or because of a special rule in the accrual rules which allows a deduction for losses associated with gains that have been taxed in earlier periods but are never realised. The business test was added in 1987 to coincide with the introduction of the accruals legislation. This was to deal with deductions for deemed interest where there were arrangements with no principal. The breadth of the interest deductibility test, in the context of derivatives (such as forward contracts), has not been tested in the courts. Currently “issuers” are subject to the interest deductibility provisions. Issuers include purchasers of property where settlement is deferred, and persons entering into forward contracts, futures contracts or options. Some of these arrangements are substitutes for forward contracts for foreign exchange and can be used as hedging instruments. The proposal to apply the general deductibility rule builds on the current structure of the Income Tax Act. While acknowledging concerns associated with the interest deductibility test, officials believe the uncertainty needs to be weighed up against the benefits of removing the automatic deduction for holders. The benefits include: • Consistency with the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, which will separate the timing rules from issues of assessibility and deductibility. • Both parties to a financial arrangement are treated in a consistent way. • Reductions in incentives to structure transactions to take advantage of the right to an automatic deduction. • Enables the holder/issuer distinction, which is complex and itself uncertain in its application, to be removed. 52 A review of the interest deductibility rules is a more appropriate forum for resolving any uncertainty in this area. That review is currently part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “Consideration” definition Clause 20Section EH 45 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The consideration definition in section EH 45 should be amended so that the “lowest price” paragraph appears before the “cash price” paragraph. Comment “Consideration” is defined in section EH 45. The paragraphs of the consideration definition must be applied in the order in which they appear, starting with the paragraph (a). As currently drafted, the cash price is the price to be used if property passes under a financial arrangement if there is a cash price under the Credit Contracts Act 1981, regardless of whether the parties have agreed a lowest price. The definition of “consideration” would give odd results if the parties had agreed to a lowest price. For example, if there is a cash price for the property passing under the financial arrangement but the parties agree a lowest price before to entering into the financial arrangement the value of the property is the lowest price rather than the cash price. As currently drafted, the consideration definition in section EH 45 requires that the cash price be used. Officials recommend that the paragraphs be reordered so the lowest price paragraph applies in cases where there is a lowest price, and if there is no lowest price then the cash price paragraph applies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 53 Issue: Lowest price clause in composite financial arrangements Clause 21Section EH 45(4) Submission (12 - ICANZ) The parties to a financial arrangement should be entitled to use the “lowest price” clause in the proposed EH 45(3)(b) irrespective of whether the arrangement is part of another financial arrangement. Comment The legislation proposes to exclude the application of the “lowest price” provisions to agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services where the agreements are part of a composite financial arrangement. This is because a composite arrangement that includes an agreement for the sale and purchase of property cannot be accurately characterised as such an agreement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Debt parking Clauses 20 and 21Sections EH 5A and EH 50 Submission 1 (12 - ICANZ) ICANZ questions the need for a specific provision to attribute income to debtors for all transfers of financial arrangements at 80% of the remaining amount payable under the arrangement. A more appropriate approach would be to amend or add to the anti- avoidance provisions to target instances of abuse. Comment The provisions on debt parking are aimed at specifically addressing structures that have been used to circumvent the debt remission provisions. Under present law, if an assignment of debt occurs and there is an intention to leave the debt outstanding questions could arise as to the application of the anti-avoidance provisions of the 54 Income Tax Act. Such arrangements could potentially be held to be an insubstance remission of debt. However, this would be very difficult to determine. The specific provision, which has precedents in both Australia and Canada, will help ensure the policy objective - to tax income from debt remission - is maintained. The breadth of the provision has been limited by the extent of common ownership between the borrower and the purchaser of the debt, the method used to value the debt (market value, as recommended by ICANZ) and the level of discount at which the debt is purchased. This will narrow its application. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (12 - ICANZ) • The market value and whether the associate of the debtor has acquired the debt at a predetermined discount to the market value should be used to determine whether or not a financial arrangement is subject to the debt parking rules. • If the primary submission fails an exception will be needed to accommodate the acquisition of financial arrangements which are issued at a significant discount and to exclude debt arising between parties that are members of a group at the time of creation of the financial arrangement. Comment The submission notes that commercial transactions are driven by reference to the market value of a financial arrangement, not its face value or the amounts payable under the arrangement. It suggests use of market value as the reference point to determine whether a transaction is subject to the debt parking provisions. Officials agree with the submission. The value of an arrangement should be its market value subject to the assumption that the debtor has the same capacity to repay the debt when it is assigned as it had when the loan was made. This will ensure that arrangements that trade at a substantial discount because of the payment structure, and not as a result of falling creditworthiness, are not caught by the rules. As we agree with the submission, the secondary issues do not need to be addressed. 55 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, but subject to the clarification proposed by officials. Issue: Security arrangements Clauses 21Section EH 53 Submission (12 - ICANZ) Sureties who are associated with the principal debtor should be able to deduct losses arising from indemnification of the principal debtor, provided no effective double deduction arises. Comment The provision that denies deductions for amounts paid by guarantors in satisfaction of an associate’s debt support the general restriction on bad debt deductions for associates. As discussed in response to the Law Society submission on page 28, relaxation of this policy is not appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Commercial bills Clause 38Section GC 14A Submission (12 – ICANZ, 23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) • The proposed section GC 14 A should be deleted. (ICANZ) • The proposed section GC 14A should apply only where the transaction has the “purpose and effect” of avoiding NRWT or AIL. (RWS) 56 • In the event that our primary submission is not accepted the words “derives gross income from the redemption payment” should be clarified. (ICANZ) Comment ICANZ recommends that the provision (which replaces the current section CE 3(1)(b) but is intended to be narrower in its application) be deleted. This is because it is not sufficiently targeted. It could, for example, result in taxation of a resident taxpayer that acquires a commercial bill from a non-resident regardless of whether the taxpayer was a party to an arrangement to avoid tax. Rudd Watts & Stone consider that the provision remains too broad and could apply where a resident buys a commercial bill in the market not knowing that it was previously owned by a non-resident. Officials consider that the policy objectives of the original provision (to support the NRWT and AIL rules) are still relevant and that the provision should not be deleted. The provision should stop non-residents selling bonds to residents before interest or redemption payments are due to avoid NRWT. The provision was intended to be limited to the parties to a sale where an arrangement exists to avoid non-resident withholding tax. We accept that the provision as drafted is too wide. The provision should apply only where there is a purpose of avoiding NRWT or AIL. The provision, if applied, taxes the resident as a proxy for the non-resident holder of a commercial bill. The gain for a non-resident holder, assuming that person is the original holder, is the difference between the amount paid to the issuer and the amount paid on redemption of the bond. Redemption payment is defined in section OB 1. No further definition is required. Recommendation That the provision apply where there is a purpose of avoiding NRWT or AIL. 57 Issue: Accrual rules anti-avoidance provision Clause 39 Submission (12 – ICANZ) The requirement under the current section GD 11 that there be a connection between the parties before a taxpayer is caught by the provision should be reflected in the redrafted provision. Comment The proposed amendment removes the requirement of a “connection between the parties” because these words could be construed as a requirement that there be an association between the parties. However, taxpayers, whether associated persons or not, may act in concert to manipulate their tax liabilities. Removal of the requirement does not mean, as the submission claims, that Inland Revenue has discretion to substitute market values indiscriminately in financial arrangements. To apply the provision Inland Revenue must show that the intention of the accrual rules has been defeated. This was discussed in Auckland Harbour Board v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1998) 18 NZTC, where the judge said: “... s 64J is essentially an anti-avoidance provision. It applies to situations where a taxpayer can point to a specific provision in the legislation, apply its terms, and claim a benefit – a benefit that is, however, contrary to the intended effect of the statutory regime. ...” Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 Issue: Application date for amendment to consolidation rules to ensure remission income is recognised Clause 40 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date for the amendment to the consolidation rules (which ensure that a debt that has not been held by members of a consolidated group throughout the term of the arrangement results in remission income for a debtor) should be amended. The provision should apply to debt remissions on or after the date that the bill receives Royal assent. Comment Debts remitted between members of a consolidated group do not normally result in income for a debtor. This is because the consolidation rules treat a group of companies comprehensively as one economic entity and one taxpayer. However, because this treatment of remission income is a concession to the general remission rule, the consolidation rules could be used to avoid the remission provisions. The amendment, like the debt parking rule, aims to close down avoidance opportunities. It does this by more tightly targeting the transactions which will not result in income for a debtor. The legislation as drafted, however, applies only to debts entered into after the date of enactment of the new accrual rules. As this legislation is intended to close down avoidance opportunities it is desirable that the rules apply to events or transfers that occur after the date the legislation is enacted, irrespective of when the arrangement was entered into. This is consistent with the application date for the debt parking provisions in clauses 20, section EH 5A and clause 21, section EH 50. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 Issue: Definitions of “agreement for the sale and purchase of property” and “forward contract” Clause 47 Submission (14W – Simpson Grierson) • The definitions of “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” and “forward contract” are circular. • It is not clear that the requirements of (i), (ii) & (iii) of the definition of “forward contract” are intended to be cumulative. • If the requirements of the definition of “forward contract” are cumulative the reference to an excepted financial arrangement in paragraph (ii) of the definition of “forward contract” should be removed. Comment The policy objectives of the changes to the definitions are to: • Extend the definition of agreement for the sale and purchase of property (ASAP) to trade credits and the provision of services. • Ensure that only the interest component associated with an ASAP is accrued when property is transferred under the accrual rules. • Ensure that agreements that are substitutable for debt or debt instruments or hedge debt or debt instruments are accounted for under the accrual rules. For such instruments the value of the property or commodity to which an arrangement is linked is taken into account. Agreements covered by the last point include those that use commodities or the price of a tangible or intangible asset as a pricing index. With such arrangements all or part of the return is indexed to the movement in the price of an asset or other commodity. Also covered are forward contracts for foreign exchange or financial arrangements. The definitions, as drafted, do not accurately reflect these objectives. As noted in the submission, the definitions mean all agreements for the sale and purchase of shares would be subject to the accrual rules as they would be forward contracts. This means both an interest component and any movement in the value of the shares would be brought to account on an accrual basis. This was not intended. 60 The definitions should be redrafted to better reflect the purpose, to avoid the problem of circularity and to indicate that the parts of the definition of “forward contract” are not cumulative. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Meaning of “conveys” in the definition of “lease” Clause 47 Submission (1W - Ernst & Young; 12 - ICANZ) • The words contained in paragraph (f), subparagraph (i), of the proposed lease definition read: “Means an agreement under which a lessor conveys to a lessee for a lease term a lease asset or the right to possess a lease asset in consideration for a lease payment.” • The proposed lease definition should apply only to new leases entered into on or after the bill receives Royal assent. Comment For the purpose of the “specified lease” definition, a lease was defined as “...any agreement entered into on or after 6 August 1982 under which a lessor conveys to a lessee for a lease term a lease asset or the right to possession of a lease asset in consideration for any lease payment...”. The bill proposed to redraft that part of the definition as “...an agreement under which a lessor provides to a lessee for a lease term a lease asset or the right to possess a lease asset in consideration for a lease payment...”. 61 The term “provides”, which is the subject of this submission, was introduced as part of rewriting the Act in plain English. The submission points out that the use of the term “provides” may unduly expand the types of agreements that could be classified as a “specified lease”. Officials do not necessarily agree with that submission. Whether an agreement is a lease depends on the legal nature of the rights granted under the agreement. The distinguishing feature between an agreement that is a lease and one that is not should not depend on the meaning of “conveys” or any other words that may be used in its place. An agreement that confers only a “right to use” a property is typically not a lease under the common law. To constitute a lease, the agreement must confer a “right to possess” the property. This interpretation is consistent with the use of the term “right to possess” in the definition of “lease”. The submission also pointed out that, therefore, certain licences of intangible property do not constitute leases under the current definition of “lease”. It is arguable whether certain licences of intangible property do not constitute leases under the current definition of “lease”. This is not an issue that we can deal with here. Even if certain licences of intangible property do not constitute leases under the current definition, officials doubt if any significant weight should be put on the term “conveys”. We do not accept, therefore, that the term “conveys” is irreplaceable because of its entrenched meaning. In order to simplify the language of the Act, the term “conveys” should be replaced with the word “transfers”. The word “convey” has been taken to mean “transfers”. In Nicholson v Milne (1989), 74 CBR (NS) 263 Virtue J stated that: “The term conveyance (like the term transfer) is itself wide enough to encompass every method of disposing of, or parting with, property or an interest therein, absolutely or conditionally. The word is of general meaning and, given a liberal interpretation, includes the transactions here which resulted in the transfer of entitlement....To ”make over property” or to “convey property” has, I believe, the same meaning as to “transfer property”....” The use of “transfers” is consistent with the meaning of “conveys”. 62 As this change does not represent a policy shift, the definition of lease should apply on or after the date the Act receives Royal assent. Recommendation That the word “transfers” should be used in the definition of lease. 63 DRAFTING CHANGES Issue: Branch equivalent income Clause 11 Submission (12 – ICANZ) The section reference in section CG 11(3C)(a) to section EH 32(5) should be amended to section EH 32(6). Comment We agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Structure and layout of Part EH Clauses 20 and 21 Submission 1 (12 - ICANZ) Division 1 should be transferred to Part EZ. Comment Part EZ contains terminating provisions. It is a collection of provisions ranging in subject matter whose only commonality is that they are terminating. The current rules apply to financial arrangements entered into before the date of the Act’s Royal assent. These rules will continue to apply to such financial arrangements until they mature. Division 1 cannot be repealed until the last financial arrangement subject to the current rules matures. We do not consider that Division 1’s termination in time is a sensible reason to add a substantial part of the accrual rules to Part EZ. Rather, we consider that all provisions relating to financial arrangements should be found in one place. Close proximity is 64 particularly favoured because Division 1 makes reference to Division 2. This way, the current rules can be read alongside the proposed rule. If the current rules were moved to Part EZ, a person would, potentially, have to turn between parts until they worked out which Division they could or should apply. The repeal of the current rules will not affect the proposed rules. This was achieved by creating Divisions. Not only is the subject matter together in one place, but it is clear and accessible to users. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 20 and 21 Submission 2 (12 - ICANZ) The first two sections in Division 1, sections EH A1 and EH A2, should be renumbered EH 1, EH 2 and the remaining sections, EH 1 to EH 56, be renumbered. Comment Division 1 contains the current rules with provisions retaining their current section numbers. Consequential amendments had to either: • refer to two sets of section references (the current rules and the proposed rules, reflecting the current and proposed terminology), with the current section references being repealed when Division 1 is being repealed; or • refer only to the proposed references and require financial arrangements to apply the provisions in other Parts as they stood prior to their (proposed) amendment. The latter option was chosen and it is for this reason that provisions in the current rules retain their section numbers. Therefore, sections EH A1 and EH A2 which were inserted to set out Divisions 1’s application and provide the link between Division 1 and Division 2 had to be numbered as they have. We note that ICANZ are happy with sections EH A1 and EH A2’s placement in Division 1, it is merely numbering on which they comment. 65 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Structure and layout of Part EH Clauses 20 and 21 Submission 3 (12 - ICANZ) There should be no comma between “Part EH” and either “Division 1” or “Division 2”. Comment We agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Confusion between “accrual rules” and “accruals rules” Clauses 20 and 21 Submission (12 – ICANZ, 23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) When “accrual rules” has been used to cover income from Division 1 or and Division 2, a new term should be used that covers both “accrual rules” and “accruals rules”, or alternatively “accruals rules” should be included as well. Comment The term “accrual rules” only refers to income arising under Division 2 and the transitional adjustment in Division 1; it has not been used to cover income from both Divisions 1 and 2. 66 References to “accruals rules” have not been omitted by accident. Rather, section EH 15 requires that provisions in other Parts that refer to financial arrangements must be applied as they stood prior to their (proposed) amendment. Taxpayers applying those provisions should read the term “accruals rules” or “qualified accruals rules” as appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of financial and excepted financial arrangement Clauses 20 and 21 Submission (12 - ICANZ) These substantive definitions should be relocated to section OB 1 to preserve the standard format of the Act. If the substantive definitions are not relocated to section OB 1, they must be cross-referenced in section OB 1 in a meaningful way. Comment We consider that it is appropriate to place definitions among substantive provisions. If a definition is fundamental to the application of a provision or subpart, it should be placed where it will be prominent. The definitions “financial arrangement” and “excepted financial arrangement” are good examples, because these definitions determine whether one must apply the accrual rules. If a definition is only used in one section, the definition may be presented in that section and generally, it is best presented as the final subsection of the section. If a definition is placed among substantive provisions, we consider that the definition should also be referred to in section OB 1. This ensures that there is a complete list of definitions for users, regardless of where the term is defined in the Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 Issue: Application dates of Division 2 Clause 20 Submission (23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The application dates of Division 2 should be contained in one section. Comment Section EH 16 provides that financial arrangements entered into on or after the date that the Act receives the Royal assent are subject to Division 2. Section EH 18(1)(d) and EH 18(2)(c) deal with financial arrangements subject to binding contracts where the binding contracts are entered into before the enactment of the bill and the financial arrangement itself is entered into after the enactment of the bill. We agree that section EH 18(1)(d) and EH 18(2)(c) more appropriately fit with the general application date in section EH 16 and should be moved to that section. We note that section EH 18(1)(e), which relies the test in section EH 18(1)(d), will need to be moved as well. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transitional adjustment Clause 20 Submission (12 – ICANZ, 23 – Rudd Watts & Stone) Section EH 14(9) does not make grammatical sense. ICANZ specifically submits that “where” should replace “if” in the opening body of section EH 14(9) and an “if” should be inserted at the beginning of paragraph (b). 68 Comment Section EH 14(9) requires a person to calculate a base price adjustment if three requirements are met. ICANZ submit that “\[i\]f paragraph (b) is read without reference to the opening words, the paragraph is a nonsense.” The Law Commission’s Report Legislation Manual Structure and Style (Report 35, May 1996) states, in paragraph 181, that “\[e\]ach paragraph must follow grammatically from the words introducing the series and must perform an equivalent function in the sentence.” As drafted, each paragraph meets this test, whereas the proposed changes would not. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section EH 15 Clause 20 Submission (23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) Section EH 15 is too broad. It requires taxpayers to apply particular provisions at a specific point in time, ignoring subsequent amendments to those provisions. Section EH 15 should therefore state that the provisions of the Act be read as being unaffected by the bill. Comment We agree that section EH 15, as drafted, requires taxpayers to apply particular provisions without regard to subsequent amendments to those provisions. If the amendment should be taken into account, a provision overriding section EH 15 would be required. An example discussed in this report (see page 58) is section HB 2(1)(a)(iv). The amendment made to that section in the bill is intended to close down avoidance opportunities and so should apply as amended to all financial arrangements, irrespective of when they were entered into. Section EH 15 is being amended to achieve this. 69 If section EH 15 were amended so that the provisions of the Act were read as being unaffected by the bill, amendments such as the debt parking rules would be of no consequence. This is unsatisfactory. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section EH 18(1)(d) Clause 21 Submission (23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) Section EH 18(1)(d) should be amended because it is not helpful to refer to an advance of a financial arrangement. Comment Section EH 18(1)(d) which sets out the application date in relation to binding contracts refers to a rollover, extension or advance of a financial arrangement. A financial arrangement may be rolled-over or extended, but it is actually money or money’s worth that is advanced under a financial arrangement, not the financial arrangement itself. We agree that section EH 18(1)(d) be amended to refer to an advance “in relation to” a financial arrangement. This language is consistent with that of Division 1. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 Issue: Section EH 21 list of defined terms Clause 21 Submission (23W – Rudd Watts and Stone) The term “insurance” should be removed from the list of defined terms for the proposed section EH 21. Comment The term “insurance” is listed as a defined term for the purpose of proposed section EH 21. The term is not defined for the purposes of that proposed section. Therefore, the term “insurance” should be deleted from the list of defined terms for the proposed section EH 21. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Sections EH 24(2), EH 26(1)(b) and EH 26(2) Clause 21 Submission (23W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The wording in sections EH 24(2), EH 26(1)(b) and EH 26(2) needs to be improved. Comment Section EH 24(2): The exception to the cash basis person definition does require a natural person to apply the formula to each financial arrangement. Section EH 24(2) will be redrafted to make this clearer. Section EH 26(1)(b): Section EH 24 provides that only natural persons may be cash basis persons. As an estate is not a natural person it will never meet the test in section EH 24. However, despite the natural person requirement, under section EH 26(1)(b) an estate may be a cash basis person if the deceased was a cash basis person at the time of his or her death and the other requirements of section EH 24 are met. No amendment is required. 71 Section EH 26(2): Section EH 26(2) provides that the trustee (of a deceased person’s estate) is treated as the same cash basis person as the deceased. This applies to the trustee in their capacity as a trustee, irrespective of whether the trustee personally qualifies as a cash basis person. As section EH 26(2) conflicts with the requirement that a trustee perform a base price adjustment on the date of a person’s death, section EH 26(2) should be repealed and the relationship between the cash basis person test and the trustee should made clearer in the section EH 26(1). Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Issue: Value of property or services in the “consideration” definition Clause 21Section EH 45 Submission (12 – ICANZ) The word “alphabetical” should be replaced by “sequential” or, alternatively, the words “alphabetical order” should be replaced by the word “sequence” or “seriatim”. Comment As drafted the value of property or services is determined under the “consideration” definition by applying paragraphs (a) to (d) in alphabetical order until a paragraph applies. The use of “seriatim” is at odds with plain language drafting. We consider that the suggested terms “sequential” or “sequence” potentially give a taxpayer too much discretion. Firstly, the words do not designate a starting point. A taxpayer may apply paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) in that order and comply with the legislation because the taxpayer has applied a sequence. Secondly, even if paragraph (a) is designated as a starting point, paragraph (a) and any order of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) are a sequence. There is no requirement that a taxpayer must apply the sequence (a), (b), (c) and (d). 72 We consider that “alphabetical” is the correct term to use because it unambiguously requires taxpayers to apply the subsection in the order of the letters of the alphabet. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 MINOR CHANGES The following are minor amendments that have been identified by either officials or raised informally by tax practitioners. The amendments improve the clarity of the legislation and do not involve matters of policy. Income Tax Act 1994 Section EH 16Clarify application date to ensure that secondary market transactions are included under Division 2. Section EH 24(2)Align the deferral test with current legislation. Sections EH 30(2)(a) and (b)Use of the word “for” is too restrictive; replace with “in relation to”. Section EH 32(2)Remove the word “equal” from the subsection heading. Section EH 32(3)Insert at the beginning of the subsection “if the straight line method can be applied to a financial arrangement,”. Section EH 40(1)Replace “section EH 32(2)”with “section EH 32(3)”. Section EH 42(1)(b)Remove “remitted, other than being written of as a bad debt”. Section EH 42(1)(c)Replace the words “a person” with the words “the person”. Section EH 42(1)(g)Replace the word “irrevocable” with “irrecoverable”. Sections EH 43(1),(2) and (3)Replace “does not have to” with “must not”. Section EH 43(3)Replace the reference to “income” with “money”. Section EH 44(1)In the explanation of the term “income” insert “(a)” after “is” and before “income”, replace the word “including” with “and”. Section EH 45(1)Insert the words “consideration means”. Section EH 45(2)Remove the words “if some or all”. 74 Section EH 51(2)(a)Replace the reference to “income” with “gross income”. Section FC 8B(2)Insert the word “term” after the words “date that the lease”. Section FC 8B(3)Insert the word “term” after the words “end of the lease”. Section FC 8C(1)Insert the word “term” after the words “before the lease”. Section FC 8EClarify that the gain is included in gross income in the year of sale. Section OB 1 – definition of maturity Replace the reference to “agreement” with “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services”. Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 22AAmend section 22A so that taxpayers are only required to keep records to verify the market value if they are not using a method approved by the Commissioner. 75 Other Changes to the Income Tax Act 1994 76 SIGNIFICANT POLICY ISSUES 77 AVERAGING OF TAX-FREE ALLOWANCES Issue: Use of the term “pay period” Clause 5 Submission (8 - New Zealand Employers' Federation (Inc)) The term “pay period” should be replaced by the term “relevant period”. Comment As noted in the submission, the proposed amendment is intended to apply to “relevant periods”, that is, the period to which estimated expenditure applies. However, it is accepted that the current wording may allow for a contrary interpretation to be taken. Officials agree, therefore, that the proposed amendment requires modification. This will necessitate slight, consequential changes to the current wording of the section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date Submission (12 - ICANZ) The application date should be backdated to the beginning of the current income year. Comment The proposed amendment applies from 1 April 1999 (the beginning of the next income year). This is because, as noted in the submission, the proposed amendment is merely designed to reflect existing practice, and Inland Revenue will not be applying a contrary application in the interim. Officials therefore believe that it is not necessary to backdate the application date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 78 GST AS PART OF THE COST OF FRINGE BENEFITS Issue: Inclusion of GST in the value of fringe benefits when the goods or services provided by the employer are subject to GST or when the cost includes GST Clauses 12, 13, 47(16) and 47(32) Submission (8 - New Zealand Employers’ Federation) Fringe benefit tax may no longer be relevant, particularly following the reduction in marginal income tax rates in the late 1980s, the move towards providing remuneration in monetary form, and uncertainty as to its coverage. Specifically, the proposal to include GST in the value of fringe benefits should be rejected. It is incorrect to assume that benefits should necessarily be valued at the market price individual employees would have paid had they purchased them directly, as employees would often prefer the market value of the goods or services in cash. The inclusion of GST in the value of fringe benefits results in employers being required to pay business income tax on top of a consumption tax, GST, which is meant to be borne by the end user. The proposal is also likely to involve significant compliance costs. Comment A general review of fringe benefit tax is outside the scope of this bill. The underlying policy of fringe benefit tax is that benefits should, in general, be valued at the price that would have been paid by the employee had he or she purchased the benefit directly. The submission of the Employers’ Federation, that employees would often prefer to receive market value of goods or services in cash, is focussed on the underlying policy of fringe benefit tax rather than the specific inclusion of GST in its value. To be consistent with this established policy, as the benefit to employees is the cost they would otherwise have paid, which would have included GST, it is necessary that the value of a fringe benefit also include GST. It was the intention at the time of the introduction of GST that all fringe benefits would be valued on a GST inclusive basis. Subsequent decisions of the courts have made legislative amendment necessary. As the example on page 34 of the commentary on the bill illustrates, exclusion of GST from the value of fringe benefits effectively enables employers to reduce their overall tax bill by paying employees in the form of benefits rather than monetarily. 79 This creates a potential risk to the revenue base by encouraging employers to provide remuneration in kind rather than in money. The inclusion of GST is necessary to ensure equity in tax system by all forms of remuneration, including non-cash benefits being taxed consistently. Compliance costs are likely to be of a transitional nature as employers update their systems in order to calculate the value of a fringe benefit on a GST inclusive basis when required. Compliance costs will be minimal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The application date for the proposed changes to definitions Clause 47(47) Submission (12 - ICANZ) The changes to the definitions of “input tax” and “registered person” should be 1 April 1999, being the application date of the substantive amendments. Comment Clauses 12 and 13, which amend sections CI 2 and CI 3, apply to all benefits provided on or after 1 April 1999. Officials agree that the effective date for the proposed changes to the definitions relevant to the inclusion of GST in the value of a fringe benefit should be amended from the date the Act receives Royal assent to 1 April 1999, so that the two are consistent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 80 TRADING STOCK VARIANCES Issue: Application of variance provision Clause 19 Submission (12 - ICANZ) The provisions relating to the deduction of a variance in the year following the year in which the variance is incurred in section EE 5(3A) should be made optional. Taxpayers who wish to include a variance in the value of stock (in which case the variance would become deductible at the time the associated trading stock is sold), should be able to do so. Comment In response to the proposed replacement section EE 5(3A) in the bill, ICANZ submits that if taxpayers have included previous year variances under Financial Reporting Standard No. 4 Accounting for Inventories (FRS-4), they should not be required to deduct the previous year variances for tax purposes. Officials agree. The submission highlights that there needs to be some flexibility in how taxpayers are to apply the variance provision. Section EE 5(4) \[referred to as EE 5(3A) in the submission, which was the numbering in the bill\] was inserted in response to a previous submission by ICANZ at the Select Committee stage of the Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998. This previous submission sought to allow taxpayers to use a pool basis to allocate variances which can be reversed in the following year and re- established at the following year-end based on the subsequent variances arising. The submission was accepted and section EE 5(4) was enacted. Further issues were raised which led to the proposed replacement of that section in the bill now being considered by this Select Committee. These difficulties indicate that it is preferable to include less detail in the legislation because of the widely varying situations which will occur in practice and different accounting systems of taxpayers. A clarification to section EE 5(3) can indicate that taxpayers are only required to calculate variances for the current income year, although it will not prevent taxpayers from carrying forward previous year variances as sought in the submission. Previous year variances that are not included for financial reporting purposes will not be required to be carried forward because they will be deducted as part of the opening stock allowable deduction under section EE 2(4). 81 Consultation with the submission-maker and with the Tax Education Office Limited has raised another issue with the variance provision. This additional submission is that the variance should be calculated with reference to actual production costs used for financial reporting purposes in accordance with FRS-4. Section EE 5(3) currently requires the variance to be calculated with reference to budgeted or standard costs. The budgeted production levels or costs may differ from the actual production levels or costs used for financial reporting purposes, so it is appropriate to use the latter. Officials consider that the calculation of the variance with reference to budgeted or standard costs in section EE 5(3) should be changed to actual production costs included in financial statements. Recommendation That the submission (and the additional submission raised in consultation) be accepted. Issue: Drafting matter Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to the income year in which taxpayers are required to have the same balance dates, should be reinstated in section EE 15. Comment Section EE 15 is a rewritten version of the previous sections EE 1(5) and EE 1(6). The section deals with trading stock transferred within a wholly-owned group of companies. There was an inadvertent change in drafting, with the effect that it is not clear from section EE 15(1) when the two companies concerned need to have income years that end with the same balance date. Recommendation That it be clarified that the income year is the year in which the trading stock is valued under the provision, and not the year in which the return is filed. 82 GUARANTEE FEES PAID TO NON-RESIDENTS Issue: Definition of “insurance” Clause 47(17) Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The proposed definition of “insurance”, which will determine the application of the section CN 4 withholding tax to guarantee fees, should be amended to ensure that it does not include fees paid on normal trade and commercial financing transactions. Comment The submission notes that the reference to “guarantee against risk” in paragraph (a)(ii) of the new definition of “insurance” to be inserted by clause 47(17) of the bill could include fees paid on normal trade and commercial financing transactions such as letters of credit and performance bonds. The main targets of the proposed amendment are guarantee fees paid to non-resident associated parties and guarantee fees which are in substitution for interest that would otherwise be subject to non-resident withholding tax or the approved issuer levy. Officials agree that it is not desirable for the amendment to apply to fees paid on normal trade and commercial financing transactions between parties acting at arm’s length. In particular, the compliance costs of imposing the section CN 4 withholding tax on such transactions would probably outweigh the revenue gain. Officials have discussed with the submission-maker a wording change to clause 47(17) which would ensure that the main targets of the amendment — guarantee fees paid to non-resident associates and guarantee fees paid in substitution for interest — are caught. The amendment would not catch fees paid on normal trade and commercial financing transactions between parties acting at arm’s length. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 83 Issue: Application date Clause 47(48) Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The application date of the new definition of “insurance” in clause 47(17) (amended as recommended above) should, in so far as it relates to unassociated party transactions, be the date of Royal assent. Comment The bill currently provides that all of the amendments relating to guarantee fees paid to non-residents will apply from 17 November 1998, being the date of introduction of the bill. Officials consider that the amendments should continue to apply from the date of their introduction in relation to associated party transactions in order to protect the tax base. However, officials agree that because the wording of clause 47(17), amended as recommended above, in relation to unassociated party transactions differs from that used on the introduction of the bill and the lower risk to the tax base posed by unassociated party transactions, clause 47(17) should apply from the date of Royal assent in relation to unassociated party transactions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Deductibility of withholding tax to New Zealand payer Clause 14 Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) It should be made perfectly clear that payments to the Commissioner of withholding tax under section CN 4 are tax deductible to the New Zealand payer. 84 Comment Officials consider that the proposed amendment is unnecessary. It is the Inland Revenue Department’s interpretation that payments of withholding tax to the Commissioner under section CN 4 are deductible to the New Zealand payer. The Inland Revenue Department agrees with the submission-maker’s interpretation that a payment of tax under section CN 4 is made by the New Zealand payer as agent of the non-resident and not in the payer’s own capacity. It therefore follows that the payment of tax under section CN 4 is not, in relation to the New Zealand payer, a payment of income tax for the purposes of section DB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (which denies a deduction for payments of income tax). This interpretation is stated in the Inland Revenue Department’s Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 5, No. 4 (October 1993) concerning section 209 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the precursor to section CN 4). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Allowing a single return by New Zealand payer Clause 14 Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) A New Zealand payer of premiums subject to the withholding tax under section CN 4 should be able to file a single return for each year in respect of all premiums paid to non-resident insurers. Comment The proposed amendment is unnecessary because Inland Revenue Department practice already allows a single return to be filed for each year by a New Zealand payer in respect of premiums paid to all non-resident insurers, and does not require the New Zealand payer to make a separate return in respect of each non-resident insurer. Inland Revenue intends to continue this practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 PROVISIONAL TAX AND USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application of use-of-money interest to provisional tax should be clarified, and it would be timely to do so in this bill. The subject has also been raised in the ICANZ submission, even though the issue is not in the bill. At present the legislation appears to require interest to be overcharged. The proposal is to introduce a refund provision for the 1997-98 income year as an interim measure because of resource constraints. A full legislative and administrative solution is proposed for subsequent years to prevent overcharging interest. Comment Under the current use-of-money interest provisions, payments towards a provisional tax liability are first applied to meeting any accumulated interest, with any residual amount going towards the tax liability itself. This measure was intended to ensure that interest did not compound, which would increase the complexity of the calculations both for taxpayers and Inland Revenue and increasing the overall amount owed. However, for provisional tax, which usually has three payments due in relation to one income tax return, the general statutory rule of applying payments to interest first in cases of underpayment actually causes compounding of interest. At present, the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that payments made on the second and third provisional tax instalment dates are first applied to meet any outstanding interest, rather than the provisional tax due. The policy intent was that payments apply first to provisional tax, with the residual amount, if any, applying to interest outstanding. This issue was identified when taxpayers and their agents received assessments different from what they expected. Officials consider an amendment to the use-of-money interest legislation is required to ensure that interest on provisional tax payments does not compound. The importance of an amendment is increased as the current legislative and operational position increases the interest charged only to taxpayers who underpaid their provisional tax, compared with the intended policy position. Compounding interest does not occur when taxpayers overpay provisional tax. This means that the current legislative position may also be seen as unfair, as only those who underpay are affected. 86 Resource issue Officials considered the option of using Inland Revenue’s FIRST system to refund all interest overcharged to all affected taxpayers for the 1997-98 income year, when the issue first arises. However, the Government’s tax simplification initiative requires substantial departmental resources on computer development. An integrated computer solution in the 1997-98 income year is likely to compromise Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver: • the employer monthly schedule; or • the effective introduction of call centres. In both cases failure to deliver would have a large impact on the revenue base and the integrity of the tax system and its administration. Further, this risk would not be balanced by resulting gains in more accurate calculation of interest for the 1997-98 income year, as the bulk of cases will be addressed through the manual process proposed below. Owing to these resource constraints, officials recommend an interim solution: a manual correction to interest calculations for the 1997-98 income year for taxpayers who apply to Inland Revenue for a refund of overcharged interest. Inland Revenue’s computer systems will be corrected for subsequent years. Inland Revenue has consulted with ICANZ, which accepts the proposed compromise. ICANZ considers the long-term solution applying immediately to be the most desirable action, but acknowledges the resource constraints in Inland Revenue. To ensure that the integrity of the tax system can be seen as being maintained for the 1997-98 income year, Inland Revenue will be writing to accountants and software developers and undertaking other publicity to ensure that affected taxpayers can apply for refunds for remission overcharged. This publicity has been discussed with ICANZ, who agrees. Recommendations • That the application of use-of-money interest to provisional tax be clarified to prevent compounding of interest. • That an administrative refund provision be introduced for the 1997-98 income year, with a full legislative and FIRST system correction for subsequent years. • That an amendment to the use-of-money interest rules as they apply to provisional tax be included in this bill. 87 TECHNICAL AND DRAFTING ISSUES 88 Issue: Amendments required as a result of Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters Act) 1998 Submission 1 (Matter raised by officials) The punctuation in section KD 1(1)(a) should be corrected to refer to “CB 1(1)(c)”. Comment Section KD 1(1)(a) was amended by replacing an incorrect cross-reference. Inadvertently, the replacement was followed by “; and” as if the provision were part of a list. However, the “; and” should have been a comma. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 2 (Matter raised by officials) Cross-references in the definitions of “direct market value interest” and “direct voting interest” that appear twice should be amended so that they only appear once. Comment Two sets of cross-referencing amendments have been made to each of the definitions “direct market value interest” and “direct voting interest”. As a result, the same words appear twice. One set of amendments, therefore, needs to be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 89 Issue: Amendments required as a result of Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters Act) 1998 Submission 1 (Matter raised by officials) Section 33A should be amended to remove a reference to “attributed income”. Comment Section 33A refers to “attributed income” as that term was to be used in the TOLIS provisions that were contained in the Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock and Other Remedial Matters) Bill. As the TOLIS provisions were not passed, the reference to “attributed income” needs to be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 2 (Matter raised by officials) Section 82A should be amended to refer to “information about a beneficiary”. Comment Section 82A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a definition of “beneficiary information” but the definition is not used in the section. The section refers to “information about a beneficiary”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 3 (Matter raised by officials) Section NC 15(1)(b) should refer to “section 36B of the Tax Administration Act 1994” rather than just “section 36B”. 90 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 4 (Matter raised by officials) Paragraph (i) of the definition of “employer monthly schedule” should refer to “Schedule 19, clause 8(b)” rather than “Schedule 19, clause 8B”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amendments required as a result of Accident Insurance Act 1998 Submission 1 (Matter raised by officials) One of the two paragraphs numbered (ia) in the definition of “salary and wages” should be renumbered as paragraph (ic). Comment Schedule 8 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 amended section OB 1 by inserting new paragraphs (ia) and (ib) into the definition of “salary and wages”. However, this amendment ignored an amendment made by the Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 that already inserted a paragraph (ia) in that definition. As it is not intended that paragraph (ia) should be repealed and be substituted by the new paragraphs (ia) and (ib), paragraph (ia) should be renumbered as paragraph (ic). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 91 Submission 2 (Matter raised by officials) Section 46(5)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to refer to “compensation payable under the Accident Insurance Act 1998”. Comment Section 46 relates to employer monthly schedules. Employers must include particulars of compensation paid to an employee under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992. Compensation paid under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 should also be included in the list of particulars that employers must include in their monthly schedule. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amendments required as a result of Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1998 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The provisional tax rules should be amended to ensure that if a taxpayer has not filed last year’s tax return, the provisional tax liability is calculated using the taxpayer’s residual income tax for the previous year, plus a 10% uplift factor. Therefore section MB 1(1) should be amended to ensure that paragraph (b) continues to apply from the 1999-2000 income year. Comment Section 14 of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1998 amended section MB 1(1) by replacing paragraph (b) with paragraphs (aa), (ab) and (b). The application date of paragraphs (aa) and (ab) should have been limited to the 1998-99 income year to provide relief as a result of the second round of tax reductions, and paragraph (b) should have continued to apply in subsequent years. The application of the section has the effect of repealing the requirement for taxpayers who have not filed last year’s return to calculate their provisional tax using the previous year’s residual income tax, plus a 10% uplift factor from the 1999-2000 income year. 92 Given that the first provisional tax payments for the 1999-2000 income year were due in February 1999, we recommend that section MB 1(1) be amended to ensure paragraph (b)’s continued application. The proposed amendment is a continuation of existing policy. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section HF 1 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section HF 1 should be clarified so that it applies to mutual associations that purchase products from their members. Comment Section HF 1 allows mutual associations to deduct rebates paid to members for their transactions with the association to the extent that those rebates are not more than the profit attributable to member transactions. Section HF 1 was redrafted as part of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 to apply to mutual associations that sell products to members, not to mutual associations that purchase products from members. This was an oversight. The section previously applied to both mutual associations that sold products to members and those that purchased products from members. Section HF 1 should be amended, therefore, to reflect its original intention and should apply from the 1997-98 income year, the application date of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 93 Issue: “Joint venture agreement” definition in section OB 1 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “joint venture agreement” should be updated in the light of the Civil Aviation Act 1990, to refer to the “Civil Aviation Act 1990” and the “Minister of Transport” with effect from 1 September 1990. Comment The definition of “joint venture agreement” refers to the Civil Aviation Act 1964 and to the Crown “acting by and through the Minister of Civil Aviation and Meterological Services”. The Civil Aviation Act 1964 was consolidated into the Civil Aviation Act 1990. Accordingly, the Act references need to be updated, and the Crown reference should refer to the “Minister of Transport”. These amendments should apply from 1 September 1990, the date the Civil Aviation Act 1964 came into force. Corresponding amendments to the Income Tax Act 1976 will, therefore, be necessary as well. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: “Timber” definition in section OB 1 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to “cost price” in the definition of “timber” should be repealed. Comment “Timber” is defined for various terms in section OB 1, including the definition of “cost price”. However, this reference is redundant as the definition of “cost price” does not contain the word “timber”. Accordingly, the reference to “cost price” should be repealed, with effect from the date of Royal assent. 94 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Limiting deductions under certain arrangements Submission (Matter raised by officials) Drafting changes should be made to clarify the proposed amendments relating to arrangements involving expenditure on films and petroleum exploration. Comment The formulae in draft sections DM 1A(4) and EO 4A(4) do not operate to reduce deductions in the manner intended. The current wording suggests that deductions should be reduced by the amount given by the formula rather than to that amount. The term “in total by” in relation to the reduction of deductions should, therefore, be replaced with “so that the total of those deductions equal”. In addition, some minor presentational improvements are being proposed to: • the draft sections DM 1A(2)(c) and EO 4A(2)(c), which exclude certain income from the consideration taken into account in the calculation of deductions allowed; and • the draft sections DM1A(7) and EO 4A(7), describing the operation of the time bar. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 95 Changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 96 TIME BAR WAIVERS 97 TIME BAR WAIVERS Issue: Date of application Clause 91 Submissions (12 - ICANZ; 13 - New Zealand Law Society; 3W - Christchurch City Council; 20 - Vela Fishing) Three issues arise in relation to this clause: • Whether the clause is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Vela Fishing raised this issue. • Whether it is appropriate that the clause should have potential retrospective effect. This was raised in all the submissions above. In addition, in an opinion to Inland Revenue, Crown Law has suggested that it may be appropriate to suggest a savings provision directed towards excluding taxpayers who filed proceedings before 18 November 1998 and who have specifically raised the validity of a time bar waiver assessment. • Drafting and technical issues identified by officials. New Zealand Bill of Rights Act We do not consider that clause 91 is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. This view is supported by recent Crown Law advice to that effect, although Crown Law notes that in this area, as in many areas affecting the Act, the issue is not free from doubt. Our responses to the arguments submitted by Vela Fishing for why the clause does breach the Act are: • Clause 91 does not breach section 27(3) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act because the clause does not deprive the taxpayer of the right to bring civil proceedings against the Crown according to law and in the same way as civil proceedings between individuals. The taxpayer retains the right to have proceedings determined in the normal way and to any remedies that successful proceedings may give rise to. What the clause does is to remove an argument (that current section 108B has no application to return periods ending before 1 October 1996) that the taxpayer might advance in its proceedings. 98 • Clause 91 does not breach section 27(2) of the Act since it does not deny any person the right to apply for judicial review. The clause might affect the outcome of judicial review proceedings, but it is not a privative clause that purports to oust a person’s right to judicial review. • Clause 91 does not breach section 26(1) of the Act because it does not make a person liable to conviction for an offence for which the person could not be liable at the time it occurred. This is because no new offence is created by the clause. If a clause is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, the requirement is simply that the Attorney General should notify the House of such a view at the second reading. Potential retrospective effect Inland Revenue’s view is that under current legislation, waivers of the four-year time bar on assessments for income years beginning before October 1996 are valid. The amendment proposed in clause 91 puts this interpretation beyond doubt. The clause is potentially retrospective because there is a reasonable alternative argument that the current legislation is flawed in that it does not apply to assessments for income years beginning before October 1996. If the law is not clarified by legislation the correct interpretation of current law will need to be determined through the court system at considerable expense to all parties. In the meantime, because of doubts about the validity of waivers, no new waivers will be entered into by Inland Revenue until post- October 1996 income years approach the four-year time bar – this is in the 2001 year at the earliest. Submissions on this clause argue that the legislation should not apply retrospectively. The only way to ensure this would be to restrict the new clause to waivers entered into after the date of enactment. The effect of all past waivers would then be litigated through the courts. In general, retrospective tax legislation is and should be avoided. Retrospective changes to tax rules undermine perceptions of the fairness of the tax system, and thus voluntary compliance, and have economic costs in that the effect of investment and other decisions become more uncertain. Nevertheless, it is recognised by the Legislative Advisory Committee and others that in the tax area, as in other areas, these considerations need to be balanced against other policy concerns on a case by case basis. In some cases it can be fairer and add to certainty for legislation to be retrospective. The classic example is the correction of an incorrect section cross- reference. Considering concerns in this balanced way can sometimes lead to the conclusion that significant changes to the law should be retrospective. For example correcting major 99 base maintenance concerns is often achieved by making remedial legislation effective from date of announcement, which is generally the date of introduction of the bill. In such cases the reasoning is that people are given notice of the change and, therefore, should not rely on the law that it is proposed to change. On more rare occasions greater retrospectivity seems justified. This is where the policy intent of legislation is seen as being clear but the legislation does not achieve it, and the result is a significant hole in the tax base or a significant unintended tax impost on taxpayers. A recent example was the retrospective repeal of duty on credit card transactions enacted as part of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1998 (No. 7). The rationale is that there is in such cases greater unfairness and uncertainty in not changing the law retrospectively than in doing so prospectively. When retrospective legislation has an adverse effect on taxpayers, the general practice has been to protect those who have relied on the law that is being retrospectively changed. The change in law is not applied to those who have demonstrated that they have relied on the old law by taking some action such as filing a return on that basis. In the case of waivers, both Inland Revenue and taxpayers have demonstrated that they understood the waivers to be valid by voluntarily entering into them in good faith. By putting beyond any doubt the validity of these voluntary agreements, certainty and fairness are enhanced. Moreover, there is no action undertaken by taxpayers in good faith that is subsequently made detrimental to them by the retrospective law change. They entered into a waiver on the basis it was valid, and this validity is retrospectively affirmed. The fact that a taxpayer has later challenged the validity of a waiver is not an action demonstrating the taxpayer’s reliance on legislation under which the validity of the waiver may have been questionable. The benign nature of the proposed clause is reflected in the submissions of the Law Society and ICANZ. The Law Society does not oppose the proposal but quite appropriately asks FEC to question whether retrospective legislation is appropriate in this case. ICANZ, in its letter of 26 February 1999 to the Minister of Revenue (referred to FEC), supports the proposal on the basis that affected taxpayers “will be treated as having given a time bar waiver of the same nature and quality which they entered into”. In addition, the taxpayer, other than Vela Fishing, who filed proceedings before the date of introduction of this bill has said to Inland Revenue that it is “accepting and understanding” of the proposal. We note that Crown Law, in its opinion to Inland Revenue on legal aspects of this waiver issue, has offered the view that it may be appropriate to consider a savings provision to make the clause non-retrospective. Consideration has been given to this but, for the reasons outlined above, the conclusion is that the clause should not be amended. 100 Recommendation The clause should not be amended to remove potential retrospective effect. Issue: Drafting issues Submission (Matters raised by officials) In the course of their analysis of submissions officials identified as requiring amendments one technical and a number of drafting issues affecting clause 91. Comment A reference to the former section 31 of the GST Act 1985 should be inserted after paragraph (d) of the substituted section 108B(3). This will clearly confirm that the time bar affecting GST assessments for periods ending before 1 October 1996 comes within the scope of the clarified provision. On page 153 of the bill, the expression “of the Income Tax Act 1994” appears in error in lines 16, 17, 20, 21, 26, 27, 37 and 38. Those words are inappropriate and should be omitted from the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 OTHER POLICY ISSUES 102 ARRANGEMENTS FOR EXTENSIONS OF TIME Issue: The power of the Commissioner to cancel an agent’s extension of time arrangement Clause 58 Submission (12 - ICANZ) The bill’s proposal that the Commissioner can cancel an agent’s extension of time merely by notifying the agent is not supported. The current section 37(4A), which requires the Commissioner to notify each client of an agent that the agent’s extension of time has been withdrawn because the agent has failed to meet his/her return filing percentage obligations, should be retained. Comment Under the current section 37(4), the Commissioner grants extension of time arrangements on a case by case basis. The rules surrounding an extension of time are negotiated annually with ICANZ. The Commissioner must be able to withdraw this extension of time if an agent does not meet the negotiated standard. The current section 37(4A) is difficult to apply because it requires the Commissioner to notify each client of an agent that the agent’s extension of time has been withdrawn for non- compliance, which would create significant administrative cost. As a further complication, not all of the agent’s clients would lose their extension of time; only those who had an outstanding return from a prior year would be affected. In summary, the current legislation does not allow Inland Revenue to monitor and sanction non-compliant agents effectively. The intention of this amendment is to state the Commissioner’s authority and remove these restrictions. Before removing an agent’s extension of time the department warns the agent involved. Some leeway is built into the process, so that minor failures to meet percentages do not result in loss of extension of time. The process is flexible and involves consultation with the agent involved. Removal of an agent’s extension of time is viewed as significant, so the department will warn the agent before taking action. In response to the concern of ICANZ that individual taxpayers will be harmed by the proposed amendment, it should be noted that clients of agents who have had their extension of time withdrawn can change to another agent, under both current and proposed law. Alternatively, they may apply for an extension of time arrangement in their own right should they choose to file their own return. 103 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The definition of “linked to a tax agent” Clause 47(26) Submission 1 (12 - ICANZ) The extended terminal tax date of 7 April should not only apply to taxpayers who are linked to an agent who have an extension of time arrangement, but to all taxpayers who have an extension of time. Comment The terminal tax date extension is granted to agents who have an extension of time arrangement in recognition of the significant number of tax returns agents file on behalf of their clients. The delay in the terminal tax date to 7 April should not be provided to those taxpayers who should be in a reasonable position to know their tax as at 7 February. Individual taxpayers with an extension of time who are not required to file their return until 31 March should be in such a position to know how much tax to pay by 7 February in any year. With individual taxpayers only one return is affected, whereas many of the returns filed by an agent may be affected. When considering the submissions officials identified the need for a consequential amendment to sections MC 1, MC 2 and NC 17, which refer to individual tax returns rather than the agent’s extension of time arrangement. We recommend that these sections be amended to provide that the 7 April date does not apply if the Commissioner has refused to grant an extension of time or has cancelled an existing extension of time under section 37(4A). Officials recommend that the proposed section 37(4A) be amended to include the Commissioner’s current power to cancel an extension of time in relation to an individual taxpayer who is a client of an agent. The proposed section 37(4A), by replacing the current 37(4A), effectively removes this authority. 104 Recommendation That the submission be declined and a consequential amendment be made to sections MC 1, MC 2 and NC 17 to make them consistent with the proposed section 37(4A). That the proposed section 37(4A) be amended to carry forward the Commissioner’s current discretion to remove an agent’s extension of time in relation to a specific individual. Submission 2 (12 - ICANZ) If agents lose their extension of time, the change in due date should be prospective only. Comment If agents do not meet their obligations for a certain year their extension of time arrangement should be withdrawn for that year, not a later year. Effectively ICANZ is suggesting that filing omissions should be addressed in a later year. A tax agent who has genuine reasons for not meeting his/her obligations, such as illness, is already catered for in terms of the annual agreement. Taxpayers can go to another agent to get an extension of time if it is withdrawn from their own agent. They can also apply for their own extension of time to file a return. If their terminal tax date reverted to 7 February because their agent’s extension of time was removed after 7 February, the Commissioner would consider remission of penalties in these cases. The submission also raises the issue of transfers to the “B List” of taxpayers who have not supplied necessary information. The negotiated agreement between ICANZ and Inland Revenue regards taxpayers placed on the B List as having had their extension of time removed. This makes their tax return, in effect, overdue, so the department takes action to ensure their return is filed. An agent can contact the department should a taxpayer subsequently provide the required information, in which event the taxpayer will again receive an extension of time by being moved from the B List. This merely involves a call to the department by the agent or his/her staff. The compliance costs of this action are not viewed as significant, especially once the department introduces a free phone 0800 number expressly for agents. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 105 TAX IN DISPUTE AND REMISSION PROVISIONS Issue: The application of use-of-money interest rules to the 1995-96 or earlier income years Clauses 92, 95 and 98 Submission (12 - ICANZ) If a dispute relates to the 1995-96 or an earlier income year and begins on or after 1 April 1997, the use-of-money interest rules, introduced as part of the compliance and penalties legislation, should not apply as proposed by this bill. Comment The submission considers that if a dispute relates to the 1995-96 or earlier income years and begins on or after 1 April 1997 that any interest payable on the tax dispute should be calculated using the provisions that existed before the introduction of the new use-of-money interest rules. The policy intention of the new interest rules is that they should be used to calculate all interest payable from 1 April 1997 onwards. If ICANZ’s submission were accepted, the rate of interest payable on tax in dispute would depend on the income year to which the dispute relates. If the previous provisions were to continue to apply, the interest rate payable would have to be brought into line with current market rates. Because these provisions have been repealed, the interest rates cannot be changed. The proposed changes would allow the old rules to apply if a taxpayer indicates that they should apply before the enactment of this legislation. Officials have discussed this submission with ICANZ, which accepts the thrust of the proposed amendments, subject to a number of proposed amendments discussed below. During the discussion ICANZ raised an additional concern that the predecessors to sections 120 and 139 should apply when the dispute relates to a period before the 1995-96 income year. Based on that discussion officials recommend the following amendments: • Amend section 120AA(1)(c) to replace the current requirement that the taxpayer’s objection, appeal or case stated must maintain that section 120 applies, with the requirement that the taxpayer has simply informed the department of his/her view that section 120 applies, in the course of the disputes resolution process. It is 106 accepted that taxpayers would not actually state in their objection that section 120 applies in relation to the tax in dispute. • Amend section 120AA(2) to include the requirement that if subsection (1) applies, the Commissioner must apply section 120 or section 139 or their predecessors, whichever is appropriate, as they applied immediately before their repeal. The effect of these amendments is first, that the taxpayer is not required to inform the department through any formal legal procedure that section 120 applies; notification by letter and as part of the disputes resolution process is sufficient. Second, to ensure that where interest is calculated under the rules that applied before the introduction of the new use-of-money interest rules that it is calculated in situations of both underpayment and overpayment when section 120AA(1) applies. Recommendation That section 120AA(1)(c) be amended so that it simply requires taxpayers to have informed the department in the course of the disputes resolution process that they consider that section 120 applies. That section 120AA(2) be amended to include the requirement that the Commissioner apply section 139, and the predecessor provisions to section 120 or 139 where appropriate. Issue: Amendments to Part VIIIA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Clauses 93 and 97 Submission (23W - Rudd Watts & Stone) The amendments in clauses 93 and 97 do not operate so as to overcome the general commencement provision (section 1(2)) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. As a consequence, Part VIIIA (Challenges to assessments) does not apply to income derived before the 1995-96 income year. Comment Officials agree that clause 93 should be amended so as to alter the reference to “1985” in section 124A (a) to “1995” and to omit the proposed new paragraph (b) from the new subsection (3) of section 124A. 107 Officials also agree that clause 97 should be redrafted so that the amendment to section 138A (1) mirrors the amendment to section 124A contained in clause 92. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 108 OTHER ISSUES 109 BINDING RULINGS Issue: Publication of public and product rulings Clauses 68, 71, 72, 84, 86 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Notification that a public or product ruling has been made should continue to be published in the Gazette. The notice that a public ruling is to be extended should continue to be published in the Gazette. The notice that a public or product ruling is to be withdrawn should continue to be published in the Gazette. Comment After further consultation it has been requested that the Gazette be retained for the notification, extension and withdrawal of public and product rulings. The need to retain the Gazette stems from section 91DE(3) and 91FJ of the Tax Administration Act, which stipulate that the date of withdrawal of a public or product ruling may not be sooner than the date on which the notice of withdrawal is made public. If the department were to use, for example, the Tax Information Bulletin to publish a withdrawal notice, it could potentially take up to a month before the notice was made public. In contrast, the Gazette is published weekly and so withdrawal can be effected much sooner. The Gazette should also be retained for the publication of notifications and extensions. The wider distribution, reliability and regularity with which the Gazette is published makes it a more appropriate venue for the publication of notification and extension notices. Clauses 68(2), 71(1), 72(1), 84(4) and 86(2) should be changed so as to refer to the Gazette, rather than “a publication of the Department”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 110 Issue: Clarification of the term “audit” Clause 73 Submission 1 (12 – ICANZ) The proposed change to clarify the term “audit” to incorporate all verification activities undertaken by Inland Revenue should not proceed. Comment ICANZ has submitted that the inclusion of the word “investigation” in clause 73 section 91E(4)(g) extends the section too far and should be removed. The original policy of the section was that Inland Revenue’s Rulings unit should not rule on matters that were the subject of investigation by other divisions of Inland Revenue. Extending “audit” to include all verification activities undertaken by the department helps clarify this policy and prevents different technical divisions of the department from committing resources to identical issues. The definition is the same as that adopted for the penalties legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (12 – ICANZ) The purpose of section 91E(4)(g) was to prevent taxpayers who are in the middle of a tax audit from playing one section of Inland Revenue against another. Inland Revenue should develop a reasonable procedure to ensure taxpayers know when they are notified of a tax audit or investigation for these purposes. Comment Inland Revenue is looking at this issue and preparing a paper for external consultation (including ICANZ. 111 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application when tax is due and payable Clause 73 Submission (12 – ICANZ) Clause 73 (Section 91E(4)(d)(i)) should be extended to include other forms of tax (such as PAYE) which are paid in advance as tax credits and are then assessable on an annual basis. Comment The potentially significant policy issue underlying this submission requires further work and consultation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ruling before the receipt of a notice of assessment. Clause 73 Submission (23 – Rudd Watts & Stone) The proposed section 91E(4)(f) has the potential to create a problem when there is a delay between the making of the assessment and the date the notice is issued, or a delay between the date the notice is issued and the taxpayer actually receiving the notice of assessment. The practical reality is that the taxpayer (and possibly the Rulings unit of Inland Revenue) will only know of the existence of a Commissioner assessment once the notice of assessment is received by the taxpayer. 112 Comment The proposed amendment is simply a clarification of the current position that a taxpayer may not request a ruling after an assessment has been made. We appreciate the practical difficulties highlighted in the submission. Further consultation is required, especially since the most likely solution identified by officials represents a significant change in the time within which a taxpayer may request a ruling. We therefore recommend that the proposed amendment not proceed pending further consultation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Arrangement not seriously contemplated Clause 73 Submission 1 (Matter raised by officials) An arrangement that is the subject of a binding ruling must be seriously contemplated not only at the time of application (as specified in clause 73(3)), but throughout the period following application to the date of issue of the ruling. Comment This amendment is needed to ensure that Rulings’ time is used in the most effective manner and in a way that is consistent with the original policy. If, after a taxpayer’s application has been received it becomes apparent that the arrangement is no longer seriously contemplated, the Rulings unit needs to be able to stop work on that application and give priority to those rulings where the arrangement is seriously contemplated. Therefore clause 73(3) should be extended to clarify that the arrangement that is the subject of a binding ruling must be seriously contemplated at the time of application through to the date of issue of the binding ruling. 113 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission 2 (Matter raised by officials) The requirement that an arrangement that is the subject of a binding ruling must be seriously contemplated at the time of application (clause 73(3)) should be extended to apply to product rulings also. Comment Section 91F(4) of the Income Tax Act gives the Commissioner power to decline to issue a product ruling if the arrangement to which the application is made is not seriously contemplated. This section has been overlooked in the draft legislation, and should be amended in the same way as the provision relating to private rulings in clause 73(3). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Material assumptions Clause 75 Submission 1 (23 – Rudd Watts & Stone) Clause 75 is intended to ensure that a ruling will still be binding if the Commissioner’s assumption is not material to the ruling. Our reading of the Act in its current form is that the Commissioner is only authorised to make assumptions that are material. This change will lead to a “scatter gun” approach to the insertion of assumptions in rulings by Inland Revenue because it will argue that the insertion of additional assumptions should not concern the taxpayer. It could lead to disputes about whether an assumption is, or is not, material post-assessment. This outcome would be 114 inconsistent with the primary aim of binding rulings – to provide taxpayers with prospective certainty of the tax effects of their transactions. Comment Although the Commissioner is required to state all material assumptions in the ruling, in theory there is no restriction on the inclusion of immaterial assumptions. The decision to subject assumptions to a materiality threshold is necessary because the materiality of the assumption cannot always be determined when the ruling is issued. The approach taken in the bill has the advantage of maximising the number of situations in which rulings can be issued, while minimising the fiscal risk. It is a taxpayer-positive development. Taxpayers’ certainty as to the tax effect of their transactions is no more compromised under this proposal than it is currently. Taxpayers need to ensure that the assumptions they made to the Commissioner are correct. At present if an assumption (even an immaterial assumption) proves to be incorrect the whole ruling is invalidated. Under clause 75 the ruling will be invalidated only if it can be shown objectively that the assumption was material. Officials disagree that this development will lead to a “scatter gun” approach. This change will not alter the way that Inland Revenue’s Ruling’s unit inserts assumptions. Assumptions are included only when the taxpayer is unable to provide information about future events or facts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (23 – Rudd Watts & Stone) If an assumption proves to be materially incorrect it should not automatically invalidate the whole ruling – if the assumption is not material to the remainder of the ruling. (For example, an assumption may be material to the application of one taxation law to the arrangement but not material to another. In this case the ruling should only cease to be binding in respect of the first taxation law.) 115 Comment Under this proposal, the Rulings unit would need to specify which part of the ruling each assumption applied to. This would be complicated and time consuming, and is unlikely to create certainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Conditions in binding rulings Clauses 77 and 84 Submission (23 - Rudd Watts & Stone) What types of conditions are contemplated by this amendment? Legislative guidance is necessary. Comment These clauses merely enact the current practise of Inland Revenue's Rulings unit, which is to identify key matters that must be assumed to be true for a ruling to be correct. Without the power to limit the application of a ruling through specifying key assumptions, the Commissioner would in many cases be unable to rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: What is meant by “consumer”? Clause 83 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The word “consumer” used in clause 83 should be defined. 116 Comment To alleviate any potential ambiguity the word “consumer” used in clause 83 should be defined to mean a party to an arrangement that is subject to a product ruling and who is not the applicant of the ruling. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Early publication of product rulings Clause 84 Submission (23 - Rudd Watts & Stone) The legislation should be modified to enable the Commissioner to publish a product ruling before the end of the two-month period if the applicant requests that it be published and it is practicable for the Commissioner to do so. Comment As currently drafted, the proposed legislation allows two months from the date a product ruling is issued to the date the ruling is publicly released. The time delay is included so that the applicant may reap some commercial advantage from the ruling before the contents are made public. It is acknowledged that there may be instances when applicants may wish to have their product ruling made public before the expiry of the two-month period. In these circumstances it should be possible for the applicant to apply in writing to the Commissioner requesting early publication. The Commissioner would then issue a notification in the Gazette and seek to publish the ruling in full in a departmental publication as soon as possible. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 117 Issue: Redraft of proposed section 91G Clause 87 Submission (23- Rudd Watts & Stone) Proposed section 91G refers to taxation law that has been repealed, but not necessarily replaced. Consequently it makes no sense to refer to the repeal changing the way the \[old\] taxation law applies to the arrangement. Comment This change is not necessary. If a section is repealed, the way the taxation law applies to the ruling has clearly changed, in that it no longer applies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Notification provisions for binding rulings Clause 88 Submission (Matter raised by officials) No notification provisions have been provided for “status” rulings. Comment Both private and product rulings contain a notification provision that requires the Commissioner to send a copy of the ruling to the applicant as soon as possible after the date on which the ruling was made. No provision has been made for this to occur for “status rulings”. Clause 88 should be amended to require that the Commissioner send a copy of the “status” ruling to the applicant as soon as practicable after the date on which the ruling is made. 118 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor changes to the operation of “status” rulings Clause 88 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirements for “status rulings” need to be specified in greater detail. Comment The requirements for “status” rulings provide only a broad outline of the process. Further discussions with those in Inland Revenue responsible for issuing these rulings has resulted in a few process-orientated recommendations for further refinement of the legislation. • inclusion of an authority provision – giving the Commissioner express power to make a “status” ruling; • inclusion of provisions where the Commissioner can refuse to make a “status” ruling – essentially mirroring the private and product ruling requirements; • clarification that a “status” ruling is annulled when the private or product ruling on which it is based is withdrawn; • including more comprehensive disclosure requirements - mirroring the private and product ruling requirements; • giving the Commissioner power to request further information in relation to the “status” ruling; and • requiring the Commissioner send a copy of the “status” ruling to the applicant as soon as possible. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 119 Issue: Redraft of proposed section 91GD Clause 88 Submission (23 – Rudd Watts & Stone) The section should be redrafted as follows: “The Commissioner does not have to withdraw and reissue a new ruling to correct a typographical or a minor error if the correction does not alter the ruling on how the taxation law applies to the person or the arrangement.” Comment Officials agree that the section needs to be redrafted, and the validity of the ruling should be emphasised. The section should be redrafted along the following lines: Effect of a minor error on binding ruling –(1) The Commissioner does not have to withdraw and reissue a new ruling to correct a typographical or a minor error if the correction does not change the way the taxation law applies to the person or the arrangement. (2) In the circumstances outlined in (1) the ruling remains binding. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Publication of product “status” rulings Clause 88 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed legislation should provide a mechanism for the publication of product “status” rulings. 120 Comment The bill introduces a new variety of ruling – the “status” ruling. This ruling is issued in response to a law change to give applicants some certainty as to whether their original ruling still applies. The bill does not provide for the publication of product “status” rulings. It is officials’ view that once a status ruling has been issued it should be notified in the Gazette and published in full in a departmental publication as soon as possible. If the original ruling has not yet been publicly released, notification and publication of the status ruling must be withheld until the original ruling is published. The original ruling and the status ruling may be published together. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Outstanding debts Clause 90 Submission 1 (Matter raised by officials) Clause 90 needs to be amended to clarify that the outstanding debts must relate specifically to earlier binding ruling applications, not to outstanding debts generally. Comment As currently drafted, clause 90 is not specific enough in its reference to outstanding debts. The policy of the section is that if an applicant has outstanding debts in relation to previous binding ruling applications the Commissioner should be able to decline to issue further rulings until these debts are paid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 121 Submission 2 (Matter raised by officials) The application date for this section should be changed to coincide with the introduction of new rates for binding rulings. Comment The application date for the section should be changed from the date of enactment to 1 June 1999. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disputable decisions Clause 99 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A decision by the Commissioner to decline to issue a ruling should be specifically excluded from the dispute resolution process. Comment As currently drafted, clause 99 removes from the ambit of the dispute resolution process decisions made by the Commissioner as part of a binding ruling or status ruling. However, it is arguable that clause 99 does not remove from the disputes process decisions of the Commissioner not to issue a ruling. The correct policy, as outlined in the discussion paper Legislative Review of Binding Rulings, is for such decisions to be excluded from the disputes process. Taxpayers whose applications are declined would still be free to initiate judicial review proceedings to challenge the decision-making process. 122 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Power to waive fees Submission (Matter raised by officials) The regulations on private and product rulings state that the Commissioner may waive fees in exceptional circumstances. The legislation (section 91I) needs to be amended to make it clear that the Governor General has authority to regulate on this issue. Comment The proposed amendment of this issue, recently identified by officials, is merely a clarification. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 123 TAX RECOVERY AGREEMENTS Issue: Age limitations on assistance in recovery of tax Clause 101 Submissions (12 - ICANZ) Any tax agreement that is entered into should only have prospective effect. The maximum amount of time that a tax recovery agreement should apply is the length of time that a New Zealand taxpayer is required to keep business records seven years from the end of the year to which the assessment relates). Comment The proposed legislation does not sanction any action taken by the Commissioner before enactment, nor does it retrospectively impose a tax liability. It merely authorises the Commissioner to collect tax debt, following enactment. In this regard, therefore, the legislation is not retrospective. Officials consider that it would be inappropriate to limit recovery action to debts that arise after the entry into force of each tax recovery agreement. This would be inconsistent with the international norm for such agreements. It would also be inconsistent with the tax recovery agreement that New Zealand has negotiated with the Netherlands. When developing the proposed legislation officials did recognise, however, that there was merit to including a cap on the age of recoverable debt. It was recommended, therefore, that the proposed legislation provide that a debt must not have been outstanding as an uncontested tax liability longer than six years before the entry into force of the relevant tax recovery agreement. Officials also recognised the desirability of a cap on the age of debt which, although it remains recoverable under the laws of the requesting country and meets the six-year rule described above, is still becoming old. In developing an appropriate provision, officials drew upon a model tax recovery agreement the OECD is currently developing. This provides that a state is not obliged to comply with a request for assistance that has been made after a period of 15 years from the date the debt first became recoverable. The rationale for this provision is that a 15-year period provides a balance between providing sufficient time for disputes to be settled domestically before foreign 124 assistance is required, and allowing a requested state to avoid the obligation to collect unacceptably old debt. It was, therefore, recommended that the proposed legislation contain a provision to this effect. There is no need to limit the period to the length of time that a New Zealand taxpayer is required to keep business records, as the availability of taxpayer records will not be a material factor in collection under a tax recovery agreement. Any request for assistance in recovery of a foreign tax debt must be accompanied by written particulars of the amount of the tax claim; the extent, if any, to which the requesting country considers that the tax claim is uncontested; a declaration that the request meets the terms of the relevant tax recovery agreement; and a certified or notarized copy of the instrument permitting enforcement in the other country. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: New Zealand’s entry into tax recovery agreements Clause 101 Submission (23W - Rudd Watts & Stone) New Zealand should only enter into tax recovery agreements once the boundaries of our domestic tax regime have been properly defined. Comment The supporting comments suggest that the submission is: • concerned with the possibility that taxpayer rights will be undermined by New Zealand’s entry into tax recovery agreements; and • driven by the perception that due consideration has not been given to the issue. The Government recognises that entry into tax recovery agreements by New Zealand will allow for extra-territorial enforcement of foreign revenue laws, in as much as New Zealand will assist in the collection of foreign tax debt, and foreign jurisdictions will assist in the collection of New Zealand tax debt. Careful consideration has, therefore, been given to the issue. 125 The proposed legislation has been developed in close consultation with the Ministry of Justice, and has been considered by the Legislation Advisory Committee. During this drafting process every effort has been made to ensure that the proposed legislation sets appropriate boundaries on the application of tax recovery agreements, thereby adequately safeguarding taxpayer rights. The provisions are consistent with the main terms and conditions of New Zealand’s first tax recovery agreement, negotiated with the Netherlands, which will provide a precedent for future agreements to be negotiated with other countries. This agreement has been derived from the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters — the international model developed by the Council of Europe and the OECD. Throughout its development the model was subjected to extensive consideration by experts in international law and tax who carefully considered the issues concerning legal process and taxpayer rights. International co-operation in tax administration has been recognised by the OECD as a necessary response to the deregulation of international commerce, and the ongoing removal of barriers to global investment and movement of capital. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Rights of appeal Clause 101 Submission (Matter raised by officials) That minor amendments be made to the proposed section 173I, to remove a redundant provision and correct imprecise drafting. Comment The proposed section 173I provides a taxpayer with a right of appeal on a question of fact or law that arises from the exercise of any authority, discretion, power, provision or right by the Commissioner or a competent authority under the legislation. Subsection (2) provides that the District Court may determine the reasonableness of such an exercise. 126 An appeal on a question of fact or law does not involve a determination of reasonableness. Officials recommend, therefore, that subsection (2) be omitted, on the basis that it is redundant. The proposed section 173I(1) refers to a taxpayer who “claims to be affected” as having a right of appeal. It should simply provide that a taxpayer “may appeal”. The proposed section 173I(1) refers to “...the Commissioner or a competent authority...”. This should be changed to “...the Commissioner or another competent authority...”. The proposed section 173I(3) refers to “...the Commissioner or the competent authority”, and should be changed to “...the Commissioner or the other competent authority”. These changes are necessary because, as defined by the proposed legislation, the Commissioner is a competent authority. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 127 DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Limiting deductions under certain arrangements Clause 101 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Changes should be made to the proposed compliance and administrative requirements for reducing deductions under certain arrangements involving expenditure on films and petroleum exploration. A number of other minor presentational drafting changes are also required in this area. Comment Clause 59 of the bill requires taxpayers who have claimed deductions under an arrangement of the type in question to file an amended annual return for the income year in which consideration for the disposal of property is derived. The TAA does not generally require the filing of amended returns. Rather, in circumstances similar to these it requires the filing of special returns in a form prescribed by the Commissioner. The reference to “amended returns” should, therefore, be changed to “special returns”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 128 Changes To The GST Act 129 GST ON OVERSEAS MAIL DELIVERY IN NEW ZEALAND Issue: Approval of the amending legislation Clauses 109–110 Submission (17W – Telecom New Zealand Limited) Telecom wishes to note its support for the introduction of amending legislation to zero-rate the supply of postal services in relation to the delivery of overseas mail in New Zealand. Recommendation None. Issue: Application date Submission (15W – New Zealand Post) The amending legislation should apply from either: • the date from which GST first applied to the supply of goods and services in New Zealand, namely 1 October 1986, or • the first day of the month from which officials became aware of the anomaly the amending legislation seeks to correct, namely 1 July 1998. Comment The broad aim of goods and services tax (GST) is to tax all final consumption that occurs in New Zealand. Agreements between international postal authorities deem the consumption of the delivery of international mail to occur at the time the letter is posted. To tax the fees charged by New Zealand Post to overseas postal organisations for the delivery of international mail in New Zealand would be against the intention of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, since the consumption of these services occurs outside New Zealand. Other comparable services, such as international courier services, are not subject to GST, creating economic distortions through providing them with a tax-based price advantage. 130 The Act specifies an exclusion from zero-rating for exported services performed directly in connection with movable personal property situated in New Zealand. As mail is considered to be movable personal property, mail delivery services, even if provided to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand, are subject to GST. The amendment seeks to align the treatment of overseas mail delivery services in New Zealand with the original policy intent with effect from the date the Act receives the royal assent. The New Zealand Post argument for retrospectively applying the amendment from 1 October 1986 is based on the original policy intent that services rendered to non- residents who are outside New Zealand at the time of supply should not be subject to GST. Officials consider that the amendment should apply prospectively as provided in the bill. While the amendment seeks to correct a situation in which the intended policy was not reflected in the legislation, officials do not believe that the amendment should be retrospective for the following reasons: • As a general rule retrospective legislation creates legislative and taxpayer uncertainty. • Retrospective legislation would not reduce any economic distortions as it will not alter purchasing decisions already made. It would merely result in a refund of $12 million of GST already paid by New Zealand Post. • Making this amendment retrospective would give an unrealistic expectation to other taxpayers seeking corrective remedial legislation. New Zealand Post has also suggested an alternative application date of 1 July 1998, the first day of the month in which the issue was brought to the attention of officials. Officials consider that there is also no justification for this date, for the reasons stated above. Retrospective legislation could be appropriate where there are significant benefits that would justify an exception. Officials consider there are no significant benefits in this case that would justify an exception to this general rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined.

Instead they make other proposals in relation to the section’s scope and methodology. Instead of making piecemeal changes in response to these submissions, officials recommend that section FC 3 be totally reviewed to ensure that it works appropriately. This would address the submitters’ concerns that the section should spell out more clearly what it covers. In the meantime, the proposed extension of the section’s scope, as outlined in the bill, should proceed. Background Section FC 3 can apply when a company owns shares that it intends to sell. This section is designed to ensure that the exempt dividend provisions, such as the inter-corporate dividend exemption for wholly owned group members, cannot be used to avoid the tax that should be paid on disposal of the shares. This can be illustrated as follows: Suppose Parent Co buys all the shares in Target Co for $100 with the intention of selling them. They are eventually sold for $110 – the $10 gain is taxable. Now suppose that Parent Co causes Target Co to pay it a dividend of $30 and then Target Co is sold for $80. In the absence of section FC 3, Parent Co would have derived an exempt dividend of $30 and suffered, for tax purposes, a tax loss of $20 on the transaction, notwithstanding the net gain of $10. Section FC 3 provides that the $30 dividend is income from the ‘sale’ of the shares – thus the net gain of $10 is taxable. Other aspects of section FC 3 are: • The section applies only to dividends that are paid out of pre-acquisition reserves because these represent a return of part of the purchase price. In contrast, dividends paid out of post-acquisition reserves are a return on the amount invested. • The shares do not need to be sold for an adjustment to be made. • To ensure that there is no double taxation, the intention is that the adjustment is reduced by any of the dividend amounts that are taxable. Changes proposed in the bill The two changes proposed in the bill widen the section’s coverage to include: • all revenue account shareholders, not merely those shareholders engaged in the business of dealing in shares or who have acquired the shares for the purpose of selling them; and 5 • associated companies of the shareholder. These changes are being made for base maintenance reasons and are intended to apply from the date the bill was introduced into Parliament (20 May 1999). Issue: Gross income and exempt income Clause 5 Submission (11W - PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proviso to subsection 1 (in particular subparagraph (d)) of the current section should be rewritten to clarify whether the reference to ‘dividends that have been treated as gross income under subsection (2)’ includes dividends treated as exempt income under section CB 10(2). Comment We agree that the interaction of the proviso to section FC 3(1) with section FC 3(2) is confusing and might be open to various interpretations in terms of which dividends are taken into account to ensure that the gross income generated by section FC 3 does not result in double taxation. Double taxation would arise if the payment were taxed once under section FC 3 and again as a dividend. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage, pending further work. Issue: Interaction of foreign dividend withholding payments Clause 5 Submission (11W - PricewaterhouseCoopers) To avoid what effectively amounts to double taxation, section FC 3 should recognise any liability for foreign dividend withholding payment deductions (FDWP) when adjusting the amount that is brought to account as gross income. Comment We propose that this matter be left at this stage, but that it be explored as part of further work on section FC 3. Clearly, dividends from non-portfolio revenue account investments in grey list countries do not result in double taxation because they are not subject to FDWP. In contrast, in cases when FDWP is payable there could be effectively double taxation. 6 Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage, pending further work. Issue: Dividends including imputation credits Clause 5 Submission (11W - PricewaterhouseCoopers) Sections FC 3 and CF 2(15) should be standardised in terms of their inclusion of imputation credits in dividends when adjusting gross income to ensure that there is no double taxation. Comment The submission raises an issue that we propose to explore as part of further work on section FC 3. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage, pending further work. Issue: Interaction with section CF 2(15) Clause 5 Submission (11W - PricewaterhouseCoopers) The interaction of sections FC 3 and CF 2(15) should be clarified given that: • CF 2(15) is explicitly ‘subject to FC 3’, and • CF 2(15) applies only in situations when shares are cancelled, whereas FC 3 applies more widely. Comment The purpose of the reference in section CF 2(15) to FC 3 is to avoid double taxation. The wording in this area appears in need of clarification, as part of the wider review of section FC 3. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage, pending further work. 7 Issue: Cost basis adjustment for shares subject to FC 3 Clause 5 Submission (11W - PricewaterhouseCoopers) After the enactment of the Core Provisions amendments in 1996 it is clear that there is no matching deduction for either the whole or any part of the cost of the shares against the section FC 3 income deemed to arise from the sale of the shares. This should be fixed. Comment We agree that there should be an adjustment if section FC 3 is applied. However, a deduction for the cost of shares that have not been sold appears inappropriate given that the cost of shares held on revenue account is taken into consideration only when the shares are sold (under section EF 2). Similarly, the current requirement to bring the section FC 3 deemed income ‘adjustment’ to account in the current income year as gross income seems inappropriate. Accordingly, officials will be exploring other options as part of the review of the section. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage, pending further work. Issue: Application to pre and post-acquisition reserves Clause 5 Submission (4 – ICANZ, 11W - PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section FC 3 should be redrafted: • to clarify that dividends distributed from post-acquisition reserves do not fall within its scope, and • so that dividends be deemed to be distributed from post-acquisition reserves first (ICANZ only). Comment Officials agree that section FC 3 should be redrafted to clarify the transactions to which it applies. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage, pending further work. 8 Issue: Limit coverage to dividend stripping arrangements Clause 5 Submissions (4 - ICANZ) Section FC 3 should be limited to dividend stripping arrangements. It should not extend to normal commercial arrangements involving the distribution of dividends. The current section FC 3(1)(b)(i) should, therefore, be excluded. Comment This submission misses the point of section FC 3. Any return on an investment held on revenue account should constitute gross income. A return of pre-acquisition profits from shares held on revenue account should, therefore, be gross income. A distribution of pre- acquisition profits need not be confined to an arrangement to buy shares. It can also be achieved through having a controlling shareholding and, hence, the reason for subsection FC 3(1)(b)(i). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Limit to wholly-owned companies Clause 5 Submissions (4 - ICANZ) Section FC 3 should be limited to wholly-owned companies. Comment Officials recommend that the submission be considered as part of the wider review of section FC 3. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage, pending the wider review. 9 NEW ZEALAND RASPBERRY MARKETING COUNCIL Issue: Consistency of terminology with the Raspberry Marketing Authorities (Dissolution) Regulations 1999. Clause 10 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The terminology used in the proposed amendment should be consistent with that used in the Raspberry Marketing Authorities (Dissolution) Regulations 1999. Comment The Raspberry Marketing Authorities (Dissolution) Regulations 1999 have recently been enacted and were not finalised at the time the proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 1994 was prepared. The suggested changes ensure that the terms used in the amendment to the Income Tax Act 1994 are consistent with the terms used in the regulations. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Available subscribed capital of Rubus Investments Nelson Limited Clause 10 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should clarify that following the distribution of shares in Rubus Investments Nelson Limited (Rubus) to the current growers for the Nelson Raspberry Marketing Committee, there will be available subscribed capital in Rubus representing those shares issued to current growers. Comment As drafted, the legislation is unclear as to whether Rubus has any available subscribed capital (ASC) following the distribution of shares to current growers. ASC generally represents the contributions of capital made by shareholders to a company. ASC can be returned to shareholders in certain circumstances without a tax cost. As the legislation is currently drafted, it is not clear whether growers could be said to have paid capital into Rubus. Nevertheless, the current growers have, in effect, at least for tax purposes, received a distribution of Cold Storage Nelson Limited shares and then contributed them to Rubus in return for shares in Rubus. Consequently, the market value of Cold Storage Nelson Limited shares should be equal to the ASC of Rubus. It is important to note that under the proposed 10 legislation, current growers would be taxed on the value of the shares in CSNL they effectively receive. That distribution is likely to be covered by imputation credits and capital gain amounts and consequently is unlikely to have a tax cost for the grower. The result of this treatment is that the growers are effectively putting a tax-paid contribution into Rubus, so there should be ASC in Rubus representing that contribution. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 11 CONDUIT TAXATION Issue: Avoiding double debits Clause 21 Submission (4 – ICANZ) An amendment should be made to ensure that a section FH 8(5) adjustment does not give rise to a debit in the conduit tax relief accounts of both the consolidated group and the individual company. Comment When a conduit tax relief account company has excessive interest expense in New Zealand and this is applied against its dividend withholding payment income, a conduit tax relief adjustment is calculated under section FH 8(5). If the relevant company is a member of a consolidated group, the bill, as introduced, would result in a debit arising to the conduit tax relief accounts of both the company and the consolidated group. This result is unintended, and an amendment is, therefore, appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transfers between memorandum accounts Clause 21 Submission (4 – ICANZ) The operation of new section MI 20 should be widened to allow credit balances to be transferred from an individual company's conduit tax relief account or dividend withholding payment account against debit balances in the consolidated group's dividend withholding payment account or conduit tax relief account. Comment The conduit tax relief account rules for consolidated groups are broadly patterned on the existing rules for consolidated group dividend withholding payment account rules. Those rules in turn are similar to those for consolidated group imputation credit accounts. The general rule followed for a company that becomes a member of a consolidated group is that any transactions to which the company is party after becoming a member affect the relevant memorandum account of the consolidated group. Balances existing before the company becomes a member of the group remain in that company's individual account, but 12 may be drawn into the consolidated group's account to offset subsequent entries to the group's account. The rule in section MI 20(1) to which the submission relates deals with a special case unique to the conduit rules. When under a wash-up adjustment a credit is transferred from a dividend withholding payment account to a conduit tax relief account, Inland Revenue is required to make a refund to the taxpayer to the extent of the transfer. In the absence of the special rule in section MI 20(1), it may be possible for a consolidated group, as a whole, to have received an appropriate amount of conduit relief (reflected in the aggregate balance of the conduit tax relief account of the group and its members being in credit), but still effectively obtain further relief from a refund for a transfer within the consolidated group's memorandum accounts (resulting because the conduit tax relief account of the consolidated group itself is in debit). Given the aggregate situation, issuing a refund for a wash-up adjustment would result in an inappropriate cost to the revenue. Similar revenue concerns do not arise for other transfers involving the dividend withholding payment account, hence the absence of a special rule to cover them in the bill. It should also be recognised that the taxpayer base to which the consolidated group conduit rules will apply is very narrow, and for the rules in question to apply, is also likely to require that a company has been a conduit tax relief account company before becoming a member of a consolidated group. The amendment sought by the submission will add complexity to the drafting, and does seem to seek a level of refinement that is not justified by the narrow ambit of the rules. Aside from the revenue consideration outlined above, there also does not appear to be a clear case for why the conduit rules for transfers between a consolidated group and its members should diverge from the precedent established in the rules for other memorandum accounts. Officials recommend, therefore, that the submission be declined. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting clarification - Shareholder measurement dates Clauses 14 and 25 Submission (4 – ICANZ) Additional words should be added to sections KH 2(2) and NH 7(3A) to clarify the effect of the subsections. 13 Comment The submission seeks the insertion of additional words in the legislation, to clarify the interface between certain subsections. Officials agree that inserting additional words would make the legislation less confusing and is, therefore, desirable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Effect of conduit election rules Clause 19 Submission (4 – ICANZ) Consequential amendments should be made to sections MG 6 and MZ 4 so that when a company has revoked an election to be a conduit tax relief account company, but the revocation is not yet effective, the company may attach dividend withholding payment credits to dividends paid to non-residents without the limitation currently imposed by section MZ 4. Comment The submission argues that if a company has revoked an election to be a conduit tax relief account company, the requirement under section MG 6 that it still attach only conduit tax relief account credits to dividends paid to non-resident shareholders could result in it carrying the cost of paying additional dividends until it can obtain a refund after the end of the income year. First and foremost, it must be recognised that the taxpayer base to which the conduit rules apply is very narrow. Consequently, the revocation of a conduit election will not be commonplace. The amendment sought by the submission does, therefore, seem to be seeking a level of refinement to the rules that is not justified by their narrow ambit. There is, however, also a counter-argument to the amendment sought which is not contemplated in the submission. Even though a company may have revoked its election to be a conduit tax relief account company, conduit relief could still arise if an income tax return is filed for a relevant income year after a revocation is made but before it takes effect. If the amendment sought in the submission is made, an inappropriate cash-flow advantage would then arise to the company instead. The cash flow issue here is essentially the same as that raised by the wash-up adjustment in section MI 6. It was an accepted fact in developing that rule that a perfect credit allocation rule does not exist. The wash-up adjustment was implemented as a compromise acceptable to both Government and affected taxpayers and can, depending on circumstances, result in a taxpayer's cash flow being advantaged or disadvantaged. 14 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 JOINT BANK ACCOUNTS BETWEEN RESIDENTS AND NON- RESIDENTS Clause 24 Submission (4 – ICANZ) The proposed amendment should be considered further before implementation. Comment When interest income is derived jointly by residents and non-residents, the payer is often not readily able to identify the respective beneficial entitlement of each recipient. This can create compliance difficulties for payers seeking to determine the correct amount of tax to withhold. It also creates administrative difficulties, as residents that have been subjected to the lower non-resident withholding rate have no incentive to advise Inland Revenue and account for the under-deducted tax. The amendment was intended to remove doubt over the withholding rate that should apply. Its aim was to achieve the following: • Non-resident withholding tax should be imposed on interest derived jointly by residents and non-residents at the rate of resident withholding tax. However, if the payer is not required to deduct resident withholding tax, he or she should not be relieved from the obligation to deduct non-resident withholding tax. • Treaty relief should still be available, but only on application to Inland Revenue for a refund of over-deducted tax, as contrasted with relief arising at source under existing rules. Relief will not, however, be available other than under a treaty. • Subject to treaty relief, NRWT deducted under the new rules should remain a final tax on the non-resident, even though the rate of tax will be higher than what it is at present. In most cases, the amendment would lead to an over-deduction of tax on that portion of interest to which a non-resident is beneficially entitled. The submission questions whether this is the intended effect, particularly for residents of non-treaty countries, who would have no entitlement to seek a refund of the over-deduction. Officials confirm that this effect was intended – the purpose is to encourage non-residents to operate separate bank accounts if they want the correct withholding rates to apply. Further, by setting the non-resident withholding rate equal to the resident withholding rate, the amendment also ensures that residents cannot have withholding tax under-deducted on their interest income by being treated as non- residents. The submission also questions whether it was intended that the amendment would allow non- residents to take a deduction for expenses incurred in deriving the relevant interest income. Officials acknowledge that this effect was unintended. It compromises the integrity of the non-resident tax base, and could have the perverse effect of encouraging non-residents to derive interest jointly with residents. It is desirable that this anomaly be addressed by 16 ensuring that interest income earned by non-residents is treated as non-resident withholding income, thereby preventing the deduction of expenses. Recommendation That an amendment be made to ensure that non-residents are not inadvertently permitted to access deductions against their interest income derived from New Zealand. 17 AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL Issue: Clarification of wording Clause 26 Submission (4-ICANZ) The proposed amendment is appropriate, although the wording suggested in section OB1 is ambiguous and should be clarified. Clarification suggestion 1: Excluded from available subscribed capital \[ASC\] is consideration received by a company “if the consideration is the giving up of rights or interests of membership in the company”. Presumably the company refers only to the company which has received the consideration. Accordingly, the giving up of rights in another company (which is not associated or in substance the same company) could still produce the unintended result. The definition goes on to state “The total available subscribed capital per share in calculated after deducting the “ineligible capital amount”. Reference to the term “ineligible capital amount” suggests that the definition is intended to apply both to the giving up of rights in the company or another company. If this is the case, the definition should refer to any company instead of the company. Comment In relation to the first part of this suggestion, to replace “the company” with “any company” would mean that the words “(which is associated or in substance the same company)” would become meaningless and the provision would become much broader in operation. To go wider could lead to unintended results, and the amendment could potentially apply to situations not intended to be covered. As for the second part of the suggestion, the reference to “the company” rather than “any company” in relation to the “ineligible capital amount” is intended to track the current wording in the ASC definition of “ineligible capital amount”. Consequently, to change this might also have consequences for that definition and could give rise to unintended consequences under both parts. Clarification Suggestion 2: It is unclear, or at the least confusing, to include within the definition of ASC reference to Available Subscribed Capital. We note that this already occurs within the definition, however where we are calculating the ASC in a particular company we are required to refer to the ASC in the same company. 18 Comment There may be an element of circularity in referring to the term “available subscribed capital per share” within the definition of “available subscribed capital” but this does not, in our view, require clarification. In fact, clarification by way of including the definition of “available subscribed capital per share” within this definition would give an unnecessarily long and complicated definition. It would, however, help to clarify the timing of the calculation of the available subscribed capital per share that is referred to in the amendment. In this regard the legislation should refer to the available subscribed capital immediately before the rights or interests are given up. Officials also believe that it would make the legislation clearer if the reference to “total available subscribed capital” was instead to “aggregate available subscribed capital”. This would mean there was consistency of terminology within the definition of “available subscribed capital”. Recommendation That the submission be declined but the timing of available subscribed capital be clarified and the reference to “total available subscribed capital” be replaced by “aggregate available subscribed capital”. 19 CROWN ENTITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED PERSON TEST Clauses 27 and 28 Submission (1W - KPMG on behalf of Meridian Energy Limited) Further amendments are necessary to the special corporate entity (SCE) rules to: 1. clarify that the subsidiaries of SCEs cannot group loss offset with the subsidiaries of any other SCE; and 2. confirm that subsidiaries of a SCE can group losses with its parent SCE. These are generic problems with the SCE rules. Comment Officials are still considering issues raised by this submission and will report further. 20 GST - TREATMENT OF EXPORTED SERVICES General comment The proposed amendment is intended to exclude from the GST zero rating provisions the supply of services that are consumed in New Zealand but contracted for by a non-resident who is outside New Zealand. The amendment aims to protect the integrity of the tax base by ensuring that services consumed in New Zealand are subject to GST, even though a non- resident may have purchased the service. An example of this would be where a non-resident parent contracts with a New Zealand school to educate the parent's non-resident child in New Zealand. The boundary between which services should be zero rated and which should be standard rated for GST purposes is difficult to draw with exact precision. It is likely that other difficulties in this area will emerge, and they can be considered as part of the Government's current wider review of the GST Act. Issue: Consumption in New Zealand Clause 38 Submission (4 – ICANZ) The current drafting of the proposed section 11(2A) should be amended to take into account whether any consumption of those services occurs in New Zealand when the non-resident is present in New Zealand. Comment The submission considers that new section 11(2A) does not determine whether there has been any consumption of services while the non-resident has been in New Zealand, only whether the non-resident was present in New Zealand. However, officials consider that the current drafting does focus on consumption in New Zealand rather than merely presence in New Zealand. Paragraph (a) of the new provision refers to the performance of the services being received by a person. Such receipt of the performance of services is equivalent to the consumption of those services. Although officials recognise that there is an element of uncertainty with both terms, the receipt of performance terminology provides a more accurate description of the consumption of services than the use of consumption terminology, whose meaning can vary depending on the context in which it is used. Paragraph (c) then requires the person receiving the performance of the services to be in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Officials consider, therefore, that the current drafting of new section 11(2A) takes into account whether any consumption of services has occurred in New Zealand. 21 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarifying persons referred to Clause 38 Submission (4 – ICANZ) The current drafting of proposed new section 11(2A) does not clearly address which “person” it is referring to. For instance, it is unclear as to whether “the person” in subparagraph (i) refers to the “another person” in paragraph (a) or, alternatively, “a person” in the body of the section. This uncertainty, in turn, means that the reference to “other person” in paragraphs (b) and (c) is unclear. Accordingly, the drafting should be clarified. A suggested redraft is provided. Comment Officials do not consider that the current drafting of proposed section 11(2A) is unclear as to which persons are being referred to. “The person” in subparagraph (i) clearly refers to “a person” in the opening words of the provision and not to the “another person” in paragraph (a). There are two main reasons for this. First, the subparagraph (i) wording of “the person who is not resident in New Zealand” is based on the wording used in the opening words of the provision: “a person who is not resident in New Zealand”. Also, the use of the definite article “the” in subparagraph (i) relates back to the use of the indefinite article in “a person” in the opening words. “”“”“”“”“”“”“”“” Although officials consider that the current drafting of new section 11(2A) is clear, it is possible to provide more assistance to users of the legislation by using the term “person A” for the non-resident contracting for the services and the term “person B” for the person receiving the performance of the services. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, in part, by using the descriptors “person A” and “person B” for the person contracting for the services and the person receiving the performance of the services respectively. 22 Issue: Timing relationship Clause 38 Submission (4 – ICANZ) The current drafting of proposed section 11(2A) should be amended to clarify the timing relationship between the receiving of the services under paragraph (a) and the presence in New Zealand under paragraph (c). Comment The clarification sought by ICANZ can be achieved by removing paragraph (c) and inserting into paragraph (a) a requirement that the receipt must be in New Zealand. The submission also provides an example where a non-resident company contracts to receive services from a New Zealand supplier and in order to arrange for the provision of those services the Chief Financial Officer of the non-resident company visits New Zealand for a short period. The submission considers that under the current drafting of new section 11(2A), the provision of the services would not be zero rated because the performance of the services has been received by the Chief Financial Officer who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. The submission seeks clarification to the new section on this point.“” Officials consider that the supply of the services in the example would continue to be zero rated under the amendment. The performance of the services under the contract is received by the non-resident company only. New section 11(2A) would therefore not be applicable. The remaining question is whether the company is “outside New Zealand” in terms of the zero rating provision in section 11(2)(e). Officials consider that the minor presence test in new section 11(2B) would apply to ensure that the supply of the services in the example would continue to be zero rated under section 11(2)(e). Therefore no amendment is necessary to ensure that the services supplied in the example are zero rated. An appropriate example will be included in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin item on the amendment to illustrate this point. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, by removing paragraph (c) of the new provision and inserting in paragraph (a) a requirement that the receipt must be in New Zealand. 23 Issue: Fees received by New Zealand travel agents from overseas suppliers for arranging overseas bookings Clause 38 Submission (3 – Travel Agents Association of New Zealand) The proposed legislation should be amended so that fees received by New Zealand travel agents from overseas suppliers for arranging offshore travel and accommodation packages for those travelling out of New Zealand are zero rated. Comment Officials agree that proposed section 11(2A) may affect the current zero rating of arranging services provided by New Zealand travel agents to overseas suppliers. This is because the performance of the arranging service supplied by the New Zealand travel agents may be received by those travelling out of New Zealand as well as by the overseas suppliers. New section 11(2A) may apply if the arranging service is performed when the traveller is still in New Zealand. In policy terms, however, zero rating is the appropriate GST treatment of these arranging services because the services which are arranged, such as accommodation, are physically performed outside New Zealand. An amendment should be made, therefore, to ensure the zero rating of services comprising the arranging of services physically performed outside New Zealand. This amendment would be consistent with the existing zero rating provision in section 11(2)(d) concerning services physically performed outside New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted by making an amendment to section 11(2)(d) to zero rate services comprising the arranging of services that are physically performed outside New Zealand. Issue: Modifications to new section 11(2A) Clause 38 Submission (5W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) Proposed section 11(2A) should be modified to provide that: • the subsection applies only to the extent that the criteria in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are satisfied; and • paragraph (c) of the provision is also prefaced by the words “it is reasonably foreseeable”. 24 Comment Proposed section 11(2A) will provide a further restriction on existing section 11(2)(e), which zero rates services contractually supplied to a non-resident. Existing section 11(2)(e) does not contain any apportionment wording. A supply of services to a non-resident either qualifies for zero rating under section 11(2)(e) or it does not. It would not be appropriate at this time to introduce apportionment wording (such as “to the extent that” suggested by the submitter) in new section 11(2A) as it would result in an inconsistency between that provision and existing section 11(2)(e), which contains no apportionment wording. The issue of apportionment has wider implications and, therefore, requires further consideration as part of the current wider review of the GST Act. Officials agree with the submitter that at the time of supply there may be no certainty as to whether the “other person” referred to in paragraph (c) (the person receiving the performance of the services) will be in or outside New Zealand when the services are performed. “”“” In response to a submission from ICANZ, officials are recommending that paragraph (c) be removed. However, the new reference to future presence in New Zealand in paragraph (a) should be prefaced by a requirement that such presence be “reasonably foreseeable”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, in part, by “”“”prefacing the reference to future presence in New Zealand in paragraph (a) with a requirement that that presence be “reasonably foreseeable”. Issue: Services supplied to a non-resident company through a representative in New Zealand Clause 38 Submission (8W – Stuart Hutchinson) Proposed section 11(2A), in its current form, would inappropriately exclude from zero rating the supply of services (such as professional advice) consumed offshore by a non-resident company, but received in New Zealand by a representative who relays the advice to the non- resident company. New section 11(2A) would properly focus on third party arrangements if it were redrafted to refer to the consumption of services in New Zealand rather than the performance of the services being received by a person in New Zealand. A suggested redraft is provided. 25 Comment This submission is similar to that made by ICANZ. The submitter is concerned that proposed section 11(2A), as currently drafted, would impose GST on supplies of services (such as legal advice) to a non-resident company if a representative of the company (such as a director or employee of the company) received, on behalf of the company, the services in New Zealand. The submitter considers that the current drafting does not focus on either the intended recipient or on where the services are consumed, but instead incorrectly equates any receipt of the service in New Zealand with consumption of the service in New Zealand. Officials note that the current drafting is intended to focus on consumption in New Zealand. Paragraph (a) of new section 11(2A) refers to the performance of the services supplied being received by another person. Officials consider that such receipt of the performance of services is equivalent to the consumption of those services but is considered to be the more appropriate terminology in this context. Paragraph (c) requires the person receiving the performance of the services to be in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Officials consider that the supply of the services in the example where the non-resident company receives legal advice from a New Zealand firm would continue to be zero rated under the amendment. Officials agree with the submitter that the director of the non-resident company that is visiting New Zealand merely receives the legal advice as a conduit and relays that advice to the company. As the submission itself points out, it is the non-resident company, not its directors or employees, that makes use of and relies upon the legal advice supplied. Thus the performance of the services under the contract – that is, the provision of legal advice – is received by the non-resident company only. New section 11(2A) would, therefore, not be applicable. The remaining question is whether the company is “outside New Zealand” in terms of the zero rating provision in section 11(2)(e). Officials consider that the minor presence test in new section 11(2B) would apply to ensure that the supply of the services in the example would continue to be zero rated under section 11(2)(e) even though a director of the non-resident company was in New Zealand. The submission may have been prompted by the reference to an employee or director in paragraph (a). These references were included to distinguish between a company and its employees or directors in the situation where the employee or director does in fact receive the performance of a particular service, such as the provision of accommodation in New Zealand. In the case of an agreement to supply accommodation, the performance of the contract involves the provision of accommodation which is received by the individual employee or director. This should be distinguished from the submitter’s example of the provision of legal advice. Officials’ view is that such advice is clearly provided to the non-resident company only. No amendment is necessary, therefore, to ensure that the services supplied in the submitter’s example, or other similar cases involving professional services, are zero rated. An example will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin item on the amendment to illustrate this point. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 Issue: GST on education services supplied to foreign students Clause 38 Submission (6W – Association of Polytechnics in New Zealand and Education New Zealand Trust) There should be a specific amendment to zero rate all education services provided to foreign students except students who are permanent residents under the Immigration Act 1987. (“Education services” should be defined as services, not including goods, supplied by education institutes registered with the Ministry of Education.) Comment The aim of GST is to tax all consumption taking place in New Zealand. Therefore all services consumed in New Zealand should be subject to GST even though a non-resident may have purchased the service. The submitter wants to retain the current GST treatment of exported services as reflected in the Court of Appeal decision in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC as “the Government should not be looking to change confirmed law to ensure that the IRD’s interpretation is upheld”. Although the particular result in Wilson & Horton was correct in terms of policy, the wider implications of the decision were not desirable. The decision meant that services contracted for by a non-resident outside New Zealand qualify for zero rating even though they are not exported for offshore consumption by the non-resident, but instead are consumed in New Zealand by another person. An example of this would be the education of non-resident students at New Zealand education institutes. The submitter refers to the direct financial benefits to education institutes from the payment of fees by foreign students and the indirect benefits to the economy from the consumption by the students of other goods and services in New Zealand during the period of their studies. The submitter is also concerned that charging GST on educational services supplied to non- residents in New Zealand could undermine the international competitiveness of New Zealand education providers. The main aim of GST is to raise revenue in a way that imposes the lowest possible economic cost on New Zealand. To achieve this, GST is applied to the widest possible range of goods and services consumed in New Zealand, both by residents and non-residents. This reduces the extent to which GST distorts consumption and production decisions in New Zealand. Officials consider that if education services consumed by non-residents in New Zealand were zero-rated any benefits in terms of the sector’s international competitiveness would be considerably outweighed by the following factors: 27 • Significant GST revenue would be lost. • There would be a risk to the GST base because non-residents could purchase education services on behalf of residents. • Administrative costs would increase because of the opportunity for residents to avoid GST. • Compliance costs would increase because there would be two rates of tax on domestic supplies of education services. • Other sectors that provide services to non-residents that are consumed in New Zealand would seek similarly favourable treatment. • Production decisions would be distorted. International competitiveness is influenced by many factors, of which GST is only one. Any business can be made more “competitive” by a tax subsidy, such as not charging GST. However, given the Government’s revenue requirements, such subsidies are at the cost of higher tax on other (unsubsidised and profitable) business and are thus to the detriment of New Zealand’s overall economic welfare. The Government’s tax strategy recognises this by promoting a broad-base, low-rate tax system. Providing a subsidy by zero-rating education services provided to non-residents in New Zealand would be inconsistent with this strategy. There is also a horizontal equity argument for charging GST on all education services provided in New Zealand, whether paid for by residents or non-residents. New Zealand residents who are required to pay GST on education services they or their children receive could regard it as unfair that a non-resident attending the same education institute is not charged GST. Finally, the key overriding factor is the policy principle of taxing all consumption that takes place in New Zealand. Exports are not subject to GST because the consumption is considered to be outside New Zealand. Therefore the fact that fees received from the education of non-resident students in New Zealand would be classified by Statistics New Zealand as export receipts is not determinative. Similarly, all receipts from non-resident tourists would be classified as export receipts, yet all goods and services consumed in New Zealand by non-resident tourists are generally subject to GST. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Telecommunication services Clause 38 Submission (7 – Telecom New Zealand Ltd) 28 A further amendment, which is specific to telecommunication organisations, should be included in the bill to clarify that “inbound” international telecommunication services are zero rated. Comment The submitter is concerned that proposed section 11(2A) may, contrary to the policy intent, incorrectly exclude “inbound” telecommunication services from the GST zero rating provisions. The main example of an “inbound” telecommunication service is an overseas caller making a telephone call to a person in New Zealand. This service is provided to the overseas caller by an overseas telecommunications provider who contracts with a New Zealand telecommunications provider (for example, Telecom) to connect the call in New Zealand. Telecom serves as a link between the overseas telecommunications provider and the New Zealand resident receiving the phone call. Although there is always scope for a generic provision to give rise to differing interpretations, officials do not consider that new section 11(2A) affects the current zero rating of the connection services provided by New Zealand telecommunication providers to overseas telecommunications providers. This is because the performance of the connection service supplied by the New Zealand telecommunications provider is received by the overseas telecommunications provider only, not by the New Zealand resident receiving the call. New section 11(2A) is not applicable, therefore, because that provision would apply only if the performance of the connection services was received by a party other than the overseas telecommunications provider who contracted for those services. Accordingly, officials consider that section 11(2)(e) continues to apply to zero rate the connection service contractually supplied to the overseas telecommunications provider by the New Zealand telecommunications provider. For the performance of the connection service supplied by a New Zealand telecommunications provider to have been treated as being received by the New Zealand recipient of the call would require an indirect benefit test. For example, the opening words of paragraph (a) in new section 11(2A) would need to read: “A benefit of the services is or will be received by another person”. Such an indirect benefit test has not been employed in new section 11(2A). The receipt of performance test actually used in new section 11(2A) is inherently narrower than such an indirect benefit test. Therefore officials do not consider that a specific amendment is necessary to ensure that inbound telecommunications services continue to be zero rated. This is because there is a sufficiently clear distinction between these services and the types of services to which the amendment is directed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 Issue: Meaning of “minor presence” Clause 38 Submission (4 – ICANZ) It should be made clear that a minor presence of a non-resident in New Zealand that is linked to the supply under consideration is still not sufficient to render the non-resident no longer “outside New Zealand” for the purposes of section 11(2)(e) or 11(2)(fa). It would clarify the provision if “minor presence” was defined as “a presence in New Zealand insufficient for the overseas entity to be considered to be resident for the purposes of the GST Act”. Comment Proposed section 11(2B) will ensure that a presence in New Zealand of a non-resident that is unrelated to a supply of services, or that is minor, would not mean that a non-resident was no longer “outside New Zealand” for the purposes of the zero rating provisions in section 11(2)(e) or 11(2)(fa). (These provisions require that the non-resident who contracts for the services is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed.) There is currently significant uncertainty as to what constitutes “outside New Zealand” for the purposes of these provisions. The proposed amendment aims to reduce this uncertainty. Officials consider that new section 11(2B) clearly provides that a minor presence in New Zealand by a non-resident that is related to the supply under consideration (for example, a visit to New Zealand by an employee of a non-resident company to liaise with the New Zealand supplier) still allows the non-resident to be treated as being “outside New Zealand”. An example will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin item on the amendment to illustrate this point. However, officials do not consider that it is feasible to define precisely the meaning of “minor presence” because the meaning to be accorded to those words is dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In particular, officials do not agree with the suggested wording of the definition of “minor presence”. The suggested wording would equate a minor presence in New Zealand of a non-resident with anything falling short of the GST Act definition of a “resident”. The GST definition of a “resident” includes a person to the extent that the person carries on in New Zealand any activity while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. Therefore a non-resident is required to have a significant presence in New Zealand before that person is treated as being resident in New Zealand for GST purposes. Officials consider that it would be going too far to define a “minor presence” as anything falling short of a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand. This would amount to equating a “minor presence” with what is in fact a quite significant presence. This would result in an inappropriate widening of the zero rating provisions and a tax effectively based on residence rather than consumption in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 30 Issue: Replacing proposed section 11(2B) with section 11(2)(e) amendment Clause 38 Submission (8W – Stuart Hutchinson) Proposed section 11(2B), which attempts to clarify the meaning of “outside New Zealand” for the purposes of section 11(2)(e), should be replaced by an amendment to section 11(2)(e) which would provide that services are zero rated if supplied to non-resident individuals not present in New Zealand and companies and unincorporated bodies to the extent that they are not resident in New Zealand. Comment This submission is similar to that made by ICANZ. The imposition of GST on a particular supply requires a territorial connection with New Zealand (section 8 of the GST Act refers). This is because the aim of GST is to tax all consumption taking place in New Zealand. As a tax on consumption, GST is based on the presence in New Zealand of the recipient of a supply, not the residence of the recipient. For example, all goods and services consumed in New Zealand by non-resident tourists are generally subject to GST. Proposed section 11(2B) provides some guidance as to the level of territorial presence in New Zealand that a non- resident company or unincorporated body may have before that non-resident is treated as being no longer “outside New Zealand” for the purposes of section 11(2)(e) or 11(2)(fa). It would be contrary to the policy principles of GST to replace the territorial connection test with the resident test as proposed by the submitter. Officials also consider that it would result in an inappropriate widening of the zero rating provisions if anything supplied to a company or unincorporated body that is not resident in New Zealand was zero rated. This is because the GST definition of a “resident” includes a company to the extent that the company carries on in New Zealand any activity while having any fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. A person who is an unincorporated body of persons is treated as being resident in New Zealand only if that body has its centre of administrative management in New Zealand. Therefore a non-resident company or unincorporated body is required to have a significant presence in New Zealand before that person is treated as being resident in New Zealand for GST purposes. Officials consider that it would be inappropriate to zero rate any supply made to a company or unincorporated body which is not resident in New Zealand because it does not meet these significant thresholds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 31 Issue: Replacing “effectively connected with” test Clause 38 Submission (5WA – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) Proposed section 11(2B) should be modified by replacing the words “effectively connected with” with the words “directly in connection with”. Comment The submitter is in favour of replacing the words “effectively connected with” with the words “directly in connection with” because it would ensure consistency with existing “directly in connection with” terminology in the zero rating provisions. It would also have the benefit of allowing reference to the several New Zealand court cases which have considered the “directly in connection with” terminology. Officials consider that the current “effectively connected with” language better achieves the purpose of new section 11(2B) than “directly in connection with” language. The existing language ensures that a presence in New Zealand of a non-resident that is unrelated to a supply of services would not mean that the non-resident was no longer “outside New Zealand” for the purposes of section 11(2)(e) or 11(2)(fa). The “effectively connected with” language better allows the substance of a connection to be taken into account than the word “directly”. The “directly in connection with” terminology in the zero rating provisions is also used in a different context; in particular, it is not used in the context of “presence” which is the subject matter of new section 11(2B). There is also a risk that “directly in connection with” language could be circumvented by a step or transaction being interposed between the non-resident and the relevant supply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Time of supply for vouchers should be standardised Clause 37 Submission (Submission 4 - ICANZ) The plethora of rules concerning the treatment of vouchers with a face value and those without a face value is causing confusion. These rules should be standardised to remove this uncertainty. This value of the supply arising from a voucher should be the time it is redeemed. 32 Comment The issues raised by the ICANZ are considerably wider than legislation before the Committee and anticipate work currently being undertaken as a result of the post-implementation review of GST. Clause 37 is an interim measure to ensure the legislation in clause 38 operates as intended while work continues on rationalising the current rules concerning vouchers, which at times require recognition for GST purposes on acquisition, and at other times on redemption. Clause 37 would make vouchers relating to services covered by new section 11(2A) subject to GST at the time of acquisition. The clause has been inserted in response to submissions on the exported services proposal contained in the GST discussion document. The submissions sought clarification of the timing rules when vouchers are used. This clarification is necessary because vouchers involve two supplies. The first supply is when the voucher is issued, and the second is when the voucher is redeemed for goods or services. The supply that is subject to GST is determined by whether or not a voucher has a face value. • Vouchers with a face value are subject to GST at the time of redemption since section 10(16) disregards the issue of the vouchers (unless the consideration paid for that voucher exceeds its face value). • Vouchers without a face value are subject to GST on issue. Section 10(17) deems the supply of goods and services resulting from redemption to have a nil value. The current voucher rules could give rise to difficulties in the application of the legislation in clause 38, which is intended to apply at the time the agreement to supply the services is entered into. Clause 38 would fail to apply if a travel voucher had a face value. This is because the issue of this type of voucher to a non-resident under section 10(16) is, in effect, deemed not to occur. The Committee should note that the current voucher rules contemplated only domestic voucher transactions, hence the question of “does consumption occur in New Zealand?” never arose. Clause 37 provides guidance in respect of vouchers that are used internationally. Aside from clause 38 failing to apply under a redemption test, officials have additional concerns with using redemption to determine the tax treatment of a voucher. If a voucher is taxed at redemption the issuer of the voucher may face additional compliance costs when the voucher is redeemed. This is because a voucher that leaves New Zealand will have its value altered by foreign exchange movements and by any fees or margins charged by offshore agencies. This may mean that the voucher will be more valuable when it is redeemed in New Zealand that it was when it was issued. If this higher value were taxed the supplier would have to return more GST than was anticipated. Therefore the purpose behind clause 37 is to reduce compliance costs as far as practicable, as well as ensuring the correct application of clause 38. 33 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: No conceptual basis for voucher policy proposal Clause 37 Submission (Submission 4 - ICANZ) From a policy perspective there appears to be no conceptual basis for a distinction between a voucher for goods and voucher for services. In some respects a voucher will in itself be “goods”. Comment As noted above, the issues raised by the ICANZ have a wider scope than the legislation before the Committee. The submission is similar to an earlier submission by the Institute on the GST discussion document and anticipates work currently being considered by officials as part of the post-implementation review of GST. Recommendation None. 34 O O T T H H E E R R P P O O L L I I C C Y Y I I S S S S U U E E S S N N O O T T I I N N B B I I L L L L 35 THIN CAPITALISATION – INCLUSION OF LEASES IN ASSET BASE Issue: Rules for measuring New Zealand assets Submission (2 – KPMG) An amendment should be made, with retrospective effect to the commencement of the thin capitalisation rules, to include finance and specified leases within the definition of total assets when measuring the debt percentage of a New Zealand group. Comment The submission does not relate to any matter contained in the bill. Further, as outlined below, the appropriate solution is not clear-cut. It is recommended, therefore, that the issue not be addressed in this bill. Officials will, however, analyse and consult with the submission-maker further, with a view to developing an appropriate solution. The thin capitalisation rules can deny companies a deduction for interest expense if their New Zealand assets are funded excessively by debt. The amount of debt is measured based on tax principles, but assets are measured instead using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The latter aim to reduce compliance costs by allowing taxpayers to use information in existing financial statements, but the trade-off is a less accurate measurement of debt to asset levels. Finance leases are an alternative to debt for financing the acquisition of an asset. Many finance leases have, therefore, been brought within the ambit of the thin capitalisation rules, as if they were tax debt. However, as the submission points out, the use of GAAP as the basis for measuring assets will not always result in the corresponding asset being included in the group debt percentage calculation. Officials confirm that this was not an intended policy effect, but is an unforeseen consequence of the trade-off inherent in using GAAP. Officials agree, however, that leases deserve further attention. Unlike normal issues arising from using GAAP, which relate to straight asset valuations, the issue here is that assets and debt matched in a company's balance sheet are not similarly matched in its thin capitalisation calculations. Officials note, however, that the solution will not be as clear-cut as the submission suggests. For one, the leases in question do not actually fall out of the thin capitalisation calculations. Rather, if GAAP does not treat the asset as “owned” by the lessee, it will still be included in the assets of the lessor. Retrospective application is also unclear. Before the recent amendment of the accrual rules, some lessees would have benefited from having leased assets treated as assets while not having the lease treated as debt. Consequently, correcting the treatment of leases retrospectively could disadvantage some taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but will be considered further by officials. 36 DEPRECIABLE INTANGIBLE PROPERTY - CASINO PREMISES LICENCES Issue: Including casino premises licences in the Income Tax Act's schedule of depreciable intangible property Submission (9W - Mr Declan Mordaunt, PricewaterhouseCoopers) A casino premises licence granted under the Casino Control Act 1990 meets the definition of depreciable intangible property and is intangible property of a type listed in Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994.Therefore it is appropriate for such licences to be included in Schedule 17. Licences should be included with effect from the date the Casino Control Act 1990 was enacted (1 August 1990). Comment The submission does not relate to any amendment proposed in the bill. It may be appropriate for casino premises licences to be included in the Income Tax Act's schedule of depreciable intangible property, but further work is required to confirm this. In the meantime, officials note that neither Schedule 17 nor its predecessor was in existence in August 1990. Recommendation That the submission be declined pending further work. 37 R R E E M M E E D D I I A A L L I I S S S S U U E E S S 38 TRADING STOCK Issue: Restricting the rule on transfer of EFAs to transfers between residents Clause 4 Submission (4 - ICANZ) The restriction is appropriate, but the application date should be the date of introduction of the trading stock rules rather than 20 May 1999. Comment Officials consider that 20 May 1999 is a more suitable application date because an earlier date might in this case penalise some taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Appropriateness of association test in definition of “small taxpayer” Clause 26(5) Submission (4 - ICANZ) Narrowing the associated persons test for small taxpayers is appropriate, but is there a need for an associated person test at all? A targeted anti-avoidance rule would fulfil the same purpose with a lower compliance cost. Comment Officials agree that the proposed associated person rule is arbitrary in nature and that it might be possible to devise a targeted anti-avoidance rule which expressed the policy underlying the rule more effectively. However, further work would be required to develop such a rule. In the meantime, the proposed rule is effective in significantly limiting the definition of “association”. Recommendation That the submission be declined pending further work. 39 TRANSFER PRICING Issue: Application of transfer pricing rules to interest-free loans Clause 9 Submission (4 – ICANZ) Section GD 13(5) should explicitly state that the transfer pricing rules do not apply to interest-free loans made to taxable New Zealand residents, otherwise the interface with other rules that exempt income could trigger the application of the transfer pricing rules. Comment Section GD 13(4) allows the transfer pricing rules to apply to transactions when a non- resident makes a supply to New Zealand for inadequate consideration. Commonly, this would result in additional non-resident withholding tax being imposed. In many cases, however, the additional tax revenue would be more than offset by the tax benefit to the New Zealand recipient when it took a deduction on the increased transfer price. If the overall effect of applying the transfer pricing rules would be a loss of revenue, section GD 13(5) prevents the transfer pricing rules applying. When interest expense on debt is non-deductible, there would be a revenue gain from applying the transfer pricing rules to an interest-free loan. The policy intent was that the transfer pricing rules would apply in such situations – this includes the situations outlined in the submission. The amendment sought by the submission is, therefore, inconsistent with the policy intent of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 40 TAX SIMPLIFICATION Issue: Tax code specified by Inland Revenue Submission (ICANZ) The proposed amendment to section NC 12A of the Income Tax Act 1994 should be clarified to specify at what point an employer is required to change an employee's tax code. Comment The proposed amendment ensures that an employer must apply a tax code specified by the Commissioner to an employee’s wages or salary until the employee’s circumstances change. As indicated in the submission, an employer will be aware of a change in an employee’s circumstances only if the employer receives notification, either by the employee or Inland Revenue. Officials support this submission and recommend that the amendment be clarified to incorporate this point. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Incorrect tax code references Submission (Matter raised by officials) References to old tax codes should be corrected. Comment Tax codes were changed as part of recent tax simplification initiatives. Officials have subsequently identified that various consequential amendments are required to the Income Tax Act 1994 to correct incorrect tax code references. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 Issue: Housekeeper and donations rebate Submission (Matter raised by officials) • Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) should be amended to allow eligibility for housekeeper and donation rebates to be calculated using the income a taxpayer receives in the year in which the payment or donation was made. • Section 41A of the TAA should be amended so that housekeeper and donation rebates continue to be claimable only after the end of the income year in which they were made. • Section 41A of the TAA should be amended to state that the period within which taxpayers with early balance dates can claim these rebates is from 1 April following their balance date. • The housekeeper and donation rebates should be removed from the definition of “allowable rebates” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act for the purposes of section BC 8. Comment Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that income from the previous year is to be used when establishing eligibility for housekeeper and donation rebates. However, since this legislation was enacted Inland Revenue has developed systems that in many cases will allow a taxpayer’s current year income to be used. Officials propose, therefore, that current year income be used to determine eligibility, when appropriate. The current practice, and the policy that the Government consulted on in the discussion document Simplifying taxpayer requirements, is that housekeeper and donation rebates can be claimed only after the end of the income year. Officials have identified that the legislation unintentionally enables taxpayers to claim these rebates during an income year in which they make a payment or donation. Officials propose that this legislation be amended so that these rebates can be claimed only from the end of the income year. For taxpayers with early balance dates, officials note that it is not, at present, administratively feasible to implement the housekeeper and donation rebate process before 1 April 2000. Therefore officials consider that a further amendment is required to ensure that the period within which these taxpayers can claim these rebates begins from 1 April 2000 following their balance date. Officials note that this will affect fewer than 200 taxpayers. Section BC 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 describes the process of calculating a taxpayer’s income tax liability and states that allowable rebates must be subtracted from a taxpayer’s unadjusted income tax liability to determine the adjusted tax liability. The new rebate claim process, however, involves separating these rebates from the calculation of a taxpayer’s tax liability. To ensure that the legislation is consistent with the new process, officials recommend that the definition of allowable rebates be amended to remove references to the housekeeper and donation rebates. 42 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Issuing income statements Submission (Matter raised by officials) • Amendments should be made to section 33A of the TAA to clarify further the rules on who should be required to file tax returns, who is required to receive income statements, and who is not required to have contact with Inland Revenue. • The words “or received” should be removed from section 80B (1) of the TAA to remove ambiguity. Comment As part of the simplification initiatives, taxpayers with relatively simple tax affairs are not required to square up their tax affairs. To prevent taxpayers from undergoing tax square-ups for minor amounts, a $200 threshold was introduced whereby taxpayers are not required to receive income statements if they receive less than $200 of income that has been taxed incorrectly. An amendment should be made to ensure that the $200 income threshold applies to taxpayers to whom the PAYE rules have been incorrectly applied, for example, because of the use of an incorrect tax code. To prevent unnecessary contact between taxpayers and Inland Revenue, taxpayers who receive significant amounts of income about which the Commissioner has no knowledge should declare this income on a return of income rather than receive an income statement. This should include taxpayers who receive interest or dividend income from outside New Zealand, where that income has had no withholding tax deducted, should file returns of income. Similarly, taxpayers who receive over $200 interest or dividend income from outside New Zealand, where that income has had withholding tax deducted, should be required to file a return of income. An amendment is required so that taxpayers who request a square-up of their tax affairs part- way through an income year must file a return of income rather than request an income statement. This is because the Commissioner may not possess all the relevant information at the time the taxpayer wishes to have his or her tax affairs squared up. An amendment is required to state expressly that a taxpayer is not required to request an income statement if an incorrect deduction of resident withholding tax occurs solely because of an error on the part of the interest payer. This is because taxpayers may be unaware of incorrect tax deductions from interest income, so a requirement to request an income statement is unreasonable. 43 A consequential amendment is required to replace the term “absentee” with the term “non- resident” following a similar amendment to section KC 1(2) of the Income tax Act 1994 in the Taxation (Accrual Rules and other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. Taxpayers who receive income statements only because of an error (for example because another taxpayer mistakenly uses an incorrect IRD number) should not automatically be issued another corrected income statement unless they specifically request one. This ensures that taxpayers, who in the absence of errors would not otherwise be issued with income statements, are not forced to undergo a square-up of their tax affairs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Family assistance Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amendments should be made to part KD of the Income Tax Act 1994 to reflect that the new income statement process will incorporate the family assistance square-up. Amendments are also required to allow for the new one-off registration process. Comment The existing family assistance legislation refers to filing returns of income. However, with the introduction of the income statement process the legislation requires amending to reflect the inclusion of family assistance square-ups. Amendments are also required to ensure that the legislation is consistent with the new policy of a one-off family assistance registration which replaces the old system that required family assistance claimants to re-register every income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Particulars to be included on income statements Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 80E of the TAA should be amended to clarify the particulars that the Commissioner is required to include on an income statement. 44 Comment An amendment is required to expressly allow Inland Revenue to include on an income statement only those details that it holds at the time an income statement is issued. This amendment is necessary because it is not possible for the department to determine whether it holds all the information required for an income statement at any point in time before a taxpayer is contacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Compulsory direct crediting of tax refunds Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to ensure that Inland Revenue is not required to direct credit all tax refunds for all tax types from 1 April 2000. Comment Section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that all tax refunds must be made by direct credit to a taxpayer’s bank account, unless doing so would result in undue hardship for a taxpayer. This provision takes effect from 1 April 2000 and applies to all tax types, including GST and FBT. Inland Revenue is not currently in a position to implement compulsory direct crediting of refunds for all tax types by 1 April 2000. It does, however, consider that a phased implementation for different tax types would provide benefits both to taxpayers and to Inland Revenue. Phased implementation of compulsory direct crediting would give taxpayers more time to provide Inland Revenue with up-to-date bank account details. It would also further allow the department to consult with taxpayers and develop practices that suit taxpayers’ needs. This would allow taxpayers with complex business activities further time to make any necessary arrangements to deal with direct-credited refunds of different tax types. The phased implementation approach would also provide the department with more time to educate taxpayers about direct crediting. ICANZ has been consulted and agrees with the proposed amendment. ICANZ is concerned that the existing timeframe for implementing compulsory direct crediting does not provide adequate time to ensure that Inland Revenue will be able to operate this system with sufficient accuracy. 45 The proposed amendment would allow the current practice of paying many refunds by cheque to continue and, therefore, would not increase compliance costs. Compliance cost reductions that would result from direct-crediting refunds to taxpayers who currently receive cheques, however, would not be realised until compulsory direct crediting is fully implemented. Officials consider that the proposed amendment should apply from the date that the Taxation (Annual Rates and other Remedial Matters) Bill receives Royal Assent. To allow Inland Revenue the necessary flexibility to determine the dates when direct crediting of refunds can be implemented, section 184A should come into force by Order in Council to allow for different application dates for each tax types. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 46 USE OF MONEY INTEREST ON FOREIGN INVESTOR TAX CREDITS Issue: Use of money interest on credit applied to earlier income year Clause 34 Submission (4 – ICANZ) • When a foreign investor tax credit is applied to an earlier income year, use of money interest should still be credited from the date an election is made to carry back the credit until it is refunded. • A cross-reference error in section OB 1 should be corrected. Comment The amendment ensures that when taxpayers carry back and apply a foreign investor tax credit against an earlier income year, that credit does not give rise to use of money interest. This reflects that the carry-back rule is merely a mechanism for allowing a refund to be issued, and does not reflect that the Commissioner has had the use of any money in that earlier year. The submission does not dispute the rationale for the amendment. It suggests, however, that the Commissioner should credit interest from the date on which the Commissioner is able, under the law, to issue a refund until it is actually issued. Officials do not consider that such an amendment would be appropriate. The carry-back rule is a concessionary rule, so that taxpayers do not face a cash flow disadvantage when funding a supplementary dividend. In the absence of such concessionary treatment, taxpayers would instead merely be allowed to carry an unutilised credit forward, having no access to the cash benefit of the tax credit nor receiving use of money interest in the interim. Officials recommend, therefore, that this point in the submission be declined. Officials agree with the submission that a cross-reference error in section OB 1 be corrected. Recommendation That the cross-reference error be corrected, but that the submission otherwise be declined. 47 O O T T H H E E R R R R E E M M E E D D I I A A L L I I S S S S U U E E S S N N O O T T I I N N B B I I L L L L 48 TAXATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS General Comment The rules that govern the taxation of financial arrangements were recently reformed by the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. The amendments proposed here merely fine-tune the earlier changes. Issue: Non-residents becoming resident Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified how subpart EH applies to a person who is non-resident and becomes resident after 20 May 1999. Comment Under section EH 19, Division 2 applies to financial arrangements that a person enters into on or after 20 May 1999 (the date of enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999). Under Division 1, if a person who was non-resident becomes a resident of New Zealand the person is treated as acquiring the financial arrangement on the date the person become resident for an arm’s length value on that date (section EH 16(2)(b)). A provision similar to section EH 16(2)(b) was omitted in error from Division 2. A section should be inserted in Division 2 providing that if a non-resident becomes resident after 20 May 1999 and the person is a party to financial arrangements the person is treated as having acquired those financial arrangements at the time the person becomes resident for arm’s length consideration. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section EH 18 Submission (Matter raised with officials by ICANZ) The relationship between Part EH Division 1 and the other provisions of the Act needs to be clarified. 49 Comment Section EH 18 applies to financial arrangements to which Division 1 applies (those entered into before 20 May 1999 for which no transitional adjustment has been made). Section EH 18 is intended to apply to a person who is holder or issuer of a financial arrangement to which Division 1 applies if other provisions of the Act would have applied to that financial arrangement, and those provisions had not been amended by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. In that case the provisions should apply as they were before the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. As section EH 18 is currently drafted, this is unclear. The section should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section EH 26(3) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EH 26(3) should be amended so that the value of the property transferred is determined by applying section EH 48(3) in alphabetical order until a paragraph applies. Comment Section EH 26(3) determines the value for which property is treated as being transferred under other provisions of the Act by referring to the paragraphs of section EH 48(3). The paragraphs are applied in alphabetical order. It should be made clear that the paragraphs should be applied in alphabetical order until a paragraph applies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section EH 31 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Under section EH 31 a cash basis person can elect to apply a spreading method. There is no provision for the revocation of this election and there should be. 50 Comment Under section EH 31 a cash basis person may elect to use a spreading method to calculate income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangements to which they are a party. The election must be made for all financial arrangements the person is a party to at the time of the election and any financial arrangements entered into in subsequent years. The person must continue to use the spreading method for those financial arrangements until the financial arrangements mature. There should be a provision allowing taxpayers to revoke the election and for the revocation to apply by giving notice to the Commissioner. Once notice had been given the revocation would apply to financial arrangements entered into in the year following the income year in which the notice is given. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section EH 48(2) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EH 48(2) should be clarified. Comment Section EH 48(2) states: For an original party to an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services or a specified option, not being an agreement or an option that has lapsed or does not proceed, a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement, the consideration for the property or services is determined by applying subsection (3)(a) to (d) in alphabetical order until a paragraph applies. The section can be read in two ways. The first is “For an original party to any agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services or a specified option, not being ... a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement ...”. The second way is “For an original party to any agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services or a specified option, ... a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement ...”. The second interpretation is correct, and the section should be clarified to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) 51 It should be clarified that if the consideration for a financial arrangement includes property or services regardless of whether the consideration is paid to the person or paid by the person, the value of the property or services is determined under section EH 48(2) and (3). Comment Consideration is defined in section EH 48. If consideration includes property or services the value of the property or services is determined under sections EH 48(2) and (3). It is unclear whether the definition of consideration applies to the consideration paid to the person or the consideration paid by the person, or to both. It should be made clear that if the consideration includes property or services the regardless of whether the consideration is paid to the person or paid by the person, the value of the property or services is determined under section EH 48(2) and (3). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section EH 48(3)(a) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EH 48(3)(a) should be amended so that the amount determined under the “lowest price” paragraph is the amount the parties would have agreed if payment had been required in full at the time the first right in the property was transferred or the services provided. Comment “Consideration” is defined in section EH 48. As currently drafted, paragraph (a) refers to the lowest price “the parties would have agreed, on the date the agreement was entered into or the specified option was granted, if payment was required in full at the time the first right in the contracted property was transferred or the services provided”. This paragraph would never apply as payment “was not required in full at the time the first right” was transferred. The section should be amended to refer to the lowest price that would have been paid if payment had been made in full at that time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 52 Issue: Section EO 2A Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EO 2A should set out how a deduction under an operating lease is spread rather than the grounds for allowing a deduction. Comment Section EO 2A provides that a lessee “is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in making lease payments under an operating lease”. Section EO 2A should set out how the deduction is calculated rather than providing the grounds for the deduction. The deduction should be subject to the normal deductibility tests. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section FC 8A Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section FC 8A should be clarified so that it is clear how the rules recharacterise a lease into financing transaction. Comment Under section FC 8A a lease is treated as a sale of the lease asset from the lessor to the lessee at the beginning of the lease. The lessor is also treated as advancing a loan to the lessee which the lessee uses to purchase the lease asset. As the legislation is currently drafted, the loan from the lessor is for the lessor’s disposition value, and the lessee uses the loan to purchase the lease asset for the lessee’s acquisition cost. The lessee’s acquisition costs include installation fees incurred by the lessee, so the loan may only partially fund the acquisition of the lease asset. The section should be amended so that the leasing of an asset is treated as a sale of the asset from the lessor to the lessee, the lessor is also treated as giving the lessee a loan, and the lessee is treated as using the loan to purchase the lease asset. The value of the loan for the lessor is the lessor’s disposition value and for the lessee the lessee’s acquisition cost. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 53 Issue: Section FC 8C Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section FC 8C(2) is not necessary because the amount the section treats as income is already income under the accrual rules. Comment Section FC 8C deals with early terminations of leases. If a lease terminates early, and the lease asset is returned to the lessor, the lease asset is treated as being sold to the lessor “for the amount by which the outstanding balance of the loan on the date of termination is more than the amount the lessee paid to be released from his or her obligations under the lease”. Under section FC 8C(2) if the amount paid by the lessee to be released from the loan exceeds the outstanding balance, the excess is gross income of the lessor. This section is not necessary as the income would arise under the accrual rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Sections FC 8F and FC 10(6A) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The words “for the purpose of this Act” at the beginning of sections FC 8F and FC 10(6A) are redundant. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section FC 8H Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that an adjustment under section FC 8I is required only if an operating lease becomes a finance lease as a result of the lease term becoming longer than 75 percent of the estimated useful life of the lease asset. 54 Comment Section FC 8H provides that a lessor and a lessee must make an adjustment under section FC 8I if (a) their lease is a consecutive or successive lease and is deemed to be one lease under the definition of ‘lease’; and (b) they did not contemplate, at the start of the lease term, that the lease would be for more than 75 percent of the lease asset’s estimated useful life. It is not clear that the adjustment should only be made if, as a result of the extension of the lease, the total lease term becomes a period longer than 75 percent of the lease asset’s estimated useful life. This should be made clear in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “lease term” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “lease term” in section OB 1 refers to paragraph (d) of the definition of “lease”. The reference should be to paragraph (f). Comment The reference is incorrect and should be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 55 TAX EXEMPTION OF PORTABLE NEW ZEALAND SUPERANNUATION AND VETERAN’S PENSION Submission (Matter raised by officials) • The definitions of “portable New Zealand superannuation” and “portable veteran’s pension” in section OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 should be amended to include payments made under section 17B of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990. These amendments should be backdated to 30 June 1993. • These definitions in section OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 should also be amended to include payments made under the new section 17BA inserted by the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions – Special Portability Arrangement) Amendment Act, which comes into force on 1 October 1999. Comment Section 17B of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 provides for the payment of New Zealand superannuation and veteran’s pension to entitled persons who are resident in the Cook Islands, Niue, or Tokelau. This provision came into force on 30 June 1993. The Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions – Special Portability Arrangement) Amendment Act, enacted in July 1999, repeals the current section 17B and introduces a new section 17BA. This extends the special portability arrangement to a number of Pacific Island nations. This legislation comes into force on 1 October 1999. The tax treatment of the payments under the special portability arrangement has always been that they are exempt from tax in New Zealand. However, the Income Tax Act 1994 does not contain a provision exempting payments of New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension under the existing special portability arrangement to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau. The Income Tax Act exempts “any portable New Zealand superannuation or portable veteran’s pension” from tax. However, the definitions of these terms in section OB 1 restricts them to payments made under sections 17 or 19 of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act. There appears to have been an oversight when section 17B was enacted, in 1993, so that the definitions were not amended to include section 17B. Officials recommend that the definitions of “portable New Zealand superannuation” and “portable veteran’s pension” in section OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976 be amended to include payments made under section 17B of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990, since 30 June 1993. These definitions in section OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 should also be amended to include payments to be made under the new section 17BA. 56 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 57 USE OF MONEY INTEREST AND SHORT OR LATE PAID PROVISIONAL TAX Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the use of money interest provisions that relate to short- paid or late-paid provisional tax, to correct an error that gives an unintended result. Comment Section 120K(4B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was inserted during the select committee stage of the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Bill 1997 in response to a late concern from a taxpayer that use of money interest could be imposed on “safe-harboured” taxpayers to the extent that they have paid less tax than required by the provisional tax formula at a due date. The intention of section 120K(4B) was to prevent use of money interest being imposed on late-paid or short-paid provisional tax paid by a safe-harboured taxpayer. However, what the provision actually does is prevent interest being imposed on late-paid or short-paid provisional tax paid by all taxpayers, whether safe-harboured or not. Use of money interest begins at the terminal tax date. This result was clearly not intended. Officials consider that this section should be amended to ensure that it is consistent with the original policy intent. At a practical level the Commissioner has been both paying and charging interest in accordance with the policy intent and this position needs to be confirmed. Officials propose that the amendment apply from the 1997-1998 income year. We also propose a saving provision to protect taxpayers who have relied on the literal interpretation of this section, provided that such taxpayers have informed the Commissioner in writing or in a tax return by the report-back date to the select committee for the Taxation (Annual Rates and Remedial Matters) Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 58 EFFECTIVE DATES FOR USE OF MONEY INTEREST RULES Submission (Matter raised by officials) • Sections 128(6) and 138I(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to provide that if the competent objection or challenge relates to the 1996-97 income year, interest must be calculated on deferrable or non-deferrable tax from the later of the day on which the notice of assessment was issued or the day after the due date. • The application date for sections 106 and 109 of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act, which inserted sections 128(5) and (6) and 138I(4) and (5), should be amended to 1 April 1997, rather than the date that Act received Royal assent (20 May 1999). Comment The proposed amendments are aimed at correcting a drafting error in the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. The compliance and penalties legislation of 1996 introduced new use of money interest rules, with application to tax liabilities and rights that arose in respect of the 1997-98 and subsequent income years. When a taxpayer enters a dispute with the department, he or she is required to pay 50 percent of the amount of tax assessed by Inland Revenue as payable, on the due date. This is known as the non-deferrable tax. The remaining 50 percent of tax in dispute is not due until the 30 th day after the day of determination of final liability, and is known as deferrable tax. Sections 128(5) and 138I(4) of the Tax Administration Act, inserted by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999, provide that the new use of money interest rules apply from 1 April 1997 to calculate the interest payable on deferrable and non- deferrable tax. This is irrespective of whether the dispute relates to an income year before the 1997-98 income year. However, the interest provisions were amended to ensure that taxpayers were not disadvantaged as a result of these amendments applying from 1 April 1997, by allowing the old rules to apply in certain circumstances for the 1996/97 income year and earlier income years. Sections 128(6) and 138I(5) ensure that if a dispute relates to the 1995/96 or an earlier income year, the old rule as to when interest begins will apply. Thus interest will not begin until after the date that the period of deferral starts, which is the later of; (a) the date on which the notice of assessment was issued; and (b) the day after the due date. Under the new rules, interest begins on the day after the due date for the payment of tax. The effect of sections 128(6) and 138I(5) is that for disputes relating to the 1996/97 income year, interest begins on the day after the due date, which is usually 7/2/98 for the 1996/97 return. This was never the intention. For all income years before the 1997-98 income year it was intended that although the new rules should apply, interest should not begin until the date under the old rules. Consequently, it is proposed that sections 128(6) and 138I(5) be amended to replace 1995/96 or an earlier income year with 1996/97 or an earlier income year. 59 Sections 128(5) and 138I(4) of the Tax Administration Act provide that the new use of money interest rules apply from 1 April 1997 to calculate the interest payable on deferrable and non-deferrable tax. However, because sections 106 and 109 of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act, which inserted these sections, do not come into effect until the date that Act received Royal assent (20 May 1999), this intention is not given effect. Recommendations • That an amendment be made to sections 128(6) and 138I(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide that if the competent objection relates to the 1996-97 income year, interest must be calculated from the later of the date on which the notice of assessment was issued, or the day after the due date. • That the application date for sections 106 and 109 of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act be amended to 1 April 1997. 60 GST AND BENEFITS UNDER ACCIDENT INSURANCE POLICIES Issue: GST treatment of accident insurance policies Clause 36A Submission (Matter raised by officials) The supply of an accident insurance policy under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 should be treated as the supply of general insurance services only for GST purposes with effect from 1 April 1999 rather than 1 July 1999 as first proposed to the Committee. Comment Under the accident compensation reforms employers must provide accident insurance for their employees under contracts which, for GST purposes, comprise both a general insurance (taxable) and a minimal life insurance (exempt) component. This means that insurers and employers would have to make apportionments for GST purposes, imposing high compliance costs upon both insurers and employers to ensure a technically correct GST treatment. Inland Revenue would incur higher administrative costs to monitor the compliance of insurers and employers with the requirement. After consultation it is proposed that the provision of all benefits under accident insurance policies be treated as being in respect of supplies of general insurance for GST purposes and, therefore, taxable by excluding the provision of the minimal life benefits from the definition of a life insurance contract in section 3(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Insurers have advised that the amendment should apply from 1 April 1999, not 1 July 1999 as first proposed, because 1 April is the earliest possible date that insurers could offer accident insurance policies to employers under the Accident Insurance Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 61 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Income Tax Act 1994 Submission (10W - PriceWaterhouseCoopers) Section DJ 1(b)(v) should be amended. The words “commencing on or after 1 st day of April 1993 and” should be inserted into section DJ 1(b)(v) after the words “in any income year”. Comment The submission does not relate to any amendment proposed in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined pending further work. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Submission (Matter raised by officials) Sections KD 4(3), KD 5AB and KD 5AC should be repealed. Comment Section KD 4(3) relates to the time when employers paid family support to employees and were reimbursed by Inland Revenue. Because employers no longer pay family support, the provision should be repealed. Sections KD 5AB and KD 5AC are transitional provisions for interim instalments of the family credit that were required as a result of changes in the rates of family assistance. Section KD 5AB relates to the period 1 July 1997 to 31 December 1997, and section KD 5AC relates to the period 1 January 1998 to 30 June 1998. As these sections are now spent, they should be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section KD 4(2)(b) should be amended to remove redundant words. 62 Comment Family assistance may be paid in interim instalments or claimed at the end of the income year as a credit of tax in a taxpayer’s return of income. Section KD 4(2)(b) refers to the Commissioner establishing that a taxpayer received an interim instalment of family assistance during the income year “otherwise than by way of any such crediting in payment of provisional tax”. These words are redundant and should be removed as the Commissioner no longer offsets the credits of tax against provisional tax payments due. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Transposed section references in section NG 4 should be corrected. Comment The references to section NG 3(1)(b) and section NG 3(1)(c) in section NG 4 are transposed and the error should be corrected, with effect from the 1997/98 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) References in the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 1976 to “state-owned enterprise” should be changed to “state enterprise”. Comment Various provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 refer to a “state-owned enterprise”. They should be amended to refer to the correct terminology, “state enterprise”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 63 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “airport operator” definition should be updated in the light of the Civil Aviation Act 1990. Comment The definition of “airport operator” refers to the Minister of Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services. The Civil Aviation Act 1990 provides that any reference to the Minister of Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services is to be read as a reference to the Minister of Transport. Since the Income Tax Act 1994 was enacted after the Civil Aviation Act 1990, officials consider that the “airport operator” definition should correctly refer to the Minister of Transport. These amendment should apply from 1 April 1995, the date the Income Tax Act 1994 came into force. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) A section reference in the definition of “consideration” should be clarified. Comment Paragraph (c) of the definition of “consideration” refers to section FE 6(b)(i), whereas it should refer to section FE 6(6)(b)(i) and be amended accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) An incorrect cross reference in the definition of “member” in section OB 1 should be corrected. 64 Comment The definition of “member” in section OB 1 incorrectly refers to section LC 1(5). The correct reference should be section LC 1(6). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) One of the two paragraphs numbered (d) in the “property” definition should be renumbered as paragraph (e). Comment Section 55 of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 amended section OB 1 by adding a new paragraph (d) into the definition of “property”. However, this amendment ignored an earlier amendment by the Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 that had already inserted a paragraph (d) in that definition. Because it is not intended to repeal the existing paragraph (d), the newly added paragraph (d) should be renumbered as paragraph (e). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) An incorrect cross reference in the definition of “residual income tax” in section OB 1 should be corrected. Comment The definition of “member” in section OB 1 incorrectly refers to section LE 2(6)(b). The correct reference should be section LE 2(4)(b), with effect from 12 December 1995. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 65 Submission (Matter raised by officials) One of the two subparagraphs numbered (xi) in the definition of “tax” should be renumbered as subparagraph (xii). Comment Section 62 of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 amended section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 by introducing a new subparagraph (xi) into the definition of “tax”. However, this amendment ignored an earlier amendment by the Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 that had already inserted a subparagraph (xi) in that definition. Because it is not intended to repeal the existing subparagraph (xi), the newly added subparagraph (xi) should be renumbered as subparagraph (xii). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proviso to section OD 8(3) should be corrected. Comment Section 59 (1)(c) of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 sought to insert sections DM 1A, EH 7, EH 53, EL 7(3)(b) and EO 4A in the proviso to section OD 8(3). These sections were not inserted correctly, and an amendment to add them to the proviso should be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) An incorrect cross-reference in section 120K(4A)(c) should be corrected. 66 Comment In section 120K(4A)(c), the reference to section MB 5(11) is incorrect as that section does not exist. The correct reference should be MB 5A. The correction should be made with effect from the date of enactment of this legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
Taxation (Annual Rates and Remedial Matters) Bill Officials’ Supplementary Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill 3 August 1999 CONTENTS Film amendments1 Crown entities and the associated person test14 1 FILM AMENDMENTS General comment On 7 July 1999 the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue announced a proposed amendment to close down, with effect from that date, certain tax planning arrangements involving films. The Minister asked the Finance and Expenditure Committee to include the amendment in the Taxation (Annual Rates and Remedial Matters) Bill, which had already been referred to the select committee for its consideration. The Minister also requested the committee to ensure that taxpayers had the opportunity to make submissions on the proposed change. The amendment proposes to include in the definition of “film expenditure” expenditure related to the film but not currently included in the definition. They also treat loss attributing qualifying companies and their shareholders as associated persons. Issue: Ambit of the amendments Submission 13 and 13B (Rudd Watts & Stone, and Simpson Grierson) The proposed amendments affect both commercially successful and unsuccessful film projects as the legislation makes no distinction between tax driven film projects and legitimate film projects. Moreover, the proposed amendments would mean that film investors and film companies will be treated prejudicially relative to investors and companies in all other industries. The features of tax driven schemes that should be stopped are where expenditure on a film is artificially inflated and income expectations are unreasonable. The submission proposes that the amendment apply only to such schemes while preserving the possibility of “downside protection” for other film ventures. The submitters have provided the Committee with alternative draft legislation which amends section EO 4A by inserting a number of additional criteria, any one of which will trigger the application of the section. These are: • that the total payments for film rights for which a deduction is sought exceed 120% of the cost of producing the film (the submitters have asked that this figure be revised to 125%); • that payments for which deductions are sought are exempt income in the hands of the recipient or the recipient is a person not resident in a “grey list” country (i.e. a country with similar tax rules to New Zealand); 2 • that there is not a reasonable expectation at the outset that the gross income to be earned by the investor as a result of the expenditure would be at least equal to the total expenditure; • the expenditure is not on a New Zealand film or a film in relation to which at least 50% of the expenditure is in New Zealand. Comment November bill amendments The “November bill”, now the Taxation (Accrual Rules and other Remedial Matters) Act 1999, stopped economic reimbursement tax schemes involving expenditure on films and petroleum mining schemes entered into by large corporate investors, primarily banks. The amendments claw back film deductions for expenditure within the tax definition of “film expenditure” where there is an arrangement that effectively reimburses the expenditure (usually by the exercise of a put option that a parent company has over shares in the deduction-taking subsidiary). The November bill structure is illustrated by the following diagram: FIGURE 1 (The numbers used in this example are close to those used in a real structure.) Subsidiary Bank Offshore film producer Step 1: $50m equity $50m film expenditure Step 2: Step 3: Bank sells subsidiary to offshore film producer for $70m 3 Thus: New Zealand company group position Economic/Accounting income Taxable income Deduction for film expenditure-50-50 Income from sale of subsidiary+70+70 Deduction for cost of subsidiary-50 Total+20-30 Therefore while the economic/accounting position is that the bank has a $20m gain (being a rate of return for the time value of money of 5.77% pa assuming a 6 year term for the arrangement), its taxable position is a $30m tax loss. These figures assume that the proceeds from the sale of the shares are taxable and a deduction is allowed for the cost of the shares. If the proceeds are not taxable then the tax loss is even greater at $50 million. A variant of the November bill structure is as follows: FIGURE 2 This structure involves returning $20m as film income rather than by way of profit on the sale of shares. Although this may make the arrangement appear more Bank Subsidiary Offshore film producer Step 3: Bank sells subsidiary to offshore film producer for $50m Step 1: $50m equity Step 2: $50m film expenditure $20m film income 4 commercial, the mismatch between economic and taxable income is the same as in the previous example. Section EO 4A would also apply in this case to claw back the full film expenditure deduction to recognise that there has been economic reimbursement. It is important to note that the film being produced may be “genuine” or “commercial”, and not “tax driven” in the sense of there being an artificial inflation of costs. What the November bill structures allow is for a New Zealand financial institution to finance a film over which it has no substantive equity interest, with a financial return heavily subsidised by our tax base. Presumably this lowers the financing costs of the offshore film producer. May bill amendments The May bill’s proposed amendments include in the definition of “film expenditure” expenditure on rights that are related to the film but are not currently included in the definition. They also treat loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) and their shareholders as associated persons. The amendments as proposed by the Government thus have two objectives: 1. To stop Kids World type structures involving investment in films by high income individuals through LAQCs. (This type of structure is illustrated in the annexed example.) 2.To ensure that large corporate investors cannot circumvent the November bill changes by incurring film-related expenditure that is not covered by the tax legislation specifically relating to films. The amendments proposed by submitters would remove aspects of the economic reimbursement rules legislated in the November bill and those proposed in the May bill. The submitters' proposals, if accepted, would continue to expose the tax base to risk from film transactions. Application of the suggested 125% threshold to the Kids World structure The alternative amendments proposed by the submitters would seem to address the Government’s first objective of stopping Kids World type structures. This is because those structures involve an artificial inflation of costs and would, therefore, fail to meet the submitters’ suggested requirement that the expenditure on film rights must not exceed 125% of the cost of producing the film. Applying the reasonable prospect of profit test to the November bill structures The submitters are concerned that it is necessary to provide a capital guarantee (or “downside protection”) if financial institutions are to invest in films. They consider that the combined effect of the November bill amendments and the proposed May bill amendments would prevent this in relation to any film whether or not “commercial”. This is because in their view the amendments operate too harshly in a situation like that covered by the November bill, where a profit from the film is expected but not in fact realised. 5 As an example of the effect of the amendments, if in figure 2 a net profit was expected from the capital guaranteed film investment but no profit was in fact produced, the gross income would be subject to tax, but no deduction would be allowed for the related expenditure. Thus, in figure 2, the $20m income would be taxed without any corresponding deduction. The submitters have, therefore, suggested that the amendments (and the November bill legislation) should not apply where there is a reasonable expectation at the outset that the gross income from the film is at least equal to the cost of producing the film. The submission means that the tax base would continue to subsidise the risk of a film being unsuccessful. However, officials agree that this should prevent the transactions that the November bill was specifically targeted at, those with a low expectation of income. In transactions actually entered into there was little real expectation of film income (figure 1) or the expectation was of a low level of film income (figure 2). The type of transaction that would be unaffected by either the November or May bill measures if the submitters’ proposal is accepted would be where the expectation of investors was as outlined in figure 3. FIGURE 3 If this expectation were met, the economic reimbursement measures would not operate since there is no reimbursement of the expenses incurred in step 2. However, if the film were unsuccessful, then the subsidiary would be sold to ensure the bank realised a profit (or return of investment) as in figure 2. Under the economic reimbursement measures, the deduction for film expenditure would be denied. Subsidiary Bank Offshore film producer Step 1: $100m equity $100m film expenditure Step 2: Option to buy or sell not exercised because subsidiary makes a profit Step 3: $140m film income 6 Essentially, therefore, the submitters’ proposal is that where there is no expectation of profit, the economic reimbursement rule would apply and no double deductions would be allowed. Where there is an expectation of profit, however, the economic reimbursement rule would not apply and a double deduction would be allowed. Officials have considered these points. The main arguments raised by the submitters for their proposed approach are: (a) The New Zealand film industry needs the ability to attract investment from financial institutions. Such institutional investment will not be forthcoming if downside protection in the form of the transactions outlined are not available. (b) Allowing double deductions might result in taxable income being less than accounting or economic income but this is not peculiar to the film industry. The bill would not prevent the described transactions operating outside the film industry. There is no good case for singling out the film industry. The arguments against the submitters' proposal are: (a) If the economic reimbursement rules apply in the transactions discussed with the submitters, taxable income of the banking group is the same as its accounting or economic income. Thus, it would still be open to the film industry to be financed along the lines outlined albeit without any tax advantage and under more stringent tax rules than apply outside the film industry. (b) The proposal would draw a sharp distinction between the tax consequences that would apply to the same transaction depending upon the profit expectations of the parties. Officials agree that the film industry is being treated less favourably relative to other sectors. However, balancing this are the concessionary provisions for the deductibility of film expenditure. The submitters consider that to some extent the concessions are counter-balanced by a number of existing anti-avoidance provisions in the films regime. Nevertheless, officials consider that the rules overall do operate more favourably than the rules for ordinary business deductions. These concessions provide special rules for film taxation and encourage investment in this high risk area. The transactions considered reduce investor risk and it therefore seems justified to prevent an even more favourable tax regime from resulting. On that basis, officials support applying the economic reimbursement rules to expenditure covered by the film tax regime. This means not altering the measures contained in the November bill. The issue of applying economic reimbursement rules to film-related expenditure outside the film tax regime (as proposed in the May bill) has needed further consideration. Even where film-related expenditure is not subject to concessionary treatment, officials consider that the economic reimbursement rule should apply. There has been a substantial amount of investment in the film industry in recent times. The immediate deductibility of expenditure in relation to films both within and outside the films regime, combined with the difficulty in valuing films, means that 7 film investment poses a special risk to the tax base. The Government considers it important, therefore, to address this risk. The Government acknowledges that longer term solutions across a wider range of industries are still necessary to close off the range of possibilities for putting the tax base at risk. The Government is currently working on such longer term solutions. However, this should not prevent the Government from implementing short-term solutions such as the present amendment when a clear risk to the tax base presents itself. Therefore, although the proposed amendment is a short-term solution, the risk to the tax base posed by schemes using this film investment structure is too great for the Government to wait until comprehensive solutions are developed. If the reasonable expectation aspect of the submitters’ proposal were adopted more detailed rules for applying the test would need to be developed. This has been discussed with the submitters. Other criteria for the application of section EO 4A as proposed by the submitters As noted above, officials consider that the suggested 125% threshold test would be effective against Kids World type structures. This means that the requirement that the recipient of the payment for film rights be resident in a grey list country would be unnecessary. In addition, it would be likely to have little practical effect since an offshore producer may have deductions for actual film expenditure offsetting income it received from the sale of film rights. The requirement could also be circumvented by using a grey list entity as an intermediary or conduit for a tax exempt entity or an entity in a low tax jurisdiction. Although the New Zealand film content requirement is desirable, it does not in itself address any of the tax issues since the structures that resulted in the November bill changes did in fact involve films with a significant New Zealand content. Conclusion In conclusion, the submitters' proposals do not achieve the Government's objective of maintaining the tax base. Recommendation That the submission be declined and the amendments proposed by the Government proceed. 8 Issue: Economic implications Submission 12B and letter from Motion Picture Association (MPA) Submission 12B (Rudd Watts & Stone) A report produced in the limited time available by Ernst & Young, approved by peer review by Dr Alex Sunderkov at NZIER, together with the MPA letter, suggest that the effect of a failure to target section EO 4A along the lines proposed by submission 13 is highly likely to have a significant adverse impact on future film production in New Zealand by US studios. The results of the submitters’ analysis, based on an assumed incremental expenditure of $100m indicate: • total economic impact measured in terms of incremental output generated in the economy is approximately $210m; • value-added impact (contribution to New Zealand Gross Domestic Product (‘GDP’)) is approximately $115m; • total incremental increase in tax revenue is approximately $44m, made up of an initial incremental increase of $21m and a subsequent incremental increase from flow-on effects of $23m; • owing to time constraints placed on the submission, the assumptions used to estimate economic benefit are conservative. Based on this indicative analysis the submitters’ conclusion is that incremental offshore film production expenditure in New Zealand has positive effects on the New Zealand economy and taxation revenue. Extract from letter from Motion Picture Association "The single most compelling factor in the decision to relocate production from Southern California to foreign jurisdiction is cost. If the existing New Zealand tax provisions now used for financing productions are eliminated, the cost of production in New Zealand may no longer be competitive when compared to other suitable locations around the world. Moreover, if changes in the law are effectuated so as to impact on ongoing productions including subsequent seasons of ongoing television series, the consequences will be even more dramatic in discouraging future production in New Zealand. Film production is a moveable business. Our business is labour intensive, creating many desirable and high paying jobs. The worldwide marketplace for production is highly competitive. Foreign countries often seek assistance of the MPA in creating incentives likely to attract film production and, if so requested, we would assist you \[the New Zealand Government\]." 9 Comment The Motion Picture Association (MPA) suggests that if the proposed amendment proceeds, production costs in New Zealand may no longer be competitive, and hence the industry may have to shift production offshore. However, the MPA has not indicated to what extent its investment decisions would be influenced by the proposed amendment. Nor has it specified particular investments that will not proceed if the proposed amendment is implemented. The Ernst & Young report does not attempt to estimate the extent to which the proposed amendment would affect foreign investment decisions. Nor does it estimate the net cost or net benefit of the proposed amendment for New Zealand. Rather, all it does is to provide rough estimates of some of the potential benefits to New Zealand from an additional $100m of foreign investment in film production. The report does not take into account the potential costs associated with failing to implement the proposed amendment. In particular, it ignores the cost to New Zealand associated with unintentionally attracting resources away from other investments that would be of greater net benefit to New Zealand. For example, the report notes that investment in tourism would yield even greater benefits to New Zealand. The report also ignores the considerable costs to New Zealand associated with the Government in effect underwriting at taxpayers’ expense the risks associated with film production. In any event tax policy should not be driven by any perceived need to provide incentives to investment in particular sectors. Issue: Certainty of film tax treatment Submission 14W (New Zealand Film Commission) The New Zealand Film Commission emphasises the desirability of having certainty and stability in the tax treatment of film investment. The Commission notes that film investment depends on as much certainty as possible in the fiscal and regulatory environment. The Commission would be concerned if the proposed tax changes were put together in such a way that they required further consequential change at a later date. Comment The New Zealand Film Commission does not oppose the proposed amendments. Instead, its primary concern is ensuring that there is certainty and stability in the tax treatment of the film industry, especially in order to encourage investment from overseas in the New Zealand film industry. The Government recognises and endorses the desirability of having certainty and stability in the tax treatment of the film industry. The tax treatment of the film industry should be sustainable in the longer term and not be subject to significant 10 changes, as a constantly changing tax regime deters foreign investment. As the submission notes, there has recently been significant United States investment in the making of film and television programmes in New Zealand. It is the Government’s policy to encourage foreign investment into New Zealand because of the significant benefits to New Zealand that such investment brings, such as new jobs, skills and technology. Foreign investment in New Zealand also assists in lowering the cost of capital to New Zealand businesses. However, the Government’s tax policies are designed to ensure that investment decisions are generally based on commercial merit rather than taxation advantage, thereby minimising distortions to the pattern of investment. The most stable tax laws are those that minimise any tax base problems. Recommendation That the principle of the desirability of certainty and stability in the tax treatment of the film industry, as highlighted in the submission, be endorsed. Issue: Not including service providers in film expenditure regime Submission 13 (Rudd Watts & Stone, and Simpson Grierson) The extension of the definition of a “right” in a film should be restricted to the application of section EO 4A. This would mean that the expenditure of service providers such as actors and directors would continue to be governed by the general deductibility provisions rather than the film expenditure regime in sections EO 3 and EO 4. Comment The expenditure of service providers such as actors and technicians who are not investors in a film, but whose remuneration is partly dependent on income from a film, would come within the film expenditure regime instead of the general deductibility provisions under the amendments as currently drafted. Officials agree that the expenditure of such service providers should continue to be governed by the general deductibility provisions rather than the film expenditure regime. It was not intended that the amendment apply to this expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 11 Issue: Application date Submission 12 and 13A (Rudd Watts & Stone) The proposed changes to section EO 4A of the Income Tax Act 1994 have retrospective effect and should be altered so the proposed clauses apply only to transactions entered into on or after 7 July 1999. Comment The proposed amendment to counter tax driven film deals applies to any expenditure incurred or depreciation recognised from 7 July 1999, the date the Government announced the amendment would be effective from, irrespective of whether investors have committed themselves to finance a project. The amendment may, therefore, affect a transaction that was entered into before 7 July 1999 if expenditure relating to the transaction is incurred or depreciation recognised on or after 7 July 1999. However, the proposed amendment would not affect a transaction for which all expenditure had been incurred or depreciation recognised before 7 July 1999. The Government carefully considered the matter of the appropriate application date of the amendment before recommending that it apply to expenditure incurred or depreciation recognised from the date of announcement, 7 July 1999. The Government decided that it did not wish to “grandfather” aggressive tax driven deals, and that it wanted to send a message to potential investors that tax driven deals may be overturned part way through their lives. However, the amendment will not affect expenditure on a film incurred or depreciation recognised before 7 July 1999. The expenditure incurred basis of the application date of the proposed amendment is consistent with that for section EO 4A, the related film economic reimbursement provision, which was recently enacted by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. This section, which reduces deductions for expenditure taken under the film expenditure regime if there is an effective reimbursement of the expenditure and the ambit of which will be widened by the proposed amendment, applies to expenditure incurred on or after 17 November 1998. This amendment also did not “grandfather” existing arrangements. Another advantage of having an amendment apply to expenditure incurred or depreciation recognised rather than transactions entered into after the commencement date is that it provides more certainty where a transaction involves a number of contracts. It should be noted that the “Kids World” prospectus itself put investors on notice that the tax results of the investment could be affected by future legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 Annex FILM LEGISLATION PROPOSAL SIMPLIFIED HIGH INCOME INDIVIDUAL EXAMPLE The following example sets out how a film scheme targeted at high income individuals might work and details the effect of the proposed law change. Of necessity a number of the steps have either been considerably simplified or omitted. Any scheme targeted at high income individuals would typically consist of a number of taxpayers and a partnership of loss attributing qualifying companies, LAQCs. Put option over shares for $57,000 Share of film costing $75,000 1. Taxpayer sets up a special purpose LAQC with $75,000 of capital. $57,000 of the $75,000 is financed by Taxpayer via a loan. The balance of $18,000 is provided by the Taxpayer directly. 2. Taxpayer arranges for a put option to guarantee the shares in LAQC can be sold for $57,000 should the film be unsuccessful. (This sum is not taxable.) This ensures that Taxpayer’s net cash outlay is only $18,000. 3. LAQC pays Film Maker $75,000 to acquire a share in a film and deducts this amount. This loss is transferred to Taxpayer. These losses provide Taxpayer with a tax refund of $25,000, or $1.39 for every dollar actually outlaid by Taxpayer. 4. $57,000 of the $75,000 Film Maker receives is set aside by Film Maker to fund the potential purchase of the shares in LAQC. Taxpayer LAQC Film Maker 13 Economically Taxpayer has paid $75,000 for the LAQC shares, held them for some time and then sold them for $57,000, a net cost of $18,000. However, Taxpayer has also obtained a tax refund of $25,000 – in other words, Taxpayer has made $7,000 on the deal, but only at the expense of the tax base. The proposed law change would reduce Taxpayer’s losses by $57,000 because Taxpayer has been “reimbursed” that amount – in other words, Taxpayer has not borne a loss of $75,000, but only $18,000. If the film is successful the put option is not exercised and the proposed amendment has no effect. 14 CROWN ENTITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED PERSON TEST \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Special corporate entity rules Clauses 27, 28, 42 and 45 Submission (1W - KPMG on behalf of Meridian Energy Limited) Further amendments are necessary to the special corporate entity (SCE) rules to: 1. clarify that the subsidiaries of SCEs cannot group loss offset with the subsidiaries of any other SCE, and 2. confirm that subsidiaries of a SCE can group losses with its parent SCE. These are generic problems with the SCE rules. Comment SCEs either have no shareholders or are entities where changes in shareholding should have no tax consequence. The best example is that the shareholding in an SOE could change when the shareholding Minister changes – that should not affect the tax treatment of the SOE. Accordingly, the SCE rules deem that a SCE is held for tax purposes by a “same single person” at all times, regardless of who actually (if anyone) holds the shares. The submission points out that there is some doubt as to who actually is deemed to own the shares in any subsidiary of a SCE. The Income Tax Act states that shares in a subsidiary are deemed to be owned by the shareholders of the parent company. However, this does not mesh well with the SCE provisions, where the “same single person” is deemed to have no other ownership rights other than those in the SCE. The submission correctly points out that this could cause confusion and unintended results. Accordingly, the clarification of the rules governing SCEs and their subsidiaries as proposed is appropriate. As with the associated person changes, the amendments should be backdated to 1992. However, tax returns that have already been filed that take up a different position should be “grandfathered”. Officials believe that the “notional single person” rule in section OD 5(5), which works in a similar way to the “same single person”, is similarly affected and should be amended in like fashion. However, because this provision is more complicated it is recommended that this amendment be made in the next available taxation bill. 15 Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that section OD 5(5) be clarified as soon as is possible. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Scope of the associated person amendments Submission (Matters raised by officials) The amendments proposed in the bill are too wide in that they simply exclude the application of the associated person rules to SCEs, rather than limit their application. Further, the proposed amendments do not appropriately deal with companies in which SCEs directly or indirectly hold shares. Comment Each SCE is deemed to be held by a different “same single person” for the purposes of the voting and market value tests. To the extent these tests are used in the associated person tests for other companies, they should apply for SCEs as well. This will involve restricting the ambit of the proposed amendment. The associated person rules should apply to ensure that SCEs and their subsidiaries are only associated vertically (that is, an SCE and its subsidiaries), but not horizontally (that is, SCE with SCE, or SCE subsidiary with another SCE or the subsidiary of another SCE). Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

They take up, and in some cases build upon, a number of the recommendations of the review by the Child Support Review 1994 Working Party (the Trapski Review). Thirteen written submissions were received. Six of the submitters also made oral submissions. Most of the submissions supported the proposed amendments, with several commenting favourably that recommendations of the Trapski Review were finally being acted upon. However, some submitters did express disappointment that the changes do not, in their view, go far enough in addressing some of the problems they have experienced with the scheme. 4 WRITE-OFF OF PENALTIES Clause 27 PROPOSED POLICY Penalties will be written off when: • Liable parents keep to debt repayment arrangements entered into within three months of when Inland Revenue first assessed their liability. • An initial penalty is more than the arrears to which it relates and the liable parent concerned has no history of late payments. Additional provisions will allow Inland Revenue the discretion to write off penalties when, under the circumstances, it would be unjust or unreasonable to charge penalties. These measures are expected to encourage voluntary compliance with the child support law by giving Inland Revenue greater flexibility to write off penalties, particularly when the liability first arises. Submission (2 – New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.), 11 - Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society, 13 – Des Eyre) Submissions 2, 11 and 13 support the proposed changes. Issue: Income and assets to be criteria for write-off Submission (7 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) Penalties should not be written off when liable parents have substantial income and have deliberately adjusted their circumstances to reduce taxable income to reduce liability. The write-off of penalties should be subject to an asset test. Comment The proposed write-off provisions are intended to encourage voluntary compliance with child support liabilities. They introduce more flexibility to deal with penalties incurred when liability is first established, and in prescribed circumstances which indicate no intent on the part of the liable parent to avoid meeting his or her liability for child support, and the non-payment of child support has been corrected as soon as possible. The proposals do not allow for write-off in all cases. 5 The extent to which taxable income produces an assessment that reflects the real capacity of a liable parent to contribute financial support is separate from decisions relating to write-off of penalties. The administrative review process provides for consideration of the inclusion of other than taxable income in the assessment of child support liability in individual cases. The proposed changes are modelled on the current provisions for the write-off of penalties for non-payment of income tax and GST. Officials consider that it would be inappropriate that the write-off of penalties be subject to an income or asset test. Such a test would increase compliance and administrative costs. In addition, such a test depending on the financial circumstances of the liable parent may lead to inequities. This would arise when the reason for the non-payment is the same but the write-off is not available because of the financial position of the liable parent. Inland Revenue proposes to issue a standard practice statement that will set out guidelines for staff to use to ensure consistent application of the proposed write-off provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extension of write-off provisions to cases of double payment Submission (13 – Des Eyre) The provisions of clause 27 (write-off of late payment penalty) should be extended to cases where the application of the Child Support Act 1991 has had the effect of causing the liable parent to pay maintenance for a child more than once. Comment The submitter suggests an extension to the power of the Commissioner to exempt a liable parent from payment of child support. This would arise when the Child Support Act 1991 has the effect of overriding an agreement relating to matrimonial property which was endorsed by the Family Court before enactment of the Child Support Act. The Child Support Act 1991 already provides for previous settlements under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 or otherwise to be considered as grounds for an application for departure from the formula. The bill does not provide for the write-off of the underlying child support liability, only penalties for late payment. The submission is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 6 INCOME YEAR OF ASSESSMENT AND INFLATION FACTOR Clauses 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 23, 26, 36, 37 and 38 PROPOSED POLICY The changes are designed to achieve a closer match between the income on which an assessment is based and the current ability of a liable parent to provide financial support. They involve changing the child support year so that, from the 2001-02 year, it will begin in July rather than in April. Recently enacted tax simplification measures will provide Inland Revenue with earlier income information. All these changes will enable Inland Revenue to base the assessments of about 75% of liable parents, those who have income tax deducted from their wages, salaries or benefits, on their income for the year ending on the 31 March before the start of the child support year. Other liable parents, those who do not have all their income tax deducted at source, will also move to a child support year that begins on 1 July, but will continue to have their assessments based on their income of two years earlier. An inflation factor will be added to the income of this group to bring them into line, as closely as possible, with the rest. For both groups there will be a transitional period covering 1 April to 30 June 2001. Submission (2 – New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.), 7 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.), 11 - Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) Submissions 2, 7 and 11 support the changes proposed, with submission 2 commenting specifically on the intention to base assessment on the previous year’s income. Issue: Sudden decline in income Submission (10 – New Zealand Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux Inc) The proposed amendments do not provide for liable parents whose income has suddenly declined dramatically, such as following redundancy. Comment At present, liable parents whose current year income is expected to be at least 15% less than the income on which their assessment is based may elect to have their assessment based on their estimated income for the year. 7 Officials consider that the estimation provisions adequately provide for situations where there has been a sudden and dramatic decline in income. The ability to base assessments on the previous year’s income rather than on income of two years previously is also expected to reduce the need for liable parents to estimate their income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 8 ESTIMATION OF INCOME Clauses 9-17, 25 and 30 PROPOSED POLICY The provisions governing the estimation of income for child support purposes are being amended to make them fairer and easier to use. The changes: • allow reconciliation assessments to be issued when liable parents who have estimated their income fail to furnish tax returns; • stop those liable parents from estimating their income again until they furnish their outstanding returns; • cap child support at what would have been payable had income not been estimated; • ensure that those who estimate their income part-way through the year will not have to continue paying the minimum amount of $10 a week when the amount they have already paid covers their liability for the year; • provide for the state to waive its entitlement if the preceding change results in a custodian moving on to a social welfare benefit; • provide that when liable parents revoke an estimation or no longer meet the criteria for estimating income, their liability will revert to what it would have been had they not estimated, with the resulting shortfall being spread over the rest of the year; • make it no longer necessary that an application to estimate income be in the “approved form”; • remove the child support use of money provisions. Submission (7 - National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.), 11 - Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) Submissions 7 and 11 support the changes proposed. The NCW submission is particularly supportive of the expected effect of encouraging voluntary compliance. 9 EXEMPTIONS FOR LONG-TERM PRISONERS AND HOSPITAL PATIENTS Clauses 19, 20, 21 and 22 PROPOSED POLICY Exemptions from paying child support will: • cover the full period of a liable parent’s imprisonment or hospitalisation if more than 13 weeks; and • be extended to long-term hospital patients who are on a reduced social welfare benefit, and patients in private hospitals and residential care institutions. Submission (2 – New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.),) Submission 2 supports the proposed changes. Issue: Exemption to be subject to an asset test Submission (7 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) The changes proposed are supported but the exemption should be subject to an asset test. Comment At present the exemption available to prisoners or hospital patients is subject to an income test. Income may only be from investments and must not exceed $520 in the child support year in which the exemption is sought. Under the proposed amendments that income test will be modified so that income is calculated on a weekly basis ($10 per week) when liable parents are in prison or hospital for more than 13 weeks but less than a full child support year. The exemption provisions recognise the limited opportunity that liable parents, who are long-term hospital patients or prison inmates have to earn an income. The current provisions allow those liable parents to retain sufficient income from investments only to meet their ongoing personal expenses while in hospital or prison. The addition of an asset test to the processing of applications for exemption would increase both the administrative cost of this activity and compliance costs incurred by 10 liable parents. Custodians who believe that liable parents have assets that could be better used to meet their child support liability may have grounds for an application for departure from the formula. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extend exemption to shorter stays in hospital or prison Submission (11 – Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) The proposed changes are supported but the exemption should also be extended to those who have very limited income and whose stay in hospital or prison is less than 13 weeks. Comment Exemptions are already limited to those who have very limited income. Treating stays in hospital or prison of more than 13 weeks as “long term” is consistent with the treatment under the Social Security Act 1964, which provides for a reduction in benefit payable when a beneficiary is a patient in a hospital for more than 13 weeks. Extending the exemption provisions to those whose stay in hospital or prison is less than 13 weeks would advantage those liable parents over other liable parents who have suffered a short-term loss of income for other reasons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 NOTICES OF ASSESSMENT Clauses 24 and 28 PROPOSED POLICY The changes are intended to allow more flexibility in the content of the notices of assessment that Inland Revenue issues to liable parents. They also allow the department not to issue a new notice of assessment when the amount of child support to be paid does not change as a result of a reassessment. This means that notices of assessment do not need to contain irrelevant information, and they will be issued only when there is a change in the amount of child support to be paid. A further minor amendment ensures that liable parents are notified of their right to apply for an administrative determination. Submissions (2 – New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.), 11 – Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) Submission 2 supports the greater flexibility of the proposed amendment. Submission 11 supports the reduction in the quantity of notices of assessment that the average liable parent will receive as a result of the proposed amendment. 12 REFUNDS Clause 34 PROPOSED POLICY The amendments remove the requirement that applications for refunds of excess child support must be in writing, and allow Inland Revenue to refund excess child support without a prior application in some circumstances. This will speed up refunds and reduce paperwork. Submission (2 - New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.), 13 – Des Eyre) Submission 2 supports the provision for greater flexibility. Submission 13 supports the provision because of personal experience of difficulty in obtaining a refund. Issue: Refund when payment has been passed to a custodian Submission (11 - Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) The proposed changes address most of the concerns with refunds of overpayments. However, the Commissioner should also be able to refund liable parent credits when payment has been passed on to the custodian (payee). Comment The existing provision which allows the Commissioner to decline to refund an overpayment when payment has been passed on to the payee provides protection against intentional collusion between a liable parent and a custodian that results in a custodian receiving payments to which she/he was not entitled. It is invoked only in those circumstances. If the Commissioner declines to make a refund, the former liable parent may choose to take action through the District Court for the recovery of the overpaid child support. Equally, the liable parent may accept that the payment has been for the benefit of the children and choose not to seek recovery. 13 It should be noted that when the Commissioner refunds overpaid child support to a liable parent, and the amount paid had already been passed to the custodian (payee), that creates a corresponding debt which must be recovered from the custodian. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 DEDUCTION OF CHILD SUPPORT FROM WAGES AND SALARIES Clauses 31 and 32 PROPOSED POLICY Liable parents will be able to choose to have more than 40 percent in child support deducted from a single wage or salary source when they have more than one employer or source of income. This will simplify their paying arrangements. Employers will be able to deduct child support according to the pay period under which they operate. Submissions (2 - New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.), 9 – New Zealand Employers Federation Inc.) The submissions support the proposed changes for the greater flexibility they will provide and the removal of current difficulties with the application of the legislation. 15 “UPLIFT” OF DEBT AND FUTURE ENTITLEMENT Clause 33 PROPOSED POLICY At present, custodians who are not social welfare beneficiaries may withdraw from the child support scheme and take over responsibility for collecting current arrears of spousal maintenance and/or child support. The amendment allows them to take over future entitlement also. A further amendment allows social welfare beneficiaries who are entitled to spousal maintenance to take over responsibility for collecting both arrears and any future entitlement. (Social welfare beneficiaries cannot take over responsibility for collecting child support because it is generally retained by the state to meet the cost of the benefit provided.) Submission (2 - New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.), 11 - Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) The proposed changes are supported for the greater flexibility they will provide. Issue: Responsibility for recovery of financial support Submission (7 - National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) Recovery of financial support should be the responsibility of Inland Revenue Child Support rather than a cost to the custodian/payee. Comment In making this submission NCW is concerned that there are no checks in the child support legislation to ensure custodians are not put under undue pressure to compromise their rights in order to retain custody of the child(ren). The amendment is proposed to enable custodians to voluntarily take over collection of amounts that are owed to them. They may still choose, as at present, to have Inland Revenue Child Support to enforce collection for them. 16 The Child Support Review 1994 Working Party considered that the limitations imposed by the current legislation create an unnecessary frustration for custodians who may wish to make their own arrangements. It is also inefficient for Inland Revenue Child Support to continue enforcing collection of financial support against the wishes of the payee. The proposed amendments follow the recommendations of the Working Party. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 17 CUSTODIANS’ BANK ACCOUNTS Clauses 4, 18 and 29 PROPOSED POLICY The amendments will preserve the administrative efficiency of requiring payments to be direct-credited to a bank account but achieve more flexibility by allowing custodians to choose any account for payments. To eliminate unnecessary delay in the start of child support, processing of an application will not be delayed because a custodian has failed to provide details of the bank account to which payments are to be made. Submission (2 - New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.)) The greater flexibility that the proposed amendments will offer in respect of custodians’ bank accounts is welcomed. 18 OVERSEAS TAXABLE INCOME Clause 8 PROPOSED POLICY Inland Revenue Child Support will have the discretion to include income that is taxable outside New Zealand in the child support assessment base when a liable parent is not resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes. (Any overseas income should already be included in the parent’s tax return if he or she is resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes.) This will ensure that assessments more accurately reflect that parent’s ability to pay child support. Issue: The discretionary power to include overseas income Submissions (6W – Karen Monet, 7 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.), 11W – Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) The submissions supported this amendment, but raised the following points: • Instead of a discretionary power to include overseas taxable income, inclusion should be mandatory, with a discretionary power to exclude overseas income in certain circumstances. • The discretionary power should be subject to appropriate internal Inland Revenue controls. Comment The amendment arose in the context of the proposed agreement between New Zealand and Australia for the collection of child support. Under the agreement each country will provide to the other information relating to a liable parent’s taxable income and location. Using this information, Inland Revenue Child Support will issue an assessment. The amendment is discretionary and not limited to Australian income to allow an assessment to include overseas income from other countries 1 when it is known and there is an expectation that payment can be enforced. As drafted, the amendment means that a further modification will not be necessary if reciprocal agreements are negotiated with other countries in the future. 1 One of the submissions made the comment that the amendment would apply only to liable parents residing in a country with which New Zealand has entered into a child support reciprocal agreement. In addition, child support is also payable if the child is a New Zealand citizen or is ordinary resident in New Zealand, no matter where the parent resides when the parent is a New Zealand citizen. 19 It is expected that the amendment will have a deterrent effect on liable parents who leave New Zealand to avoid their child support liability. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 20 RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIA Clause 39 PROPOSED POLICY In anticipation of a reciprocal agreement being entered into between New Zealand and Australia for the enforcement of collection of child support and spousal maintenance, the Family Proceedings Act 1980 is being amended so that, once the agreement comes into effect, people residing in New Zealand or Australia will not be able to seek maintenance using the United Nations Convention for the Recovery of Maintenance Abroad. The amendment will be given effect by the Order in Council that gives effect to the reciprocal agreement. Issue: Effectiveness of the provision Submission (7 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) Although the submission supported the proposed child support reciprocal agreement, it was sceptical about the effectiveness of this change, given the time that negotiations have already taken. Comment The child support reciprocal agreement is to be considered by the Prime Ministerial Taskforce on Closer Economic Relations with Australia. It is expected that the Taskforce will not be reporting to the respective Prime Ministers until the end of June. The implementation date will not precede that report and will also be dependent on Australia enacting the legislative changes necessary to their Child Support Act to give effect to the agreement. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 21 ISSUES OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE BILL Issue: Value of fringe benefits to be included in taxable income Submission (1- James Darkins) The value of fringe benefits should be included when assessing the taxable income of liable parents. The current method of determining the taxable income of a liable parent discriminates against parents whose sole source of income is wages from which PAYE is deducted at source. Liable parents who receive fringe benefits as part of an employment package or their remuneration from a business gain a financial benefit which is not reflected in the amount paid to the custodian. Comment The submitter believes that while the ability to structure remuneration from employment to maximise non-cash benefits has a negative impact on the collection of income tax, there is a greater impact when that reduced income is used to determine child support liability. The loss of entitlement creates inequity for custodians, most of whom are women. Taxable income is used as the basis for formula assessments of child support because it is administratively simple, is subject to audit and does not add compliance costs for liable parents. It is an accurate basis for the majority of liable parents. The Child Support Act does recognise that assessment based on taxable income may not always produce an appropriate level of liability. It does this through the departure provisions. Liable parents and custodians can seek the determination of a more appropriate assessment of liability, initially by applying for an administrative review. These reviews, carried out by independent contractors, follow precedents set in past court cases and allow for other than taxable income to be taken into account in setting the level of liability. A recent determination granted a departure from the standard formula assessment by making a nominal assessment of the value of a company car available for private use. The review officer stated: “As personal transport is a standard living expense, it must be brought into account in assessing (the liable parent’s) ‘real income’.” The formula assessment based on taxable income produces an equitable level of liability for the majority of liable parents. Officials consider it appropriate that special circumstances that lead to an inequitable result should continue to be considered independently on a case-by-case basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 Issue: Lower estimation threshold to 10% Submission (3 – New Zealand Federation of Family Budgeting Services (Inc.)) The threshold for an estimation of income to be accepted should be 10% rather than 15%, as it is currently. Comment Whatever level of threshold is used, boundary problems will occur for those who do not quite meet it. Alternative thresholds were considered both at the time of the development of the Child Support Act 1991, and by the Child Support Review 1994 Working Party. The Working Party concluded that the 15% threshold should be retained for the following reasons: • The lower the threshold, the more likelihood there is of income being underestimated. This could lead to more liable parents incurring underestimation penalties at the end of the year. • A low threshold would lead to an increase in the number of liable parents having to re-estimate their income at regular intervals to take account of fluctuations in income and to avoid underestimation penalties. This would increase compliance costs for liable parents and employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue Child Support. • There would be increased uncertainty for custodians about the level of support they could expect to receive. The threshold was also set at a level which it was believed would discourage liable parents from misusing the estimations provisions to reduce or defer their child support payments. Liable parents who are genuinely facing hardship through a drop in income that does not meet the 15% threshold are still able to seek a departure through the administrative review process. There is case precedent for this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 Issue: Explicit liability for same sex partners of custodians Submission (4 – Commissioner for Children) There should be specific wording in the Act to include liability for same sex parents to pay child support. Comment This issue was recently considered in a High Court appeal against a Family Court declaration that the former partner in a long-standing lesbian relationship is the “step- parent” of the children born to the partner. It was noted in that judgment that the wording of the Child Support Act 1991 should be taken to be gender-neutral unless otherwise stated, and that an inclusive interpretation would promote the protection of children’s rights. In this particular case, however, other factors were taken into consideration before a conclusion was reached. The case focussed on parental status rather than on the wider issues of the status of same-sex relationships. Officials consider that the court is the appropriate forum for consideration of all the factors that should be taken into account in reaching a conclusion on whether a person who is neither a natural parent nor an adoptive parent should be declared to be a step- parent and consequently liable for the payment of child support. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (5 – Dara Walsh) This comprehensive submission proposes a radical change to the child support system. Specific issues raised are described below. Issue:A state-guaranteed system under which both parents are equally liable for the costs of raising their children (Points 12 – 17, 40, 43, 48, 51 and 52) Under the proposed system a standardised cost of raising children would be set. Parents would each be liable to meet half that cost. Parents who were unable to pay their share could apply for financial assistance. The level of that assistance would be determined by a formula, as at present, with parties having recourse to the Family Court to obtain orders for additional financial assistance. 24 Comment The proposal suggests a total reform of the child support system. Officials therefore have not undertaken detailed analysis of the merits of the proposal as it is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Automatic inclusion of a partner in living allowance The comment is made that child support liability automatically reduces when a non- custodial parent has a live-in partner, regardless of whether or not that person is dependent. Comment Living allowances are provided in an attempt to balance the needs of a liable parent’s absent family and current family. Providing an allowance for the spouse and/or children in the current family ensures that the basic needs of that family can be met. At the time of introduction of the Child Support Bill 1991 it was considered too complex administratively to distinguish between dependent and non-dependent spouses. It is recognised that the automatic inclusion of a spouse in the living allowance can create an inequity for the custodian and children when the new spouse is not dependent on the liable parent. When that inclusion does produce an unfair result a custodian may seek a departure from the formula by applying for an administrative review. Officials believe that the independent consideration of individual cases through the administrative review process or Family Court is the appropriate approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax deductibility of child support payments The submission questions whether child support payment should be tax-deductible. Comment It is a general principle of New Zealand income tax law that there is no deduction for income tax purposes of private or domestic expenditure. The costs incurred by a family raising children are not deductible for tax purposes. As a corollary child support payments received are not treated as taxable income. 25 Child support payments are taken into account in calculating a family’s entitlement to family support, the independent family tax credit and the guaranteed minimum family income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Liable parents’ taxable income Submissions (5 – Dara Walsh, 7 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) • Child support should be based on children’s financial needs rather than on a liable parent’s taxable income. • Some liable parents can reduce their child support liability by the use of trusts, companies and self-employment. • Some liable parents use either legal or illegal methods to reduce their taxable income. • By basing child support on taxable income, a liable parent’s tax-deductible expenses are taken into account. • A large percentage of liable parents pay only the minimum. • Liable parents should be asset tested. Comment Child support is based on taxable income because this information is readily available from Inland Revenue’s computer system. With over 130,000 liable parents, the assessment process needs to be fully automated. The Child Support Act recognises that the use of taxable income may produce an inappropriate result in some situations by allowing a departure from the formula to be granted if it has produced an unjust or unfair result when the income, earning capacity, property or other financial resources of the liable parent or the custodian or the child are taken into account. As the first step in the departure process, custodians and liable parents can ask the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make an administrative determination. This is a low-cost, informal process which is carried out by independent people, experienced in law and contracted to Inland Revenue, who follow precedents set by past court cases. Court precedents have established that avoidance arrangements, such as transferring assets to a trust, can be “looked through” and a person’s true economic position taken into account when setting the level of child support. Any custodian or liable parent who is unhappy with an administrative determination can apply to the courts for a departure order. 26 Officials are currently reviewing the results of child support administrative review decisions made in the 12 months to 28 February 1999. The purpose of the review is to establish whether the administrative review process is successful in addressing the issue of liable parents attempting to avoid or minimise their child support liability. A self-employed person’s taxable income allows a deduction for expenditure legitimately incurred in deriving that income. Any modification to that income is currently best addressed through the administrative review and court processes. Approximately 35 percent of liable parents are themselves beneficiaries. For other liable parents with modest incomes, the living allowance means that those who have new partners and/or children will also often be assessed at the minimum rate. The following table shows the maximum amounts of taxable income which result in $520 being payable under the standard formula for the 1999-2000 child support year. INCOME AT WHICH MINIMUM CHILD SUPPORT AMOUNT PAYABLE Number of children for whom child support is payable Living Allowance OneTwoThreeFour Single$14,292$13,569$13,328$13,136 Married$18,333$17,610$17,369$17,177 Single/Married plus one child $24,817$24,094$23,853$23,661 Single/Married plus 2 children $27,261$26,538$26,297$26,105 Single/Married plus 3 children $29,705$28,982$28,741$28,549 Single/Married plus 4 children $32,149$31,426$31,185$30,993 Although Inland Revenue is not in a position to asset test liable parents, the property of a liable parent can be taken into account in granting a departure from the formula assessment. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 27 Issue: Differences in income-earning capacity “The law maintains both parents are equally liable for the support of their children. However, income-earning capacity is not yet gender-neutral and child support payments are often a token gesture, an insult.” Comment Although the Child Support Act 1991 creates an expectation that both parents will contribute to the financial support of their child(ren), it does not require equal financial contributions from them. Rather, it is implied that some at least of the contribution provided by the custodian will not be in a monetary form. The purpose of the Child Support Act is to ensure that parents not living with their children contribute in a monetary form based on their capacity to pay. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Value of full-time care Parent who are full-time caregivers (regardless of whether or not they have a partner), should have the value of this recognised in a monetary form. Comment Family support and the independent family tax credit are paid fully to principal caregivers. This means that many partners who stay at home to care for the child(ren) do receive a payment in their own right. The object of the child support scheme is to ensure financial support is paid for children. Additional financial support for caregivers, when needed, is more appropriately considered under the Social Security Act 1964. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 Issue: All custodial parents to receive payment towards cost of children All custodial parents should receive at least 50% towards the minimum cost of raising children. Comment The Government’s policy is to provide assistance to families who are in need of financial assistance. Depending on their circumstances, there are a number of social assistance programmes available to custodians to assist with the raising of children. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Income splitting for tax purposes and paid parental leave The state could endorse the validity of caregiving for all parents via income splitting for tax purposes and paid parental leave in households where other state assistance is not sought. Comment This submission is outside the scope of the bill. Officials have not undertaken any detailed analysis of this submission. The Select Committee is currently considering the Paid Parental Leave Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (7 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) This submission, in addition to commenting on specific aspects of the bill, considers there are a number of omissions. Issue: Delays in receiving child support following cessation of benefit Some custodians experience unnecessary delays when transferring off a benefit. Comment The delay between cessation of benefit payments and commencement of child support payments is an inevitable consequence of the payment cycle. The following is an example of how the payment cycle applies: 29 Child support liability is assessed for the month of May. Payment of that assessed liability is due by the 20 th June. Payment received by the 20 th is passed on to the custodian by the 7 th July, or earlier if possible. Although custodians experience a delay when they move off benefit, those who move onto a benefit continue to receive their child support for the first month. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Maximum for assessable income The maximum assessable income level should be removed or at least increased. The existence of the maximum exacerbates the discrepancy in standards of living between parents following break-up of a marriage or long-term relationship. Comment The rationale for placing an upper limit on formula assessed child support payments is that where a family income is very high, the opportunity exists for discretionary spending over and above the costs of maintaining the children. After separation the parent who earns the high income should still have the right to decide upon discretionary spending. When the formula does produce an unfair outcome it is appropriate that consideration of all the factors which could lead to a departure from the formula be carried out independently. There is case precedent for setting a higher level of liability when a liable parent’s income is much larger than the maximum amount allowable under the formula. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Voluntary agreements entered into under duress The bill should provide for checks to ensure custodians are not put under undue pressure to compromise their rights in order to retain custody of the children or other interests. Comment It is one of the principles of family law that wherever possible the parties to domestic disputes should be encouraged to reach their own agreements. Agreements that are reached voluntarily are generally more likely to be adhered to. The Child Support Act 1991 provides some safeguards in that the parties to a voluntary agreement can ask Inland Revenue Child Support to enforce payment, or either party can ask for a formula assessment when the terms of the agreement are no longer appropriate. 30 The Child Support Act does provide for a party to a voluntary agreement to apply to the Family Court to have that agreement set aside. One of the grounds for such an application is that the concurrence of the applicant was obtained by undue influence. Recommendation Note that the Child Support Act 1991 already provides controls in the situation suggested by the submission. Issue: Liability to pay while an objection is considered The Child Support Act allows for suspension of liability by the Family Court while an objection is considered. The penalties when applications are lost should be sufficiently high as to deter frivolous or vexatious intent. Comment Suspension of liability is not automatic following an objection or an application to the Family Court. Liable parents must make a separate application to the Court for a suspension order. Very few such applications are made. In considering applications for suspension orders, the Family Court must make a judgment about the chances of the substantive application being successful, the ability of the applicant to make payments pending the outcome and any disadvantage that would be caused to the custodian and the child(ren). Officials consider that the Family Court is the appropriate forum in which such judgments should be made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Discrimination against larger families The bill should address the discrimination against larger families which arises from the maximum percentage under the formula being reached at four children. Comment Increasing the child support percentages to take account of liability for more than four children might, for some liable parents, have produced an unacceptably high level of payment to meet out of their disposable income. In addition, to maintain a balance, if percentages were increased for the fifth and subsequent children, a similar adjustment in the living allowance would be proper for liable parents. This might have the effect of reducing the amount of child support available to custodians. 31 Officials consider that consideration of all the factors which may determine a higher level of liability than that produced by the formula, should be carried out independently. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Termination of liability on the death of the liable parent When the liable parent has substantial assets, the liability should be forward assessed, as a debt of the estate before any testamentary disposition. Comment The law already provides for children to make a claim against the estate of a deceased parent when there has been a breach of that parent’s moral duty to maintain and support the child. To enact a provision as suggested would create a greater obligation for a parent not living with his/her children at the date of his/her death than exists for a parent whose children are living with him/her at that time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Adequacy of support within a marriage or long-term relationship All custodial parents, irrespective of marital status, should be able to obtain support from a benefit if the support received from a partner is inadequate. Their partners would then become liable for child support. Comment A custodian is specifically precluded from applying for child support if he or she is “living with the person from whom payment of child support is sought as the legal spouse of that person or in a relationship in the nature of marriage.” Family support and the independent family tax credit are paid fully to the principal caregiver. This means that many partners who stay at home to care for children do receive a payment in their own right. 32 It would be regarded by many as an unwarranted intrusion in people’s lives if the state were to become involved in the way in which families choose to allocate their financial resources within a marital relationship. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Relationship between assessed income and actual earnings in rural situations A number of rural women report that assessed income often has little relevance to the actual earnings of the liable parent. Comment The Child Support Act recognises that the use of taxable income may not produce an appropriate result in some situations. It does so by allowing for an application for departure from the formula in those situations. There is case precedent for departure from the formula where taxable income does not justly or equitably reflect financial ability to provide financial support. Recommendation Note that the Child Support Act 1991 already provides, through the departure provisions, for a liable parent’s true economic position to be taken into account in setting the level of child support. Issue: Liable parents who were granted “nil orders” under the former scheme Submission (13 – Des Eyre) The cases of liable parents who were granted “nil orders” by the Department of Social Welfare under the liable parent contribution scheme should be reconsidered. Comment This submission refers to those liable parents who were affected by the retrospective application of the Child Support Amendment Act 1993. The amendment was made to reflect the intention of Government, at the time of enactment of the Child Support Act 1991, that this legislation was to introduce a totally new child maintenance regime. However, through a drafting error it was possible for earlier administrative decisions to override the new legislation. 33 The provisions of the amendment act did not apply to any judgment given on the effect of the original legislation prior to the enactment of the amendment. Consideration was given to those who would be adversely affected by the retrospective nature of the amendment. They could apply to the Family Court if the assessment was inappropriate in their particular circumstances, or to Inland Revenue to make arrangements for payment of arrears. The Child Support Review 1994 Working Party further considered their situation. The Working Party concluded that the retrospective nature of the legislation was not universally appropriate, but that further “retroactive interference in the lives of these parents and children” could not be justified. Officials consider that since many people affected by the Act have adjusted to new arrangements it would be even more inequitable to create exceptions for some of them now. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Liability in respect of children “abducted” from New Zealand Submission (14 – Peter Shannon) There should be an exemption from liability when qualifying children are “abducted” from the country or other illegal means are used to facilitate their removal. The submitter believes that the Government is implicitly supporting an illegal activity by enforcing payment of child support when the qualifying children have been “abducted” from this country. The Child Support Act 1991 provides for the financial support of children when either or both parents do not live with those children. It is not concerned with issues relating to custody and access. The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is given effect in New Zealand through the Guardianship Amendment Act 1991. However, regardless of the outcome of an application under that Act in respect of a child(ren) removed from New Zealand, the Child Support Act places an absolute obligation on absent parents to support their children. That obligation is not removed or abated on grounds of “fault” of either parent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 34 Issue:What constitutes “income, earning capacity, property and financial resources” Submission (7 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc)) In relation to the ground which allows a departure from the formula assessment to be granted on the basis of the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of either parent or the child, clear guidelines are needed to simplify and reduce compliance costs, and to make the legislation simpler, fairer and easier to use. Comment The courts have considered this provision (section 105(2)(c)(i) of the Child Support Act 1991) on a number of occasions. Their decisions establish precedents for Review Officers to follow when granting a departure from a formula assessment 2 . Comment on the court decisions can be found in Family Law in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extend the coverage of the Child Support Act Submission (8 – Mary Speller) The Child Support Act should be extended to cover all parents who have a qualifying child in New Zealand. Comment To be liable to pay child support a person must be: • a parent of a qualifying child 3 ; and • a New Zealand citizen, or ordinarily resident in New Zealand or in a country with which New Zealand has entered into a child support reciprocal agreement. 2 Since 1 July 1994 custodians and liable parents have been able to ask the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make an administrative determination as the first step in the departure process. Any custodian or liable parent who is unhappy with an administrative determination may apply to the Courts for a departure order. 3 A qualifying child is one who is: • under 19 years of age; • not a married person; • not financially independent; • a New Zealand citizen, or is ordinarily resident in New Zealand. 35 A person is ordinarily resident in New Zealand if he or she: • has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand; • is personally present in New Zealand for an aggregate of 183 days in any 12- month period; or • is absent from New Zealand while in the service of the New Zealand Government. To do as this submission suggests could result in New Zealand attempting to apply its domestic law to residents of another country. Even if a child support assessment were to be made, it could be enforced only in a country with which New Zealand had a reciprocal agreement for the collection of administrative assessments. An alternative to a child support assessment may already exist. For example, if the liable parent resides in a country that is a signatory to the United Nations Convention for the Recovery of Maintenance Abroad, an order for maintenance may be sought from the courts. Such orders are enforceable in these countries. The following table shows the countries that are signatories to the Convention. 36 COUNTRIES WHO ARE SIGNATORIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RECOVERY ABROAD OF MAINTENANCE AlgeriaArgentinaAustriaAustralia BarbadosBelarusBelgiumBolivia Bosnia andBrazilBurkina FasoCambodia Herzegovina(Kampuchea) Cape VerdeCentral AfricanChileChina Republic CroatiaCubaCyprusCzech Republic DenmarkDominican RepublicEcuadorEl Salvador EstoniaFinlandFranceGermany GreeceGuatemalaHaitiHungary Ireland (Republic)IsraelItalyLuxembourg MacedoniaMexicoMonacoMorocco NetherlandsNew ZealandNigerNorway PakistanPhilippinesPolandPortugal Romania Slovak (Republic)SloveniaSpain Sri LankaSurinameSwedenSwitzerland TunisiaTurkeyUnited KingdomUruguay VaticanYugoslavia (Serbia And Montenegro) Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Extension of the child support enforcement provisions Submission (8 – Mary Speller) • The present provision that allows for the arrest of a liable parent believed to be leaving New Zealand to avoid his or her child support liability should be extended to liable parents with arrears. • It should be possible to arrest liable parents for reasons other than child support avoidance. Comment Officials do not consider that the existence of child support arrears is, of itself, sufficient reason to stop a liable parent from leaving the country. Over half of liable parents with child support arrears have entered into an arrangement with Inland Revenue Child Support to clear those arrears. The submission does not indicate in what other situation(s) that arrest to stop a liable parent leaving New Zealand would be appropriate. Officials cannot envisage any situation, other than where a person is intending to leave New Zealand to avoid payment of child support, that would warrant depriving a person of his or her liberty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 38 ISSUES RAISED BY INLAND REVENUE Clauses 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 26, 30, 36 and 37 Issue: Dates from which amending provisions are to apply Submissions (Matter raised by officials) Comment Because of the delay between approval for the introduction of this bill and the actual date of introduction, and consequently the delayed likely date of enactment, it is necessary to make some changes in applications dates to ensure that the law, when enacted, is not retrospective in effect. Recommendation That the revised implementation dates set out in the table below be included in this bill. CLAUSE NUMBER APPLICATION DATE (As currently drafted) ACTION REQUIRED 8 Child support year commencing on 1 April 1999 Delete subclause 8(2) – to apply from the day after the date of Royal assent (Subclause 1(2)). 11 1 April 1999To apply from 1 April 2001 12 1 April 1999To apply from 1 April 2000 13 1 April 1999To apply from 1 April 2000 17 Child support year that commenced on 1 April 1998, and subsequent years The reference in subclause 17(4) to 1 April 1998 should be amended to read: “1 April 1999” 4 . 20 1 April 1999Delete subclause 20(4) – to apply from the day after the date of Royal assent (Subclause 1(2)). Delete subclause 1(5). 21 1 April 1999Delete subclause 21(2) – to apply from the day after the date of Royal assent (Subclause 1(2)). 22 1 April 1999Delete subclause 22(2) – to apply from the day after the date of Royal assent (Subclause 1(2)). 30 1 April 1999 The reference in subclause 30(2) to 1 April 1999 should be amended to read: “1 April 2001”. 4 4 This effectively means that interest that would have been payable from 21 April 2000 will not be imposed. 39 Issue: A minor drafting amendment Submissions (Matter raised by officials) Comment A drafting change to section 208(a) of the Child Support Act 1991 was approved by Government in May 1997. However, that change was overlooked when the Child Support Amendment Act (No.3) 1997 was drafted and enacted. It is an offence under the Child Support Act if a person fails to notify the Commissioner that he or she has ceased to be eligible for an exemption from the payment of child support. It is not currently an offence if a person fails to notify the Commissioner that he or she has ceased to be eligible for an exemption from the payment of spousal maintenance. This anomaly can be corrected by amending the reference to “child support” in section 208(a) of the Child Support Act to “financial support” because financial support is inclusive of both child support and spousal maintenance. Recommendation That “child support” in section 208(a) of the Child Support Act 1991 be amended to “financial support”, to apply from the day following the date of Royal assent.

The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) be amended to provide a clear four-year time bar in relation to all taxes except where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has reasonable grounds to suspect a return to be fraudulent or wilfully misleading. 2. The burden of proof remain with the taxpayer, but that consideration be given to establishing a “ test” for the Inland Revenue Department to meet to ensure that only properly calculated and substantiated amended assessments are issued to complying taxpayers. 3. Section 81 of the TAA be amended to allow for access to personal information, but that this provision be linked to requests for information by the individual concerned under privacy principle 6. 4. An electronic footprint be inserted in the Inland Revenue Department’s files to record who accesses individual taxpayers’ details. 5. The Inland Revenue Department review its approach in respect of the care and management provisions in light of recent Court of Appeal decisions, with a view to amending its internal guidelines to make it clear the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can exercise discretion on a case by case basis. 6. The procedures for monitoring the delegation of the powers of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be reviewed. 7. With respect to the penalties regime: • a past record of “ good behaviour” be taken into account when deciding whether to impose a penalty • the Inland Revenue Department exercise a greater degree of flexibility when applying shortfall penalties • shortfall penalties not apply when it is determined that the taxpayer has made an inadvertent error. 8. The Inland Revenue Department develop a systems audit methodology in order to assess whether taxpayers are adopting a reasonable standard of care. 9. The Inland Revenue Department reinforce both publicly and internally that if a taxpayer or adviser has not interpreted legislation a penalty for unacceptable interpretation cannot apply. 10. The Government review the process by which assessments can be challenged, placing particular emphasis on assessing the merits of establishing a time limit on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue when addressing a taxpayer’s Notice of Response. I. 3I 4 11. The method by which use of money interest is calculated be reviewed to determine whether changes to the interest rates for overpayments and underpayments to reduce the differential between the rates are appropriate. 12. The Government review the whole area of write-offs and in doing so consider: • whether there should be a time limit on the reinstatement of a debt • whether, if the present policy is to continue, the term “ write- o ff" should be replaced by wording that more accurately describes the policy (for example “ provisional write-off") • whether it is necessary for the write-off provisions to be contained in the Inland Revenue Acts. 13. The Inland Revenue Department issue clear directions to taxpayers as to their options, rights and obligations with respect to repayment arrangements. 14. The ministerial approval thresholds for instalment arrangements and remissions be removed, but that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be required to provide a regular report to the Minister of Revenue outlining applications for remissions and instalments in excess of $100,000. 15. The Government review the preferential status of the Inland Revenue Department in liquidations. 16. The Inland Revenue Department re-establish a problem resolution service with experienced personnel who are committed to customer satisfaction outcomes. 17. The Inland Revenue Department ensure that the problem resolution service, once established, is well publicised. 18. The Inland Revenue Department advise all complainants, dissatisfied by the results of an internal inquiry, of their rights to appeal to an external agency. 19. The Government establish a specialist tax adviser position within the Office of the Ombudsman, with appropriate resources, to investigate matters of tax administration by the Inland Revenue Department. 20. The Inland Revenue Department investigate ways to preserve over the counter services in areas where it is closing offices, particularly in isolated areas. 21. The Inland Revenue Department enhance its monitoring of telephone services to ensure greater timeliness and accuracy of responses and that the department identify and remedy any skills deficiencies as a matter of priority. 5 I. 3I 22. The Inland Revenue Department take steps to enhance the timeliness and quality of its responses to written correspondence, and that the performance standard in the 1999/2000 Purchase Agreement of dealing with all correspondence within eight weeks of receipt be reviewed. 23. The Government consider moving the responsibility for drafting tax legislation back to the Parliamentary Counsel Office. 24. The Government consider whether establishing a board of directors to provide an oversight of the Inland Revenue Department’s operation of its powers is desirable. 25. The Inland Revenue Department implement, as a matter of priority, a nationally consistent training programme aimed at improving communication and customer service skills. 26. The Inland Revenue Department consider implementing a programme along similar lines to the Business and Parliament Trust, which would enable staff to build relationships with, and have greater exposure to, the business community. 27. The Inland Revenue Department establish a taxpayers’ charter to outline to taxpayers their rights and obligations in respect of the tax system. I. 3I 6 Introduction This inquiry was commenced amid growing public concern over the manner in which the Inland Revenue Department (the department) conducts its operations. It had always been our intention to conduct an inquiry of some nature into the workings of the department during this Parliament as a means of assessing the impact of, and holding the Government accountable for, the new compliance and penalties regime. However, given public perceptions that the department was at times too heavy-handed and inflexible in its dealings with taxpayers we decided that a wider review of the powers and operations of the department was necessary. We acknowledge that the collection of revenue from often reluctant taxpayers is not an easy task. We also realise that in most cases the department discharges its duties in a fair, ethical and professional manner. However, the evidence we received and heard indicates there are times when the department’s approach in its dealings with taxpayers has been less than exemplary. We are concerned that the reasons for the department’s occasional lapses in its duty to apply the law in a professional manner be identified and remedied. This is essential to maintain the integrity of and public confidence in the tax system. We consider that this report and our recommendations, if acted upon, will contribute in this regard. This report makes a number of recommendations to the Government and we note that the Government has announced an intention to undertake a number of reforms in the wake of our inquiry. However, given the wide scope of the inquiry and the relatively short time frame in which it was conducted, we have not been able to investigate fully all the issues which arise from the submissions we have received. Many of these issues raised substantive concerns which we feel warrant a more lengthy period of consideration. While this is the final report of this committee on the inquiry, we agreed that the best approach would be to highlight in this report the areas which we strongly consider need further investigation, and make suggestions for follow-up by the next Finance and Expenditure Committee and the Government. A number of individual taxpayers took the time to make submissions to us about their dealings and relationships with the department. We make no findings or recommendations in respect of specific cases detailed to us as our terms of reference and factors such as the secrecy provisions in the TAA precluded us from doing so. However, the value of individual submissions in giving us insights into the operations of the department on a number of levels cannot be overstated. The recommendations we make follow the experience of these taxpayers who took the trouble to make full and considered submissions to us. In a number of cases we drew issues relating to specific cases to the attention of the department for comment or follow-up action. Many submitters to the inquiry had genuine and deeply- held grievances with the way they have been treated by the department. 7 I. 3I Several made appearances before us at considerable emotional cost. We greatly appreciate their input. Our thanks go to them. Focus of report: principal issues of concern We received a large number of submissions on this inquiry and although many submitters detailed to us quite different experiences with the department, several themes emerged from the public hearings. The key points to emerge are as follows: • The underlying structure of the penalties regime is sound. However, the rates of penalty are excessive in some cases and should be reduced, and there is a need for greater flexibility on the part of the department in its operation of the regime, without unduly compromising fairness and equity to all taxpayers. • The importance of the perception by taxpayers that the tax law and its administration is fair and appropriate. Improvements are needed in this area. • More checks and balances on the department’s exercise of its powers are required to enhance the integrity of the tax system. • The first principle of the department’s debt management practices should be consistent with the statutory responsibility to collect the highest net revenue over time, not collection at any cost. • The department’s debt management practices should include early warning systems and involve more senior personnel who are and can be seen as independent and impartial. • There is a need for an internal system for the resolution of taxpayer complaints and problems to prevent problems escalating and being brought to the attention of the Ombudsman. • While we do not find that the department’s structure and approach in its dealings with taxpayers is fundamentally flawed, there is a need for a cultural shift in the department to reflect a greater customer oriented ethos. This shift must be driven from the senior management team. Committee procedure The membership of the committee, the procedures for beginning this inquiry and hearing evidence, and the terms of reference for our inquiry are set out in Appendix A. A list of submissions received is set out in Appendix B. During the course of the inquiry, we encountered several issues relating to procedures for committee inquiries in general. We wish to draw these issues to the attention of the House. Natural justice provisions applied Several submitters, when describing their experiences with the department made serious allegations against the department and individual officers. Examples of these ranged from general comments about the I. 3I 8 professionalism of officers and the manner in which they dealt with the submitters, to serious allegations of misconduct or conflicts of interest. We considered that in order for the inquiry to be requisitely thorough it was necessary for us to receive submissions containing such allegations without requiring that they be removed. We had an obligation, where a person was named and where an allegation had the potential to seriously damage that person’s reputation, to apply the provisions of natural justice. There are set procedures for providing an opportunity for those against whom allegations are made to respond1. In essence the person concerned is informed of the allegation and given an opportunity to respond. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) took the opportunity to respond in writing on behalf of officers of the department who had allegations made against them. The department was provided with all publicly released submissions and provided written responses to many submissions prior to oral evidence being heard. Allegation of criminal wrongdoing not pursued Committees are prohibited from investigating an allegation of crime against a named individual without the express authority of the House. One submitter alleged that an officer of the department altered a document which was subsequently used in Court to commence bankruptcy proceedings against the submitter. It was alleged a letter had been altered to include advice regarding the appeal options available to the submitter. This information, it was alleged, was missing from the original document and would have provided grounds for the submitter to appeal a departmental decision, which may have prevented the subsequent bankruptcy. We subsequently received evidence from the officer concerned who denied all knowledge of the second document. The prohibition on us under Standing Order 206 means that we cannot take this issue any further. However, we understand this matter has been referred to the Police. Statutory secrecy and select committee powers We had to consider whether the committee’s powers to call for persons, papers and records2 could override the statutory secrecy provisions contained in the TAA. This is a broad power derived from section 242 (1) of the Legislature Act 1908. The public interest embodied in these powers is that committees should have the power to call for all information that is relevant to the matter they are considering. We also had to consider the principles of natural justice in relation to the department’s right to respond to allegations made in the submissions. We recognised that it was just as important for the department to counter inaccurate or incorrect information. At issue was the extent to which the 9 I. 3I 1 These are contained in Standing Order 226. 2 Standing Order 203 provides committees with these powers. department could disclose information which is covered by the secrecy provisions of the TAA. A further question about the application of the secrecy provisions to the department’s employees making submissions in their personal capacity was also a concern for us. The effect of section 81 (1) of the TAA is to impose a statutory duty on departmental officers to maintain the secrecy of all matters related to the Inland Revenue Acts. The only exceptions to this “ fundamental obligation” are communications “ for the purpose of carrying into effect” the Inland Revenue Acts. Section 81 (3) specifically prohibits officers from the requirement to produce or divulge anything to a court or tribunal “ except where it is necessary to do so for the purpose of carrying into effect” the Inland Revenue Acts. However, the Solicitor-General’s advice is that this section can have no relevance to a select committee which is neither a court or a tribunal. Since 1995 there has been imposed on the department a legislative responsibility to protect the integrity of the tax system (this is contained in section 6 of the TAA). This responsibility specifically includes the rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential. This confidentiality has long been recognised as an important element for the effective working of the tax system. Against this background we recognised the primary area of potential difficulty was the ability of the department to respond to individual taxpayer complaints and allegations of misconduct. Advice of the Solicitor-General and the Clerk of the House of Representatives The advice of both the Solicitor-General and the Clerk of the House of Representatives was that as a principle the secrecy provisions should prevail and that no person can look to the committee to be released from his or her statutory obligations. In effect, the committee has an obligation to obey the law. It is up to the committee to determine a way to reconcile its desire for information with any secrecy provisions that might apply. The Commissioner is still bound by the duty of non-disclosure in respect of taxpayer confidentiality. We agreed that while we were not strictly bound by the law to observe the secrecy provisions, we still had an obligation to take account of them. However, the Commissioner could obviously comment on matters which had already been placed in the public arena by submitters. The secrecy obligation can only apply to that which is secret. We concluded it was the responsibility of the Chairperson to guide witnesses away from issues considered irrelevant to the inquiry, being outside our terms of reference, or which could cause difficulties in terms of the secrecy provisions. As a rule of thumb we adopted the principle that the department would be asked to respond to submissions in a way that corrected errors of fact or omission or to requests for information on a general or policy level without revealing taxpayer specific details. In this way we found that we were able to receive responses to the allegations I. 3I 10 made in submissions and our requests to the department for information without unduly compromising the secrecy provisions. The option of hearing and receiving evidence in private and secret was always open to us and we availed ourselves of this option during the course of the inquiry. Adverse findings This report contains findings with respect to the conduct of the Commissioner and the department which we have identified as being adverse pursuant to Standing Order 245. These findings were forwarded in draft form to the Commissioner to give him an opportunity to make a submission to us on them. The Commissioner made a submission to us on the findings which we took into account before presenting this report. 11 I. 3I Term of reference A: To review the powers of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to assess and collect income tax pursuant to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and other relevant Acts and to assess whether these powers are justified Overview of the Commissioner’s powers The primary objective of the department, as contained in section 6a (3) of the TAA, is “ to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law” . In order to do this, the Commissioner has been granted wide powers under the TAA. To enable the Commissioner to carry out his tax administration functions he is able to delegate his powers to officers of the department. Information-gathering powers The Commissioner’s information-gathering powers include the power to access land and buildings, the power to request information in writing and the power to require a person to give evidence under oath before the Commissioner or to seek an inquiry before a District Court Judge. The power of the Commissioner to access any property is only restricted in the case of private dwellings. Before the Commissioner can enter a private dwelling without the occupier’s consent a warrant must be obtained from a judicial officer. We understand that it is very rare for the department to make a formal written demand for access to someone’s premises. In most cases the prior agreement of the occupier is obtained. Assessment powers The Commissioner is required to assess the taxable income and income tax liability of all taxpayers. If a taxpayer does not file a return, the Commissioner may make an assessment of the amount on which the Commissioner believes tax ought to be imposed and of the amount of such tax. This is known as a default assessment. If, after an initial assessment is issued, the Commissioner audits a taxpayer and determines that the income as originally returned should be adjusted, the Commissioner has the authority to issue amended assessments. Adjustments can be made at any time with the taxpayer’s agreement. However, if agreement is not forthcoming the Commissioner must follow the disputes resolution process. Generally, the Commissioner may alter an assessment only within four years from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer provided the return. However, if the Commissioner considers that the tax return filed by the taxpayer is fraudulent or wilfully misleading or does not mention income of a particular nature or derived from a particular source, the Commissioner can amend a return at any time. I. 3I 12 Powers to impose penalties and grant relief from payment Under legislation the Commissioner is able to apply penalties for non- payment or under-payment of tax and is also able to remit, write-off and defer payment of tax subject to conditions. We examine the Commissioner’s powers and operations in this regard under term of reference B in this report. Statutory powers generally appropriate While the Commissioner’s powers are extensive, we consider that, by and large, these powers are appropriate for the role the Commissioner is required to undertake. The department is bound to enforce compliance on the part of all taxpayers. Not to do so would seriously damage the integrity of the tax system and undermine the system of voluntary compliance. The extent of the Commissioner’s powers is necessary to ensure that reluctant taxpayers meet their obligations. Those powers ensure that taxpayers who willingly pay their tax are not disadvantaged or required to pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden. The powers of the Commissioner are similar to those conferred upon tax collectors in similar jurisdictions, such as, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, the department’s powers are not excessive when compared to other State agencies which operate in revenue collection and enforcement environments. While the powers of the Commissioner are generally appropriate we do consider that some steps need to be taken with respect to the penalties regime and the Commissioner’s powers to enter into arrangements with errant taxpayers. We comment further on these matters later in the report. We considered various aspects relating to the powers of the Commissioner and make the following comments and recommendations. Manner in which powers exercised problematic Many submissions to the inquiry suggest that it is the manner in which the department exercises its powers rather than the extent of those powers which is at issue. The New Zealand Law Society (NZLS) points out that the tax paying community’s perception of the way in which the powers are exercised is almost as important as the reality of the extent of those powers. Voluntary compliance is a fundamental feature of the tax system. Taxpayers must believe that the tax system is fair and reasonable and that disputes will be dealt with in a fair and impartial manner. While we acknowledge that examples of the department misapplying its powers are relatively rare, when they do occur they are a significant issue for the taxpayers involved. During our hearings we heard from a number of taxpayers whose dealings with the department caused them great emotional distress and financial hardship. While fault was not always one- sided, the department in our view sometimes dealt with these taxpayers in a heavy-handed and dictatorial fashion. When the department’s officers act 13 I. 3I towards taxpayers in such a way it can only serve to undermine the integrity of the tax system. We note there have been a few recent decisions of the Courts and the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) which demonstrate the misapplication of the department’s powers. For example, a very recent decision of the TRA3 contains a number of severe criticisms of the department’s performance. Judge Willy refers to a “ saga of obfuscation and delay on the part of the Commissioner” . He states that the Commissioner failed in his duty to be fair in the exercise of his tax collecting function. Criticisms of the behaviour of the department’s personnel were also made in a recent High Court decision4. It should be noted that both cases are under appeal. The most recent report of the department on the health of tax administration5, contains survey information that indicates that a relatively high proportion of taxpayers believe that the department targets its enforcement action unfairly on “ ordinary people” rather than those who pose the most significant risk to the revenue base. This may be a consequence of perceptions that the department is heavy-handed in the use of its powers in its dealings with smaller taxpayers, especially small businesses. We can understand how this perception has arisen. It is our view that the recommendations contained in this report and the policy announcements made by the Government in the wake of our inquiry will put in place a set of meaningful checks and balances in the relationship between the department and taxpayers, which should help address the negative perceptions now in place. Time bar period should be more comprehensive We share the concerns of the NZLS that the exceptions to the four-year time-bar period are too wide. The time-bar period for the Commissioner to issue an amended assessment is inapplicable if the Commissioner believes that the tax return filed by the taxpayer is fraudulent or misleading or does not mention gross income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source, and in respect of which a tax return is required to be provided. These limitations can result in a taxpayer having an open-ended and potentially crippling exposure to an unknown tax liability. Additionally, situations can arise where a taxpayer has the onus of proof in relation to an assessment by the department but no longer has the necessary records to successfully dispute that assessment. The TAA imposes a seven-year record retention requirement on most taxpayers. We do not consider that the department should be empowered to issue an amended assessment beyond the period for which the taxpayer is required by the law to retain records, unless the Commissioner suspects fraud or wilfully misleading non-disclosure. The open-ended nature of the Commissioner’s power to I. 3I 14 3 TRA No. 93/013 4 New Zealand Wool Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,082 5 Inland Revenue Health Report, December 1998 issue amended assessments is too wide, especially given the strict nature of the penalties regime. We recommend to the Government that the TAA be amended to provide a clear four-year time-bar in relation to all taxes except where the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to suspect a return to be fraudulent or wilfully misleading. Burden of proof The New Zealand tax system is based on taxpayer self-assessment and voluntary compliance. Since the taxpayer has the primary access to information used in preparing a tax return, the burden of proof falls on the taxpayer. This is consistent with the rationale behind self-assessment and is the practice in both Australia and the United Kingdom. We received a significant number of submissions calling for the burden of proof to be reversed. Several of these related to disputes with the department over amended assessments and highlighted difficulties in ascertaining from the department the basis on which the assessments had been made. Submitters also pointed to an unwillingness on the part of the department to reassess tax liabilities with the taxpayers concerned. NZLS and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ) also recommend the burden of proof be reversed. NZLS maintains that, given the high level of disclosure which is required of taxpayers under the self-assessment system, the department already has access to considerable taxpayer information. NZLS submits that because of the increased obligations on taxpayers to disclose information to the department, and the increased range of penalties which can apply, the burden of proof should be reversed, except in cases where taxpayers are clearly not complying. NZLS recommends that where a taxpayer has complied with the law, but the department seeks to amend that assessment, the onus should be on the department to prove that liability—at least to a " prima facie" standard. This would greatly assist in achieving a perception of fairness in the tax laws. ICANZ is of a similar view. It notes the increased obligations on taxpayers and the increased range of penalties and recommends the burden of proof be shifted to the Crown, except as regards the provision of information. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (the Committee of Experts), however, supports the placement of the onus of proof on taxpayers, except for civil penalties for evasion. The main justification for this is, as noted above, that taxpayers have more information about their tax liabilities and are, therefore, in a better position to assess their own tax liability than the department. This approach is consistent with the taxpayer’s obligation to determine correctly the amount of tax payable which is central to the policy of self-assessment. The Committee of Experts, however, recognises the potential for an undue burden being placed on taxpayers who want to refute an amended assessment. 15 I. 3I The Committee of Experts notes that if a taxpayer is able to prove on the balance of probabilities that the department’s assessment is excessive by at least a certain amount, the court should be able to reduce the department’s assessment by that amount. The Committee of Experts recommends the law be amended to provide expressly for this. The department submits that any proposal to shift the onus of proof to the Commissioner would need to ensure that risks to the revenue are minimised. In practical terms this would involve implementation of safeguards to ensure the Commissioner had access to information regarding taxpayers’ affairs sufficient to sustain the burden of proof. The department argues that to ensure the Commissioner had the necessary information, record-keeping requirements would need to be increased, increased penalties for failure to keep records would be needed, and audit activity would need to increase. These requirements would increase administration costs for the department and compliance costs for the taxpayer. We note that recent legislative changes have been made to the burden of proof in the United States, shifting the burden from the taxpayer to the Secretary to the Treasury. The shift only applies to individuals and small businesses. Taxpayers must also satisfy a number of conditions to ensure relevant information is provided to the Secretary before the burden of proof is shifted. As the changes are relatively new, there is little information on how the new rules are affecting taxpayers. However, it is probable that satisfying the preconditions will be both costly and unpalatable for taxpayers and will outweigh the benefits from having the burden of proof shifted. On balance most of us agree the onus of proof should remain with the taxpayer. We are not convinced, however, by the argument that the taxpayer is the only one with all the information available to assess his or her potential tax liability. The department has broad powers to collect information relevant to determining the liability of a taxpayer and has almost unlimited access to records during a taxpayer audit. We have taken account of the many examples given to us by taxpayers who have been confronted with amended assessments of apparently insupportable amounts and the subsequent difficulties encountered in trying to understand the basis for the assessment. We agree that if the burden of proof is to remain with the taxpayer, there must be a test on the department to ensure that only properly calculated and substantiated assessments are issued to taxpayers who comply with their obligations. This could take the form of a “ prima facie” standard as recommended by NZLS or the legislative amendment proposed by the Committee of Experts. We recommend to the Government that the burden of proof should remain with the taxpayer but that consideration be given to establishing a “test” for the department to meet to ensure that only properly calculated and substantiated amended assessments are issued to complying taxpayers. I. 3I 16 Some of us consider that the burden of proof should be placed on the Commissioner. In civil matters where a debt is asserted, it is up to the party making the assertion to prove the debt on the balance of probabilities. Some of us can see no reason why the same burden should not apply to the Commissioner. We agree with the NZLS that the reversed burden of proof on tax matters results in a “ guilty until proven innocent” approach and coupled with the harsh penalties regime means that taxpayers can be placed in intolerable positions trying to refute positions taken by the department which may have no substance. We consider that this is a matter worthy of further investigation by the next Finance and Expenditure Committee. Ability of taxpayers to access their personal files The secrecy provisions of section 81 of the TAA under which the department must operate make it difficult for taxpayers to get access to information held about them by the department. When the burden of proof rests with the taxpayer, it is doubly difficult for taxpayers to refute tax liability assessments if they cannot access this information. The Privacy Commissioner submits section 81 of the TAA should be amended to allow individuals access to information held by the department about them. The need for secrecy is not in dispute, but the Privacy Commissioner considers that where this is in conflict with the right of individuals to get information held about themselves, then the provision should go no further than is required to meet the need for secrecy. To highlight this conflict, the Privacy Commissioner provided us with examples of complaints which his office was not able to pursue because the taxpayers concerned were denied access to information held about them by the department. Privacy principle 6 provides for individuals to access personal information held about them. The principle behind this is the recognition of an individual’s entitlement to some degree of personal autonomy. At the very least it allows an individual an opportunity to correct information held about them which might be inaccurate. In terms of the Privacy Act 1993, section 7 (2) (a) provides that nothing in principle 6 derogates from any provision contained in any Act which imposes a prohibition or restriction on the availability of personal information. Section 81 is such a provision and therefore prevails over the access rights contained in principle 6. For the Privacy Commissioner this means that he is unable to take some complaints any further and they are referred to the Ombudsman to investigate the department’s exercise of its discretion on whether or not to release information for the purpose of carrying into effect the Inland Revenue Acts. Section 81 does provide for exceptions and it is the view of the Privacy Commissioner that a further exception be added to allow for access to personal information. In recommending this, the Privacy Commissioner suggests that any amendment be worded so that it refers to disclosure of information by the department in response to a request by the individual concerned under privacy principle 6. We agree. A more general exception 17 I. 3I might lead to inroads into the obligation of secrecy. The proposed amendment would also ensure the procedural provisions of the Privacy Act 1993, the review provisions involving the Privacy Commissioner and the Complaints Review Tribunal, come into play. Disclosure, however, should not be absolute. Safeguards would be required to prevent disclosure of information from an informant, or to ensure the information is not being coerced for use by a third party. We think a commonsense approach is required in this situation. The justification that a taxpayer needs to be assured that all his or her details are kept confidential by the department should not apply when it is the taxpayer who is seeking the information. As a further protection, the Privacy Commissioner recommends that an electronic footprint be incorporated into the department’s files. This is done in Australia and acts as a deterrent to unauthorised disclosure. The Australian Tax Office requires the mandatory use by its officers of an electronic technical support system. The purpose of which is, inter alia, to manage casework, monitor performance, and to meet the standards of confidentiality which are set out in the Taxpayers’ Charter. We recommend to the Government that section 81 of the TAA be amended to allow for access to personal information but that this provision be linked to requests for information by the individual concerned under privacy principle 6. We recommend to the Government that an electronic footprint be inserted in the department’s files to record who accesses individual taxpayers’ details. Operation of care and management provisions needs assessing Several submissions raised questions as to the extent of the Commissioner’s powers under the “ care and management” provisions in section 6a of the TAA. Care and management involves managerial discretion as to the use of statutory powers in a cost effective manner. In 1994 the Organisational Review Committee, chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson, addressed the practicalities of operating the tax system with limited resources and the fundamental importance of voluntary compliance to tax collection. The care and management provisions are the result of recommendations of the Organisational Review Committee. Section 6a (3) of the TAA encapsulates the provisions. It reads: In collecting the taxes com m itted to the C om m issioner’s charge, and notwithstanding anything in the Inland R evenue Acts, it is the duty o f the C om m issioner to collect over tim e the highest net revenue that is practicable w ithin the law having regard to— I. 3I 18 (a) the resources available to the Comm issioner; and (b) the im portance o f prom oting compliance, especially voluntary com pliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c) the com pliance costs incurred by taxpayers. The legislation recognises that it is not possible for the Commissioner, acting with limited resources, to collect every cent of due taxes. NZLS points out that uncertainty has arisen as to the precise scope of section 6a. The department exercises its discretion at the strategic and policy levels. It is not exercised by individual tax officers in respect of individual taxpayers. The department argues that this is because the duty to collect the highest net revenue operates at the macro level of the tax system and because consistency in the use of discretion is necessary to maintain the integrity of the tax system. In two recent Court of Appeal judgments there has been specific judicial comment on the department’s application of the care and management provisions6. These clearly indicate that the discretion in section 6a should be exercised by the department at both the general policy level and at the level of specific tax disputes. By adopting this approach the department would have increased flexibility to settle debts. We consider that it is important that the status and effect of the care and management provisions be determined. While we note that there are potential dangers from the point of view of consistency of approach in operating discretion on a case by case basis, we agree with ICANZ, NZLS and other submitters that the department’s current interpretation of the provisions is too restrictive from both a legal and policy perspective. Consistency can be achieved through the development of guidelines together with a regular review of the exercise of that discretion. We note that the department acknowledges that changes need to be made to its approach to the settlement of tax issues after assessment. We recommend that the department review its approach in respect of the care and management provisions in light of recent Court of Appeal decisions, with a view to amending its internal guidelines to make it clear the Commissioner can exercise discretion on a case by case basis. We do not consider, however, that an amendment to the TAA to deal explicitly with the issue is necessary. Delegation of authority not monitored appropriately Section 7 of the TAA allows the Commissioner to delegate any or all of his powers to officers of the department and we have concerns that these delegated powers are applied inconsistently. Clearly the delegation of powers is necessary to properly administer the tax system. Most powers are delegated to functions, not to individual officers. NZLS points out that the greatest potential cause of inappropriate exercise of the department’s powers is inappropriate delegation. ICANZ suggests that it is not 19 I. 3I 6 CIR v Auckland Gas Company Limited (1999) 19 NZTC 15,027 and Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075. uncommon for officers to exercise delegated powers in a manner inconsistent with the Commissioner’s stated policies. Evidence we received from taxpayers supports this assertion. For example, the policies for instalment arrangements are inconsistently applied across offices, with some offices being overly restrictive relative to the department’s stated policies. Having policies applied inconsistently between units or offices of the department creates uncertainty for taxpayers. Furthermore, as a general principle, taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated the same. We accept that at times it may be appropriate for officers to use their discretion when applying delegated authority. However, when delegated powers are used in a manner inconsistent with stated policies the reasons for such a departure should be recorded and reported to the Commissioner. The Commissioner should then report regularly to the Minister of Revenue (the Minister) and Parliament on the exercise of delegated powers. We recommend that the Government review the procedures for monitoring the delegation of the powers of the Commissioner. I. 3I 20 Term of reference B: To review the Inland Revenue Department’s application of the compliance and penalties regime established under the tax acts, including the process by which and the rate at which use of money interest is set, and also the simultaneous application of late payment penalties Overview The compliance and penalties regime has been in place for two years, generally effective for income periods from 1 April 1997. The aim of the compliance and penalties reform was to correct deficiencies in the previous provisions and to tighten the legislative structure of taxpayer obligations and penalties for non-compliance with tax law. The policy objective behind the compliance and penalties regime is to promote voluntary compliance and to encourage all taxpayers to pay their taxes on time. For the legislation to be fair and equitable to all taxpayers it must be based on the premise that most taxpayers are honest and make a genuine attempt to honour their taxation responsibilities. Taxpayers in similar situations should be treated similarly. The standards that taxpayers are expected to meet, and the penalties applied to them, should recognise the differing circumstances and abilities of individual taxpayers. Sanctions should be consistent with the seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the offender. There is a delicate balance that must be struck between maximising voluntary compliance and not creating a perception that the regime is being applied too harshly. The public good argument in favour of taxation is jeopardised if compliance can only be achieved under the threat of severe penalties and enforcement action. There is a risk that applying the regime too harshly could in effect be counter-productive in ensuring the compliance of some taxpayers. It is the vast majority of taxpayers who attempt to comply voluntarily who ensure the tax system is efficient and effective. The cornerstone of New Zealand’s tax system is self-assessment. We would like to stress the difference between voluntary compliance and self- assessment. New Zealanders do not pay tax voluntarily, we have a self- assessment system and we pay tax under the threat of penalties if we do not. Under self-assessment, taxpayers determine their own tax liability, notify that in a return to the department and pay the tax. The department’s role is to audit those calculations. Self-assessment itself is an example of a trade-off between compliance costs and administration costs. Its basis lies in the fact that taxpayers have more information about their own affairs than the department does. The assumption is the taxpayer is in a much better position than the department to assess their tax liabilities. The compliance and penalties provisions apply across virtually all tax types. The provisions cover interest, civil penalties, criminal penalties and remissions. The civil penalties are late filing, non-electronic filing, late payment and shortfall penalties. The previous penalty rules consisted 21 I. 3I mainly of two types of penalties; additional tax and penal tax. Additional tax was applied to late payments of tax, and the rate varied according to the tax type. Penal tax of up to 300 percent of the deficient tax applied in cases of evasion or fraud, or when the taxpayer failed to account for deduction such as PAYE deductions. It was considered that this regime had its faults and a more comprehensive regime was needed to redress the perceived problems. The previous Finance and Expenditure Committee stated in the commentary on the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill that it was concerned the department might apply the new standards too stringently. The committee voiced a concern that for “ ordinary” taxpayers there is a risk that the department may impose penalties in circumstances where the taxpayer’s conduct is not in fact exceptionable or in situations where an ordinary taxpayer clearly misunderstands the ramifications of what is or is bound to become, a legally complex piece of legislation. A recent report from the Commissioner to the Minister of Revenue on the health of the tax administration acknowledges the compliance and penalties regime as a pressure point:7 A material proportion o f business taxpayers are either not aware o f the new com pliance and penalties regim e (CPR) or, o f those that are aware, have negative attitudes about its fairness. This represents a pressure point to the departm ent in that the behavioural shift that the change in penalties was designed to effect may not be achieved for those taxpayers who are not aware of the new rules. A large number of submissions comment that the penalties regime is too harsh or the department is applying the penalties too harshly. NZLS notes that the absence of any discretion given to the department in the application of penalties means that in many situations the department is forced to impose penalties where the circumstances may dictate that it is not in fact the most appropriate course of action. We considered each of the civil penalties in turn and have the following comments and recommendations. Late filing penalty The tax system now imposes a penalty onto those taxpayers who file a late tax return. In the case of income tax returns there is a standard penalty of $50 for late filing. This rises to $250 if the net income of the entity filing the return exceeds $100,000, and $500 if the net income of the entity filing the return exceeds $1 million. We do not consider that an adjustment to the late filing penalty is required. Non-electronic filing penalty Under the 1998 tax simplification legislation, employers are no longer required to file a PAYE reconciliation, but they are required to file a schedule of tax deductions from employees’ wages on a monthly basis. I. 3I 22 7 Inland Revenue, Health Report, December 1998 Employer monthly schedules are fundamental to the operation of the new simplified tax system, so it is appropriate to impose a penalty if the employer does not file in electronic form. Section 139 of the TAA imposes a penalty on employers who do not file the schedules in a prescribed format. There are exemptions in the Act from filing electronically for some employers. The penalty is the greater of $250 or $1 for each person employed at any time during the month to which the employer monthly schedule relates. The penalty will be imposed automatically by FIRST, the department’s computer system. We are not recommending any change to the non-electronic filing penalty. Late payment penalty The late payment penalty is intended to enforce payment of taxes by the due date. It is designed to support efficient collection of revenue through voluntary compliance. Under the present rules a late payment penalty of five percent is imposed if the payment of the tax is not made by the due date. After that, incremental penalties of two percent each month are charged on the amount outstanding (excluding interest but including earlier unpaid penalties). Late payment penalties are not charged on amounts outstanding of $100 or less. Over this threshold the penalties are imposed automatically by FIRST. Section 183 b of the TAA provides for 60 percent of the initial late payment penalty to be cancelled if an arrangement is entered into on or before the payment due date. The Committee of Experts stated in its report that, " The committee endorses the reasons for the late payment penalty, and considers it inappropriate to depart from giving taxpayers incentives to pay their tax on time. However, the penalty should have less of an impact." 8 A number of submissions held similar views. ICANZ submits that there be no penalty for short term defaults of up to a month, the initial five percent penalty be reduced to two percent and the incremental late payment penalty be reduced from two percent to one percent. Many submissions comment that the rate of the late payment penalties is excessive. Others claim that the compounding effect of the penalty was too harsh, and that many taxpayers are unaware of the compounding penalty. In their view, the incremental penalty, when considered in conjunction with use of money interest, imposes an effective penalty necessary to ensure compliance. The department suggests that delaying the imposition of the late payment penalty for 30 days could entice many taxpayers to delay paying by 30 days from the due date. The due date for payment would effectively become the day before the late payment penalty begins. To avoid taxpayers deferring payment in this way, interest for use of money could be charged. The department believes this would ensure that taxpayers had an incentive to pay and enter into instalment arrangements during this 30- 23 I. 3I 8 Report o f Committee of Tax Experts on Tax Compliance, 1998. day period. The department suggests that the risk of deferral could be reduced slightly if the initial late payment penalty is imposed, then remitted if full payment of the outstanding tax and interest is made within 30 days. Delaying the imposition of late payment penalties might have positive spin-off effects in other areas such as compliance cost reduction, return filing and debt collection. In this way, compliance costs for taxpayers and, possibly, administrative costs of the department could be reduced. It would also represent a more commercial approach to payment of tax. These benefits would have to be balanced against the risk of significant deferral of tax payments. This delay would have no effect on the debt collection process, as the tax would still be outstanding even though the penalty has not been imposed. We note that the Government considers that an incremental application of the initial late payment penalty has merit and is proposing a policy change along these lines. We welcome this initiative. The objective of the incremental late payment penalty is to provide a clear, continuing incentive to comply. The department submits that because the late payment penalty is the principal method by which the Government ensures payment of assessed tax it must be a significant penalty. The rate must exceed the borrowing costs faced by taxpayers, otherwise some may decide to defer payment. Following evidence to our inquiry the Government has announced it is to consider lowering the incremental two percent late payment penalty to one percent per month. We fully endorse this policy change. Reducing the incremental penalty, which in our view is excessive, will increase the fairness and the integrity of the tax system and it will reduce pressure on processes used to mitigate imposition of the incremental penalty such as disputes procedures and remission requests. Shortfall penalties Shortfall penalties replaced the penal tax system two years ago. The department must consider whether to impose a shortfall penalty if a taxpayer pays less tax than that which is due and the rate of a shortfall penalty is a percentage of the tax shortfall. The rate of the penalty depends on the category of fault. There are five categories of fault: I. 3I 24 Penalty Percentage of resulting tax shortfall Lack of reasonable care 20% Unacceptable interpretation 20% Gross carelessness 40% Abusive tax position 100% Tax evasion or similar acts 150% These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed. A taxpayer does, however, have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty. Many problems experienced by taxpayers in the area of shortfall penalties occur due to the department’s application of the lack of reasonable care and unacceptable interpretation penalties. Lack of reasonable care The purpose of the lack of reasonable care penalty is to increase voluntary compliance. The standard is the cornerstone of the penalties regime which requires all taxpayers to act reasonably in the conduct of their tax affairs. The test of reasonable care is whether a taxpayer of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability or likelihood the prospect that an act (or failure to act) would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all the circumstances. The Committee of Experts agreed that a tax system, based on self-assessment, requires an effective statutory penalties regime to provide taxpayers with appropriate incentives to comply. We recognise that in the previous select committee’s report on the compliance and penalties regime, the committee was very aware of the problems that could arise due to the application of the lack of reasonable care test. ICANZ notes in its submission that it had sent a memorandum to the department outlining examples of where this test had been applied inappropriately, and where it thought improvements could be made. ICANZ then refers to an internal departmental memorandum published in the Taxation Information Bulletin on 10 June 1998. It explains the reasonable care standard and is the department’s operational guideline when applying the standard: T he Standard recognises taxpayers’ varying abilities and reflects a balance betw een the need for returns to be correct and the recognition o f the difficulties taxpayers may face in ensuring they are correct. Reasonable care is not intended to be overly onerous to taxpayers and does n o t m ean perfection. C ircum stances that m ay be taken into account when determ ining w hether a taxpayer has exercised reasonable care include: • the com plexity o f the law and the transaction (the need to balance the com plexity o f the law w ith the category o f taxpayer) • the m ateriality o f the shortfall (consideration m ust be given not only to the nature o f the shortfall, but also the size o f the shortfall in relation to the taxpayer) • the difficulty and expense o f taking the precaution (consider whether the types o f controls in place are com m ensurate with the size and nature of the taxpayer) • the age, health and background of the taxpayer • the b u sin ess’s record keeping practices (com m ensurate with the size and nature o f the business and the internal controls). We are encouraged to note that the department subsequently put into place a number of administrative changes which fully or largely resolved many of the problems which ICANZ had raised regarding the application of the lack of reasonable care standard. However, inconsistencies in the 25 I. 3I application of the reasonable care standard continue to occur and this is a concern. NZLS suggests the need for consistency in the application of the penalties regime to ensure that taxpayers do not have a negative perception of the regime. There is obviously considerable potential for some subjectivity in the application of the penalties regime and NZLS suggested that we review the guidelines that have been developed by the department to achieve consistency. We have listened to many submissions where consistency has been an area of concern and we consider that it would be advantageous for the next Finance and Expenditure Committee in conjunction with the Government’s post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties regime to also review the guidelines the department has put in place to guide the department’s officers in their application of the regime. A number of submitters believe that a penalties regime needs to remain in place, but that the existing penalties regime is harsh. Most submitters recognise the need for a penalties regime to act as an incentive for paying taxes. The major area of concern in the penalties regime involves the many cases where penalties are being applied on the average law abiding taxpayer unreasonably. For example, Nigel Smith and Associates provided us with the following case study: A client had a business o f com m ercial letting o f prem ises. The lessees questioned the lessors on the m arket value o f the rent being charged. The client obtained a market value rental and found that they had been overcharging the client. W hen this was established the lesso r passed a credit note adjusting the rent and G ST charged on it. The lessor claim ed the adjustm ent in the same G ST return as the lessee adjusted theirs using the credit note. A lthough no revenue was lost Inland R evenue im posed a 20% lack o f reasonable care penalty on the basis that the lesso r w as on a paym ents basis and would not accept that the crediting that w ould have arose constituted a payment. The solicitor for the departm ent advised us that they w ere required to im pose the penalty as a m istake had occurred and that they had no pow er otherw ise not to do so. On this interpretation every little m istake w ould be subject to the penalty. PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that the shortfall penalties regime should be amended to ensure that taxpayers are not penalised for honest or inadvertent mistakes. Unless the department is more willing to accept that taxpayers can make honest errors and is prepared to allow a greater degree of latitude in applying the shortfall penalties regime, the integrity of the tax system will be eroded. Although a small proportion of taxpayers are intentionally non-compliant, and a reasonably tough penalties regime is required to dissuade them from abusing the tax system at the expense of honest taxpayers, most taxpayers try diligently to meet their tax obligations. Many experience difficulty with the complexity and volume of their responsibilities. This sentiment was shared by many other submitters seeking more discretion in the application of the penalties regime. We have noted the Government’s intention to undertake a post- implementation review of the penalties provisions. When undertaking this we recommend that: I. 3I 26 • a past record of “good behaviour” be taken into account when deciding whether to impose a penalty • the department exercise a greater degree of flexibility when applying shortfall penalties • shortfall penalties not apply when it is determined that the taxpayer has made an inadvertent error. A more consistent, reasonable and flexible application of the lack of reasonable care standard will, in time, be perceived by the taxpaying public as fair and just. ICANZ suggests that the department develop a systems audit methodology in order to assess whether taxpayers are adopting a reasonable standard of care. Taxpayer confidence in the tax system would be improved if the department’s audit methodology was, in the experience and perception of taxpayers, clearly focussed on whether or not reasonable standard of care systems are in place. We endorse this idea and recommend the department develop a systems audit methodology to assess whether taxpayers are adopting a reasonable standard of care. Unacceptable interpretation The purpose of the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty is to ensure that in a self assessment environment taxpayers who take a position which has significant tax consequences take extra care. It ensures that the conclusions they reach on their tax liability are sound. This is required by the reasonable care standard. The distinguishing feature of the acceptable interpretation standard is that it lacks some of the subjective elements, for example, taxpayer effort, when there is a significant amount of tax at stake. The unacceptable interpretation test only applies to tax shortfalls where, if viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. The unacceptable interpretation standard is an objective test involving an analysis of the law to the relevant facts. It is not relevant that a taxpayer believes that the position taken was an acceptable interpretation. Section 141b (7) of the TAA provides that the matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include: • the actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant • decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position). Other matters which may be considered in particular circumstances are binding rulings and other published departmental statements, legal articles, 27 I. 3I statute other than tax law, dictionary meaning and generally accepted accounting practice and commercial practice. ICANZ submits that the department be required to reinforce internally and publicly the principle that if a taxpayer (or adviser) has not interpreted legislation a penalty for unacceptable interpretation cannot apply. The department has confirmed that where a taxpayer has reasonably relied on an adviser, the taxpayer is considered to have taken reasonable care. In a survey ICANZ did of its members in November 1997, comments were made that to circumvent this arrangement some of the department’s staff were, as an alternative, imposing penalties for unacceptable interpretation. However, we understand that the department has advised that the unacceptable interpretation standard will apply unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax adviser did not apply his or her mind to the tax laws or make an interpretation. The tax adviser must demonstrate he or she has not interpreted the tax laws and exercised his or her judgement. Departmental staff are now taking the view that even where a tax adviser can demonstrate he or she has not interpreted the tax laws or exercised his or her judgement, the tax adviser should have addressed a particular issue and therefore unacceptable interpretation stands. The result of this is that if a tax agent does not address a particular tax law and makes a mistake, unacceptable interpretation applies. We agree with ICANZ on this matter and understand that the department’s policy is that if a taxpayer or adviser has not interpreted legislation, a penalty for unacceptable interpretation cannot apply. We recommend the department publicise this policy both internally and to the taxpaying public. Simultaneous application Those who fail to comply with the obligations imposed by the Inland Revenue Acts can be subject to the simultaneous imposition of interest and a variety of penalties. If a payment is late, both late payment penalties and interest apply. If at the same time late filing is involved, a late filing penalty can also be applied. In appropriate cases the department considers the imposition of a shortfall penalty. A number of submissions note that it may not be clear to taxpayers that the simultaneous application of penalties applies. The department needs to be more proactive in this area and therefore we expect the department to improve its communication to taxpayers on the issue. Process for challenging assessments needs review Currently the TAA provides a challenge process to an assessment or disputable decision made by either the Commissioner or a taxpayer. The legislation provides for a two month response period from the taxpayer to the Commissioner’s disputable decision or assessment, or from the taxpayer issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) to the Commissioner. However, the two month response period does not apply to the Commissioner in addressing a taxpayer’s Notice of Response (NOR). I. 3I 28 One submission comments that the legislation provides an open ended time arrangement for the Commissioner to address any disputable decision derived from the Commissioner’s own NOPA. The submitter suggests that the Commissioner should be on a limited time frame to respond to the NOR. We consider that this is a matter worth considering. A time limit would provide taxpayers challenging decisions with greater certainty and would provide taxpayers with a protection against potential abuses of the challenge system. A time limit would therefore enhance the integrity of the tax system. We recommend that the Government review the process by which assessments can be challenged, placing particular emphasis on assessing the merits of establishing a time limit on the Commissioner when addressing a taxpayer’s NOR. Use of money interest Operation of policy The principle behind the use of money interest (UOMI) is to protect the department from being used as a financing or investment option. The payment of interest is a cost to both taxpayer and government for having the use of the other party’s money over a period of time. The policy is also aimed at encouraging taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. The mechanism for setting interest rates, and the interest rates themselves, are made under Order in Council. The interest rate for overpayments is the 90 day bank bill rate less one percentage point. The interest rate for underpayments is the Reserve Bank base lending rate plus two percentage points. These rates are adjusted when there is an increase or decrease in the Reserve Bank business base lending or 90 day bank bill rates in corresponding amounts to the over/underpayment rates. For underpayments, the department has adopted the Reserve Bank business base lending rate as its formula because it considers this rate represents the base rate major banks charge good corporate customers. The department notes that for other customers banks generally add a margin of between two and five percentage points. For underpayments, the department considers its formula is appropriate because it recognises that the department is an involuntary lender. The rate applies to all and, although this means it is too high for some and too low for others in some cases, the department believes the rate is below the best available on-demand unsecured bank interest rate. Extent of differential in rates opposed The majority of submissions on this issue support the concept of the UOMI policy, but not the continued application of such a wide difference in the rates charged and paid by the department. As at 8 March 1999 UOMI was just over 10 percent for the taxpayer (10.59 percent) if tax has been underpaid and just under four percent to the taxpayer (3.38 percent) if tax has been overpaid. 29 I. 3I The department’s position, and that of the Committee of Experts, is that without the UOMI provisions, a taxpayer who fully complies may be treated less favourably than a taxpayer who does not. The rates, therefore must recognise that the taxpayer and not the department ultimately chooses whether taxes are underpaid or overpaid. As such the rates must be, on underpayments, close to, but more, than what taxpayers pay for unsecured (short and medium term) borrowing from another source, and on overpayments, close to, but less than what they would receive on short- term deposits of a similar risk. There is no dispute on the need for differential rates. However, submitters have raised questions about the justification for such a large differential. ICANZ submits the basis of rate setting should be such that the rate charged to taxpayers on underpayments should be no more than the standard bank overdraft rate. ICANZ considers the rate of interest currently charged on underpayments is excessive and significantly higher than the rate at which most taxpayers borrow. Furthermore, ICANZ states the department’s rate of interest on overpayments provides the Government with funding at a lower rate than it can borrow and provides a lower return than a taxpayer can achieve if they voluntarily invested (and significantly lower if the taxpayer has borrowed to fund the overpayment). ICANZ notes that it has made a series of submissions to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on this issue and comments that reasons given for rejecting the Institute’s proposals are “ specious” . ICANZ suggests the UOMI regime does more than “ compensate” the Government for not having the use of its money. ICANZ suggests there is a penal element included in the rate which should not be there. By way of comparison, ICANZ provides the UOMI rates which apply in Australia and the United States, which it suggests are fairer and more appropriate. The difference in the rates in these countries is one percent to 4.5 percent; in New Zealand it is 6.8 percent. ICANZ also notes that base rates adopted in these countries and the uplifts applied attempt to appropriately charge to or return to taxpayers generally for the use of funds without imposing a penal rate.9 The UOMI rules have a particular impact on those taxpayers who pay provisional tax. ICANZ submits there be a difference in the imposition of UOMI rates on tax which can be accurately calculated from provisional tax which cannot be calculated accurately. With provisional tax ICANZ notes that interest is charged on the difference between tax actually paid and the actual tax liability. In this situation, ICANZ submits that a penal rate of interest is neither required nor justified. The Committee of Experts notes that if a taxpayer has no reasonable expectation of having to pay interest at the time of making provisional tax payments, an unexpected 9 In Australia the rates are related to the Treasury Yield Note (TYN) which is the weighted average o f the latest weekly tender for 13 week Treasury Notes. The rates are set at underpayments— TYN plus four percent; and overpayments— TYN. In the United States the rates are related to the Federal Short Term Rate (FSTR). Underpayments are charged at FSTR plus three percent and overpayments at FSTR plus two percent. Higher rates are charged on under/over payments in excess of $100,000 and $10,000 respectively. I. 3I 30 breach of the interest thresholds should perhaps find relief from UOMI. We agree with the Committee of Experts on this point. It is the department’s position that the UOMI rules have resulted in provisional taxpayers meeting their tax liability on time during the income year. The department does not support a reduction in the interest rate on underpayments of provisional tax. It considers such an action would increase the potential for deferrals because those whose cost of borrowing exceeded the underpayment rate could choose not to pay provisional tax. This could lead to the re-introduction of the under-estimation penalty. We do not consider the department has responded adequately to the ICANZ proposal that the differential between underpayments and overpayments be narrowed. We accept the UOMI policy and the need for different rates for overpayments and underpayments to protect the department from being used as a financing or investment option and to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. We also accept that it may be necessary for the differential to be as wide as it is at present. However, we do not consider the department has made a case for this. At present we consider the spread is perceived to be excessive, unfair and to contain a penal element. While we also acknowledge the need to reduce and minimise both administrative and compliance costs, we do not consider this necessarily justifies the continuation of a policy if it is proved inequitable. Therefore, we recommend that the method by which UOMI is calculated be reviewed to determine whether changes to the interest rates for overpayments and underpayments to reduce the differential between the two rates are appropriate. We agree the UOMI rules for provisional taxpayers should not be changed. The department informs us that the UOMI rules have resulted in the provisional tax payments at the first, second, and third provisional tax dates evening out. We believe this should be encouraged. 31 I. 3I Term of reference C: To review the debt management practices and the adequacy of the powers of the Inland Revenue Department to remit tax liabilities or enter into arrangements for deferring the payment of tax and the department’s operation of its powers The department has a difficult job to perform when dealing with taxpayers who are in debt to the department. The department differs from other creditors in three important aspects: • Creditors can generally chose who they deal with. The department must deal with all taxpayers. Often the department’s debtors choose to pay trade creditors in preference to the department to ensure that their supply of essential business needs continues. • Unlike other creditors, the department has no general discretion to compromise on payment of established tax liabilities. • Some forms of tax debt (such as PAYE and child support) are given preferential status in the statutory priority of distribution following insolvency. Debts owing to the department arise when the department has issued a default assessment if the taxpayer has failed to file a return, or the department has issued an assessment showing an amount owing and the taxpayer has failed to pay the full amount by the due date. A large number of submissions indicated to us that the system for informing taxpayers of debts is inadequate. Once a debt has arisen in a taxpayer’s account, the taxpayer gets notice of that debt by a variety of ways, by Notice of Assessment, Statement of Account and reminder letters. If the debt remains unpaid and there is no prospect of immediate payment, the department needs to consider debt management options available to it. Although the department’s preference is to recover debt by voluntary payment in full, recovery can also be by way of voluntary time payment (for example, an instalment arrangement), or by compulsory deduction. If a taxpayer is in financial difficulty the department can, in limited circumstances, provide relief from debt by way of write-off, cancellation or remission. Some submissions were approving of the department’s general approach; for example, Denham Martin and Associates states: Our clear im pression is that in this area the C om m issioner and his staff have adopted a fair and com passionate approach to applying penalties and assisting taxpayers w ith their outstanding tax obligations. T he cases w here this has not been done w ould be the exception rather than the rule. This sentiment was shared by others who acknowledge that the department has a difficult job to perform, but many submissions also suggest that significant improvements could be made to the department’s debt management practices. Following our examination of the department’s debt I. 3I 32 management practices we make the following comments and recommendations. Department needs to take action on outstanding debt more quickly PricewaterhouseCoopers states the debt recovery division within the department should become involved in collecting outstanding tax at an earlier stage than at present. Under current policies and procedures, situations are often beyond retrieval before they reach debt recovery. In many cases the first contact with a taxpayer in relation to unpaid taxes is several months after the due date has passed, at which time the department issues a statement recording the unpaid tax together with accrued penalties. Many taxpayers who get themselves into this situation are unaware of the effect of penalties, and by the time they are made aware of it, substantial penalties have accrued, plus interest. Many other submissions state that a contributing factor in the accumulation of debt is that the department is too slow in identifying and following up on debt. PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests that the department should adopt practices common to trading banks and institute prompt follow-up procedures for overdue debts. Arguably the department should have more sophisticated follow-up procedures than banks as the imposition of late payment penalties and UOMI will generate a higher debt and can result in what are initially relatively small debts escalating into amounts which are beyond the ability of taxpayers to ever pay back. When debt is recognised early there is a better chance of recovering the debt (from the department’s perspective), and the debt will be more manageable (from the taxpayer’s perspective); therefore, a ‘win-win’ situation is achieved. We concur with this analysis. We understand the department is working on ways to identify outstanding debt earlier and that it is working towards utilising its call centres to make outbound calls to taxpayers in arrears. We welcome these initiatives. Refocusing of debt and return management strategy The department accepts the validity of the above concerns and is refocusing its debt management resources on two broad priority areas: • Debt which has risen to a significant level (over $10,000) irrespective of age. • PAYE and GST. This debt tends to be newer debt and has significant potential to escalate. This approach recognises the need to balance the use of resources across both new and old debt. Performance standards in the departmental forecast report focus on the department collecting new debt as quickly as possible. ICANZ submits that the experience of its members suggests that there are cases where a defaulting taxpayer is “ put to the wall” . ICANZ has no problem with a firm and fair approach being adopted towards debt collection, but is concerned with the lack of commercialism that sometimes 33 I. 3I is displayed by debt collection personnel, probably as a result of “ punishing” operational guidelines set down for them. In order to improve the department’s debt collection philosophy ICANZ suggested that the department must ensure that: • the department’s systems immediately identify situations where a taxpayer is “ in arrears” • if the amount of the arrears is significant, the department is promptly in direct contact with the defaulting taxpayer, with a view to alerting them and seeing whether there is a situation calling for departmental help and assistance (or indeed, fast track recovery action) • in all cases, if immediately the debt is say three weeks in arrears, contact be made with the taxpayer to alert them to the situation, and (where appropriate) to formally invite them to come and discuss the situation (including any required instalment arrangements) • in the case of continuing default, thereafter continue to follow-up routinely on the default with the taxpayer, and be prepared to take appropriate action (which need not necessarily be recovery action). ICANZ also suggests that the department consider passing the debt on to be dealt with by another body, perhaps a separate arm of Government to deal with unaddressed debts. At the moment no personal contact by the department’s debt collecting staff is made until the debt is several months overdue. By this time, if the taxpayer has serious financial problems there will be a further two to three months of unpaid taxes (PAYE and GST, etc.) along with mounting late payment penalties and interest charges. This kind of debt compounding over a few months for a small business can be devastating. Accordingly, ICANZ believes that if such an approach were to be introduced and the approach was accompanied by a positive, focussed, friendly but firm cash flow management approach on the part of the department’s debt management staff, there would be considerable advantages for taxpayers, the perception of the department in the minds of taxpayers, and the community at large, in particular: • debt problems would be identified promptly, and consequentially managed better • the penalty and interest exposure of defaulting taxpayers could be minimised • if a suitable debt management arrangement was not concluded within a (say) six month period, then the troublesome debt not in dispute could pass out of the hands of the departmental officers (who otherwise would be considered “ the bad guys” ) onto another Government department for debt collection. We consider that the ideas raised have merit and should be closely investigated by the department. The next Finance and Expenditure Committee should consider following up with the department what action has been taken in this regard. However, we do see a problem in passing I. 3I 34 the debt on to another body, in that this would just transport the problem somewhere else, rather than resolve it. Write-offs A write-off is an accounting concept whereby a debt is written off the books of a creditor. The debt still exists but no action is being taken to collect it. The debt can be reinstated if the taxpayer’s position improves. The write-off provisions are not contained in legislation. They are an administrative practice adopted by the department in line with the Public Finance Act 1989. UOMI and penalties continue to accrue. Debts that can be written-off can generally be reinstated at anytime (except in cases of bankruptcy or liquidations). Many submitters were concerned that the term “ write-off" is not fully explained. Many taxpayers believe their debt has been permanently wiped and they are often subsequently unprepared in cases where the debt collection is reinitiated. Another submitter raised the problem of its de- motivating effect on taxpayers. If a taxpayer knows the debt will be reinstated once he or she is in a better financial position, the incentive to find work is removed. In this situation a “ lose-lose” outcome is the result because not only is the department failing to maximise net revenue over time by not collecting money to pay the debt, but the taxpayer is not working to pay tax in the interim. We recommend that the Government review the whole area of write- offs and in doing so consider: • whether there should be a time limit on reinstatement of a debt • whether, if the present policy is to continue, the term “write-off” should be replaced by wording that more accurately describes the policy (for example “provisional write-off” ) • whether it is necessary for the write-off provisions to be contained in the Inland Revenue Acts. Cancellation of penalties Penalties may be cancelled subject to the successful completion of a specified action such as an instalment arrangement. If the action is successfully completed the remaining debt is cancelled. The purpose of the penalty cancellation provisions is to encourage taxpayers to enter into repayment arrangements at an early stage and to make repayment of debt by instalments more rapid. ICANZ, in its submission, included the department’s practice statement about the application of the cancellation provision: Provided taxpayers f u l l y comply w ith an approved arrangement entered into before the due date, Inland Revenue w ill cancel 60% of the initial late paym ent penalty and all the subsequent late paym ent penalties. This cancellation does not however extend to use o f m oney interest, w hich will still be charged (em phasis added). 35 I. 3I However, section 183b (2) of the TAA states in relation to the cancellation provision: (b) the taxpayer com plies with the taxpayer's obligations under the arrangement. The word “ fully” does not appear in the legislation. The department’s explanation of the inclusion of the word “ fully” in the practice is: By fully we m ean the taxpayer has to see an agreed arrangem ent through to the end— they cannot bail out part w ay through and still expect to get cancellation o f the penalties under section 183b. H owever, as stated, the taxpayer can vary the arrangem ent by mutual agreem ent and still stay w ithin the am bit of section 183b. The ability to vary the arrangement by mutual agreement is not widely known. The use of the word “ fully” is inconsistent with this position. Obviously, if a repayment arrangement can be varied once agreed to, the original arrangement does not have to be fully complied with to attract cancellation. We consider that partial failure to comply with an arrangement should not result in a disproportionate penalty. We consider that it is important that the department be very clear as to the rights of the taxpayer under repayment arrangements. We recommend the department issue clear directions to taxpayers as to their options, rights and obligations with respect to repayment arrangements. Instalment arrangements Under section 177 of the TAA the Commissioner can provide relief by way of granting an instalment arrangement when a taxpayer is in financial difficulties. The provision is restricted to income tax and fringe benefit tax, but we understand that under the care and management provisions instalment arrangements have been entered into for other types of taxes. While we consider that it is appropriate for instalment arrangements to be available for all tax types, the current legislative framework does not establish clearly that the Commissioner is empowered to do this. This can lead to inconsistent treatment for taxpayers seeking an instalment arrangement for tax types other than income tax and fringe benefit tax. We note that following these concerns being raised during our inquiry the Government intends to clarify this situation. The department generally limits instalment arrangements to periods of less than 12 months (commonly six months). We consider the restriction may lead to unrealistic instalment arrangements if taxpayers are required to pay debt within rigid time frames rather than within the taxpayer’s financial budget. The factors that may determine whether an instalment arrangement is an acceptable course of action for the department include: • is the repayment proposal realistic? • can the taxpayer meet future tax liabilities? • has the taxpayer previously had and adhered to an instalment arrangement? I. 3I 36 • has the taxpayer filed all required returns or are there any current default assessments? • has the taxpayer been granted other relief in the past? In practice a complicated calculation must be done to ensure that the department receives the best possible return from the action taken, thereby maximising the “ Net Present Value” (NPV). This value will be maximised if the debt can be repaid over as shorter period as possible. However, we consider that rigidly imposing time limits for instalment arrangements of six or 12 months, as some local offices have been doing, is far too inflexible and is not consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to maximise revenue collected over time. Many submitters wrote or told us of the frustration at not being kept fully informed of what was required of them, and of the department's tardiness in communicating with taxpayers who were asking for help or were asking for clarification regarding their tax affairs. One submitter told us he had desired to enter into an arrangement and offered payment of $600 per month to help clear some of the debt as the department was threatening bankruptcy. This offer was refused. The department agrees with many of the sentiments expressed by those who made submissions. The department acknowledges that some local offices have been seeking to impose time limits on instalment arrangements. National Office has recently sent out a memorandum to all staff which emphasises that there is no time limit for instalment arrangements. The department adopts a policy that instalment arrangements will not generally be entered into if a taxpayer can pay the debt using other sources or means. This satisfies the principle that immediate recovery of the full amount of the debt is the optimum outcome in terms of NPV. Lengthy instalment arrangements are unlikely to maximise the NPV of any recovery, so a number of factors need to be taken into account when long- term instalment arrangements are being considered. Following legitimate concerns raised in submissions to this inquiry, a standard practice statement on instalment arrangements is being produced that is intended to improve consistency across departmental offices. This will be completed following both internal and external consultation. We are pleased the department is taking steps to enhance a consistency of approach. We expect the department to be more flexible in its approach to instalment arrangements, and make its intentions clear to the taxpaying public. Serious and financial hardship provisions require review The Commissioner has discretion to remit income tax or fringe benefit tax if a taxpayer is in financial difficulties or to remit income tax if satisfied that serious hardship exists. The NPV calculation applies to these provisions. In practice the department uses the financial hardship provision for taxpayers in a continuing business who are in genuine financial difficulties and do not have the ability to pay arrears, but do have the ability to account for future taxation requirements. 37 I. 3I Many submitters believe the department is reluctant to grant remission for serious and financial hardship, and that it is unclear as to when the provisions are granted and under what circumstances. The hardship provisions are very limited at the moment, and applying them across all tax types was suggested in many submissions. Submitters argue the hardship provisions should be used more widely to avoid bankruptcy in many situations where there is a realistic option of the business being able to pay its current and future tax obligations if relief is granted. The department instigated a review of the hardship provisions in October 1998, having had concerns about possible deficiencies in the provisions for some time. There are philosophical reasons why remission should be agreed to only rarely. These are based on fairness and the perception remitting for some taxpayers gives to other taxpayers who have paid their tax. It also erodes the ethos that all taxpayers have an obligation to pay their tax. Effectively a delicate balance must be reached between remitting tax for those taxpayers in serious and financial hardship and the impression this gives the compliant taxpayer. The policy reason behind not applying these provisions to all tax types is that certain tax types such as PAYE are deemed held in trust by the taxpayer10. It is the taxpayer’s duty to withhold these taxes on trust and then forward them on to the department. They are not meant to be spent in the general course of every day business. The department has acknowledged that the current application of the hardship provisions and the write-off rules can lead to inconsistency and there is some lack of clarity with their application. It is not clear when a write-off is granted rather than serious or financial hardship. These problems would be partially removed if the hardship provisions applied to all tax types. We note and welcome the Government’s intention to extend the provisions in this manner. However, we consider some clear statements as to when the provisions will apply are also needed. PricewaterhouseCoopers in its submission included material contained in an April 1994 Report to the Minister of Revenue. The report specifically stated: To ensure the proper and consistent use o f m anagerial responsibility in these areas, the tax administration w ill be required to refine or develop internal guidelines for the exercise o f care and m anagem ent in the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. The guidelines should be consistent with the objective of maximising net revenue over time according to the law and give guidance to staff on the proper procedures and consideration to take into account as they apply tax law. The report went on to suggest that the application of these guidelines should be subject to an independent and periodic audit by the Office of the Controller and Auditor-General. The results of the audit should then be published in a report to Parliament. We believe this is a very good suggestion which may solve many of the problems raised by submitters, expressing their concern at the consistency of the provisions’ application. 10 See section 167(1) of TAA. I. 3I 38 The department points out that there are a number of problem areas in the current hardship provisions. These include whether the current tests are appropriate. The department is to review the provisions as part of the post- implementation review of the compliance and penalties regime. We consider the next Finance and Expenditure Committee should thoroughly assess the outcome of that review. Ministerial approval threshold in cases of serious or financial hardship Under the TAA, ministerial approval must be obtained if the amount subject to an instalment arrangement or remission exceeds $50,000. In practice, however, the Commissioner told us the department had generally not been requesting ministerial approval for instalment arrangements of over $50,000. This kind of disregard for the law could severely damage the integrity of the tax system, if taxpayers perceive that the department can summarily disregard its statutory obligations. If in practice the approval thresholds are inappropriate or overly cumbersome, then the law should be changed, not merely ignored. Many submissions express concern over the need for ministerial approval to remit, refund or enter into instalment arrangements for amounts exceeding $50,000. The Minister’s role is designed to provide an assurance that the Commissioner is appropriately applying the hardship provisions in the most significant cases. However, there are a number of disadvantages with the requirement to get ministerial approval: • The process can be time consuming, causing considerably more stress to the taxpayer. • Delays often affect the taxpayer’s economic circumstances and may act to reduce revenue collection. • It impacts on the separation of the Commissioner’s statutory role of day to day tax administration from the Minister’s role of political oversight. We are of the view that ministerial discretion should be removed. We consider that removing the threshold would be beneficial for a number of reasons. Primarily it would reduce the amount of stress on the taxpayer waiting to hear whether their application has been agreed to. It will result in administrative cost savings for the department and reduce compliance costs on taxpayers due to the faster processing times. We recommend that the ministerial approval thresholds for instalment arrangements and remissions be removed, but that the Commissioner be required to provide a regular report to the Minister outlining applications for remissions and instalments in excess of $100,000. Bankruptcy proceedings A large number of the submissions we received were from people who had been forced into bankruptcy by the department. Of these, a significant proportion were self-employed or sole contractors. The department states 39 I. 3I that legal proceedings are initiated as an action of last resort and only after careful consideration of all aspects of a case. Many submissions claim that the department takes a heavy handed approach to debt collection, and pursues debt rigorously and without tact. Some submissions allege that the department uses standover tactics in the form of intimidation and threats to obtain payments. While we make no findings in respect of individual cases, we are concerned at the pattern they reveal. In the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, the department referred 1000 individuals for bankruptcy and 995 companies for liquidation. In 44 percent of those cases the proceedings referred have subsequently been withdrawn mainly because the debt was paid in full or arrangements were made to pay the debt over time. The department considers bankruptcy and liquidation as a last resort. Several submitters claim the department instigates or threatens bankruptcy proceedings too readily. Submitters are of the view that the department is not prepared to consider alternative strategies or options. Many bankruptcy proceedings could be avoided if the department became actively involved in taxpayers’ affairs sooner rather than later, to halt the growth of debt. By the time the department does get involved the debt is so large the department has no other choice but to bankrupt. As stated earlier, the department is to take steps to be more proactive in identifying new debt more quickly. It will focus some of the debt collection follow-up from the call centres and use the benefit of the technology to more actively pursue debt. We welcome this initiative and hope this action will be a factor in lowering the number of department initiated bankruptcies. We consider this matter should be kept under review by the next Finance and Expenditure Committee. Department’s statutory preference in liquidation proceedings should be reviewed The department has statutory preference in liquidations. The statutory preference is governed by section 312 of the Companies Act 1993 and the preferences are set out in the Seventh Schedule of the Act. The tendency is to pay out the department’s tax preference, including interest and penalties, which appear not to have a statutory preferential status, dispose of any remaining assets (frequently there are none) and wind up the company. Remaining unsecured creditors are advised that there is no dividend and no fighting fund with which to litigate to recover bad debts or pursue delinquent directors. Research on liquidations in the Wellington region was submitted to us by Ian Caddis and Jane Laking. The statutory preference of the department was identified as a major contributing factor to the dismal result of only two cents in the dollar being paid out to unsecured creditors. This has a significant flow on effect. The researchers conclude that the department loses more revenue than it collects in the liquidation process and this has a domino effect on other creditors who often fail as a consequence. Further, I. 3I 40 it is not clear whether the statutory preference extends to the collection of penalties and interest as well as the core tax debt. We consider that these arguments are valid and we recommend that the Government review the preferential status of the department in liquidations. Tax amnesty Tax amnesties are commonly used when there is a major change proposed to a tax regime. Research indicates that a tax amnesty is most successful when changes are proposed to the method of detection or to the size of the penalties. PricewaterhouseCoopers submits the Government should promulgate a tax amnesty in which taxpayers with undeclared tax issues can pay off tax due from previous years without any penalties or interest being imposed. PricewaterhouseCoopers believes there are thousands of taxpayers living in fear of the consequences of not having declared income for tax purposes but who would like to bring their affairs up-to-date. People in this situation, however, feel unable financially and unwilling emotionally to approach the department for fear of significant penalties being imposed. An amnesty was last held in New Zealand in 1988. The reason for this was to encourage people to come forward if they had failed to meet their tax obligations but also because the department had increased both its checks on tax evasion and the penalties for this offence. The amnesty ran for a two month period. Taxpayers who came forward at that time were still charged with a late penalty payment. This was done for reasons of fairness. If penalties had not been charged, non-compliers would have had the advantage of the use of that money and would have paid less tax than those who complied. Just over 16 000 taxpayers responded with an additional $26.6 million of revenue being assessed. The majority (80 percent) of respondents were non-business taxpayers disclosing additional income from interest and dividend tax. This has since been addressed through withholding taxes. Arguments put forward to support a tax amnesty note the potential receipt of tens of millions of additional dollars for the revenue. Aspects of the black economy may also be brought into the regulated taxation regime by allowing people to come forward without fear of prosecution and penalties. An amnesty could provide a mechanism to draw attention to the implications of not complying with the taxation Acts, it could stimulate voluntary compliance, and recover tax which might otherwise never be paid to the department. PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that a tax amnesty be held under which people would pay core tax owing but not penalties or interest. Such an action, in the submitter’s view, would go some way to restoring faith in the integrity of the tax system. There are several drawbacks to providing a tax amnesty, however. PricewaterhouseCoopers acknowledges that if an amnesty was introduced, it would need to be handled with due regard to all those taxpayers who have and continue to comply with their tax obligations. For this reason, PricewaterhouseCoopers does not recommend that any core tax amounts be 41 I. 3I remitted. The 1988 amnesty attempted to find a balance between complying and non-complying taxpayers by charging a late payment penalty. The need to achieve a balance of this sort is a key disadvantage with holding a tax amnesty. A further consideration is whether the changes in the tax regime are significant enough or provide a sufficient incentive for non-compliant taxpayers to come forward. One further disadvantage of tax amnesties is that if they become a reasonably frequent occurrence non- compliers might be discouraged from coming forward in anticipation of another tax amnesty at a later time. We find the arguments for and against a tax amnesty both have merit. We have no doubt that there are many taxpayers with a strong desire to regularise their tax situation and make a fresh start with the department but are afraid to do so because of the effect of compounding penalties. There needs to be due consideration, however, given to those taxpayers who do comply with their tax obligations. We do not believe it is appropriate for us to make a recommendation as to whether a tax amnesty is desirable at this time. This is a matter for the Government to consider. I. 3I 42 Term of reference D: To examine the feasibility and desirability of establishing a tax ombudsman to investigate taxpayer complaints Complaint mechanisms within the department We received overwhelming support from submitters for the establishment of a separate tax ombudsman to investigate taxpayer complaints. We feel this is more a reflection of the general frustration amongst some taxpayers with the lack of redress available to them from within the department. We consider the call to establish a tax ombudsman is a direct consequence of the disestablishment by the department of its Problem Resolution Service in 1996. The Problem Resolution Service was established to resolve problems that could not be resolved through the department’s standard procedures (that is, with the officer concerned or with the officer’s manager). A dedicated Problem Resolution Officer was established in each district office to assist with cases where long delays had occurred or where taxpayers considered a decision to be incomplete or unfair. The Service was disbanded in 1996 after the Organisational Review which introduced segmentation into the department. The effect of this was to group all the information about a particular taxpayer within one managerial group. It was considered sufficient for the manager to act as the point of contact for any taxpayer complaints. Many submitters, however, feel this arrangement lacks transparency and independence. Queries, complaints and disputes about technical tax matters are resolved under the disputes resolution procedures as set out in the TAA. This includes referral to the department’s Adjudication Unit, which is an independent unit within the department set up to assess the merits of a case against a taxpayer before legal proceedings are initiated. From the evidence we received, there is general support for this practice and confidence in the neutrality and independence of the Unit. Ultimately taxpayer complaints of a technical nature are determined by the Taxation Review Authority or other courts. Complaints that may amount to a serious breach of the department’s Code of Conduct are dealt with by the Internal Audit section of the department’s National Office. There are very few options, however, for a taxpayer who has a relatively “ low level” complaint such as poor communication or the lack of timely responses from the department when dealing with a tax dispute. If the dispute cannot be resolved at the officer/manager level the other options available to the taxpayer are an approach to the Commissioner directly, to a local Member of Parliament, the Minister, or the Ombudsman. Current role of the Ombudsman in tax matters While there is no dedicated tax ombudsman in New Zealand, taxpayers can and do make complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman regarding any administrative action or decision made by the department. A specific 43 I. 3I unit within the Office of the Ombudsman deals with complaints of this nature. The Ombudsman, however, cannot make determinative or binding decisions following an investigation of a complaint. The department, therefore, like any other government department is not obliged to follow the Ombudsman’s recommendation. However, the department notes that it “ accepts most recommendations" . The Ombudsman advised us that the number of general inquiries received relating to the department’s administration of the tax laws has increased significantly over the past three years.11 The major areas of complaint are: • refusal of access to information requested by taxpayers • failure to communicate adequately the reasons for a decision • failure to respond to a taxpayer’s communication within a reasonable time • failure to take account of all relevant matters when exercising a statutory decision • applying a narrow interpretation of statutory provisions. Options for enhancing the Ombudsman function PricewaterhouseCoopers submits there is no need for a separate tax ombudsman to be established provided the resources of the existing Office of the Ombudsman are strengthened by establishing a specialist tax team to review decisions made by the Commissioner as they relate to the department’s administration of the TAA. PricewaterhouseCoopers is surprised that this expertise is not currently available within the Office of the Ombudsman given that tax issues represent the second highest number of complaints against government agencies. ICANZ submits that a tax ombudsman, whether separate from the existing Office of the Ombudsman or not, must have the requisite skills and experience, and have the unqualified support of the Commissioner who has in place a “ fast track priority facility” to deal with tax ombudsman cases. In 1995 in Australia a specialist tax ombudsman position was established within the Commonwealth Ombudsman Office. The establishment of this position was seen as a key mechanism in balancing the rights and responsibilities of the Australian Tax Office (ATO) and of the taxpayers. Publicity about and accessibility to the tax ombudsman are considered key performance objectives of the ATO. Areas of tax administration investigation undertaken by the tax ombudsman include debt recovery actions, decisions to bankrupt, conduct of audits, provision of advice, method of handling inquiries, remission of penalties, handling of correspondence, and delays in decision making. We note these areas in particular were all raised by submitters as problem areas with the department. The Chief New Zealand Ombudsman, Sir Brian Elwood, submits there is no point in establishing a parallel office to his unless the powers of the tax 11 In 1996/97 there were 80 complaints, in 1997/98 this rose to 119, and in the 1998/99 year the total number of IRD-related complaints was 189. I. 3I 44 ombudsman are radically different from those which apply to the existing Ombudsman. Sir Brian also submits that the investigation of complaints about the administration of the tax laws of New Zealand currently rests with the Ombudsmen as part of their general jurisdiction. The Ombudsmen undertake a review function and have the necessary statutory powers to enable them to do so. Sir Brian’s view is that, given this background, there is no need to establish a separate and stand-alone Tax Ombudsman Office. If a specialist tax position was established along the lines of the Australian example, Sir Brian submits that additional resources would be required to undertake investigations. He suggests that the cost of additional specialist resources to deal with tax administration investigations would be less than the cost of establishing a stand-alone Tax Ombudsman Office. We agree and note the majority of submitters on this issue are seeking a means of redress for administrative actions on the part of the department. There was no support for a separate tax ombudsman to investigate technical tax issues which, we agree, are best left for the courts to determine. On a related issue, Sir Brian submits that the department has a statutory obligation to advise taxpayers of their right to seek redress from the Ombudsman. He suggests the department be required to inform a complainant, dissatisfied with the results of an internal inquiry, that they are able to lodge a complaint with an external review agency, such as the Ombudsman or the Taxation Review Authority. Sir Brian also suggests the Commissioner operate an internal complaints system headed by a complaints review officer who reports directly to the Commissioner. The Ombudsman further recommends section 81 of the TAA be reviewed so that taxpayers’ access to information held about them by the department is improved. We deal with this issue elsewhere in this report. Need for effective departmental complaints service We conclude that the establishment of a separate Tax Ombudsman is not necessary. We do not think the cost of such an establishment (estimated at approximately $1 million) is warranted, especially as we do not recommend that a tax ombudsman exercise determinative powers in respect to technical tax matters. We agree that the current powers of the Office of the Ombudsman are sufficient to investigate complaints of tax administration. We believe there is a public perception that a fundamental imbalance exists between the powers of the department and the taxpayer. Recent changes in the tax laws have imposed on taxpayers significant compliance obligations, the department has at its disposal extensive investigatory powers which are less well supervised than those of the Police, and the burden of the “ onus of p ro o f" all combine to produce an impression that it is impossible and perhaps foolhardy to “ take on” the department. The issue for us, therefore, is the need to ensure the tax system provides a ready and inexpensive avenue through which taxpayers can find redress. 45 I. 3I There should not be a need for taxpayers to engage professional help to sort out unacceptable administrative performance which has already been the subject of meaningful resolution attempts by the taxpayer. We also consider the segmentation of the department has failed to achieve the desired outcomes in respect of problem resolution. Before initiating an investigation into a complaint, the Ombudsman must be satisfied that genuine efforts have been made to resolve the dispute through the department’s dispute resolution procedures. In the case of tax administration issues, we do not consider the current procedures of officer/manager resolution followed by an approach to the Commissioner or a Member of Parliament represent such an effort. We believe that a greater onus on the department to provide an avenue for problem and complaint resolution is required. We recommend a problem resolution service, similar to that established in 1989, be reinstated. We recommend the department commit adequate resources to this service in terms of experienced personnel and personnel committed to “ win-win” outcomes. We believe that if such a service is set up many taxpayer issues will be resolved at an early stage at the least personal and financial cost to taxpayers concerned. If this is done, we feel that recourse to the Office of the Ombudsman will be limited to the more serious cases of alleged mistreatment. We also consider that such a service, if properly resourced and well publicised, will be seen as a significant step by the department to improving equity in the tax system. We consider the Office of the Ombudsman should be augmented by the establishment of a tax specialist with appropriate resources as in the Australian practice. We recommend: • the department re-establish a problem resolution service with experienced personnel committed to customer satisfaction outcomes • the department ensure that the problem resolution service, once established, is well publicised • the department advise all complainants, dissatisfied by the results of an internal inquiry, of their rights to appeal to an external agency • the Government establish a specialist tax adviser position within the Office of the Ombudsman with appropriate resources to investigate matters of tax administration by the department. We consider establishing a separate tax ombudsman’s office is not desirable. I. 3I 46 Term of reference E: To review whether the structure, operation and culture of the Inland Revenue Department, and its understanding of the law, have affected the department’s application of the compliance and penalties regimes and the service it provides to taxpayers and their agents Structure Overview of structure The current organisational structure was put in place as a consequence of the 1994 Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department. The department is structured on the basis of four business units: • Policy Advice—responsible for development of tax policy. • Adjudication and Rulings—undertakes the final quantification of taxpayer liability in disputed cases and provides rulings. • Operations—responsible for providing the bulk of services to taxpayers and their agents. • Strategic Services—provides specialist management advice to the Chief Executive and senior managers. The Operations business unit has the most interactions with taxpayers and is responsible for providing the bulk of services to taxpayers. The provision of services to taxpayers and their agents is managed by means of a “ hub and spoke” model of field delivery. There are three office types: • Service Centres—large metropolitan hubs responsible for managing the other offices within their area with a range of centralised technical and support functions. • Branch Offices—smaller offices, located in non-metropolitan areas providing all functions, such as services, debt and return management and audit. • Customer Service Offices—relatively small offices which largely provide service functions centred on the operation of a public counter. Current changes and restructuring The department is in the process of implementing major structural changes as a result of the Government’s decision to implement tax simplification initiatives for salary and wage earners. Implementation of the tax simplification programme and the introduction of call centres have substantial implications for the future structure of the department. The change process markedly alters the manner of service delivery. The call centres will respond to the majority of taxpayers’ queries. The immediate result of this will be the removal of the majority of advisory staff from the branch offices. Call centres and electronic filing are new delivery mechanisms which will significantly change the nature of interactions with customers and the skill 47 I. 3I needs of the organisation. The changes currently affect the Operations business group. Staffing reductions of around 700 full-time positions will result and 11 of the current permanent sites will close. Most telephone calls will be centralised into five call centres. The department is to close the nine customer service offices and its two smallest branch offices (located in Greymouth and Alexandra). Office closures are timed for March 2000. While we are generally supportive of the broad direction of the simplification programme and the restructuring, the office closures will substantially reduce the capability of the department to provide face-to-face services to taxpayers. A taxpayer facing difficulty with their tax affairs will often be able to resolve problems more easily dealing with an officer in person. Disputes and problems can thus be resolved before they escalate. Not having access to a face-to-face service may cause frustration and annoyance among taxpayers and impact on the perceived fairness and integrity of the tax system. We consider the effect of the loss of face-to-face services should be closely monitored by the next Finance and Expenditure Committee and recommend that the department investigate ways to preserve over the counter services in areas where it is closing offices, particularly in isolated areas. Initiatives such as the establishment of mobile offices and the creation of a network of agencies should be considered. Quality of telephone services Given that the vast majority of taxpayer contacts with the department in future will be over the telephone, it is imperative that the department provides outstanding service in this area. The department has performance targets of answering: • 80 percent of calls within 20 seconds at the Business Call Centre • 70 percent of calls within 30 seconds at the Personal Call Centres. We note that these targets are broadly in line with international benchmarks for call centres. We have been sharply critical of the quality of the department’s telephone services in the past. The department has responded to criticism of its service by devoting more staff to answering calls and has sought to minimise the need for people to contact the department by simplifying requirements and improving statements. We note that around 13 percent of all calls to the call centres are currently being abandoned. This rate of call abandonment is too high. We understand that the call centres have only been in operation since April 1999 and difficulties can be expected while the system is bedded in. However, we would expect to see significant reductions in abandonment rates in the very near future. This is a matter which should be closely monitored by the next Finance and Expenditure Committee. The quality of the department’s telephone services is dependent not only on the timeliness with which calls are answered, but also on whether queries are being dealt with to taxpayers’ satisfaction. ICANZ submits that its members complain they cannot get access to knowledgeable staff and I. 3I 48 that they are left waiting on the telephone for up to 30 minutes. Several other submissions lend support to this claim, as do the personal experiences of members of the committee. This is unacceptable. Clearly it is crucial that frontline staff have the knowledge and skills necessary to provide taxpayers with prompt and accurate service. The consequences for taxpayers when they are misinformed can potentially be dire. We recommend the department enhance its monitoring of telephone services to ensure greater timeliness and accuracy of responses and that the department identify and remedy any skills deficiencies as a matter of priority. We understand that the Business Call Centre has been primarily staffed by employees with no background in tax matters who have been trained in the various tax questions most likely to be received. According to the State Services Commission, staff received a month’s full-time training prior to the call centre going on-line. In hindsight this appears to have been inadequate. However, as staff members spend time in the job we expect deficiencies in knowledge to be overcome, as long as staff can be retained and training is ongoing. This is a further matter which should be monitored and reported on by the next Finance and Expenditure Committee. In particular we suggest the committee should consider whether the call centres are retaining sufficiently skilled staff and should assess whether staff are being adequately trained. Responses to written correspondence require improvement A very large number of submissions complain about the department’s poor performance in the manner in which it deals with correspondence. Numerous examples were given where the department has not responded to correspondence, has been tardy in its response or has provided an unsatisfactory response. We note that the department accepts many of these criticisms. Delays in replying to correspondence are particularly unacceptable when taxpayers are in arrears and are accumulating penalties. The department needs to take particular care to deal with such cases expeditiously. This is another aspect of the department’s operations which should be closely monitored by the next Finance and Expenditure Committee. We recommend that the department take steps to enhance the timeliness and quality of its responses to written correspondence, and that the performance standard in the 1999/2000 Purchase Agreement of dealing with all correspondence within eight weeks of receipt be reviewed. Internal provision of drafting services inappropriate The Policy Advice division of the department contains a legislative drafting unit which, under an Order in Council made in 1994, has responsibility for the drafting of tax legislation. The department is the only Government department which is responsible for drafting its own legislation. We considered whether this is appropriate. We understand that the department was given responsibility for drafting tax bills in 1994 in 49 I. 3I order to speed up the process and to overcome some managerial deficiencies within the Parliamentary Counsel Office. We understand that these have now been resolved. We consider that there are a number of reasons why it is undesirable to allow the department to draft its own legislation. Primarily we are concerned that allowing the department to both initiate and draft its own legislation allows tax legislation to progress without the scrutiny of an agency set aside from policy considerations. Issues of importance in the wider public policy context can potentially go unraised as a consequence. Furthermore, the Parliamentary Counsel Office and the Chief Parliamentary Counsel set drafting standards. The department is not bound by those standards. We do not consider it desirable that drafting standards and style for tax legislation differ from all other forms of legislation. Additionally, there is an efficiency argument in favour of having a single drafting agency. Having an agency competing for drafters splits the already small talent pool. We are concerned that this will lead to the more talented drafters being attracted to the department’s drafting unit if it is able to offer more attractive employment packages. This could have potentially serious implications for the overall quality of legislative drafting. We consider that the arguments for moving the responsibility for drafting tax legislation back to the Parliamentary Counsel Office have merit and are worthy of further consideration. We recommend that the Government consider moving the responsibility for drafting tax legislation back to the Parliamentary Counsel Office. Desirability of a board of directors should be considered We consider that an improvement in the accountability arrangements for the department is necessary. Given the wide powers of the Commissioner and the degree to which authority is delegated, we believe that a specialist body, in the form of a board of directors, to review the performance of the department and to review the Commissioner’s performance in discharging his or her statutory responsibilities may be desirable. This board could be modelled on the Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, in that it would have a general oversight function, but would not be involved in the day to day operations of the department. We do not envisage such a board as a limitation on the statutory powers presently conferred upon the Commissioner. Any board should be staffed by those with expertise in areas such as the management of large service organisations, customer service, tax law and information technology. Functions of the board could include providing independent reports to the Minister of Revenue on the health of the tax system, the stewardship of the department, the operation of the penalties regime and the strategic direction of the department. Any such board should not have access to specific taxpayer information and should have no involvement in specific matters relating to the interpretation and enforcement of tax laws, tax legislation or day to day operational decisions. I. 3I 50 We recommend that the Government consider whether establishing a board of directors to provide an oversight of the department’s operation of its powers is desirable. Culture The culture of any organisation stems from its leaders. Some submissions to us suggest that the department’s senior management team, including the Commissioner, have engendered a culture of punishment and fear which impacts upon both staff and in turn taxpayers. Irrespective of the extent to which this is true, we believe that there must be a cultural shift within the department, and that shift must come from the top. We acknowledge that the department has a compliance and enforcement function which often requires it to take firm steps to ensure taxpayers are meeting their obligations. However, from the evidence we heard, we consider that the department’s culture is one which sometimes emphasises enforcement at the expense of providing a courteous and professional service to taxpayers. The fact that taxpayers have obligations which must be met does not excuse the manner in which some taxpayers have been treated by the department. We do not consider that the department needs to use the threat of sanction as a means to encourage compliance to the extent that it currently does. The vast majority of taxpayers will willingly comply with their obligations, as long as they are treated civilly and are made aware of their responsibilities. We do not question that the law will at times need to be firmly enforced. However, we believe that the pendulum has swung too far towards the use of sanctions and threats to enforce compliance. Taxpayer satisfaction must become paramount for the department. Having said that, we do not wish to denigrate the department’s employees. We believe, however, that the level of communication between National Office and the coalface needs improvement. The Public Service Association spoke to us of a culture of “ punishment and fear” in the department and of management imperatives which stress efficiency and speed over quality of service. It believes such an approach can lead to undue pressure being placed on staff to meet unrealistic or inappropriate performance targets, which in turn can lead to a breakdown in the department’s relationships with taxpayers. What we consider is required is an attitudinal shift. This shift needs to come from senior management and involve a restatement of values focussing on the needs of the department’s customers. We consider that it is imperative that the Commissioner strongly re- emphasise to staff the importance of the values and behaviours that contribute to a strong organisational culture. There are currently seven Organisational Commitments which were developed in 1996 and are included in the department’s Code of Conduct for staff. They are: 51 I. 3I • Recognising and meeting customer needs. Providing an effective customer service by pursuing excellence and being fair, efficient and responsive to the diverse needs of customers, and constantly looking for better ways of doing things. • Highly ethical behaviour. Maintaining the highest standards of trust, confidentiality and integrity in work and relationships with others. • Positive work environment. Encouraging open communication and cooperation, making use of the widest range of skills, experience and diversity and providing opportunities for development. • Encouraging voluntary compliance. Seeking to make compliance easier and less costly while being fair and firm with non-compliers. • Recognising the importance of cooperation. Working together to improve job satisfaction and achieve better results. • Treaty of Waitangi obligations. Seeking to meet treaty obligations and providing opportunities for staff to further develop their understanding of Māori and their working relationships with Māori. • Exercising good judgement. Exercising good judgement while promptly correcting any mistakes and learning from them. We understand that these commitments form the base on which core competencies for staff are built. We consider the commitments themselves, if adhered to, are appropriate to the work the department has to undertake. Clearly, however, the evidence we heard points towards instances where these commitments were not being followed, and an example not being set by senior management. Our attention was drawn to inappropriate cartoons in the department’s internal practice documents. While we accept the Commissioner’s statement that no one in the current senior management team was aware of the cartoons until recently, their very existence indicates the commitments are not being reinforced adequately. While this specific issue has been addressed, it is the Commissioner’s duty to ensure that all staff are made aware of the commitments and to take action where it is demonstrated that they are not being followed. We expect this duty to be carried out. Affecting cultural change in an organisation the size of the department is not a task which should be taken on lightly. However, we consider such a change is necessary to complement the proposed changes in policy and legislation outlined in this report and to maintain the integrity of the tax system. We understand that improvements in staff training will be made to assist in improving the culture. Training will focus on communication skills and customer service training as well as courses in negotiation techniques for debt management staff. We welcome these initiatives. We recommend that the department implement, as a matter of priority, a nationally consistent training programme aimed at improving communication and customer service skills. The department is also reviewing the form of its system-generated correspondence to improve, to an acceptable professional standard, its content and tone. Many submissions noted the heavy-handed tone of much I. 3I 52 of this type of correspondence from the department and we are encouraged that the department has pledged to act to remedy this. Staff require greater interaction with business community We consider that the department’s relationships with small taxpayers often break down because the department does not understand sufficiently the pressures facing small businesses in meeting their tax obligations. We consider this could be remedied in part by the department initiating a programme whereby officers of the department in areas such as debt management and operations get given the opportunity to interact more frequently with the business community and small business in particular. This would enable them to get a feel for the pressures businesses work under and help to improve the working relationship between the department and business. We recommend the department consider implementing a programme along similar lines to the Business and Parliament Trust, which would enable staff to build relationships with and have greater exposure to the business community. Understanding of law Tax legislation is extremely complex. The practice of tax law is considered one of the most intellectually demanding areas in large corporate law firms. We consider that improving the department’s understanding of the law is primarily a human resource issue. The department needs to attract and retain skilled tax professionals. The department’s work programme for 1999/2000 includes the implementation of new remuneration structures to ensure pay levels are appropriate to the market in those areas in particular where technically skilled staff are required to be recruited and retained. The majority of us have no comment to make as to whether the department acted competently with respect to seeking prosecutions on “ winebox” transactions. This issue has been comprehensively examined in the courts and the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters Relating to Taxation. We note that the Commissioner is seeking the advice of the Solicitor-General with respect to prosecuting those involved in certain winebox transactions following the recent High Court ruling overturning findings of the Commission of Inquiry. We consider this is an appropriate step to take. Taxpayers’ charter Many submissions raised the idea of establishing a charter of taxpayers’ rights. Currently the department has a customer charter which sets out very simply what a taxpayer’s rights and obligations are when dealing with the department. We do not believe that this customer charter goes far enough. Very few people are aware of its existence, and a taxpayers’ charter should be widely advertised so all taxpayers are aware of what is expected of them and the department when being audited. A more comprehensive taxpayers’ charter could be based on the following which is drawn from charters in other tax jurisdictions: 53 I. 3I This Charter deals with your rights and obligations and the level of service you will receive in your dealings with the Inland Revenue Department. While you are obliged to co-operate with the audit process, these rights are designed to protect you from unreasonable demands, to minimise disruption of your business or personal life during the audit, and to protect you from arbitrary actions. 1. Co-operation and Professionalism 1.1 We will be client focussed and co-operative. 1.2 We will act ethically and with honesty and integrity. 1.3 We will treat you in a professional, objective and fair manner. 2. Assistance 2.1 We will help you understand our processes and practices regarding tax collection. 2.2 W e will provide you with information concerning your taxation obligations. 2.3 W e will explain our decisions under the tax laws and will advise you of the identity of, and enable you to directly contact, the decision maker. 3. Privacy & Confidentiality 3.1 We respect your privacy and will treat all information collected or received as private and confidential. 3.2 This information will be kept secure and will only be used or disclosed in accordance with the law. 4. Service Orientation 4.1 We will treat you with courtesy and respect. 4.2 W e will provide competent, timely and consistent service. 4.3 W e will respond promptly to your letters and telephone calls. 5. Investigations 5.1 Where practicable we will give you reasonable notice of our intention to conduct an investigation. 5.2 We will arrange a suitable time and place for an interview and allow you time to prepare your records. 5.3 We will explain the audit process and will advise you o f the scope and nature of our enquiries. 5.4 We will give you an indication o f how long the audit should take. 5.5 On completion of the audit we will formally notify you of the result. 6. Right to instalment arrangement You can request to enter into an instalment arrangement if you; Have filed your returns and paid tax on time for the past five years; and Have not entered into an instalment arrangement before. 7. Objection, Review and Appeal 7.1 We will explain your rights and the process to you. 7.2 W e will ensure that your objections are dealt with by an independent officer and without bias. 7.3 If your objection is partially or fully disallowed we will provide you with a formal statement of reasons. 7.4 If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of an objection you have the right to lodge an appeal. 8. Your obligations 8.1 We are committed to treating your complaints seriously and will endeavour to resolve them quickly and efficiently. 8.2 If you believe your rights as detailed in this Charter have not been adequately met please contact the Complaints Centre. I. 3I 54 A further issue is whether there should be a time limit on taxpayer audits. Some submissions suggested that the department has all the power when conducting an audit. This power imbalance causes unnecessary and unwanted stress. There are many obligations imposed on the taxpayer, but the perception is that the department has few, if any, obligations imposed on it. Many of the suggestions contained in the taxpayers’ charter help to redress this concern through a commitment to responding to correspondence and phone conversations in a timely manner. Including a time limit on taxpayer audits would go one step further in imposing an obligation on the department to raise its efficiency standards and complete audits as quickly as possible. For this to work the taxpayer would in turn have to ensure all documents were provided as quickly as possible. We believe a taxpayers’ charter similar to one outlined above would be advantageous in New Zealand. We would expect it to be widely publicised to ensure that all New Zealanders were aware of its content. We recommend that the department establish a taxpayers’ charter to outline to taxpayers their rights and obligations in respect of the tax system. Conclusion We are pleased to see that in the wake of our inquiry the Government has announced proposals to make a number of policy and administrative changes to enhance the fairness and clarity of the tax system. It is also pleasing to see steps being taken to simplify the tax system for small businesses. This should reduce compliance costs and make it easier for businesses to meet their obligations. However, we consider that more is required for perceptions of the fairness of the tax system to improve markedly. Our recommendations, if acted on will, in our view, greatly contribute towards this. In addition to legislative and policy changes, we consider a shift in culture is necessary. We note that an effort has begun. However, more is required to ensure that the focus of the department is on achieving the highest standards of service possible to taxpayers. We consider that the next Finance and Expenditure Committee has a significant role to play in continuing to examine the powers and operations of the department. Primarily, we suggest the next committee should: • closely examine the outcome of the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties regime • review the effectiveness of the department’s new organisational structure to assess whether service to taxpayers has been improved • assess the adequacy of the Government’s response to the recommendations in this report. 55 I. 3I Appendix A Terms of reference The Finance and Expenditure Committee resolved to conduct an inquiry into the powers and operations of the Inland Revenue Department on 3 March 1999, with the following terms of reference: (a) To review the powers of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to assess and collect income tax pursuant to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and other relevant Acts and to assess whether these powers are justified. (b) To review the Inland Revenue Department’s application of the compliance and penalties regime established under the tax Acts, including the process by which and the rate at which use of money interest is set, and also the simultaneous application of compounding late penalty payments. (c) To review the debt management practices and the adequacy of the powers of the Inland Revenue Department to remit tax liabilities or enter into arrangements for deferring the payment of tax and the department’s operation of its powers. (d) To examine the feasibility and desirability of establishing a tax ombudsman to investigate taxpayer complaints. (e) To review whether the structure, operation and culture of the Inland Revenue Department, and its understanding of the law, have affected the department’s application of the compliance and penalties regimes and the service it provides to taxpayers and their agents. Approach to inquiry We invited certain organisations to make submissions on the inquiry. We also called for public submissions with a closing date of 30 April 1999. Hearing evidence took 52 hours, including over 12 hours from the department. We spent a further nine hours in consideration. We received 188 public submissions on the inquiry from the organisations and individuals listed in Appendix B. We heard 53 submissions in public.

Supplementary Briefing Papers VOLUME 1 Tax Policy November 1999 Preface Inland Revenue has prepared two volumes of briefing papers on tax policy issues to supplement its briefing. The first volume, comprising four chapters, outlines the functions of, and the types of issues addressed by, the Policy Advice Division. Chapter 1 discusses the policy process. Its purpose is to outline the types of services supplied by the division to assist you to perform your important role in tax, social, and fiscal policy. It highlights the need for you to develop a protocol with the Treasury Ministers to clarify the precise role you are expected to play in these important policy areas. Chapter 2 then discusses tax design issues. Its purpose is to assist you in understanding your tax policy role as Minister of Revenue by discussing a number of topical tax policy issues. The chapter outlines the objectives of the tax system and highlights a number of important constraints to the process of tax reform. Chapter 3 discusses the tax policy work programme. The focus of tax reform has shifted over the last decade from an emphasis on fundamental tax base issues to an emphasis on base maintenance (anti-avoidance measures) and tax simplification. This chapter outlines and discusses the main issues that comprise the current tax policy work programme. A review and update of the work programme is a priority issue for you to discuss with the Treasury Ministers. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the New Zealand tax system. It illustrates how the tax system has changed since the early 1980s as a result of the process of tax reform. It describes personal taxation, company taxation, GST, and international tax, as well as the taxation of savings, and outlines the manner in which those taxes are assessed and collected. It also provides statistics on the revenue collected by the tax system.

Revenue advises the Government on all aspects of tax policy. This is the responsibility of the department’s Policy Advice Division. The division is a small, multi-disciplinary team of professionals that includes lawyers, accountants, economists, statisticians, and other people with experience in tax and business. The division has 31 tax policy analysts out of 65 total staff members. It comprises eight units, in addition to its internal management support unit: • The GST Unit is responsible for the review of GST, codifying taxpayer self- assessment, and several income tax base maintenance issues. • The Business/International Unit is responsible for policy issues related to tax simplification, the review of the compliance and penalties legislation, and the timing of business income and deductions. It is also responsible for international tax policy issues; negotiating, maintaining and interpreting New Zealand’s double tax agreements with other countries; and contributing to international organisations involved in tax issues, including the OECD and APEC. • Company Tax Projects is responsible for projects such as company interest deductibility for tax purposes. • The Tax and Social Policy Unit is responsible for business and personal tax policy and social policy measures that interact with the tax system – such as family support, the family-plus package of tax credits, child support and the student loan scheme. • The Law Drafting Unit drafts all tax legislation except regulations and assists with the passage of bills through Parliament. The specialist unit was set up in 1995 on the recommendation of Sir Ivor Richardson (now President of the Court of Appeal), who headed the organisational review of Inland Revenue. In many cases tax legislation had become very difficult to read and understand, which added to the costs of administering and complying with the law. The new Law Drafting Unit was set up to overcome these problems. The Richardson review considered it highly desirable that tax law drafting be carried out by the same organisation that provided tax policy advice. • The Rewrite Project Team is responsible for rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994. The aim is to improve the Act’s structure, make the interrelationship between the parts of the Act explicit, and use a plain language style of drafting. Clarification of the law will minimise the compliance costs faced by taxpayers. The team consists of a number of legislative drafters as well as policy analysts. • The Forecasting and Analysis Unit forecasts future tax flows independently of the Treasury, and appraises Treasury forecasts before they are finalised. It also forecasts other Crown Revenues and Expenses administered by Inland Revenue, reports Chapter 1 Page 2 monthly on accrued revenues and cash receipts against forecasts, and analyses the revenue implications of tax and social policy proposals. • The Ministerial Services Unit provides staff for the Minister of Revenue’s office to act as an interface with the department, and co-ordinates the drafting of responses to correspondence and parliamentary questions received by the Minster of Revenue. It also provides services to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue relating to correspondence with individual taxpayers, including official information and privacy issues and dealings with the office of Ombudsmen. The Finance and Expenditure Committee in its report, Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department, recommended that consideration be given to transferring our legislative drafting functions back to Parliamentary Counsel’s Office. The report does not refer to Sir Ivor Richardson’s review, nor the reasons given in that review for establishing tax law drafting responsibilities within Inland Revenue. Any decisions to alter current tax law drafting responsibilities would have a significant impact on our Law Drafting Unit and Rewrite Project Team, as well as on the functions of the Policy Advice Division. The policy development process Since 1995 tax policy has been developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP), a process designed to produce better, more effective tax policy. The main objectives of the GTPP are to: • encourage earlier, explicit consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs by Ministers; • provide opportunities for substantial external input into the policy formulation process, which is intended to increase transparency and to provide for greater contestability and quality of advice at both the conceptual and detailed design stages; • clarify the responsibilities and accountabilities of participants in the process; • improve the management of the tax policy process; and • ensure that the performance of tax policy initiatives, as well as the process of reform, is reviewed regularly. The GTPP represents a significant improvement in the way tax policy is developed and in tax reform generally. Major tax initiatives are now subjected to much greater public scrutiny at key stages in their development. The process enables us to develop more practical options for change, through consultation with professional associations, tax practitioners and those who will be affected by the proposed reforms. The ability of the GTPP to produce better tax policy than prior processes has been recognised domestically and internationally. For example, the key theme of establishing processes for consultation has been adopted as a recommendation by the Ralph Committee’s 1999 report reviewing the Australian tax system. The Policy Process Page 3 The GTPP, detailed in figure 1, has five key development stages: • Strategic : This involves the development of an economic strategy, a fiscal strategy and a three-year revenue strategy. • Tactical: This involves the development of a three-year work programme and an annual resource plan. • Operational: This involves detailed policy design, formal detailed consultation, and Ministerial and Cabinet approval of detailed policy recommendations. • Legislative: This stage, which can occur concurrently with the operational stage, involves the translation of the detailed policy recommendations into legislation. • Implementation and review: This involves the implementation of legislation, the post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues.

Legislative Drafting (phases 6 - 12) Chapter 1 Page 4 Consultation and communication A key feature of the GTPP is the emphasis it places on communication and consultation at each of the main stages of the process. As manager of the process, Inland Revenue devotes a large proportion of the Policy Advice Division’s resources to: • facilitating discussions between Ministers on tax issues; • preparing discussion documents and issues papers that identify problems with the tax system and evaluate alternative options for reform; • ensuring that interested parties are consulted and their concerns are taken into account in the policy development process; • publishing commentaries on taxation bills before Parliament • drafting legislation and assisting the passage of bills though Parliament and parliamentary select committees; • reviewing the effectiveness of new legislation after it is implemented; and • keeping the interested public informed of policy and legislative developments through various means, including our specialised tax policy web site at http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz . Respective roles of Inland Revenue and the Treasury One of the main aims of the GTPP is to clarify the responsibilities and accountabilities of all participants in the process of tax policy development, particularly the respective roles to be played by Inland Revenue and the Treasury. The Policy Advice Division has been primarily responsible for the detailed design, implementation and review of tax policy, meaning the operational, legislative, implementation and review stages of the process. We manage the policy process through these stages. The Treasury has been primarily responsible for the strategic stage of the process, although we take part in it. This involves integration of the Government’s economic, fiscal and three-year revenue strategies. The revenue strategy sets the Government’s broad objectives in the tax area and this establishes priorities for setting the tax policy work programme. The last revenue strategy, agreed in 1996, is included as Appendix A. Within these broadly defined roles, it is up to the two departments and their respective Ministers to determine where the comparative advantage of each department lies, and to ensure that the roles and responsibilities of the two departments are defined in accordance with those comparative advantages. The Policy Process Page 5 An important aspect of this is the need for Ministers to develop a protocol between themselves, establishing their respective policy roles. The protocol between Inland Revenue and the Treasury could then be updated to reflect Ministers’ respective responsibilities. Because there have been a number of Ministers with overlapping responsibilities in the tax area, the early development of protocols has been important to ensure the smooth functioning of tax policy development. Past protocols have emphasised the need for information-sharing on joint advice and decision-making. Included as Appendix B is the protocol between Inland Revenue and the Treasury that has been applicable to date. Tax policy work programme The objective of the tactical stage of the GTPP is to develop a tax policy work programme that gives effect to the Government’s three-year revenue strategy. The preparation of the rolling three-year work programme involves: • The initial scoping and conceptualisation of broad policy proposals. External input can be useful at this stage of the process. • Prioritising and sequencing the development of tax policy initiatives. In the course of refining the rolling three-year work programme, the annual work and resource plan is developed. This involves consideration of: • the budgeted resource requirements to develop the initiatives specified in the rolling three year work programme; • the estimated time-frames for developing, legislating and implementing these policy initiatives in the year ahead; and • the strategy for obtaining external input through the public release of a more detailed “white paper” and communicating policy decisions. The tactical stage of the GTPP culminates in a joint report by Inland Revenue and Treasury to the Treasury Ministers and the Minister of Revenue that provides a detailed outline of the tax policy work programme proposed by officials. Officials will report to Ministers on a proposed work programme as soon as possible. Once approved by Ministers and Cabinet, that joint tax policy work programme in effect becomes a detailed tax policy purchase agreement between Treasury Ministers and the Minister of Revenue and their respective departments. Page 6 Chapter 2 Tax Design Issues The issues facing the Policy Advice Division Introduction The past few years have seen considerable public debate over the appropriate direction of tax reform in New Zealand. There is a reasonable consensus that New Zealand needs a tax system that is capable of raising sufficient revenue to finance expenditure and debt repayment in a manner that is consistent with the economic and social policy objectives of the Government of the day. However, there is considerable debate about the precise nature of a tax system that is capable of achieving such objectives. Much of the debate arises from the inherent conflict between the objectives of the tax system. The most efficient tax systems, which raise money at the least cost to the nation as a whole, such as poll taxes, are not necessarily the most equitable. Similarly, simpler taxes may be inefficient and unfair. As a result, complex trade-offs need to be made between the conflicting objectives of efficiency, simplicity and equity. This requires the exercise of considerable judgement, and inevitably results in differences of opinion over where to strike the appropriate balance. The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate the complex nature of some of these trade-offs by reference to some topical tax policy issues. Changing rates of personal income tax Appropriate tax scale design, a prominent issue in the lead-up to the election, raises three very important matters. The first is the time required for any changes to the personal tax rates to be enacted. The second is the appropriate progressivity of the personal tax rate structure. The third is the relationship between individual tax rates and the rest of the income tax system. Timing of personal income tax rate changes The introduction of a tax rate change requires a minimum of two months between enactment and implementation. This period of time is required by businesses to make necessary administrative changes to allow them to comply with the law (although some private sector payroll firms have indicated that even this minimum time is really too short, and three to four months is the desirable lead-time). Payroll software developers require this time to incorporate Inland Revenue’s new payroll software specifications into their payroll packages and to test and market the new products. Employers also need to make changes to and test their payroll systems. Tax Design Issues Page 7 From a policy perspective, this means that legislation for tax rate changes needs to fit within a tight timeframe. For example, legislation changing tax rates from the 2000-01 income year would have to be enacted by late January 2000 for the new scale to apply from 1 April 2000 and for retrospective legislation to be avoided. A similar process is required for resident withholding tax collected by banks if tax rate changes affect these rates. Payers of interest such as banks would then need to modify their resident withholding tax systems. If a new withholding rate needs to be implemented, payers of interest may also be required to seek elections from account holders. A tax rate change also has consequences for provisional tax payments, particularly if the rate change takes effect part way through an income year. Provisional taxpayers are able to determine their provisional tax payments either by direct reference to the amount of tax payable in a proceeding year, or by estimating their liability. If tax rates are changed part way through a year, use of money interest implications could arise for payments that have already been made. A tax cut could result in the Government paying interest to taxpayers who overestimate their tax liabilities. A tax increase could result in taxpayers underestimating their tax liabilities, thus incurring interest. The Government would not receive the full amount of tax revenue until terminal tax is paid (for the 2000-01 year, generally 7 April 2002). Therefore the Government should exercise caution when deciding on the timing of any changes to tax rates. Consideration should be given to administrative measures required for the introduction of tax rate changes, the impact on taxpayers and the effect on the timing of Government revenue. For these reasons, if changes in tax rates are to be effective by 1 April 2000, and if retrospective effect is to be avoided, tax rate changes need to be legislated by late January 2000. Tax scale design Ideally, tax reform should improve the ability of the tax system to raise and redistribute income in an equitable and efficient manner. Attempts to improve efficiency, however, may result in a reduction of the overall equity of the tax system. Conversely, increasing the progressivity of the tax scale may decrease the efficiency of the tax system. Although raising marginal tax rates for individuals may be seen as resulting in greater equity, it may also cause: • increased disincentives to save and invest; • distortions in patterns of investment and choice of organisational form (that is, lowering the quality of investment); Chapter 2 Page 8 • increased compliance costs, because of: -the increased incentive for high-income taxpayers to increase their involvement in tax planning schemes (see, for example, the section on schemes targeted at high income individuals in chapter 3); -the likelihood that tax law will be more complex in attempting to reduce the scope for such schemes, which is inconsistent with the objective of simplifying the tax system; • the increased administrative costs associated with the increased need to audit high- income taxpayers, exercise anti-avoidance provisions and introduce additional provisions in the Income Tax Act to reduce the scope for tax planning schemes. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the progressivity of New Zealand’s income tax system. As individuals’ income rises, so does their average income tax rate, reflecting the higher marginal income tax rates for income earned over $38,000, and the abatement of family assistance. 1 F IGURE 2: A VERAGE INCOME TAX RATES OF INDIVIDUALS FOR YEAR ENDED M ARCH 1998 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% $1 to $10,000 $10,001 to $20,000 $20,001 to $30,000 $30,001 to $40,000 $40,001 to $50,000 $50,001 to $60,000 $60,001 to $70,000 $70,001 to $80,000 $80,001 to $90,000 $90,001 to $100,000 Individuals Total Taxable Income Average Income Tax Rate 1 Income tax is net of family assistance, hence the existence of taxpayers with no taxable income and negative income tax (income tax refunds).

They comprise 26% of all individual taxpayers, but pay 73% of the personal income tax collected. It should be noted, however, that only about half of this tax relates to income over $30,000. The greatest amount of revenue raised by income band is on the first $10,000 of taxpayers’ income, which raises $3,730 million, or 27% of all personal income tax collected. This is illustrated in figure 4.

The top personal marginal tax rate is currently aligned with withholding tax rates on interest and dividends. It is also aligned with the company, trustee, fringe benefit and superannuation contribution tax rates. Changing the top personal marginal tax rates while leaving these other tax rates unchanged could affect the efficiency, simplicity and equity of the tax system. Although alignment could be preserved by changing the tax rates on other forms of income, this would also entail efficiency costs and increased complexity, and may not meet the equity objectives that alignment is designed to achieve. In particular, the administrative and compliance costs from the introduction of a greater number of statutory tax rates would be higher. Resident withholding tax on interest income, for example, is currently collected by banks. Increasing the number of statutory tax rates on interest income would require banks to withhold either at the varying tax rates or at one rate, with taxpayers filing a tax return at the end of the income year under the later option. Inland Revenue would then reconcile any overpayment or underpayment of tax. This would re-introduce the requirement for a large number of salary and wage earners to file returns. Taxes and economic growth The adverse effects of taxation There is a growing concern internationally about the adverse effects of taxation on domestic savings and investment, and potentially on economic growth. The general trend amongst OECD countries has been towards lower rates of tax on income from capital. There remains, however, uncertainty surrounding the effects of taxation on economic growth. This uncertainty is highlighted both in Inland Revenue’s report on research commissioned by the department (see the Report on Research Commissioned by Inland Revenue in Volume 2 of this Supplementary Briefing) and in a 1997 OECD report on taxation and growth 2 . Although the precise relationship between taxes and growth is unclear, taxes can and do have significant unintended effects on decisions. Such unintended effects are likely to affect adversely New Zealand’s economic performance. It is well recognised that taxes impose costs on the community by: • discouraging saving and investment, consumption and production; and • encouraging inefficient patterns of consumption, production and resource use (including the costs that Inland Revenue incurs in administering the tax system, as well as the costs taxpayers incur in order to comply with their obligations under the tax system). 2 Leibdfritz, W., Thornton, J. & Bibbee, A. (1997) Taxation and Economic Performance, Economics Department Working Paper No.176, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Paris. Tax Design Issues Page 11 Although some of these costs are difficult to measure, analysis to date indicates that the overall costs of taxation are high. Tax reform may be reducing those costs to some extent, but there remains a concern that the costs of taxation may be rising as a result of an increased sensitivity of decisions to taxation. These sensitivities arise from factors such as: • the opening up of world markets and the removal of obstacles to trade and foreign investment; and • the increasing mobility of financial, human and physical capital – hence the increasing relevance of tax disparities. It is important, therefore, that tax reform be aimed at improving the efficiency of the tax system, and that it recognise the costs of raising tax revenue when evaluating the benefits of further Government expenditure financed through taxation. Effects of taxing the income of non-residents It is reasonable to seek to impose taxes on non-residents on income sourced from New Zealand. This recognises that domestic resources (including infrastructure) are being used to generate profits. Taxing non-residents, however, deters inbound investment. It is also possible that the cost of the tax may be passed on to the domestic economy, distorting domestic production and investment decisions such that the economy may be potentially worse off than if no tax were imposed. The issue, therefore, is how to raise a given amount of revenue at minimal cost to the New Zealand economy. This in turn raises the question of the appropriate rates at which to tax foreign investment. There is a trade-off between the desire to raise a given level of tax revenue from investment while still attracting that foreign investment. The sensitivity of foreign investment to income tax rates will depend on the availability of alternative investments. Foreign portfolio investment, which is highly mobile, is likely to be very sensitive to New Zealand tax rates. Foreign direct investment, by contrast, is likely to be less sensitive to New Zealand tax rates, because of the longer-term nature of such investment – tax is only one factor amongst many that are considered in the decision to locate such investments in New Zealand, and may not necessarily be the most influential factor. Most foreign investment into New Zealand is in the form of debt or corporate equity. Interest paid to foreigners is generally taxed at a very low rate (1.34%) under the approved issuer levy rules. The tax on corporate equity investment (shares owned by foreigners) is determined by a combination of the company tax rate and withholding taxes on dividends. Because of the foreign investor tax credit rules, the maximum tax rate on foreign equity investment from the combination of company and withholding taxes is set at 33% – the company tax rate. It is important to note, therefore, that the real rate of tax on foreign investment is not set by reference to the company tax rate alone, but is a combination of the tax impost on debt and equity investment. This allows more room for the company tax rate to be set to meet domestic tax policy objectives. Chapter 2 Page 12 The proper balance for appropriately taxing inward foreign investment is an ongoing issue requiring careful analysis. For example, a recently released discussion document on interest deductibility proposes an increase in the minimum equity financing of companies controlled by a single non-resident. Taxing consumption by non-residents New Zealand’s goods and services tax (GST) aims to tax consumption that occurs in New Zealand. To a limited extent, this will deter the consumption of goods and services in New Zealand by non-residents. Again, there exists a trade-off between raising the required revenue and minimising the deterrent effect of New Zealand’s GST. At issue is the appropriate rate at which to apply GST to goods and services consumed in New Zealand by non-residents. This rate depends upon the sensitivity of consumption by non- residents to New Zealand rates of GST. The GST rules zero-rate goods and services destined for consumption by non-residents while they are overseas. This is because demand for most New Zealand exports is expected to be highly price-sensitive. If GST were imposed on exports, most of the incidence would be shifted back onto New Zealand exporters since New Zealand is a price taker in world markets. New Zealand does, however, impose GST on imported goods. Just as goods exported from and consumed outside New Zealand should not attract GST, goods imported and consumed within New Zealand should be subject to GST. Since GST taxes consumption in New Zealand, this prevents imports being tax-favoured over domestically produced goods. Imported services (other than domestic freight and insurance services associated with imported goods) were not originally included in the GST base because of the practical difficulties in doing so and the limited volume of services imported into New Zealand in the late 1980s. However, the consequences of not taxing imported services are that some businesses and consumers may have a preference for purchasing imported rather than domestically supplied services. The relative price of imported services as consumer products or as inputs into production is lower than domestically supplied services. The effect of this distortion on relative prices will depend upon the degree to which imported and domestically supplied services are substitutes and the sensitivity of consumers and producers to the difference in the relative prices. For example, New Zealand’s telecommunications sector is particularly sensitive to the decision not to impose GST on imported telecommunications services because of the high degree of substitutability of their products. The tax policy work programme includes work identifying the advantages and disadvantages of introducing GST on imported services (see chapter 3). Tax Design Issues Page 13 Options for reducing the adverse effects of taxation Targeting taxation at certain activities Generally, the objective of targeted taxation is to change the level of investment, production or consumption of a certain activity in a way that provides net benefits to the economy. For example, the current tax system imposes specific excises on certain goods such as alcohol and tobacco. The aim is to use the tax system to penalise the consumption and reduce the production of these goods because of the adverse externalities they cause, such as higher health care costs. Similarly, lower tax rates are often proposed for certain activities to: • reduce the adverse effects of the tax system on New Zealand’s economy (such as distortions caused by too-high rates of tax on the income of non-residents, or on consumption in New Zealand by non-residents); • address some perceived failure in the market mechanism to allocate sufficient resources to a particular activity (such as the provision of explicit tax concessions to stimulate certain activities such as research and development). To evaluate whether initiatives for tax relief are necessary, detailed information is required on just how sensitive such activities are to changes in tax rates. When evaluating the use of tax concessions as a means of addressing perceived market failure, a threshold question is whether there is a case for Government intervention. If a case does exist, the question must then be asked: are tax concessions the most appropriate instrument with which to achieve the Government’s objectives? In theory, tax concessions may encourage investment and production in a certain activity. In practice, however, they may not achieve this objective. Tax concessions tend to be relatively inefficient instruments because of difficulties associated with: • monitoring and controlling the amount of the subsidy provided – tax concessions can provide an open-ended and non-transparent form of assistance; and • restricting access to the subsidy to the intended recipients – it is extremely difficult to prevent the benefits of the subsidy from flowing to unintended persons (for example, to high-income taxpayers in the form of increased tax deductions). Research and development has recently been highlighted as an area where tax concessions might provide benefits to the economy as a whole. This area forms part of the current tax policy work programme (see chapter 3). Again, the general problem in contemplating tax concessions for research and development is that they can be difficult to target. For example, tax credits tend to favour more established firms over new firms because the latter are more likely to be in a tax loss position and will not be able to take advantage of the incentives. Similarly, accelerated depreciation allowances favour investment in capital goods that depreciate quickly because frequent investment results in greater claims on the allowance. Chapter 2 Page 14 It is necessary, therefore, to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of tax concessions against other forms of assistance, such as direct subsidies. Similar considerations apply when looking at using the tax system to discourage certain activities. Analysis of carbon taxes falls into this category. Simplifying the tax system Administrative and compliance costs also form part of the economic costs of the tax system. Minimising the adverse effects of these costs can be achieved by simplifying the tax system, which is an important part of the current tax policy work programme (see chapter 3). It should be noted, however, that simplification often conflicts with the neutrality and equity of the tax system. This was recognised by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in its report Tax Compliance (December 1998). An example highlighted in that report is the taxation of income from superannuation funds. Income in a savings institution that belongs to an individual whose marginal tax rate is less than 33% is still taxed at the highest marginal rate. Proposals last year to tax individual savers at their appropriate marginal rate were necessarily complex because superannuation funds pool the contributions of their members and do not regularly pay dividends. Ultimately, they were not enacted. This case illustrates the trade-off that often exists between the equity of the tax system and the need for simplicity. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (at Paragraph 1.11) noted that the efficiency costs of the tax system far exceed the more visible compliance and administrative costs imposed by taxes. Care needs to be taken before simplifying taxes at the cost of a less efficient tax system. Work is being undertaken on initiatives to simplify the tax system aimed at reducing the compliance costs faced by small businesses. It is anticipated that this will best be achieved through reducing the costs imposed on businesses in meeting their day-to-day tax obligations, such at those imposed by provisional tax, PAYE, GST and fringe benefit tax. For example, better aligning tax payment dates with businesses’ cash flows may reduce compliance costs while potentially also easing cash flow management. Seeking to reduce the stress associated with tax is also of considerable importance. Current tax simplification initiatives are discussed further in chapter 3. Base maintenance Maintaining the integrity of the tax base from erosion arising from tax planning schemes is also a means to reduce the unintended effects of taxation. This is true regardless of the tax scale. Base maintenance protects the tax revenue required by the Government to meet its expenditure commitments. It also prevents the inefficient allocation of resources to the design and use of tax planning schemes, and the resultant undermining of the effectiveness of targeted tax policy. For this reason, base maintenance issues form an important part of the current tax policy work programme (see chapter 3). Tax Design Issues Page 15 The Policy Advice Division collates information from Rulings and other areas of Inland Revenue on base risks. Although we have maintained an active base maintenance legislative programme, identified risks tend to exceed the ability to legislate against them. The New Zealand company tax base is especially susceptible to base erosion. That is because it is especially reliant on the banking/finance sector (see chapter 4), a sector that has the cash flow and technical resources to implement sophisticated tax planning. There is also evidence in more recent times of increased tax planning by high-income individuals. Examples of this were the film schemes legislated against in September this year. The tax treatment of savings The taxation of savings is commonly perceived to encompass only the taxation of long-term, low-risk investment schemes, namely superannuation and life insurance policies. In fact, such schemes form only part of the income from capital available to individuals. Other forms of investment include the purchase of residential housing, shareholdings or bank deposits. When considering the tax treatment of savings, it is important to do so in the context of all other investment alternatives. The taxation of savings is efficient if investment decisions are not driven by their respective tax treatment. That is, the tax treatment of savings should be consistent with the tax treatment attributed to all forms of income from capital. To avoid distortions in investment decisions, savings must be taxed at the same rate at which other forms of investment are taxed. Under a comprehensive income tax system, all income from savings is taxed as it is derived. Savings are taxed on a taxed-taxed-exempt basis. This approach operates as follows: • Contributions by an investor to an investment entity are made out of taxed income. • The investment entity is subject to tax on income derived from the use of the investor’s funds. • Withdrawals and distributions of the tax-paid investment income are non-taxable in the investor’s hands. Our tax system broadly applies this approach, whether investors’ funds are invested in superannuation funds, life insurance funds, banks or companies. Other forms of investment, however, are treated differently. For example, the tax system favours investment in owner- occupied housing (as it does in many OECD countries) because, generally, neither any capital gain arising from the investment nor the imputed rent is taxed. Most investment gains, such as the gains from shares on revenue account by a company, are taxed. However, when a person holds shares on capital account, any gains are untaxed capital gains. This encourages individuals to invest in their own assets rather than through collective investment vehicles (such as funds managed by financial intermediaries). Chapter 2 Page 16 As a practical matter, determining the boundary between non-taxable capital gains and taxed investments can be difficult because of the ease with which investors can substitute one form of investment for another. The base maintenance section of the tax policy work programme addresses problems of this kind, such as arrangements in which high-income individuals invest in schemes that yield non-taxable capital gains. Schemes that highlight the relative ease in some cases with which income from labour can be recharacterised as capital gains are also on the base maintenance work programme. An example of this is the use of restrictive covenants to replace remuneration. Although taxing capital gains would address the boundary issue, Government policy to date has been not to tax such gains. Instead, the aim has been to improve the efficiency of the present income tax system. Taxing capital gains in a more systematic and comprehensive manner than the current system would provide some benefits, including possibly increased revenue. The main advantage, however, would be to improve the neutrality, fairness, and efficiency of the current system. Taxing capital gains would not, however, be without its difficulties. For example, if capital gains were to be taxed comprehensively, it would be necessary to impose tax on gains on an accruals basis. In practice, such an approach is unlikely to be feasible. The main difficulty associated with taxing capital gains is the measurement of the changes in asset values on an accrual (unrealised) basis. Such measurement involves considerable compliance costs from valuing assets on a regular basis, and it may be necessary to continue to tax some forms of income only on a realisation basis. Capital gains also implicitly include some measure of inflation that could potentially be captured by taxation. The issue of how to tax savings, and investment generally, is therefore complex. Whether the tax system exempts certain forms of capital gains does not alter the fact that income tax discourages savings by reducing the return that the saver or investor receives. The current tax policy work programme focuses more on minimising the effect of taxation on favouring some forms of investment over others, rather than trying to influence the overall level of investment. International trend towards lower rates of tax on income from capital Given the difficulties associated with taxing capital gains, and the adverse effects of taxing income from capital, many countries have sought to reduce tax rates on income from capital. Amongst the range of methods that have been suggested for taxing income from capital are: • The split rate system, introduced by the Nordic countries in the early 1990s, in which: -“Personal income”, which includes labour income, private and public pensions and government transfers, is taxed at progressive rates; and -“Capital income” such as interest, dividends and some forms of capital gains, is taxed at a uniform proportional rate equal to the corporate tax rate. Tax Design Issues Page 17 • The reduction of tax rates on certain forms of income from capital. The United States, and more recently Australia, have reduced (or are proposing to reduce) tax rates on some forms of capital. • Exempting certain forms of income from capital such as the disposal of land, shares and other assets. All these approaches to taxing income from capital result in adverse effects on the quality of investment. Providing exemptions or lower tax rates for certain forms of income causes inequities and inefficiencies. Individuals who can choose the form in which they derive their income will be able to take advantage of any preferential treatment of income from capital. These inequities may then be capitalised into the value of assets, creating distortions in the patterns of investment. Ultimately, however, it is the increasing mobility of factors of production in the modern age that is responsible for many of the difficulties. Because factors of production, and capital in particular, are increasingly mobile, investment in different assets is becoming increasingly sensitive to their respective tax treatment. In taxing income from capital, there is a need to be concerned not only with the effect of the tax system on the level of investment, but also the quality of that investment. Our approach to date has been to apply uniform taxation on income from capital and deal with the international mobility issue by taxing New Zealanders on their worldwide income, while carefully constructing rules for the taxation of foreign investment into New Zealand. Australian tax reform Within the past 18 months, the Ralph Committee has undertaken an extensive review of Australia’s business taxation. The Committee released its recommendations to the Australian Government in September 1999. The Australian Government has signalled that it will adopt most of the review’s recommendations, with implementation expected incrementally over three years. The recommendations are linked to the introduction of GST and Australia’s recent overhaul of withholding and provisional taxes. The proposed Australian tax reforms generally mirror New Zealand’s reforms since 1984. However, because of our close economic connections, it is important that developments in Australia be monitored. Some of the more notable proposals in Australia are to: • Reduce the corporate tax rate progressively from 36% to 30% by 1 July 2001. A large part of the resulting revenue loss will be funded by replacing accelerated depreciation with effective life depreciation. Given that New Zealand has a 20% loading to depreciation rates, it may be possible to make a similar trade-off here. Chapter 2 Page 18 • Introduce a simplified system of calculating tax for small businesses, where eligible businesses will be able to calculate income tax on a modified “cash accounting” basis rather than on an “accrual” basis and to pool and depreciate assets on a concessionary basis. • Make substantial changes to future tax policy development. Broadly, the review’s approach is patterned on our own Generic Tax Policy Process. The Ralph Report also raised the possibility of Australia allowing at the shareholder level credits for Australian tax paid by New Zealand companies (and vice versa). The review recognised that a bilateral solution would be preferable to a unilateral solution. We expect to continue working with our Australian counterparts to see if a practicable and mutually beneficial mechanism can be developed. Page 19 Chapter 3 Tax Policy Work Programme The work of the Policy Advice Division The precise role that the Policy Advice Division plays is determined largely by the priorities of the Government. The Policy Advice Division is accountable for commenting on and assisting with the implementation of tax policy directed by the Government. However, a lot of the work of the Policy Advice Division, such as reviewing the effectiveness of existing legislation and seeking to address weaknesses that compromise the integrity of the revenue base, is internally generated, and is a natural and critical function of the policy advice role. Given that resources are finite, the Government will need to direct how the division’s resources are employed, based on the Government’s revenue priorities. This will involve trade-offs, and could result in the Government needing to choose between a number of worthwhile policy initiatives in determining what work is to be pursued. One of the priorities for the new Government, therefore, will be to confirm or amend the work programme. This will also involve considering the priority of a number of remedial issues on which the private sector expects early action. You should also be aware that you will have to consider several issues in your first three months as Minister of Revenue. One example is the statutory obligation to set the interest rate for student loans. We will provide you with a full briefing of current issues, including those that need attention in the immediate future, in our report on developing a tax policy work programme. This report will be sent to you shortly. Focus of current work programme Government focus in the 1980s and early 1990s was on general tax reform. With that significant reform now completed, the focus has shifted more recently to: • addressing issues that might otherwise compromise the integrity of the tax base; • making the tax system more efficient and simpler to comply with; and • resolving tax issues that arise from broader economic reforms, such as the restructuring of various government agencies. Chapter 3 Page 20 This chapter focuses on the nature of the work currently undertaken by the Policy Advice Division: Part One deals with maintaining the integrity of the existing tax system. This is a critical role of the Policy Advice Division, regardless of what broader direction the tax system might take, as it is central to preserving the credibility of existing tax law. Part Two discusses work being undertaken on initiatives to simplify the tax system. These initiatives aim to make it easier for taxpayers to comply with the law, as well as seeking to reduce the adverse effects imposed by the tax system, such as compliance and administrative costs. Part Three considers various tax strategy initiatives. These initiatives seek to give policymakers a better understanding of the effect of certain tax policies, particularly in relation to entity taxation and savings and investment. The conclusions drawn will enhance the formulation of coherent tax policy in the future. Part Four canvasses the day-to-day work of the Policy Advice Division which, although not always high-profile, is important to the continuing health of the tax system. It also highlights the important role that the Policy Advice Division can play in Government initiatives that superficially may not appear to fall under the tax umbrella. Part One: Maintaining the integrity of the tax system A key feature of tax policy work is the importance of maintaining the integrity of the tax system. Enacting new policy as legislation is not the end of the process. If taxpayers can restructure their affairs to circumvent the intended effect of legislation, all that is achieved is that resources that might more productively be used elsewhere are committed instead to avoiding tax, while the Government and the broader economy reap no benefits from what might otherwise be very effective policy. A significant role of the Policy Advice Division is, therefore, to monitor the effectiveness of tax legislation that has been implemented. The Policy Advice Division is in a unique position to undertake this function. As well as employing the staff that have been involved in the process of developing much of existing tax policy and law, our links with the Operations and Rulings Divisions within Inland Revenue, and with numerous tax professionals outside the department, give us access to information other parties are unable to access, and allow us to readily develop an up-to-date picture of potential threats to the tax base. It must be noted, however, that it is not the Policy Advice Division’s responsibility to apply the anti-avoidance provisions in the Tax Acts, nor to police tax evaders. Our role is to identify policy features within the law that are deficient, and to develop solutions to address any weaknesses that are identified. Tax Policy Work Programme Page 21 To this end, an important aspect of the process is consultation. An underlying principle of effective tax administration is that taxpayers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations. If the Government is open about its reasons for pursuing certain policies, the result is a better understanding in the taxpayer community, and better compliance. Thus, as far as is practicable without compromising the tax base, the Policy Advice Division consults widely, within both the private and public sectors, on any tax policy initiatives. Having said this, there is a limit to how far the consultative process can successfully be pursued – consulting on some base maintenance concerns could, for example, open a window of opportunity for those being consulted, which would be inappropriate. Measures to maintain the integrity of the tax system fall into two broad categories – base maintenance work and remedial amendments. These are discussed in more detail below. Base maintenance work “Base maintenance” initiatives are designed to protect the tax base from erosion arising from tax planning schemes. This should be distinguished from “base broadening”, the latter being the result of a deliberate policy decision to expand the tax base to include forms of income that were previously excluded. In practice, however, this distinction can become blurred as it may be necessary in some cases to broaden the tax base in order to close a particular loophole in the tax system. When base maintenance problems are identified, they are quantified, prioritised and fed into the tax policy work programme, the preparation of revenue forecasts and the Government’s fiscal risk estimates. However, because the number of base maintenance problems exceed immediately available resources, the only practical course of action is to prioritise them to ensure that the most severe, solvable problems are addressed first. A number of base maintenance concerns have been addressed by legislation this year. In recent years, some base maintenance issues have been included in each tax bill considered by Parliament. A number of base maintenance issues remain, however, to be addressed. The following discussion focuses on two key issues: schemes targeted at high-income individuals, of which films have been an example, and goods and services tax (GST). These issues have been selected because they are ones the Government will need to consider closely in the near future. The discussion highlights features of the tax system that have given rise to the specific concerns, and outlines work that has been undertaken on the issues to date and is still required to be done in the future. Schemes targeted at high-income individuals Recently, evidence suggests an increase in the number of tax planning schemes being widely marketed to high-income individuals. These schemes have involved forestry, computer software, insurance and films. Chapter 3 Page 22 The schemes seek to exploit weaknesses in the Income Tax Act, such as the non-taxation of certain income from capital, or timing mismatches created by deliberate Government policy (as in forestry and films). Deductions are taken for expenditure under the schemes. However, the recognition of income is typically deferred (as in forestry), if it is recognised at all. (For example, the income is shifted outside the tax base.) It is also common for taxpayers who benefit from the deductions not to have to risk their own capital to claim the deductions. Some of the schemes may fall within the current anti-avoidance provisions, or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the Income Tax Act. This is being tested as tax returns are filed and assessed. We are, however, working on more comprehensive solutions to the schemes. These could involve recommendations for significant change to specific features of the Income Tax Act. The schemes operate by exploiting boundaries in the Act (such as the non-taxation of certain forms of income from capital, and the active/passive income boundary). An initial question is whether these boundaries should be retained. If they are, the question becomes how they should be preserved so that they cannot be exploited inappropriately. We are continuing to work on developing a comprehensive solution to tax planning schemes. To some extent, what has been done to date, such as the legislative changes made this year to address film schemes, is best described as “sand in the works” – it makes the threshold more difficult to meet if such schemes are not to be struck down by the anti-avoidance rules. However, a comprehensive solution remains the most desirable response to the issue. GST GST is designed to be imposed on all goods and services that are consumed in New Zealand. To effect this, GST is imposed on any taxable supply made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. An amendment was made in the Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act 1999 to ensure that GST continues to be charged on “exported” services that are actually performed and consumed in New Zealand. The change was aimed at services that are contracted for overseas by non- residents, but consumed in New Zealand. An example here is travel vouchers which are sold outside New Zealand to non-residents, but redeemed for services consumed in New Zealand. Technological developments have, however, created new difficulties for the design and application of the GST rules, and we are considering these further. For example, when GST was introduced, imported services were not subject to the rules. This was because they were not common at that time (legal and technological constraints meant that services were typically consumed in the jurisdiction where they were produced). Furthermore, there were – and still are – practical difficulties associated with levying and collecting GST on them. Tax Policy Work Programme Page 23 Deregulation of the telecommunications and financial services market, coupled with rapid advances in communication and computer technology, mean that it is now possible to consume a wide range of services in New Zealand that have been produced offshore. For example, telephone call-back services are consumed by New Zealanders, but because the service provider is outside New Zealand, GST is not currently imposed. This raises issues of competitiveness between taxed and untaxed services consumed in New Zealand. We are continuing to work on the issue, which includes consideration of whether it might be feasible to introduce a “reverse-charge” mechanism (one that requires the consumer to account for the tax, rather than the supplier) in relation to imported services. A number of other base maintenance issues in the GST area (relating to second-hand goods, deregistration and deferred settlements) were included in the discussion document GST: A Review, released in March this year. It is intended that legislation on these issues will be ready for inclusion in a tax bill next year. Other base maintenance issues There are other base maintenance issues, but the ones discussed above are the most significant. Other issues to be addressed include reviews of: • the use of passive investment funds by superannuation funds; and • the taxation of restrictive covenants and lease inducement payments. Remedial amendments In the course of redesigning and reviewing the tax system, and discussing the operation of the tax system with other areas of the department and practitioners, the Policy Advice Division identifies a large number of unintended effects of tax legislation. These problems are considered when formulating the tax policy work programme. Issues relevant to projects currently on the work programme are included in those projects. By contrast, issues that are outside the scope of the current work programme are prioritised and added to the existing work programme if sufficiently important. In that regard, it is useful to consult with the private sector and professional bodies (such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants) about their priority concerns. In contrast to base maintenance initiatives, “remedial amendments” to legislation are not directed primarily at protecting the tax base and the Government’s fiscal position. Rather, they are directed at correcting the unintended consequences of legislation. These can be due to either a legislative error, or effects that were not envisaged at the time the legislation was designed. Chapter 3 Page 24 Once again, the distinction between base maintenance initiatives and remedial amendments can become blurred where an unintended consequence of legislation is being used to erode the tax base. In these cases, the correction of that legislative anomaly can be viewed as being both a remedial and a base maintenance initiative. This year, a large variety of remedial amendments have been enacted. Other considerations The Policy Advice Division also conducts post-implementation reviews of new legislation. This enables us to check whether the legislation is working effectively, and that it is achieving its policy intent. An important review that is being undertaken at present is the post- implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation. As well as reviewing the effectiveness of the current rules, the review will also consider a number of the recommendations in the report of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, and the report of the FEC Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department, both released in the past 12 months. Part Two: Simplification of the tax system The Policy Advice Division is currently working on a number of initiatives to simplify the tax system. Under a simplified tax system, taxpayers will find it easier to comply with the law. The adverse effects of the tax system, such as compliance and administrative costs, will also be reduced. It is important, however, that simplification initiatives be consistent with improving the overall tax system. Although compliance and administration are significant “deadweight” costs of the tax system (costs that are not expended directly on consumption or wealth-generating activities), the implications the tax system has for individuals’ decisions on improving their skills, participating in the labour force, working, saving, investing, and taking risks can be even more significant. Tax simplification is best advanced, therefore, as part of an overall tax strategy, not as a series of ad hoc, discrete measures. The approach that has formed one of the central themes of recent tax policy has been to consider simplifications in terms of a wider strategy of improving the tax system. It involves moving to statutory self-assessment on the basis that taxpayers are in the best position to calculate their income and determine their tax liability. Revised penalty rules were introduced in 1996 to provide incentives for taxpayers to calculate their tax liabilities correctly. The rewrite of the Income Tax Act aims to make it easier for taxpayers to self-assess. Nevertheless, it is recognised that there will always be areas of legal uncertainty, and the binding rulings system, introduced in 1995, provides a mechanism for gaining certainty. Although this will produce a more efficient tax system, the need to self-assess does place Tax Policy Work Programme Page 25 considerable burdens on taxpayers. These were lifted for wage and salary earners by removing the requirement for most of this group to file tax returns from the 1999-2000 year onwards. Tax simplification work such as that set out in the recent Less Taxing Tax discussion document aims to reduce the compliance burden on small businesses, in particular, while continuing to improve the efficiency of the tax system. This overall strategy of simplifying and improving the tax system is reflected in continuing policy work in four key areas: • the rewrite of the Income Tax Act; • tax simplification; • codification of self-assessment; and • the GST review. These projects are discussed in greater detail below. Rewrite of the Income Tax Act The Rewrite project is a major tax policy initiative aimed at simplifying and clarifying existing tax legislation through the introduction of a coherent structure and plain language drafting. The project is an important initiative for simplifying the tax system, and the rewritten Act is expected to minimise the costs to taxpayers, tax professionals, the judiciary and other groups of using the legislation. The first phase of the project was completed with the enactment of new Core Provisions in July 1996. The project is now working on Parts C, D and E of the Act (Income, Deductions and Timing), which might appropriately be described as the “engine-house of the Act”. The enactment of the Core Provisions left a number of issues unfinalised, such as ensuring the use of consistent terminology throughout the Act. Although such deficiencies are not fatal – the Act can still be applied effectively – it is important that the second stage of the project be completed as soon as possible. This would make the Act far simpler to read and apply, and would mean that the greater part of the aim of the Rewrite project, namely the minimisation of the costs faced by taxpayers because of the way the law is expressed, would largely have been achieved. The Assistant General Manager of the Policy Advice Division is dedicated to managing and ensuring the successful completion of Phase II of the Rewrite project. Work is well advanced, and legislation is expected to be ready to be introduced into Parliament by 31 August 2001. This introduction date is far later than anticipated when the project first began and has, not surprisingly, been the subject of criticism. The main reason for the later introduction date has been that the project has generated far more work than initially contemplated. It has, for example, identified a number of areas where the policy intent of existing law is unclear and Chapter 3 Page 26 needs to be clarified to enable the legislation to be written plainly. In a couple of cases, this has resulted in significant new projects being initiated – on interest deductibility, distributions and the tax consequences of death. Interest deductibility A significant number of New Zealand companies pay interest on money they borrow to further their activities. However, how much of that interest expenditure can be deducted for tax purposes has long been an area of uncertainty, because the law itself often lacks clarity. As a result, companies frequently structure their dealings in such a way as to ensure that the interest expense they incur can be deducted, which leads to increased compliance costs and economic inefficiencies. The discussion document Interest Deductions for Companies, released on 20 September 1999, set out proposals for clarifying and simplifying the rules for interest deductibility for companies. Submissions have now been received, and we expect to report to Ministers on their content early next year. We are also looking at whether the rules for interest deductibility for taxpayers other than companies can be clarified and simplified. We expect to develop proposals in this area over the next two years. Distributions and the tax consequences of death The application of current income tax law to “in kind” distributions of assets, as well the tax consequences on death, are unclear, and have been the cause of uncertainty in the taxpaying community. We have been consulting with selected private sector representatives on proposals we have developed for dealing with these issues. We will be reporting to Ministers on the outcome of these proposals early next year. Tax simplification The tax simplification project is working on measures to reduce the compliance costs faced by taxpayers. Significant progress has already been made – for example, recent legislation removed the obligation of many salary and wage earners to complete tax returns. The focus of the project is now shifting towards business initiatives. The discussion document Less Taxing Tax, also released on 20 September 1999, proposed a series of tax improvements aimed at individuals and small businesses. Three key themes had emerged from the consultation undertaken in preparing that discussion document: Tax Policy Work Programme Page 27 • Simplification for business taxpayers is unlikely to come from eliminating the forms businesses have to complete. The major problems for business taxpayers do not lie in filling in the forms, but in the amount of work required to obtain the necessary information to calculate tax liabilities. • For tax purposes, businesses are not a homogenous group like salary and wage earners. Any consideration of tax-related problems of businesses must span a variety of different entities with vastly different processes and systems. • Some specific taxes and elements of the tax system impose high stress costs on taxpayers. Many of the issues businesses feel strongest about concern tax rules which they neither like nor perhaps understand, such as the depreciation rules, which in fact impose relatively low compliance costs. In other words, there is a strong link between a taxpayer’s view of an aspect of the tax system and the perception of the burden that aspect places on the business. Specific concerns were expressed in relation to provisional tax, calculating year-end income tax requirements, fringe benefit tax, the timing of tax payments, and the compliance and penalties rules. Submissions have been received and we expect to report to Ministers on their contents early next year. Next steps A further, potentially more significant round of small business tax simplification is also under way. This work aims to reduce compliance costs imposed on small businesses by: • reducing compliance costs imposed on these businesses in meeting their day-to-day tax obligations, such as those imposed by provisional tax, PAYE, GST and fringe benefit tax; • making it easier to calculate and pay tax, which may involve considering the introduction of minimum thresholds for the application of tax rules, such as for the valuation of trading stock; • better aligning tax payments and businesses’ cash flow, which could ease cash flow management and thereby reduce taxpayer default; and • reducing the likelihood of penalties being imposed on small businesses that act honestly and in good faith. To achieve this, consideration is being given to ways that businesses’ tax affairs might better be integrated into their business activities. Taxpayers could then meet their tax obligations as a by- product of running their business rather than it being a dedicated activity in itself. It will be important to recognise, however, that business taxpayers are not homogeneous and that one approach will not work for all. For example, many businesses are interested in more technologically-based solutions in relation to payments, while others consider the current payment systems satisfactory. Chapter 3 Page 28 Consideration is also being given to the possibility of expanding, within the tax system, the role of intermediaries such as tax agents, payroll firms and financial institutions. The advance of information technology and the ability to move information at low cost may have created scope for intermediaries to help small businesses meet their obligations, resulting in a potentially new approach to lowering compliance costs. As part of the proposal development process, we will be considering in detail the simplification proposals contained in the Ralph report on Australian tax reform. Codification of self-assessment The 1994 Organisational Review of Inland Revenue identified the adoption by the department of a “substantial” system of self-assessment as a major reform in tax administration, but one that was not reflected in legislation. Rather, existing tax legislation is still written as if it were the Commissioner who actually performed all assessment activities. Most of the major administrative changes necessary to support a self-assessment system have been implemented in the form of the binding rulings system and the new compliance and penalty rules. The Income Tax Act and Tax Administration Act do, however, need to be amended to reflect the manner in which the tax system is now administered. In doing this, it will be important to ensure that the Commissioner retains overall responsibility for assessing and collecting tax on the Government’s behalf, while reflecting the reality that taxpayers and other entities now play an important role in the performance of those activities. A discussion document outlining the legislative amendments that would be necessary to codify the practice of self-assessment was released in August 1998. A key objective of the proposals set out in the document was to ensure that disputes are dealt with fairly and more quickly. Consequently, the document proposed to reduce to some extent various time periods for taxpayers and the Commissioner to alter assessments. It is intended that legislation to effect self-assessment will be available for inclusion in a tax bill next year. GST review As well as dealing with a number of base maintenance issues, the discussion document GST: A Review, released in March 1999, contained the following proposals to simplify GST: • increases to the registration, simplified tax invoice, payments basis accounting and other thresholds; • simplification measures for change-in-use adjustments; and • numerous remedial matters. It is intended that legislation on these issues will be ready for inclusion in a tax bill next year. Tax Policy Work Programme Page 29 Part Three: Tax strategy initiatives New Zealand’s tax and benefit systems are very complex and interrelate with each other. This can, however, be a significant barrier to: • Effective policy development. If policy developers do not have a full picture of how things fit together and the consequences of adjusting a small part of the whole, changes that are made to the system could prove to be counter-productive. • The effective operation of the tax/benefit system. The system is not transparent to taxpayer-beneficiaries because of the complexity of the combined tax and benefit system. The Policy Advice Division is undertaking work in three key areas that will assist in our understanding of the operation of the tax/benefit system. These are: • the composition of households’ wealth and its relation to the tax system, in conjunction with the Treasury and the Investment Savings and Insurance Association; • the interface between the taxation and the benefit system; and • the effect of taxation on the type of entity used for conducting investment. Savings and investment The focus of our work on the savings and investment project is not the level of savings in New Zealand, but the forms in which households hold their wealth – housing, shares, bank accounts or otherwise. If the tax system were working efficiently, the risk-adjusted rates of return would be equalised across all forms of holding householder wealth. In practice, however, taxation rules tend to favour some forms of assets over others. For example, a person not subject to the top marginal tax rate faces a lower effective tax rate on a bank deposit than for an investment in superannuation. Our work on savings and investment is reviewing the impact of tax law on the portfolio of assets held by New Zealand households. This should lead to a better appreciation of the effect of different tax policies on the composition of household wealth. Tax/benefit interface The Treasury is looking at the interface between taxes and the benefit system, and the effect of the combined system on work incentives. Policymakers are increasingly aware that tax and benefits are essentially a single system, and that policy should have regard to the effect of the system as a whole. At present, however, the effects of the combined tax/benefit system lack transparency. The Policy Advice Division is contributing to the Treasury’s work. Chapter 3 Page 30 Entity taxation Several types of entities in New Zealand are subject to their own specific taxation rules. Examples include Maori authorities, qualifying companies, mutual associations and co- operatives, and charities. One way to encourage efficient savings and investment is to ensure that there is a stable and neutral investment environment. This means that one type of entity should not receive more preferable tax treatment than any other. Consequently, we are working on developing a standard framework for entity taxation – instead of having a number of entity-specific rules, it may be feasible to have a generic taxing framework, with specific rules to address situations where it may be desirable to diverge from the normal pattern. A related issue concerns the appropriate treatment of charities, and other tax-exempt entities. Chapter 4 of the report by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, released in December 1998, makes a number of recommendations on the tax treatment of such entities. We are reviewing the recommendations in that report. Maori authorities Maori authorities are still subject to tax rules that were developed in the 1950s and have not been reviewed since. We are reviewing the current tax treatment afforded to Maori authorities to determine whether it distorts Maori social and economic development and, if so, how those distortions could be addressed. The review will also clarify the public benefit test of charitable status as it applies to iwi and hapu-based structures. The terms of reference for the review have been issued, and preliminary discussions with national Maori organisations have confirmed their support for such a review. At present, we are consulting with Maori authorities and tax practitioners as part of the policy development phase of the review to gain a better understanding of how Maori authorities operate in practice. The Maori community is, therefore, expecting further developments to occur in this area. We are working toward preparing a discussion document on the issues for release by June 2000. Research and development and carbon charges The Policy Advice Division has also been involved in an inter-departmental project for reviewing New Zealand’s investment in research and development (R&D). The review is intended to consider a range of issues, including whether there is underinvestment in R&D in New Zealand, and if so, why and how this may be addressed, the contribution that R&D makes to firm innovation and the performance of the economy, and the tax treatment of R&D in New Zealand and overseas. If the review continues, a steering group that includes private sector representatives will be convened, and it will report to the Government by 31 March 2000. Tax Policy Work Programme Page 31 The division is also contributing to inter-departmental analysis of a possible charge or tax on carbon emissions. Part Four: Other Policy Advice work A number of important functions undertaken by the Policy Advice Division are critical to the continuing health of the tax administration. Role in implementing major economic reform initiatives One area that has the potential to consume significant policy resources is our role in assisting in the implementation of major Government reform initiatives. Typically, these involve the restructuring of Government assets, where assets are shifted from one type of entity to another. Recent examples include the accident compensation, electricity and producer board reforms. It is easy to underestimate the extent to which such reform initiatives commit our tax policy resources. Tax implications should not be considered as an afterthought, but as an integral part of the reform development process. Our role is most effective and efficient if we are party to Government reform initiatives at their development stage. Social policy role Over the last decade, Inland Revenue has been given responsibility for administering key social policy initiatives, including making payments under the Family Support and Family Plus schemes to 185,000 families, administering child support, and collecting student loan repayments. The Policy Advice Division advises the Government on these major social policy mechanisms. International tax initiatives Since the late 1980s international tax reform has reduced the extent to which the international tax rules distort the nature of cross-border investment. A key feature of this reform has been to address aspects of the tax system that deterred investment into New Zealand. This has involved reducing the effective marginal tax rates applying to non-resident investment into New Zealand, which has in turn reduced the extent to which these taxes increase the domestic cost of capital. This has been achieved through a range of initiatives, including: • The approved issuer levy rules , which eliminate non-resident withholding tax when an issuer pays a 2% levy on interest paid on certain registered securities. • The foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules , which ensure that the total New Zealand tax (company tax plus NRWT) on non-resident equity investment does not exceed 33% (the company tax rate). Before the rules were introduced, foreign investors had to pay full New Zealand company tax as well as non-resident withholding tax. Chapter 3 Page 32 • The transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules , which improve the accuracy with which the New Zealand sourced income of non-residents is measured, and reduce non-residents’ ability to transfer profits out of New Zealand free of tax. • The conduit rules , which reduce the tax paid by non-residents in relation to investments made through New Zealand into third countries. One issue we are continuing to work on is the implementation of the new transfer pricing rules, which came into force on 1 April 1996. The Policy Advice Division, in consultation with the business community, is continuing work on developing transfer pricing guidelines for New Zealand. It is anticipated that draft guidelines on the remaining issues to be covered (other than the treatment of branches, which has yet to be resolved by the OECD) will be issued early next year. Negotiation and maintenance of DTAs As the significant international tax reforms have now been concluded, the international tax team has recently been reorganised into a smaller specialist treaty team. The team is responsible for the negotiation and maintenance of New Zealand’s network of double tax agreements (DTAs) with other countries, much of New Zealand’s input into tax policy initiatives of the OECD, and the finalisation and publication of New Zealand’s transfer pricing guidelines. New Zealand has a network of 26 DTAs with its main trading and investment partners. The most recent agreement was one concluded with Thailand in 1998. The focus of DTAs is wider than the elimination of double taxation. They are aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment and assisting tax administration by: • eliminating certain forms of double taxation; • reducing withholding taxes on cross-border investments; • exempting certain short-term activities in the host state from income tax; • providing certainty of treatment; • providing dispute resolution procedures; and • enabling information to be exchanged between tax administrations. We are in the process of negotiating agreements with Japan and Russia. The negotiations with Japan are seeking to replace the 1963 agreement between the two countries, which has become outdated. The negotiations with Russia have resulted in an agreed text between the two countries, and all that remains for the agreement to come into force is for it to be signed and ratified by the respective Governments. Tax Policy Work Programme Page 33 We expect negotiations in the near future to focus on Latin America. At present, we do not have any DTAs with countries in this region, but it is becoming an increasingly important area in New Zealand’s international trade developments. We also anticipate that there will be an increasing demand for mutual assistance in the collection of tax agreements – this is where we assist another country to collect its tax and it in turn assists in collecting ours. An agreement with the Netherlands for the collection of tax is in the process of being completed. It is possible, however, that future agreements might also deal with child support and/or student loans. (An agreement with Australia for the reciprocal collection of child support becomes effective from 1 July next year.) A large part of our treaty team’s DTA work involves negotiating remedial amendments to our existing treaties, at either our request, or the request of our treaty partners. For example, we have recently negotiated protocols to revise existing DTAs with China, India and Korea. These protocols removed the ability of investors to exploit tax sparing provisions 3 in those treaties in an unintended manner. The protocol with India also reduced the withholding rates faced by New Zealand investors into India, which has positive benefits for our business community. A number of other protocols are awaiting finalisation or are being negotiated. As well as maintaining our agreements, the treaty team also provides a range of treaty services including notifying our treaty partners of changes in tax law in New Zealand, documenting our existing DTAs, and enhancing our DTA interpretation services. The treaty team is also involved in: • contributing to OECD initiatives; and • monitoring developments on the implications of cross-border electronic commerce. Other day-to-day work of the Policy Advice Division The Police Advice Division provides advice in a number of other areas. Advice on the tax implications of other legislation We are responsible for providing advice on the tax consequences of a range of Government initiatives. In 1999, for example, we commented on: • the tax implications of various Government payments to Maori; • New Zealand Defence Force Operational Allowances: East Timor; • the Children’s Health Camps Board Dissolution Bill 1999; • the insolvency review and priority debts; and • producer board reform. 3 Tax sparing provisions permit foreign tax credits to be claimed in certain situations where tax has not been paid to the foreign state. Their purpose is to prevent tax concessions aimed at attracting foreign capital, which are granted in developing countries, being clawed back by the country of residence of the investor. Chapter 3 Page 34 Advice on other initiatives The Policy Advice Division is responsible for providing advice on a range of Government initiatives that do not have purely tax implications. In 1999, for example, we commented on: • the local government funding review; • the review of credit unions; • the implications of the Human Rights Act for the Revenue Acts; and • Public Trust Office restructuring. Continuing work Other continuing work of the Policy Advice Division includes: • the preparation of taxation amendments, including the drafting of legislation; • the development of accrual determinations, which explain how the rules for determining income and expenditure from financial arrangements apply to specific financial instruments; • the provision of policy advice on applications for binding rulings; • revenue forecasting and analysis; • operating the Ministerial Services Unit; • assisting the Government to meet various statutory obligations including: -confirmation of annual tax rates; -setting the deemed rate of return for foreign investment fund rules; and -setting interest rates for the “use of money”, fringe benefit tax, and student loans; • answering questions on tax and social policy. Reports on the tax system Two reports that have featured prominently in the media in the last 12 months are the report by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (December 1998) and the report on the Finance and Expenditure Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department (October 1999). A number of tax policy recommendations were made in these two reports. In most cases, these recommendations have been readily incorporated into existing tax policy projects. Only in a couple of cases has it been necessary for recommendations to be considered outside of existing projects. Page 35 Chapter 4 Overview of the New Zealand Tax System The tax system the Policy Advice Division works with Developments since 1984 Since 1984 successive Governments have introduced a wide range of reforms to the New Zealand tax system. The reform process was driven by the recognition that the New Zealand tax system was not delivering sufficient revenue to finance the Government’s expenditure initiatives, the tax system created significant economic distortions, and it consisted of a range of sales taxes that were complex and cumbersome to administer. The principles that have been followed in reforming the tax system included: • The economic decision-making process should be determined by economic substance rather than tax considerations. • The tax system should minimise the opportunities for avoidance. • The tax system should have low administrative and compliance costs.

The tax base has changed from relying on taxes on individuals’ income to generate two-thirds of total revenue in 1984, to one by the early 1990s in which taxes on consumption and companies played an increasingly important role. By the end of this reform period, the contribution to total revenue of taxes on individuals’ income had dropped to just over half, while the introduction of GST raised the contribution of taxes on consumption from 13% to 25%. The changing composition of the New Zealand tax base is shown in figure 5. Through the nineties the process of continuing reform focused on maintenance of the company tax base, so that by the mid-1990s taxation from companies had grown from 7% in 1984 to 14% in 1995. Since 1995 tax reform has primarily involved decreases in the marginal income tax rates of individuals, to the point where in 1999, only 45% of total revenue was from the direct taxation of individuals. Over the period 1984 to 1999 the ratio of tax to GDP increased from 29% to 33%. Total tax revenue rose from $10.7 billion to $32.9 billion. Broadening the tax base and lowering marginal income tax rates The main focus of the tax reform programme in the late 1980s was on broadening the tax base and lowering marginal income tax rates. Broad-base tax systems reduce the economic distortions between different forms of earnings, savings, investment and consumption decisions and are an effective defence against tax avoidance. A low marginal income tax rate reduces the incentive for tax planning schemes and increases the reward from increased work effort. The company income tax rate was aligned to the same level as the top rate for individual income tax. Aligning the corporate income tax rate with the top individual income tax rate encourages entrepreneurs to focus on expanding the profitability of their businesses rather than designing and using tax planning schemes. Broadening the individual income tax base involved: • removing most income exemptions and tax rebates such as the First Home Mortgage Interest Rebate; • introducing rebates and assistance measures that are income or family targeted; • reducing marginal income tax rates – for example, reducing the top income tax rate from 66 cents in 1984 to 33 cents in 1988; and • introducing a fringe benefit tax. For companies, broadening the income tax base involved: • abolishing a wide range of business incentives that were administered through the tax system, such as export incentives; • removing the general income tax exemptions for inter-company dividends; Overview of the New Zealand tax system Page 37 • introducing comprehensive rules for taxing financial arrangements (the accrual rules) and accounting for foreign-sourced income; and • introducing an imputation credit scheme for company dividends to eliminate the double taxation of company income distributed to shareholders. Replacing wholesale taxes with a comprehensive GST In October 1986, New Zealand replaced its diverse range of wholesale taxes with a comprehensive goods and services tax (GST) at a rate of 10%. GST was increased in July 1989 to 12.5%, in response to the need to raise greater revenue to finance the Government’s expenditure initiatives. Greater use of withholding taxes In the late 1980s and early 1990s the tax reform programme started shifting into initiatives aimed at improving the overall efficiency with which the tax system operates. The use of withholding taxes recognises that collecting tax at the source of income reduces the scope for tax evasion and non-payment and that entities such as financial institutions and employers are often in a better position than Inland Revenue to collect tax. New withholding taxes introduced during the reform process comprised: • a withholding tax on residents’ interest (now levied at 19.5% or 33%); • a withholding tax on residents’ dividends levied at 33%; and • a dividend withholding payment levied at 33% on dividends paid by foreign companies to resident companies. These new withholding taxes, in conjunction with non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends, interest and royalties, comprise 5% ($1.7 billion) of the total tax revenue for the year ended June 1999. Each of the withholding taxes has been included in either taxes on individuals or taxes on companies, depending on where their incidence falls. Reforming other taxes Reforms to other tax types have included: • repealing estate and stamp duties; • repealing land taxes; • progressively removing and reducing import tariffs and customs duties; and • increasing excise rates on alcohol and tobacco. Chapter 4 Page 38 Simplifying and clarifying the tax system By the early 1990s, increasing concern was being expressed about the complexity of tax legislation and its implications for administrative and compliance costs. The process of tax reform had produced numerous piecemeal amendments to the Income Tax Act, significantly increasing its complexity. This not only increased administrative costs, but it also increased compliance costs in view of the increasing role that taxpayers were playing in the assessment and collection of tax. As a result, since the early 1990s the tax reform programme has included initiatives aimed at reducing compliance costs. In the early 1990s this involved the implementation of a range of initiatives recommended in 1989 by the Tax Simplification Consultative Committee. More recent initiatives have included: • restructuring the Income Tax Act and rewriting its Core Provisions in order to assist taxpayers to determine, calculate and satisfy their tax obligations; • introducing a binding rulings system to clarify the manner in which tax legislation applies to the particular activities of taxpayers; and • removing the need for many salary and wage earners to file income tax returns. The incentives for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations have also been enhanced through the implementation of: • base maintenance and anti-avoidance measures; • improved compliance and penalties legislation; and • improved procedures for resolving disputes between Inland Revenue and taxpayers. Aspects of the current New Zealand tax system Taxation of individuals Salary and wage earners Taxation of salary and wages is by source deductions (PAYE, for “pay as you earn”), which account for $12.3 billion (37.3%) of all taxes collected. Employers are required to forward to Inland Revenue PAYE deductions made on behalf of their employees. Until 1999, many salary and wage earners were required to file an IR5 income tax return to reconcile their annual income, if their main sources of income were from salary and wages, interest, or dividends. Overview of the New Zealand tax system Page 39 For the 1999-2000 income year, most of the 1.2 million salary and wage earners will no longer have to file an IR5 return. Because most taxpayers have tax withheld at source from salary and wages, interest and dividends, Inland Revenue has enough third party information to generate a tax return without input from the taxpayer. Some of those involved in the student loan, child support and family support schemes will, however, still be required to furnish Inland Revenue with information, given the additional information required under these schemes. Changes to individual statutory tax rates occurred in June 1996 and June 1998. Before the 1996-97 income year, individuals’ rates were 24% up to $30,875, and 33% beyond. The current tax scales are 19.5% up to $38,000, and 33% beyond. These changes are estimated to have reduced income tax from individuals by $2.5 billion. “Other Persons” This category consists of revenue collected from individuals who have sources of income other than salary and wages. These comprise the self-employed, shareholder employees, partners and anyone who has significant other income that has not had tax withheld, such as rental income. Such persons may be required to pay provisional tax in the form of three equal payments made throughout the year based on the previous year’s income, provided their residual income tax liability exceeds $2,500. Of the 800,000 taxpayers in this category, approximately 200,000 pay provisional tax, while the rest have relatively small sources of other income. Rebates New Zealand has a minimal number of rebates available to individuals. Those that are available include: • the low income earner rebate , which has the effect of generally reducing the effective tax rate to 15% on income below $9,500; • a transitional tax allowance for certain employees working more than 20 hours per week (maximum of $728 reducing by 20 cents per dollar of income between $6,241 and $9,880); • a charitable donations rebate ; and • a housekeeper/childcare rebate . Taxpayers who are children are exempted the first $1,040 of non-investment income. Family assistance Family assistance is provided to low-income families with dependent children by way of Family Support and the Family Plus package. Family Support is administered by both Inland Revenue and Work and Income New Zealand, with entitlement depending on the number and ages of the children. Family Plus entitlement entails a further degree of independence from welfare-related state support, and is administered entirely by Inland Revenue. The Family Plus package has three separate components: Chapter 4 Page 40 • The family tax credit is available to families where one or both parents are in full- time work. It provides a guaranteed income level, net of tax, below which a family’s income cannot fall. If a family’s income falls below the guaranteed level, the Government tops up the difference. • The child tax credit is $15 per child per week, provided the family is not in receipt of a welfare benefit, and has not received accident compensation for a period greater than three months. • The parental tax credit is a new initiative which took effect from 1 October 1999. For families who also qualify for the child tax credit, it provides a payment of $150 per week for eight weeks after the birth of each child. Family assistance targets low-income families, so the combined entitlements are abated for incomes exceeding $20,000. Entitlements may be received fortnightly based on estimated earnings, or as a lump sum at the end of the year. Inland Revenue administers payments of $600 million to 185,000 families through these schemes. The average payment in 1998 was $3,400. Student loans Inland Revenue is also responsible for collecting student loan repayments, primarily through the PAYE system for salary and wage earners. Those who are earning over the repayment threshold ($14,716 for 1999-2000) are required to pay 10% on the portion of their salary over the threshold. For income over $50,000, the rate rises to 15%. Child support Inland Revenue also administers child support. Non-custodial parents are assessed for child support payments based upon their taxable income minus a living allowance according to their current living status (whether they are single or married, have dependants and so on). The repayment rates are 18% for one dependant child, rising to 30% for four or more. Inland Revenue forwards payments to the custodial parent when she or he is not in receipt of a social welfare benefit. Company taxation Company taxes are levied on all New Zealand resident companies, local government trading enterprises (LATES), unit trusts, superannuation funds and on non-resident companies that derive income from New Zealand in the form of business profits, dividends, interest income or royalty payments. The are four types of company taxes. Overview of the New Zealand tax system Page 41 Income tax Company income tax is levied at 33% of taxable income. New Zealand resident companies are taxed on their world-wide income, with a credit allowed for tax paid overseas. Non-resident companies operating and investing in New Zealand are taxed only on their New Zealand- sourced income. New Zealand operates an imputation credit system to prevent the double taxation of company profits, once when earned by the company and then again when the profits are distributed to the shareholder. Imputation credits are provided to the company when income tax is paid, which can be attached to dividends to offset tax payable by that shareholder. About 160,000 companies, LATES, unit trusts and superannuation funds file income tax returns. Of these, 50,000 pay no tax because they are able to offset any income against losses, and 60,000 have no income. Income tax from the remaining 50,000 companies totalled $3.7 billion in the year to June 1999. Tax losses Provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 allow companies, unit trusts and superannuation funds to offset losses generated in previous income tax years against income in future income tax years. Figure 6 shows the make-up of corporate tax losses in New Zealand since 1992. The ability to use previous losses is subject to continuity requirements for shareholder ownership. If these provisions are breached the losses expire.

Although the value of tax losses is high, the ability of the business community to use them is limited. Many of the losses are sitting in companies that have no income and cannot be used. A fair indication of the value of losses that can be offset against income in future income tax years is the total value of losses generated in the most recent income tax year. In the 1997- 98 income tax year, $6.3 billion of losses were generated. Loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) The rules on loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) allow companies meeting defined criteria to pass losses generated in the income tax year on to their shareholders. The objective of the LAQC rules is to place the shareholder in a LAQC in the same tax position as a partner in a partnership.

In total, $1.4 billion in losses have been passed through to shareholders since the introduction of the rules. Overview of the New Zealand tax system Page 43 Non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) NRWT is levied at either 10, 15 or 30% on interest, royalty and dividend payments made to non-residents. About 3,000 companies pay NRWT on behalf of non-residents. Relief from double taxation on dividend distributions to non-resident shareholders (company profits first subject to income tax and the dividend distribution subject to NRWT) is provided through New Zealand’s foreign investor tax credit (FITC) rules. They extend the benefits of New Zealand’s imputation system to non-resident shareholders of New Zealand companies through the payment of a supplementary dividend. For certain registered securities, resident borrowers are subject to an approved issuer levy (AIL) of 2%. There is then no obligation to deduct NRWT from interest paid to offshore investors on these securities. For the year to June 1999, revenue from NRWT totalled $717 million, and revenue from AIL totalled $46 million. Foreign dividend withholding payments When companies, unit trusts and superannuation funds derive dividend income from overseas, they are required to deduct a dividend withholding payment on behalf of their shareholders. The withholding rate is 33 cents in the dollar. A credit for the foreign dividend withholding payment is deducted from the shareholder’s liability once the dividend is passed on. This is similar to the way imputation credits can be passed on to shareholders. Revenue from foreign dividend withholding payments totalled $8 million for the year to June 1999. Withholding tax on residents’ dividends Companies deduct withholding tax when dividends paid to New Zealand shareholders have insufficient imputation or dividend withholding payment credits attached to offset the tax liability in the hands of the shareholder. Withholding tax on residents’ dividends is levied at 33%. Withholding tax on residents’ dividends totalled $63 million in the year to June 1999. Chapter 4 Page 44 Sources of New Zealand’s income tax revenue by industry sector The size of the productive industries in New Zealand and the contribution that these industries make to the total business income tax 4 collected varies widely, as shown in figure 8. The largest productive industry in New Zealand, as measured by Statistics New Zealand production statistics, is the manufacturing industry. This industry comprises approximately 20% of the total GDP 5 of New Zealand in the year to March 1998. It contributed 11% of the total business income tax and 19% of the total PAYE.

This sector contributes 16% of New Zealand’s GDP. This suggests that New Zealand’s business income tax base is very sensitive to the health of our banking sector and the income derived by superannuation funds, life insurance companies and unit trusts Taxation of savings The New Zealand tax system is designed to minimise distortions to the investment choices of investors, by taxing all savings on a taxed-taxed-exempt basis, which operates as follows: 4 Business income tax includes company income tax and income tax levied on self-employed income, partnership income and shareholder salaries. 5 GDP excluding estimates for Owner Occupied Dwellings and Unallocated. Overview of the New Zealand tax system Page 45 • Contributions by an investor to an investment entity are made out of taxed income. • The investment entity is subject to tax on income derived from the use of the investor’s funds. • Withdrawals and distributions of the tax-paid investment income are non-taxable in the investor’s hands. This ensures that income earned from investing in superannuation funds, unit trusts and life insurance products is taxed on the same basis as income earned from investing in companies. In the year to 30 June 1999, taxation of superannuation funds, unit trusts and life insurance products raised $720 million. Goods and Services Tax The rate of GST is 12.5%, and GST accounts for just over 25% of Crown Revenue. About 450,000 entities are registered for GST. All persons or businesses who are engaged in a taxable activity on a continuous or regular basis must register for GST, if their annual gross income from their taxable activity is over $30,000. Below this level, registration is voluntary. Those who register must forward to Inland Revenue on a regular basis their net GST (GST charged on supplies made minus GST claimed on costs incurred). If the net figure is negative, this amount is refunded. Those who do not register cannot charge GST or claim GST refunds. GST has a comprehensive base, in that few goods or services are exempt. Imports are subject to the same GST rate as domestically produced goods. Exports are zero-rated. Other taxes and duties Fringe benefit tax Fringe benefit tax is payable at a rate of 49% on the value of fringe benefits employers provide to employees and shareholder-employees. This rate was set so employers face the same cost in providing fringe benefits that they would in making an equivalent taxable payment to an employee on the top 33% marginal tax rate. There are four main categories of taxable fringe benefits: • motor vehicles; • low-interest loans; • free, subsidised or discounted goods and services; and • employer contributions to sick, accident or death benefit funds, superannuation schemes, and specified insurance policies. Chapter 4 Page 46 Fringe benefit tax raised $323 million in the 1998-99 year. Gaming duty Gaming duty consists of totalisator duty, lottery duty, gaming machine duty and casino duty. These duties raised $157 million in the 1998-99 year. Totalisator duty is payable at the rate of 20% of the betting profits of a racing club or totalisator agency board. Lottery duty is payable at the rate of 5.5% of the nominal value of all gaming activities carried out by the New Zealand Lotteries Commission. Gaming machine duty, at the rate of 20%, is payable on the profits from a gaming machine or dutiable game. Casino duty is payable by licensed casino operators at the rate of 4% on the “casino win” of all authorised games conducted or played in the casino. Other duties In recent years, estate, stamp and credit card transaction duty have been repealed, while revenue from gift duty has fallen to $2 million. Cheque duty, levied at 5 cents per cheque, raises $12.5 million. Page 47 Appendix A Revenue Strategy Agreed in 1996 Aims of the Government’s tax policy New Zealand’s best interests are served by a tax system which: • secures the revenue the Government needs to pay for its expenses, to reduce its debts and to allow future cuts in tax rates; • reduces economic growth as little as possible, consistent with the need to raise revenue. This means that it interferes as little as possible with the decisions of individuals, companies and other entities; • is fair, with all taxpayers making an equitable contribution, based on their ability to pay; • minimises opportunities for avoidance and is vigorously enforced, with effective penalties for non-compliance; and • has low compliance and administration costs. The tax system To achieve the above aims, the Government believes that both direct and indirect taxes should be made as broad-based as possible, as far as compliance costs allow. Broad-based taxes reduce distortions between different forms of earnings, saving, investment and consumption and are an effective defence against tax avoidance. The Government will: • actively maintain the current income tax and GST tax bases. This involves stopping opportunities for abusive tax behaviour by identifying and closing tax loopholes, and by vigorous enforcement. It may also involve broadening the tax bases where that is desirable for maintaining the bases or for reducing any significant economic distortions; • review penalties for non-compliance; • clarify tax laws so that honest taxpayers can more easily calculate their correct tax liability; and • simplify the tax system and reduce filing requirements. Appendix A Page 48 Tax rates Tax rates will be kept as low as possible, subject to budget requirements. Tax cuts will focus on lowering the rates of tax on income. The tax policy process The Government will apply the Generic Tax Policy process recommended by the review committee chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson. In particular, consultation will continue to be part of the implementation of all major initiatives. Page 49 Appendix B Protocol between Inland Revenue and the Treasury Set out below is the protocol agreed between Inland Revenue and Treasury for the preparation and presentation of tax policy advice by officials: • Officials’ process will be based on the GTPP proposed by the IRD Review Committee, adapted as appropriate to meet the circumstances of a particular issue. This will ensure that all departments are aware of, and working to, the same work programme timetable, and that the responsibility of the departments for leading or supporting through all phases of particular projects will be allocated according to the comparative advantages of the departments, and consistent with the generic process. While the process is intended to be generic, the presumption should be that it be followed unless a good case can be made in the particular instance for an alternative course of action. The aim will be to ensure that both the accountabilities are clearly defined and that Ministers can be assured of contestable advice throughout the process. • Officials’ primary duty is to provide Ministers with free and frank advice and not to represent the view of any particular Minister. In dealing with parties outside Government, for instance in the course of consultative processes, the duty of officials is to describe accurately the views of the Government and the rationale for Government policy. • On all tax policy issues it is essential that Ministers have available to them the information and perspectives of both the Inland Revenue Department and the Treasury, of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet as chair of the Officials Tax Committee, and on occasions of other departments that have a legitimate interest in the particular policy issue. It will be the responsibility of whichever of Inland Revenue or the Treasury is leading on a particular issue to ensure that other relevant departments are consulted. • On all matters of significant policy content, officials’ advice should be presented to both the Treasurer and the Minister of Finance and Revenue at the same time and in a joint paper, normally prepared by the Officials Tax Committee under the chairmanship of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Such papers should contain all relevant information and options relating to the particular issue, officials’ analysis of that information and those options, and officials’ advice. Where officials wish to offer differing advice on a significant issue, the reasons for the differences should be clearly identified. • No surprises. Each department concerned will keep the other(s) informed on work for which it has primary responsibility. On matters which departments agree are of administrative or minor detail, the department with the lead responsibility may report directly to Ministers but, in doing so, will ensure the other department(s) has adequate opportunity to consider the issue and provide comment. Appendix B Page 50 • Dispute resolution. Day to day responsibility for the operation of the protocol rests with the General Manager of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, and the Deputy Secretary of the Regulatory and Tax Policy Branch of the Treasury. In the event of any disagreement arising between the departments concerning the way this protocol is working, the two Chief Executives will meet to resolve it. • Communication. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Secretary to the Treasury will meet from time to time, generally three times a year, to review the workings of this protocol and the associated relationships.
