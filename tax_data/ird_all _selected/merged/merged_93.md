Tax policy officials’ Tax and social policy engagement framework governs how engagement will be undertaken on tax policy issues and on the social policy initiatives that are delivered by Inland Revenue. 1 The purpose of this document is to affirm officials’ commitment to engagement and set out what stakeholders should expect from officials in undertaking engagement. 2. Since 1994, New Zealand has had a generic tax policy process (GTPP). A key feature of the GTPP is the focus on public consultation which plays an important role in creating and sustaining a tax system that is both widely accepted by taxpayers, and is able to respond to New Zealand’s changing needs. Consultation with stakeholders ensures that the alternative perspectives and expertise of those directly affected by the proposals are considered. This is necessary to improve policy and regulatory outcomes, and to ensure the durability of reforms. 3. This document reaffirms our commitment to the existing GTPP processes for all stages of policy development. Further enhancements to the process have also been implemented. These have been borne out of consultation on the way that the GTPP process has been working and aim to fill in the gaps identified and reflect how GTPP has evolved throughout the years. 4. Officials have committed to five principles for engagement which will be canvassed in greater detail in this document, these are: • wider engagement; • engagement with Māori; • earlier and more frequent engagement; • the use of a greater variety of engagement methods; and • greater transparency and accountability. 5. Good faith engagement should be undertaken by all participants in the process. Why we engage 6. The purpose of interacting with the public is to improve customer, policy and regulatory outcomes, and to inform stakeholders in advance of regulatory changes. Submitters will often have better access to information on the size and nature of the problem and how the issues can best be solved. Consultation can also enhance voluntary compliance because it allows interested parties more time to understand why there is a need to change, and more time to adjust to changes. Innovative solutions are most likely to come from working with those in the sector and using our tax system on a regular basis. There is an added sense of legitimacy and shared ownership if stakeholders have been given a chance to provide input into the development of new rules. Given the Government’s commitment to the Crown Māori relationship, consultation also serves a further purpose of facilitating appropriate engagement with 1 The social policy initiatives administered by Inland Revenue include KiwiSaver, student loans, child support and Working for Families Tax Credits. 6 Māori. This ensures that true and practical partnerships are developed with Māori stakeholders going forward. 7. Other practical benefits of consultat ion include: • bringing alternative perspectives and the expertise of those directly affected by proposals; • providing valuable input as to how realistic or practical a proposal is, as well as identifying potential unintended effects that policy makers have not considered; • increased scrutiny of officials’ analysis and advice, allowing potential problems with a proposal to be identified and resolved early; • helping regulators to balance opposing interests; • increasing durability of reforms – better designed policies are less likely to need amendments once introduced; • increased public buy-in and acceptance of changes, as stakeholders are more likely to accept proposals that they have been involved in developing; and • improved understanding and increased compliance, reducing enforcement costs. 8. According to the OECD Background Document on Public Consultation, 2 there are three related forms of interaction or engagement with the public: • notification; • consultation; and • participat ion 9. The three forms of engagement fall on a spectrum, with notification being the least amount of engagement and participation being the most. Notification involves a one- way flow of communication to the public of the Government’s regulatory decisions or plans. Consultation involves information flowing both ways between the public and the Government, and is concerned mainly with gathering information to facilitate the drafting of higher quality regulation. Participation refers to active involvement of interest groups in the formulation of government policy. 10. In tax and social policy consultation, we see the different forms of engagement as serving three purposes: 1. Consultation to identify the policy problem or opportunity. 2. Consultation or participation to help identify the best solution to a policy issue. 3. Notification and some consultation of proposed changes to tax policy settings to the public as part of the democratic process. The current engagement framework – the Generic Tax Policy Process 11. New Zealand has a tax policy process that is widely seen to work relatively well. Our formalised Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) includes a strong consultative 2 Background Document on Public Consultation, OECD, 2006, https://www.oecd.org/mena/governance/36785341.pdf 7 component, and has a high degree of support from the private sector, tax officials, and government ministers. 12. In a 1994 report, the Inland Revenue Organisational Review Committee 3 stated that the GTPP’s main objectives were to: • encourage early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs; • provide an opportunity for substantial external input into the policy formation process; and • clarify the responsibilities and accountability of participants in the process. 13. These objectives are achieved through five phases: 1. Strategic phases: high level economic strategy; fiscal strategy; revenue strategy. 2. Tactical phases: rolling three-year work program; annual work and resource plan. 3. Operational phases: detailed policy design; formal detailed consultation and communication; ministerial and Cabinet signoff of detailed policy. 4. Legislative phases: drafting of legislation; ministerial and Cabinet signoff o f legislation; introduction of bill; select committee phase; passage of legislation. 5. Implementation and review phases: implementation of legislation; post- implementation review; identification of remedial issues. 14. There are opportunities for public engagement throughout these phases. 15. The strategic phase of the GTPP involves the development of an economic strategy, a fiscal strategy, and a revenue strategy. While no formal consultation processes are in place for this phase, broad policy proposals may be publicized through channels such as budget documentation. 16. In the tactical phase, targeted consultation takes place with the private sector and interested parties to identify the tax policy issues which are important to them, so that the government can prioritise which tax policy issues will be addressed over the next 18 months. Consultation on the development of the work program, combined with published information about the current work program, means that the public knows what changes are being contemplated. 17. In the operational phase, formal detailed consultation currently takes place during detailed policy design. On major reforms, consultation will often involve the release of a government consultation document. Normally, about six weeks are allowed for submissions (although sometimes this can take longer or shorter depending on the circumstances), and during the submission period officials have intensive face-to-face meetings with affected taxpayers. After the submissions have been received and considered, officials will report to the government on them. 18. The government may either decide to start preparing legislation taking into account what has been learned from submissions, or ask for further consultation on specific 3 Organisational review of the Inland Revenue Department: report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee, April 1994. 8 issues. This may involve direct consultation on specific points or the release of another consultation document seeking further submissions on those specific points. 19. In the legislative phase, Parliamentary Select Committees will consider submissions from the public as part of the legislative process. The Committee, on advice from officials, may then recommend that further changes be made in line with those submissions, or recommend that submissions be declined. 20. Tax policy advice in New Zealand is jointly provided by Inland Revenue and the Treasury. New Zealand is unique internationally in having the tax policy function being led by the tax administrator (Inland Revenue). Reviews of tax policy development processes across the world noted there are a number of advantages to having the tax policy function jointly led by the tax administration. The tax policy function is better informed by being closer to the coalface and benefits from greater intelligence flows. It also helps mitigate the risk of developing tax policy which is difficult to implement and enforce in practice. 21. The Treasury’s tax strategy team plays an important role in holding Inland Revenue’s policy advice accountable and providing an alternative view where they feel this is required. This arrangement increases the extent to which tax policy advice is tested internally before issues are put to Ministers or released for public consultation. The Treasury also play an important role in: • ensuring tax policy is nested within a broader whole-of-government perspective; • contributing an economic perspective to the development of tax policy; and • ensuring the tax system is administered efficiently and effectively. 22. A consequence of the GTPP is that it increases the time it takes to develop and implement tax and social policy. The process also involves considerable time and resources for both the private sector and policy officials. However, most stakeholders believe the GTPP to be a valuable and essential part of building and maintaining a good tax system. 23. While recognising that current consultation processes under the GTPP generally work well, there is always room for further improvement. Officials are committed to improving the GTPP to ensure that the aims of GTPP are supported by our processes. Outcome focused policy development process 24. Officials are committed to an outcome focused policy development process and will work more closely with customers, stakeholders and wider Government to ensure that business and customer input is sought at the various stages outlined below, as and when appropriate. Focusing on outcomes means that policy development will be an iterative process, with each stage not necessarily being strictly delineated from another. This process largely occurs in the operational and legislative phases of the GTPP, and is made up of seven overlapping stages: • Problem/opportunity design: identifying issues and opportunities, clarifying the scope of the issue, and getting approval to begin project planning. This includes forecasting the time and resource required for the project. • Solution design: undertake research and analysis to identify the options and solutions to address the issue, their costs and impacts. 9 • Public participation: this stage covers consultation, which will be genuine and fit for purpose depending on the nature of the policy issue. • Ministerial decisions to proceed: policy options will be finalised, including the costs and impacts. Ministerial and Cabinet approval will be sought for the policy changes. • Policy to legislation: initially draft legislation will be developed but this stage also covers the parliamentary process and any communication on resulting legislation. • Policy to implementation of solutions: the legislation will be implemented and operationalised in accordance with the policy intent. • Post implementation review: a post implementation review will be conducted to ensure that the policy works as intended. 25. Currently, consultation occurs only once the project has reached the public participation stage. This is when some research and analysis has already been undertaken on the issue, and options to address the issue have been identified. Some consultation also occurs in the policy to legislation stage through the Select Committee process. 26. We are committed to ensuring early and continuing engagement with the public on tax changes, and exploring new ways to broaden the public’s engagement with the development of tax policy. 27. We propose a new policy process, where practicable, where public engagement begins from the problem and opportunity design stage and continues throughout all seven stages, including post-implementation review. Model engagement process for policy reforms 28. The proposals below are intended to reaffirm our commitment to existing GTPP consultation processes for each stage of policy development. They also seek to formalise further enhancements to current processes where gaps have been identified, and to reflect how the GTPP has evolved through the years. 29. This document is intended to formalise many principles and processes that are already being applied in major policy reforms, and also to ensure that the tax policy process is consistent with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet’s best practice guidelines for policy development. 4 It is intended that they will apply formally across the board following public feedback on our proposals. 30. Officials are committed to the following principles for all policy reforms: • wider engagement; • engagement with Māori; • earlier and more frequent engagement; 4 Start Right, DPMC Policy Project, https://dpmc.govt.nz/our-programmes/policy-project/policy-methods- toolbox/start-right. See Appendix 3: The DPMC Policy Project’s Start Right approach. 10 • the use of a greater variety of engagement methods; and • greater transparency and accountability. 31. The need for flexibility in managing issues, timing, and resource needs will affect the scope for consultation on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the proposed processes outlined are not intended to be a prescriptive model of consultation to be strictly followed in all cases – there will be situations where a departure from the model process is justified. Wider engagement 32. The project planning process for new policy issues will focus on ensuring that a range of stakeholders and skills are included in project teams from the start. This selection process will consider the particular expertise that is required, while ensuring that the groups most affected by the proposal are adequately represented. 33. This includes ensuring adequate representation as appropriate from interested parties across: • Inland Revenue and the Treasury; • other Government departments; • tax professionals; • accounting software providers; • not-for-profit and other community organisations; • industry and sector representatives; and • members of the general public. 34. The level of engagement with these stakeholders will vary depending on the nature of the issue and the time and resource available. For some policy initiatives, engagement with the tax practitioner community may be sufficient. However, in areas like social policy and not-for-profit tax issues, wider engagement will be necessary. We think that wider engagement outside of the tax community will be most beneficial in the following circumstances: • the tactical phase of the GTPP to help set the general direction of tax and social policy reforms; • when attempting to understand the policy problem or opportunity; • when understanding with who and how to engage; and • when attempting to understand the potential impact of proposed policy changes. 35. We are committed to identifying and developing strong links with interested stakeholders in these areas and using them effectively, while acknowledging that it may take some time to develop. 36. Once identified, the interested parties should be able to be engaged at every stage of the policy development process. At a minimum, this will involve communication of relevant decisions and proposed processes going forward. Where appropriate, opportunities for co-production of tax policy with a wider range of stakeholders involved from the start will lead to more robust and durable policy outcomes. 11 37. Engagement on matters beyond purely tax technical policy issues will also be more effective if those who will have to administer and implement policy decisions can provide early input. This will help identify what the feasible options are, and inform design decisions to ensure that new tax rules are as easy to comply with as possible. 38. Wider engagement also means that, where appropriate, we will seek feedback on a wider range of policy products. Draft wording for inclusion in legislation, commentaries, and Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) items are examples which could benefit from prior consultation before they are finalised or released. Where appropriate, and where time permits, consultation on elements of draft legislation will help ensure that the legislation achieves the policy intent and resolves any inconsistencies. Draft commentaries and TIB items can also be consulted on to ensure they accurately communicate the policy intent, and submitters could suggest areas in which further guidance would be helpful. Engagement with Māori 39. As part of the initiatives towards wider engagement, it is important that appropriate weighting is given to the status of Māori as rightsholders in the process and as Treaty partner of the Crown. To give effect to this special relationship, officials intend to adopt the Māori Crown Relations framework endorsed by Cabinet. 5 The intent and values for engaging with Māori are set out in Table 1. Table 1: Engaging with Māori – intent and values Area for consultation Proposed detail Intent To work with Māori to respond better to the range of needs, aspirations, rights and interests and provide for active partnership with Māori in the design and implementation of the process and outcomes sought. Values Partnership The Crown and Māori will act reasonably, honourably and in good faith towards each other as Treaty partners. Participation The Crown will encourage, and make it easier for Māori to more actively participate in the relationship. Protection The Crown will take active, positive steps to ensure that Māori interests are protected. Recognition of cultural values The Crown will recognise and provide for Māori perspectives and values. Use mana-enhancing processes Recognising the process is as important as the end point; the Crown will commit to early engagement and ongoing attention to the relationship. 5 https://tearawhiti.govt.nz/te-kahui-hikina-maori-crown-relations/engagement/ 12 40. The way that engagement is conducted with Māori will also be determined by the matrix set out in appendix 2. As part of the Māori Crown Relations framework, this matrix provides a sliding scale that stipulates the level and type of engagement required depending on the extent of Māori interests involved. Early and frequent engagement 41. Our stakeholders have identified earlier engagement as a key area where there is room for improvement. Earlier engagement helps to refine the problem definition and identify what might be plausible solutions. This may result in the need for less consultation later in the policy development process, as many of the issues will already have been worked through before the details of the proposals are consulted on. It can also help with appropriately scoping the project early on, which can help policy officials to more efficiently allocate policy resources. 42. We think the first step to engagement is to establish strong links with interested parties. Where possible, standing committees could be formed for various issues or sector groups. Or if such groups have already been formed by other government agencies, those existing relationships could be shared between government agencies as necessary. Tax policy officials already have established consultation channels with representatives of large businesses, but this could be extended to representatives of small and medium businesses, not-for-profit organisations, and other sector or industry groups. 43. Public engagement should be seen less as one discrete task or step in the policy development process – rather, officials will be engaged in continuous ongoing dialogue with interested parties. This will provide opportunities for the public to raise issues as they arise, and it will facilitate more frequent engagement as interested stakeholders have already been identified. We expect that engagement will be spread out over the course of the policy development process, and that it will become part of a more iterative process. This is consistent with the Start Right approach to policy development proposed by the Department of the Prime Minster and Cabinet (DPMC) Policy Project (see appendix 3). 44. The public will be notified on what the Government is working on or intending to work on. This already occurs for most policy issues through the publication of the Government’s tax policy work programme (TPWP), which is refreshed every 18 months. 45. The Ministers of Finance and Revenue are responsible for setting and agreeing the Government’s TPWP every 18 months. Setting the TPWP involves engaging with Ministers and stakeholders towards the end of each TPWP cycle to ensure that the right mix of items are included on the refreshed TPWP, taking into account factors such as wider Government priorities and objectives as well as initial stakeholder views. Once a new work programme is set, we intend to regularly update the TPWP (as appropriate). This includes, for example, ensuring that deliverables for key items of work are progressing within the timeframes outlined on the TPWP. This will also involve checking in with Ministers to ensure that they are still comfortable with the relat ive priorit ies of the items on the TPWP, or understanding whether expectations for certain items of work may have changed. 46. Officials are also developing processes to communicate the Government’s remedial work programme, and to provide interested parties (such as the tax practitioner 13 community) with the opportunity to identify remedial issues which should be addressed. Where appropriate, this will allow engagement on a review of the effectiveness of policies that have been implemented and address any gaps in the rules. 47. We recognise that engaging with policy issues and making submissions comes at a cost to submitters, as often a significant amount of resource is dedicated to preparing submissions. However, we think it will reduce the amount of resource needed to analyse more detailed policy options later in the policy process. Those who do not wish to participate in the earlier engagement with officials to scope the problem definition are free to decline, and instead engage later when more detailed policy options are presented. Methods of engagement 48. For significant policy changes, there will be at least one round of formal public consultation. This already occurs for the vast majority of projects and will continue. However, a greater focus will be placed on ensuring that the method of engagement used is fit for purpose. While a consultation document may be appropriate in most circumstances, officials will consider: • the intended audience and how best to communicate with them; • who is likely to be affected by the proposal; • the scope and scale of the proposal; and • the purpose of the consultation. 49. Some alternative engagement tools include the use of: • focus groups with customers; • workshops with representative industry bodies, community organisations, market participants, and service providers; • online forums; • use of multimedia content across different languages; • processes that are culturally appropriate for particular groups of people – for example, using a hui to engage with Māori customers; and • face to face discussions with affected customers. 50. Many of these alternative engagement tools facilitate active participation by stakeholders, in some respects co-producing the policy solution. Officials will need to weigh up the time and cost required for each engagement tool, and what outputs are created. This will then be incorporated into officials’ project planning processes. Different engagement tools will be added to this list as and when they become more commonly used. 51. When consultation takes place, officials will ensure that the scope of the consultation is clearly communicated. It should be clear what has already been decided, and what scope there is left to influence the outcome. 52. The use of confidential consultation will be minimised in order to ensure that consultation is transparent, and all interested parties have an opportunity to participate. 14 53. Consultation is not a ‘one size fits all’ approach. The level of engagement undertaken will be commensurate to the nature and complexity of the policy issue. Figure 1: Level of engagement Transparency 54. The Organisational Review Committee recognised that consultation must be, and be seen to be, genuine. Genuine consultation is a two-way flow of information, and this should include another flow of information back to submitters. This will be better achieved through a more transparent process to feed back to submitters how officials have considered their points, whether any changes have been made to proposals as a result of their submission, and why or why not. Ensuring that consultation is genuine supports the Tax Working Group’s recommendation that engagement on tax policy initiatives be carried out in good faith by all participants. 55. Following consultation, feedback will be provided to submitters to communicate the Government’s response to the submissions. This would note what has changed as a result of the consultation, and why or why not. 56. Feedback will be provided in a timely manner, once policy decisions have been made. If this is not achievable, officials will provide an explanation of why this is not possible. 57. Under existing processes, officials report to Ministers once submissions on a proposal have been received. This will include a summary of the submissions, as well as recommended responses to those submissions. Cabinet Office Circular CO 18(4), as part of providing for the proactive release of Cabinet papers, also suggests that related key advice papers can be proactively released at the discretion of the relevant Minister. Officials support the release of these key advice papers where appropriate. Releasing existing information also means that this could be achieved without much more additional resource being required to achieve this greater transparency. 6 6 This is also consistent with the proactive release of Cabinet papers within 30 business days of a Cabinet decision being made. The proactive release of Cabinet papers started on 1 January 2019 – see https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-proactively-release-cabinet-papers-%E2%80%93-and- open-government-action-plan-be-issued. 15 58. However, this proactive release would be subject to certain legal or other practical requirements – for example, if the release of the information would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Requirements under the Official Information Act 1982 will also be considered when deciding whether to release certain informat ion. Remedial issues 59. The purpose of a remedial amendment is to ensure that tax legislation aligns with the original policy intent. As the policy would have been through a full consultation process before it was enacted, the value added by consulting on remedial issues is more limited. 60. However, some targeted consultation will help ensure that remedial amendments: • achieve the desired policy outcome; • are able to be easily applied (is the legislation clear and unambiguous?); • do not increase compliance or administration costs; and • do not have any unintended consequences. 61. It should be made clear that the policy is settled and only details concerning the above four matters are subject to consultation. So far, these matters have been left until Select Committee to be ironed out, as they mostly concern how the legislation has been drafted. However, in some circumstances it would be beneficial to use some form of limited consultation to test the practicality of proposed solutions and to gather relevant data. Exceptions 62. While we recognise the importance of providing a clear and transparent set of principles on which consultation processes should be based, we think it is important that processes have enough flexibility to adapt to unique circumstances. There will be some circumstances where full consultation is not appropriate or possible given the costs and benefits associated with engaging on that particular issue. However, the government and policy officials will ensure that these exceptions to usual consultatio n processes are only allowed on a principled basis. 63. For example, under GTPP there is generally an exception to wide public consultation for revenue protection or anti-avoidance measures. This is because prior consultation on these measures could provide taxpayers the opportunity to rearrange their affairs prior to the enactment of the proposed measures. This would reduce the amount of revenue collected. 64. Other circumstances where wide public consultation may be inappropriate include measures included as part of the Budget process, or where Inland Revenue’s secrecy obligations under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (or other secrecy obligations under another Act) may prevent officials from undertaking wider consultation. For example, if there are proposals developed in response to a case involving a specific taxpayer or group of taxpayers, it may be inappropriate to consult widely in order to protect those taxpayers’ commercial position. 16 65. Urgent Government priorities may sometimes require a more truncated policy development process. However, the principles of earlier and wider engagement and greater transparency will still be adhered to, where appropriate, but adapted to suit the tighter timeframes. 66. The reason for having exceptions to the full GTPP consultation process is to ensure that consultation processes are flexible and not overly prescriptive. As such, the exceptions listed in this document are not intended to form an exhaustive list. 67. As a general rule however, it is our view that exceptions will be used sparingly, and the reasons for departing from the usual level of engagement required by the GTPP should be communicated to the public once the proposals are in the public domain. This is to promote greater transparency and accountability, and to ensure that the reasons given for departing from the GTPP can be subjected to public scrutiny. 17 Appendix 1: Overview of the Generic Tax Policy Process (1994) 7 Figure 2: The Generic Tax Policy Process 7 Organisational review of the Inland Revenue Department: report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee, April 1994, page 81.

**THE SWISS CONFEDERATION**

**FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME**

The Government of New Zealand  
and  
the Swiss Federal Council;

Desiring to amend the Convention between the Swiss Confederation and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income signed at Berne on 6 June 1980 (hereinafter “the Convention”);

Have agreed as follows:

**Article I**

The following new preamble shall replace the existing preamble:

“_The Swiss Federal Council and the Government of New Zealand;_

Intending to conclude a Convention for the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in this Convention for the indirect benefit of residents of third States);

Have agreed as follows:”

**Article II**

1.  The existing paragraph 7 of Article 7 (Business profits) of the Convention shall be renumbered as paragraph 8.

2.  The following new paragraph 7 shall be added to Article 7 (Business profits) of the Convention:

“7. A Contracting State shall make no adjustment to the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States after 5 years from the end of the taxable year in which the profits would have been attributable to the permanent establishment. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default.”

**Article III**

The existing paragraph of Article 9 (Associated enterprises) of the Convention shall be numbered as paragraph 1.

2.  The following new paragraph 2 shall be added to Article 9 (Associated enterprises) of the Convention:

“2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall, if necessary, consult each other.”

3.  The following new paragraph 3 shall be added to Article 9 (Associated enterprises) of the Convention:

“3. A Contracting State shall not include in the profits of an enterprise, and tax accordingly, profits that would have accrued to the enterprise but by reason of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 have not so accrued, after 5 years from the end of the taxable year in which the profits would have accrued to the enterprise. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default.”

**Article IV**

The following new paragraph 6 shall be added to Article 22 (Elimination of double taxation) of the Convention:

“6. The provisions of paragraph 3 shall not apply to income derived by a resident of Switzerland where New Zealand applies the provisions of this Convention to exempt such income from tax or applies the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11 or paragraph 2 of Article 12 to such income.”

**Article V**

The first sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 23 (Mutual agreement procedure) of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following sentence:

“Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present the case to the competent authority of either Contracting State.”

**Article VI**

The following new paragraphs 5 and 6 shall be added to Article 23 (Mutual agreement procedure) of the Convention:

“5. Where,

(a) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and

(b) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within three years from the date when all the information required by the competent authorities in order to address the case has been provided to both competent authorities,

any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests in writing. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.

6\. The Contracting States may release to the arbitration board, established under the provisions of paragraph 5, such information as is necessary for carrying out the arbitration procedure. The members of the arbitration board shall be subject to the limitations of disclosure described in paragraph 1 of Article 24 with respect to the information so released.”

**Article VII**

The following new Article 25A (Entitlement to benefits) shall be added to the Convention immediately following Article 25:

“Article 25A Entitlement to benefits

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention.”

**Article VIII**

1\. The existing paragraph 4 of the Protocol to the Convention shall be renumbered as paragraph 5.

2\. The following new paragraph 4 shall be added to the Protocol to the Convention:

“4. With reference to paragraph 5 of Article 23

Notwithstanding paragraph 5 of Article 23 a case may not be submitted to arbitration if:

(a) in the case of New Zealand:

(i) the case involves the application of New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule contained in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, including any subsequent provisions replacing, amending or updating these anti-avoidance rules. New Zealand shall notify the Swiss Confederation through diplomatic channels of any such subsequent provisions;

(ii) the case involves the application of New Zealand’s permanent establishment anti-avoidance rule contained in section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007, including any subsequent provisions replacing, amending or updating these anti-avoidance rules. New Zealand shall notify the Swiss Confederation through diplomatic channels of any such subsequent provisions; and

(b) in the case of Switzerland, the case involves the application of tax avoidance as defined under case law by the Swiss Federal Court.

It is further understood that the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 23 shall not apply if:

(a) the case concerns issues where Chapter VI D.4 (hard-to-value intangibles) of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (July 2017 or a later version of those Guidelines) is applied by a Contracting State in an adjustment according to paragraph 1 of Article 9:

(i) in a fiscal year that is not time barred but concerns profits that relate to a time barred fiscal year in that Contracting State; or

(ii) through the application of domestic legislation which provides for a more extended period for adjustments specifically for hard-to-value intangibles than what applies under the regular statute of limitation for reassessments;

(b) the case is connected with fraud, gross negligence or wilful default.”

**Article IX**

1\. Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other via diplomatic channels of the completion of the procedures required by its law for the bringing into force of this Protocol.

2\. The Protocol shall enter into force on the date of the receipt of the later of these notifications and shall thereupon have effect:

(a) in the case of New Zealand:

(i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of January following the calendar year in which the Protocol enters into force;

(ii) in respect of other taxes, for any taxation year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Protocol enters into force; and

(b) in the case of Switzerland:

(i) in respect of taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of January of the year next following the date on which the Protocol enters into force;

(ii) in respect of other taxes, for taxation years beginning on or after the first day of January of the year next following the date on which the Protocol enters into force.

3\. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 2, the amendments made by Articles II, III, V, VI and VIII of this Protocol shall have effect from the date of entry into force of this Protocol, without regard to the taxable period to which the matter relates. However, for cases that are under consideration under paragraph 2 of Article 23 of the Convention at the date of entry into force of this Protocol, the start date of the 3-year period referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 23 of the Convention shall be the later of the date of entry into force of this Protocol and the date otherwise provided for under paragraph 5 of Article 23 of the Convention.

Impact Statement Template | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Coversheet: GST on low-value imported goods Advising agencies Inland Revenue, New Zealand Customs Service Decision sought Final policy approval Proposing Ministers Hon Grant Robertson (Minister of Finance), Hon Stuart Nash (Minister of Revenue) and Hon Kris Faafoi (Minister of Customs) Note: Changes to the Impact Statement Submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill expressed concern about the proposed application date of the GST amendments of 1 October 2019, noting that this leaves little time between the likely enactment date of the Bill and the start of the proposed collection system for GST on low-value imported goods. Submitters considered that offshore suppliers cannot be expected to invest in making information technology systems changes until the law is enacted, as the proposed rules are not finalised and may yet be subject to change. They have also noted that there may not be enough time after the rules are finalised for offshore suppliers to register for New Zealand GST and make the systems changes necessary to collect GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers by 1 October 2019. This raises a risk that electronic marketplaces and suppliers (that do intend to comply with the proposed legislation) may be left with little choice other than to temporarily cease shipping goods to New Zealand from 1 October until the required systems changes are ready. In light of the issues raised with officials and, by submitters, Ministers’ preferred option in relation to the application date is 1 December 2019, so the Impact Statement has been updated to reflect this Ministerial preference. Fiscal impact of the proposed delay The tax forecasts in the original Impact Statement assumed an application date of 1 October 2019. A delay in the application date to 1 December 2019 would reduce the forecast amount of GST revenue for the 2019/20 fiscal year by $14 million. Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries have been allocated extra funding in Budget 2019 by way of tagged contingencies. These amounts will decrease by approximately $4.334 million in the 2019/20 fiscal year if implementation of the proposals is delayed to 1 December 2019. The net fiscal cost of the proposed delay in implementation is therefore estimated at $9.666 million. Impact Statement Template | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Government has made a decision to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods (refer CAB-18-MIN-0143). The problem under consideration is how to implement the proposed system in a way that imposes as little deadweight cost as possible on the parties involved and in the least distortionary way possible, while also maximising voluntary compliance. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The taxing point for imported goods valued at or below $1,000 is proposed to be the point of sale (as opposed to being at the border, as is presently the case for consignments between the Customs de minimis 1 and $1,000). This means that non-resident suppliers (as well as electronic marketplaces and “re-deliverers”) 2 would be required to register for, collect, return and remit GST on their sales of goods valued at or below $1,000. This is considered to be the most feasible and cost-effective collection option at this time. Requiring offshore suppliers to collect GST on imported goods valued at or below $1,000 is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach. The reason for thi s preference is that Inland Revenue has placed a higher weighting on making the rules as simple as possible for the parties involved in order to minimise aggregate compliance costs. Customs prefers an approach whereby offshore suppliers would be required to collect GST on imported goods valued at or below $400. Under Customs’ preferred approach, Customs would continue to collect GST and other charges on imported consignments valued above $400. Customs prefers this approach because it is estimated to collect $303 million of additional GST over the forecast period compared with $278 million under a $1,000 threshold. The Crown would also forgo up to $8.8 million in tariff duty under a $1,000 threshold, and Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries would forgo at least $48.9 million of departmental revenue over the forecast period if alternative funding arrangements are not put in place. A $1,000 threshold may also reduce the incentive for importers to provide accurate information, potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management. 1 The Customs de minimis is defined as the minimum amount of “duty” collectable (which includes GST), as opposed to the maximum value of a consignment on which duty is not collected. The de minimis is $60, meaning that if the amount of GST and duties on a consignment is less than $60, revenue and cost recovery charges are not collected on that consignment. 2 An electronic marketplace, such as a website, app or internet portal, is commonly used by sellers to market and sell their products to buyers. Re-deliverers are used by consumers when the supplier of the goods (or the marketplace) does not offer shipping to New Zealand. The most common scenario is that the goods are instead shipped to an overseas mailbox from which the re-deliverer collects the goods and ships them to New Zealand, but the re-deliverer definition would also include businesses providing personal shopper services. Impact Statement Template | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Key beneficiaries are expected to be: • Government: The New Zealand Government would collect additional GST, estimated to be $52 million for the 2019/20 fiscal year (assuming a 1 December 2019 application date). However the Government may incur a fiscal cost of approximately $17.795 million per annum (based on the 2017/18 year) in replacing funding for Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) that is currently cost-recovered by the two agencies under existing arrangements, depending on final decisions. The Government would also forgo tariffs (of up to $3.2 million per annum based on the 2017/18 year) on consignments valued at or below $1,000. • Domestic retailers: Collecting GST on low-value imported goods may in some cases help to improve New Zealand-based retailers’ ability to compete with offshore suppliers of low-value goods. • Fast freight: Courier companies would no longer collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on behalf of the Government on goods between the current de minimis and $1,000. This is expected to generate some administrative cost savings for the industry. • New Zealand Post: Like courier companies, New Zealand Post would no longer be involved in collecting revenue on goods valued at or below $1,000 which may lead to some cost savings. • Consumers: While consumers as a whole are unambiguously worse off, some consumers would benefit from the removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges from imported consignments between the de minimis and $1,000. • Businesses importing low-value goods: Businesses that import low-value consignments would also benefit from the removal of cost recovery charges and tariffs on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Where do the costs fall? Costs are expected to fall on: • Consumers: Consumers would pay GST on imported goods valued at less than $400 which they previously would not have paid any GST or duties on under the current border collection system. Suppliers’ compliance costs may also be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices (over and above the amount of the tax itself). There is also a risk that consumer choice may be adversely affected if suppliers cease to offer shipping of goods to delivery addresses in New Zealand. Consumers may also experience delays in receiving goods if Customs and MPI require increased physical inspections as a consequence of a potential decrease in the reliability of information provided to Customs for border and biosecurity risk assessment. Impact Statement Template | 4 IN CONFIDENCE • Suppliers (including electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers): Suppliers meeting the $60,000 GST registration threshold would bear the compliance costs of making the necessary systems changes and implementing new processes, registering, filing GST returns and remitting the GST to Inland Revenue. Suppliers selling through electronic marketplaces would not be required to register and return GST to Inland Revenue if their non-marketplace sales to New Zealand consumers are less than $60,000, as the operator of the electronic marketplace would be the entity responsible for registering and returning GST on sales made by third parties through its marketplace. In these situations, the marketplace operator may pass its compliance costs on to the underlying suppliers. • New Zealand-based manufacturers: Footwear and clothing manufacturers may be adversely affected by the removal of tariffs on imported footwear and clothing under the proposed $1,000 threshold (given that the few remaining tariffs are mostly on clothing and footwear manufactured in certain countries). However, these industries have already had to adapt to the increasing non-collection of tariffs, as the phased implementation of New Zealand’s free trade agreements mean that the amount of tariffs that would otherwise be collected if no action is taken would be decreasing over time anyway. • Customs and MPI: Cost recovery charges 3 which fund Customs’ and MPI’s risk management activities at the border would be forgone on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. This would exacerbate an existing funding shortfall for Customs and MPI until a new cost recovery regime is put in place, unless Crown funding is provided to replace the lost cost-recovered funding. Customs and MPI may also incur costs should the quality of data associated with entries diminish resulting in increased physical inspection of goods. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Key risks and unintended impacts include: • Risk of suppliers and electronic marketplaces ceasing to offer shipping to New Zealand delivery addresses: If the compliance costs are disproportionately high or are perceived by the relevant collection entities to be too high, there is a risk that some non-resident suppliers or operators of electronic marketplaces may not comply with the rules or may not continue to ship goods to New Zealand delivery addresses. This risk is thought to be more significant for smaller suppliers that make supplies to New Zealand consumers near or above the $60,000 registration threshold. 4 The inclusion of rules that impose the liability to register for and return GST on operators of electronic marketplaces in respect of low-value goods sold through their marketplaces to New Zealand consumers by non-resident suppliers should help to 3 The Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy. 4 It is assumed that non-resident suppliers with annual sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000 would predominantly be large (or at least medium) entities, given that the $60,000 registration threshold applies to their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than their worldwide sales, and that in most cases their sales to New Zealanders would be a small proportion of their total worldwide sales. However, it is likely that there would be some smaller suppliers that would nevertheless have sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000. Impact Statement Template | 5 IN CONFIDENCE mitigate the risk of smaller suppliers ceasing to ship to New Zealand, as many of these suppliers would be selling to New Zealand through an electronic marketplace. Officials’ preferred options that are outlined in this Regulatory Impact Assessment include measures that are intended to simplify the requirements for non-resident suppliers, operators of electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers as much as possible, which should help to reduce this risk. • Competitive disadvantages for compliant businesses: There is a risk that the addition of GST to the prices of goods offered to consumers by compliant businesses may result in a competitive advantage for other businesses that would not be required to register and return GST (or that would not comply with the rules if liable to register). The inclusion of rules that would deem operators of electronic marketplaces to be the suppliers of low-value goods sold through their marketplaces by non-residents should help to minimise this risk by improving compliance with the rules. This would however result in GST being collected on goods supplied by non-residents that would not otherwise be required to be returned if these suppliers sold goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website. It is a possibility that this may potentially create a competitive disadvantage for compliant marketplace operators. However, this risk is not thought to be significant given the market dominance of the large electronic marketplaces. • Quality of import entry information for biosecurity and border risk assessment: The preferred option may reduce the incentive for importers to enter accurate information (as there will be no requirement to pay revenue on consignments below $1,000), which may have adverse consequences for the management of biosecurity and other border risks. Customs and MPI will monitor any impacts on the management of border and biosecurity risks. • Undervaluation of goods by suppliers or importers for Customs purposes: Compared with the existing de minimis, a $1,000 threshold may exacerbate the existing issue of undervaluation in relation to high-value consignments. This may not have a significant impact on net GST collections on imported consignments valued above $1,000 (as the vast majority of imported goods above $1,000 are imported by GST-registered businesses), but this could have adverse implications for the collection of tariffs and cost recovery charges on high-value consignments. • Potential behavioural changes by consumers: Compared with the existing de minimis, the $1,000 threshold may also incentivise consumers to purchase goods valued between $400 and $1,000 free of GST/VAT from offshore retailers that would be below the registration threshold. It is difficult to say how significant this risk may be, since it is expected that many larger offshore retailers that ship goods to New Zealand would be above the registration threshold, and it is unclear how many smaller offshore suppliers below the registration threshold would sell goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website or mail order. Consumers may also be incentivised to arrange for friends or family members in foreign countries to buy goods for them and reimburse the friend or family member. However, whether this would necessarily be cost-effective is uncertain, as it is likely to be the case that the consumer would end up paying foreign Impact Statement Template | 6 IN CONFIDENCE VAT, GST or sales tax if they arrange for a friend or family member to buy the goods and ship the goods to them. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Analysing the impact of the proposals on offshore suppliers has been constrained by the lack of data and information available. Fiscal impact estimates have been modelled using retail banking data for the 2017/18 fiscal year supplied by Datamine. Online transactions were identified using a range of methods, including by identifying whether a card was present for a transaction and isolating transactions with known e-commerce only retailers. To exclude services and intangibles and the likes of tax payments, only transactions with merchant category codes clearly related to goods retail were included. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: The Treasury, Inland Revenue Department and New Zealand Customs Quality Assurance Assessment: A joint panel from The Treasury, Inland Revenue and Customs considers that the Regulatory Impact Assessment partially meets the quality criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The RIS could probably be clearer and more concise, particularly as to the nature and implications of the agency disagreement as to the value threshold below which offshore suppliers would be required to collect GST. However, it seems unlikely that this would make the decision itself any more clear-cut, since the adoption of either threshold will entail downsides as well as upsides. It is also evident that consumer and supplier behaviour will be a major driver of the outcome in practice, particularly in terms of revenue collected. It will therefore be important, as set out in the RIS, to collect data and information from different sources, including experience in other jurisdictions, to inform ongoing monitoring and possibly review of the new approach. Impact Statement Template | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Statement: GST on low-value imported goods Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service are responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations and constraints on the analysis are as follows: • Range of options considered: The Government has already made a decision that it intends to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on imported goods valued at or below $400 (refer CAB-18-MIN-0143). Options considered are therefore focussed on the key design settings for that particular collection model (as opposed to considering alternative collection models), including the level of the low-value goods threshold. • Evidence of the problem: There are some uncertainties about the scale of the problem in terms of estimating the forgone GST revenue. Retail banking data supplied by Datamine suggests a potential forgone revenue figure on imported goods below the de minimis for the 2017/18 fiscal year of approximately $130 million, which is assumed to be growing at a rate of around 11.9 percent each year. • Quality of data used for impact analysis: It is not possible to accurately determine how many offshore suppliers may register and comply under the preferred option. A crude estimate may be obtained by reference to the number of entities that have registered under Australia’s new GST legislation (which is based on essentially the same collection model). However, registrations are continuing to be processed in Australia, which means that the eventual number of registrants in Australia may be significantly more than the 721 entities that had registered as of 10 July 2018. While there is data on how much GST is collected by Customs on imported goods, it is not possible to determine the net amount of GST collected on imported goods as many consignments are imported by GST-registered businesses that are able to claim the GST back from Inland Revenue. This means the potential fiscal risk of increasing the threshold above which GST is collected on consignments at the border and below which non-resident suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers are responsible for returning GST cannot be precisely quantified. • Assumptions underpinning impact analysis: The Government’s proposed approach is estimated to increase GST revenue by approximately $66 million for the 2018/19 fiscal year, increasing to $100 million and $112 million in the 2019/20 and 2020/21 fiscal years respectively. The primary caveat to this revenue forecast Impact Statement Template | 8 IN CONFIDENCE is that it assumes static behaviour on the part of both suppliers and consumers. However, the imposition of GST on low-value imported goods may decrease consumers’ propensity to buy goods from offshore, and may also decrease suppliers’ willingness to ship goods to New Zealand, further increasing costs of importing goods for consumers. Another key limitation is that the revenue forecast assumes for simplicity a 100 percent collection rate under the existing border collection system in relation to consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. The limitation of this assumption is that it is clear that undervaluation by suppliers is an issue to some extent, but the exact scale of the problem and the amount of GST forgone as a result are unknown. • Time constraints: The Government has chosen offshore supplier registration as the proposed collection model on the basis that this is the only option that can be feasibly and cost effectively implemented in 2019/20 (that is, without having to wait for future technological advancements and improvements in the availability of electronic advance data in the international postal system). Responsible Managers: Gordon Witte Anna Cook Acting Policy Manager Director Policy Policy and Strategy Policy, Legal and Governance Inland Revenue New Zealand Customs Service 21 May 2019 21 May 2019 Impact Statement Template | 9 IN CONFIDENCE Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? Historically, the majority of imported goods have been imported by businesses in consignments valued above the de minimis. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers imported goods below the de minimis. Therefore, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported goods below the de minimis were considered to outweigh the benefits of taxation at that time. However, the growth in online purchases means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant (retail banking data supplied by Datamine indicates that New Zealand consumers spent approximately $870 million online on goods from offshore suppliers in 2017/18). The implication of this is that domestic businesses may be at a disadvantage compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price of the goods. It also means that the Government is forgoing GST revenue on goods that are consumed in New Zealand, and this forgone revenue is increasing over time. Based on a seven-year average, the number of imported consignments valued below $400 is growing at about 17 percent per annum. In response to these issues, the Government has made a decision to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods (refer CAB-18- MIN-0143). 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? Border collection system GST is currently collected by the New Zealand Customs Service on imported consignments on which at least $60 of “duty” (including GST) is collectable. In practice this means that GST is not collected on imported consignments with a value below $400 (including freight and insurance) if GST is the only duty owing (which is typically the case). However, where the goods are subject to tariffs, the insurance and freight-inclusive value of the goods may be as low as $226, depending on the applicable tariff rate and the amount of international freight and insurance charges. 5 Customs’ and MPI’s border risk and biosecurity activities are funded by the collection of cost recovery charges on imported consignments above the de minimis. Work to date has shown that a substantial reduction in the current de minimis (fr om $60 of duty) is not feasible in the short term as the marginal costs of collection under the existing system would outweigh the additional revenue collected. The extent to which the de minimis may eventually be reduced in a cost-effective way under the current system or under a model where fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post collect the GST is also uncertain, as is the likely timing of such a reduction in the de minimis. Other interested agencies (from a trade, competition or consumer affairs standpoint) are the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and 5 This consignment value of $226 assumes that the applicable tariff rate is the maximum 10 percent rate and that there are no clearly separable freight and insurance charges. Impact Statement Template | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Employment (MBIE), who were all consulted during the process of drafting this Regulatory Impact Assessment. Offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on remote services The preferred option builds upon the existing system that has been successfully implemented since 1 October 2016 for the collection of GST on cross-border supplies of “remote” services, including supplies of digital services and intangibles such as streaming services and software. At the time of designing the rules, policy officials had conservatively estimated the total forgone GST revenue to be around $40 million and that around 100 businesses might register. Since implementation, the rules have been performing better than initial expectations, with $131 million in revenue being collected under these rules for the 2017/18 tax year (the year covering 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018) with over 200 businesses registered to date. This more than favourably compares with other jurisdictions’ experience with implementing similar rules for the collection of consumption taxes on cross-border services and intangibles. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? GST as a broad-based consumption tax should apply to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand, including imported goods. This helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple, as opposed to being a tax that distorts competition by creating biases in consumers’ or businesses’ behaviour or which collects little revenue by only collecting on a narrow tax base. At present, GST is collected on imported goods when duty (including tariffs and GST) of $60 or more applies. This threshold is called the de minimis 6 and equates to a consignment value that varies between $226 and $400 according to whether or not tariffs are payable. The non-collection of GST is problematic because the growth in online purchases from offshore suppliers means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is large and growing, and so is the amount of forgone revenue. Forgone revenue Estimates of the forgone revenue vary. In 2015, Inland Revenue estimated a ‘maximum potential’ forgone GST revenue figure of approximately $140 million per annum using credit card data. Officials did further work in 2016 using a mixed dataset including Customs sample data on import values, as well as data on volumes from New Zealand Post and fast freight carriers and Australian estimates of the split between business and consumer purchases. This work indicated a lower potential forgone GST revenue figure of approximately $80 million for the 2016 calendar year. More recently, Inland Revenue has estimated using retail banking data that approximately $130 million in GST revenue was forgone in 2017. This more recent figure is considered to be more robust than previous estimates, as the use of merchant category codes and proxies for identifying online-only transactions should mean that the dataset roughly consists only of online purchases of goods from offshore suppliers. A limitation of the 2015 estimate is that an assumption had to be made about the split 6 The rationale behind having a de minimis is to achieve a balance between the cost of collection and revenue collected, as well as to facilitate the free flow of goods across the border. Impact Statement Template | 11 IN CONFIDENCE between spending on goods versus spending on services and intangibles. The main limitation of the 2017 estimate (based on a mixed dataset including Customs’ sample data) is that its reliance on declared values may produce an estimate that is lower than the actual forgone revenue, as suppliers may be incentivised under the current system to under- declare values. The growth in direct consumer imports is a relatively recent development and the amount of forgone GST is expected to continue to grow – estimates vary but assuming the growth in the total value of goods imported below the de minimis is 11.9 percent per year 7 , the amount of forgone GST is forecasted to grow to $183 million by 2021 if no action is taken. Competitive neutrality The extent to which the current non-collection influences consumers’ purchasing decisions is unclear, as there are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers may purchase goods from offshore, including overall cheaper prices, product availability and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The following options were considered and ruled out by ministers: • Collection between the point of sale and delivery by transporters: fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post would collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on goods above a lowered de minimis (“extended status quo” or “transporter model”). • Collection after delivery: consumers would pay GST directly to the government after delivery of the goods (“pay after delivery” or a “consumer reverse charge”). These options were also considered by officials in a previous Regulatory Impact Assessment in July 2017 and by the Tax Working Group (the TWG). The TWG recommended that the Government implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low- value imported goods, noting that practical concerns with options to collect GST between the point of sale and delivery and after delivery mean these two options may not be feasible in the short term. The previous work on GST on cross-border services and intangibles considered an option where financial intermediaries, such as credit card companies and other payment processing intermediaries, would be responsible for remitting GST on online purchases of low-value imported goods. This option was considered to be unlikely to be feasible because financial intermediaries would be unlikely to have the information necessary to precisely determine in all cases whether the payment was for goods or services (or both), or whether the goods or services were purchased while the consumer was overseas. Another limitation is that where the payment for the goods is made to a New Zealand-based entity (such as a resident marketplace), there would not be sufficient information about whether the underlying supplier of the goods is based offshore or not. 7 The growth in the total value of low-value goods imported by New Zealand consumers would be less than the annual growth in volumes of 17%, as the majority of the growth in volumes is at the lower value bands. Impact Statement Template | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Interdependencies with ongoing work Customs’ border risk management and MPI’s current biosecurity processes are reliant on information about the content of low-value goods. For example, courier companies provide information on low-value goods prior to their arrival at the border for risk management. Import entry data are used by MPI and Customs to risk-assess consignments at the border. This means that these existing information requirements would need to remain in place under the preferred option, even though this information would not be used for the collection of GST or tariff duty on low-value imported goods. There are also cost recovery implications for Customs and MPI, associated with the proposed removal of the Import Entry Transaction Fee and the Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy (which fund Customs’ and MPI’s risk and biosecurity assessment activities at the border) from imported consignments with a value of $1,000 or less. Customs is currently reviewing its cost recovery arrangement and will report back on the financial implications of its lost cost-recovered funding in the context of that review. MPI expects to report to Cabinet on the financial implications of its lost cost-recovered funding at the time of final policy decisions by Cabinet on the GST on low-value imported goods proposals. Both MFAT and MBIE carry out work which has implications for New Zealand’s tariff policy. Impact Statement Template | 13 IN CONFIDENCE 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The main stakeholders are consumers, non-resident suppliers of low-value goods, operators of electronic marketplaces, re-deliverers, the fast freight industry and customs brokers, New Zealand Post, domestic retailers, tax advisors and domestic clothing and footwear manufacturers. A government discussion document GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system was released in May 2018 for full public consultation on key design issues. Inland Revenue received 32 submissions in response to the discussion document. A further 49 submissions to the Tax Working Group that mentioned the GST on low-value imported goods issue were also forwarded to Inland Revenue officials to consider. The submissions received were from private sector tax advisors, goods transporters and customs brokers, New Zealand business groups, electronic marketplaces and a number of private individuals. Most submissions were generally favourable at a high level of the proposed offshore supplier registration system. However, some submissions indicated a preference for a different collection model to the one proposed in the discussion document, or otherwise stated that other collection models should be given further consideration before being discounted. A couple of submissions from tax advisors considered that the proposed offshore supplier registration system may only be an interim step until technological advancements make an alternative collection model feasible. The New Zealand retail industry groups that made submissions on the discussion document agreed with the analysis of the problem presented in the discussion document and were strongly in favour of the proposed solution. New Zealand Post, fast freight carriers and customs brokers were also broadly supportive of the proposed approach but expressed some concerns about the finer details of how the system would be implemented, particularly in relation to the lack of detail provided in the discussion document as to how the proposals would interact with customs processes at the border and any potential changes to these processes. Most private individuals (the bulk of whom submitted to the TWG rather than on the discussion document) supported the collection of GST on low-value imported goods. However, as most of these submissions were made to the TWG prior to the release of the discussion document, these submissions tended not to comment on any specific details of the proposals, such as the proposed collection model. A small number of submissions (including those on the discussion document and to the TWG) from private individuals were opposed to the collection of GST on low-value imported goods regardless of the collection model. Submitters’ views on the design options are noted in the discussion of those options in section 5. Impact Statement Template | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? The options analysed in section 5 consist of the following packages of key design options: • Option one: Design options proposed in the government discussion document (with some gap-filling design options added in for where the discussion document was silent on a specific design detail). • Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $400. • Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000. Option one: Design options proposed in the government discussion document (status quo option) In April 2018, Cabinet decided to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on imported goods valued at or below $400 and to release a government discussion document to consult on the design details of the proposed system (refer CAB- 18-MIN-0143). This option reflects the package of design features that were proposed in the government discussion document released for public consultation in May 2018. Scope of the rules and registration requirements The proposed offshore supplier registration system would only apply to goods supplied by non-residents with a customs value of $400 or less. 8 Goods would be covered by the proposed regime where either the actual supplier of the goods (or the supplier for GST purposes if not the same person) arranges, assists or facilitates the delivery of the goods to a New Zealand address. 9 Supplies to GST-registered businesses would be excluded from the scope of the rules. Rules for determining whether the supply is made to a consumer or to a GST-registered business would apply. However, where GST is charged on a supply to a GST-registered business, the supplier would be allowed to issue the recipient with a tax invoice (thus allowing the GST-registered recipient to claim a deduction for the GST in its GST return), 8 The calculation of the customs value is set out in Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018. In the case of low-value imported goods, the customs value would generally be the transaction value of the goods (being the price paid or payable when they are sold for export to New Zealand), subject to a number of adjustments including deductions for the costs of transportation, insurance and other charges and expenses related to the handling and transportation of the goods from the time they have left the country of export. For the purposes of determining whether GST applies at the point of sale, a supplier would be able to self- assess the customs value using a reasonable estimate as at the time of supply, rather than being required to determine it strictly in accordance with schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act. 9 The discussion document was silent on whether or not this $400 threshold would be based on the customs value or the freight and insurance-inclusive value of the goods. Basing the threshold on the customs value of the goods has been chosen on the basis of feedback received in submissions. Impact Statement Template | 15 IN CONFIDENCE provided that the value of the supply does not exceed $1,000 – otherwise the supplier would be required to provide a refund of the GST. Non-resident suppliers would be required to register for GST and collect and return GST on goods that have a customs value of $400 or less if their taxable supplies of goods and services exceed (or are expected to exceed) $60,000 in a given 12-month period. However, where low-value goods are sold through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be deemed to be the supplier of the goods for GST purposes and would therefore have the responsibility for registering and returning GST. Suppliers that only sell through GST-registered electronic marketplaces (or who make less than $60,000 in taxable supplies outside of a GST-registered electronic marketplace) would not be required to register. A re-deliverer would only be deemed to be the supplier of low-value goods imported by a consumer if neither the supplier nor an operator of an electronic marketplace assists in bringing the goods to New Zealand. Interaction with border collection system GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges would not be collected at the border on imported consignments with a customs value of $400 or less. However, GST (along with tariffs, cost recovery charges and other applicable levies) would continue to be collected at the border by Customs on consignments with a customs value in excess of $400. Double taxation (where both the supplier and Customs collect GST) may arise when multiple low-value goods are sent in a single consignment valued above $400, or if low-value goods are sent in a consignment with goods valued above $400. Double taxation could also arise where the exchange rate used by the supplier at the time of supply differed from that used by Customs at the time of importation. The supplier would be required to issue a receipt to a New Zealand consumer in relation to a supply of low-value imported goods. The receipt would be required to include the name and GST registration number of the supplier, the date of issue and a description of the goods supplied. If GST has been charged on all of the goods, the receipt should show the amount paid for the supply along with a statement that this includes GST, or alternatively, the receipt could identify the GST charged for each of the goods separately. If GST has been charged on only some of the goods (for instance if some are valued above $400), the receipt should include information showing whether GST has been charged on each of the goods. Monetary amounts detailed on the receipt would not need to be in New Zealand dollars. To prevent Customs from collecting GST on the importation of the goods, the consumer would provide their receipt to Customs when asked by Customs to pay the GST. Where double taxation does arise, the supplier would be responsible for providing the consumer with a refund of the GST. 10 10 The discussion document was silent on who would provide a refund. Placing the responsibility for providing refunds on the supplier is included as one of the design options here as it is officials’ preferred option in relation to who is responsible for providing refunds. Impact Statement Template | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST Operators of electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers need to use information from either underlying suppliers or consumers to determine the GST treatment of supplies. A marketplace operator would need to have information about the residency of an underlying supplier, as the proposed marketplace rules only apply to supplies made by non-resident underlying suppliers. Re-deliverers would rely on information provided by consumers about the value of the goods. Marketplace operators and re-deliverers would still be liable for GST and any associated interest or penalties in situations where the supplier or consumer provides incorrect or misleading information which results in a GST shortfall. Operators of electronic marketplaces would also be liable for GST on goods sold by non- resident suppliers through their marketplaces to New Zealand consumers in situations where: • The payment for the goods is made directly to the supplier instead of to the marketplace operator, or when there is not a split payment mechanism allowing the amount of the GST to be remitted by the payment processor to the marketplace operator; and • The supplier defaults on paying the amount of the GST to the marketplace operator. Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $400 Scope of the rules and registration requirements With the exception of two additions, the design features relating to the scope of the proposed rules are the same as those described under option one. To reduce compliance costs for some suppliers (including re-deliverers and operators of electronic marketplaces), these businesses would be able to charge GST on goods valued above $400 supplied to New Zealand consumers if: • The supplier (or deemed supplier) self-assesses that their total sales of goods individually valued above $400 are no more than 5 percent of the value of their total supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers; or • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to allow a supplier not meeting the above 5 percent test to charge GST on goods valued above $400. 11 To reduce compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between supplies to consumers and to GST-registered businesses, suppliers would also be able to agree with the Commissioner on an alternative method for determining whether a supply is made to a GST- registered person. This could apply in situations where the nature of the supply or the total 11 The proposed discretion could cover circumstances where the 5 percent test is not met due to a minor or one- off discrepancy, where it is too difficult for the supplier to determine precisely whether or not their supplies of goods above the threshold to consumers are less than 5 percent of their total sales of goods to consumers (but it is likely to be the case that they would be less than 5 percent) and the Commissioner is satisfied that the supplier represents a low compliance risk. Impact Statement Template | 17 IN CONFIDENCE value of the supply is such that it would be expected to be received only by a GST-registered business. For example, if the supply is of a large number of low-value imported goods (for instance, hundreds of t-shirts or hundreds of hard copies of a book), either the nature or the value of the supply (or both) would likely indicate that the customer is not a consumer. The design features relating to registration requirements are the same as in option one. Interaction with border collection system Aside from one addition relating to the prevention of double taxation, the design features for how the proposed offshore supplier registration system would interact with the existing border collection system are the same as those described under option one. The supplier would be required to take reasonable steps to ensure that GST information is included on Customs documents. 12 The supplier could do this by providing the fast freight carrier with a copy of the receipt described under option one, or by instructing the person that undertakes the fulfilment of the goods to do so. If the value of the consignment is above the low-value goods threshold, the fast freight carrier or customs broker would include the supplier’s GST registration number and information about which goods had GST collected by the supplier on the Customs documentation. If this information is included on Customs documents then Customs will only collect GST on the items in the consignment on which GST was not collected at the point of sale. Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST The Commissioner would be provided with the ability to prescribe or agree to a method for a marketplace operator or a re-deliverer to make conclusions relevant to whether they are the deemed supplier of low-value goods and the amount of GST that is payable. When exercising the discretion, the Commissioner would take into account the commercially relevant information that is available to the marketplace operator and the reliability of this information, the compliance costs of the marketplace operator and the mechanisms the marketplace operator has to prevent and address situations where incorrect information is provided. Where the marketplace operator or re-deliverer has a safe harbour agreement, they would not be liable for additional GST if they have relied on incorrect information and as a result have underpaid GST. If this happens, the underlying supplier or consumer may be required to register and pay the GST instead. Operators of electronic marketplaces would be able to claim a bad debt deduction in circumstances where the supplier defaulted in paying the GST to the marketplace operator, provided the marketplace’s commission or facilitation fee was also not collected. 12 At present this would only be feasible where goods are being delivered by fast freight, as there is currently insufficient electronic data on parcels sent through the international postal system. Hence this would not be a requirement where goods are sent to New Zealand by post. Impact Statement Template | 18 IN CONFIDENCE Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 (Ministers’ proposed option) Scope of the rules and registration requirements The proposed offshore supplier registration system would generally apply to goods supplied by non-residents with a customs value of $1,000 or less. With the exception of the change in the proposed low-value goods threshold from $400 to $1,000, the other design features relating to the scope of the proposed rules and registration requirements would be the same as those described under option two. Interaction with border collection system GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges would not be collected at the border on imported consignments with a customs value of $1,000 or less. However, GST (along with tariffs, cost recovery charges and other applicable levies) would continue to be collected at the border by Customs on consignments with a customs value in excess of $1,000. The design features for the prevention of double taxation are the same as those under option two, as is the process for GST refunds where double taxation does arise. Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST The design features for marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST (where the supplier or consumer provided incorrect or misleading information or where the supplier defaulted in paying the GST to the marketplace operator) are the same as those in option two. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The criteria against which the options have been assessed are: • Certainty and simplicity: The rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers are aware of the GST treatment of a particular supply and their GST obligations. • Efficiency of compliance: Compliance costs for businesses and consumers should be minimised as far as possible. • Efficiency of administration: Administrative costs for government departments should be minimised as far as possible. • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation. • Sustainability and neutrality: The preferred option must have the ability to meet the objectives of collecting the forgone GST revenue and reducing the distortions the current treatment brings about, without unduly restricting trade and consumer choice or creating new distortions. Counteracting measures should be kept proportionate to the risks involved. Impact Statement Template | 19 IN CONFIDENCE Efficiency of compliance, sustainability and neutrality and fairness and equity are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading off increased administration costs for gains in these three areas. The certainty and simplicity criterion would generally be positively correlated with the efficiency of compliance criterion, in that the more certain and simple the rules are, the lower compliance costs should be. However, there are some instances where increased simplicity and certainty for one group may come at the cost of increased uncertainty or complexity for another group. There may also be instances where having more flexible as opposed to prescriptive rules makes the rules simpler for some parties (and thus reduces their compliance costs) but results in the rules being more complex or less certain for other parties. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No low-value goods threshold An option where offshore suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers would be required to charge GST on all supplies of imported goods to New Zealand consumers (with or without GST collection at the border by Customs on consignments above a certain value) was ruled out. This option was discounted because of concerns about the potential revenue risks involved with replacing the existing collection of GST at the border on high-value consignments with collection at the point of sale by offshore suppliers, being that offshore suppliers may not return the GST that they had collected (or had purported to have collected on the customs documentation). Defining the low-value goods threshold with reference to the value of the transaction Defining the low-value goods threshold in terms of the value of the total transaction, as opposed to the value of an individual good, was also ruled out. This is because multiple low- value goods could be sold together in the same transaction with a total value in excess of the low-value goods threshold. Non-taxation would therefore arise where the goods were shipped separately in multiple consignments each valued below the low-value goods threshold, thus creating an avoidance opportunity. Preventing double taxation The discussion document asked for submissions on whether a reasonable belief exception similar to that legislated in Australia may be an appropriate way to avoid double taxation. Under a reasonable belief exception, the supplier would not charge GST on a supply of low- value goods if it had a reasonable belief that the goods will be shipped together in a single consignment with a total value above the low-value goods threshold. A reasonable belief exception was ultimately ruled out on the basis that it would likely be only very rarely used by suppliers, based on the experience so far in Australia. It may also be potentially quite subjective, which could create difficulties for suppliers pose and potentially pose an integrity risk. Refunds where double taxation arises Options where either Customs or Inland Revenue would be responsible for providing GST refunds to consumers where double taxation arises were considered and ultimately ruled Impact Statement Template | 20 IN CONFIDENCE out. This is mostly because having Customs provide refunds would be disproportionately costly and would likely be difficult for consumers (at present the provision of one refund takes two hours of staff time). Given that the instances of double taxation should be rare, having Inland Revenue set up an entirely new process is likely to also be disproportionately costly. It would also not be intuitive for consumers to approach Inland Revenue for a refund (being a party that they had not otherwise had any interaction with in relation to the transaction). It is expected that placing the responsibility for providing refunds on suppliers would provide suppliers with more incentive to take reasonable steps to prevent double taxation. Business-to-business supplies Options where offshore suppliers would be required to register and return GST in respect of business-to-business supplies or where suppliers would have the option of charging GST on business-to-business supplies valued above $1,000 were ruled out owing to the revenue risks associated with high-value supplies, which naturally pose a greater fraud risk. 13 Electronic marketplaces A “pure” vendor collection model (where the only persons that would have a liability to register and return GST would be suppliers that have legal title over the goods sold to consumers) was not considered. Officials consider that the level of compliance with a pure vendor collection model would not be likely to be good enough to warrant serious consideration of such a model, as it is expected that a large proportion of revenue would continue to be forgone while also meaning that there would not be a level playing field for suppliers that do comply. A joint and several liability model, similar to the one introduced in the United Kingdom for tackling non-compliance by suppliers selling through online marketplaces, was not given much consideration primarily because it is similar to the rebuttable presumption model described below, and hence there are similar concerns with it in relation to compliance costs, enforcement and administration costs. Consideration was given to two exceptions to the “deemed supplier” approach behind the proposed marketplace rules: • Rebuttable presumption model: The default position would be that the marketplace would be deemed to be the supplier, but this presumption of liability can be rebutted if the marketplace agrees to meet the requirements of a “recognised marketplace”. A recognised marketplace would be required to provide Inland Revenue with information about their underlying suppliers, including their trading names, contact details and the total value of supplies of low-value goods that each of their underlying suppliers is making through the marketplace to New Zealand consumers. A recognised marketplace would also endeavour to ensure that liable suppliers have registered and are returning the GST on supplies made to New Zealand consumers, and 13 Although the goods covered by the proposals are by definition of a low value, multiple low-value goods may nevertheless be supplied together as a single high-value supply. Impact Statement Template | 21 IN CONFIDENCE would be required to block suppliers that are continuously non-compliant from selling to New Zealand where the marketplace is aware or should be aware of this non-compliance. For low-level compliance with their responsibilities, a recognised marketplace would be subject to warnings, ultimately leading to monetary penalties. For significant or ongoing non-compliance the marketplace would lose its “recognised” status even if, despite its best efforts to ensure compliance from suppliers, the suppliers selling through the marketplace are largely non-compliant. • Commissioner discretion: The Commissioner would have a discretion to allow a given electronic marketplace to not have the responsibility for registering and returning GST in respect of goods sold through its platform. This discretion would apply where the Commissioner considers the marketplace has a compelling case that it cannot be reasonably expected to be able to comply with the deemed supplier requirements. These two options were ultimately ruled out for the following reasons: The rebuttable presumption model (and the Commissioner discretion if exercised) would shift compliance costs to underlying suppliers. Aggregate compliance costs are therefore likely to be higher as a result of there being more collection entities, some of whom may have less sophisticated systems and may not be as well-resourced. The model would rely on ongoing commitment of resources by Inland Revenue and operators of recognised marketplaces to continually educate suppliers and enforce compliance. It is questionable that these responsibilities and the information requirements for recognised marketplaces would be less onerous than their obligations under the deemed supplier model. Inland Revenue and operators of recognised marketplaces would also need to deal with the risk of underlying suppliers continually creating new identities to avoid GST. If compliance is perceived to be low, this may reduce the willingness of other suppliers to comply. It would be difficult to assess the point at which the recognised marketplace would need to revert to being deemed to be the supplier for GST purposes where there is persistent non- compliance by underlying suppliers. Compliant underlying suppliers may be disrupted by potential deregistration. The rebuttable presumption model (and the Commissioner discretion option) would create uncertainty for electronic marketplaces and underlying suppliers in the lead-up to the implementation date, as it may take a considerable amount of time to reach an agreement with the Commissioner (or for the Commissioner to reach a conclusion as to whether her discretion should be exercised). Given there is just under five months between expected legislative enactment and 1 December 2019, it is desirable that all parties have certainty about their obligations so that they can make adequate preparations to comply. The use of the Commissioner’s discretion would be likely to distort competition between electronic marketplaces. There may also be risks that the Commissioner may be perceived as applying the discretion unfairly where it is available only to some electronic marketplaces, which would have an adverse effect on the integrity of the tax system. It may be difficult for the Commissioner to apply the discretion consistently and assess whether the marketplaces are capable of collecting GST. It may be especially difficult for the Impact Statement Template | 22 IN CONFIDENCE Commissioner to respond to assertions that a marketplace may withdraw from the New Zealand market if the discretion is not applied. Many of the prominent electronic marketplaces would already be registered in Australia under their equivalent legislation. In many cases the systems already implemented by these marketplaces for Australia could be extended to comply with New Zealand’s rules, as the rules would be broadly similar. Impact Statement Template | 23 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Option one Status quo (Design options proposed in the government discussion document) Option two Design options reflecting submissions, with a low-value goods threshold of $400 Option three Design options reflecting submissions, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 Certainty and simplicity 0 + The addition of simplifying design details post-consultation should simplify compliance for suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers compared with option one. ++ Suppliers that only sell goods valued at or below $1,000 or who fall into the 5 percent rule as a result of the $1,000 threshold can charge GST on all of their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than being required to distinguish between goods valued below or above the threshold. Greater price transparency for consumers compared with options one and two as GST is charged at the point of sale and tariffs and cost recovery charges are removed from imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Efficiency of compliance 0 + Some compliance cost savings compared with option one. + This option is expected to have the least compliance costs overall compared with the other options owing to the $1,000 threshold. Efficiency of administration 0 + Some administrative cost savings for Customs in relation to preventing double taxation, owing to the requirement for suppliers to ensure that GST information is included on Customs documents where goods are delivered by fast freight. Administration costs for Inland Revenue would be the same as those under option one. + Administrative cost savings for Customs in relation to the prevention of double taxation. Administration costs for Inland Revenue would be the same as those under options one and two. Fairness and equity 0 + Reduced compliance costs for suppliers and consumers, including reduced potential for double taxation (since the supplier would be required to provide a refund if double taxation occurs). + More suppliers are likely to be liable to register under this option, increasing the coverage of imported goods that are subject to GST compared with options one and two. Reduced potential for double taxation owing to $1,000 threshold and the proposed mechanisms for preventing double taxation. There is however less fairness for retailers importing consignments valued above $1,000 that are Impact Statement Template | 24 subject to tariffs compared with options one and two (up to $2.6m more in tariffs p.a. would be forgone). Sustainability and neutrality 0 + Estimated GST collections are the same as under option one. However, the reduction in compliance costs for suppliers compared with option one may mean that less suppliers cease to ship to New Zealand or refuse to comply. ++ Estimated to collect $25m less in GST over the forecast period than options one and two. However, this option is considered to be the most sustainable over the longer term, as it is considered that it may result in a better compliance outcome than options one and two whilst minimising the number of suppliers that cease shipping to New Zealand (and therefore may actually result in more GST being collected). Approx. $14.9m p.a. in cost recovery charges for Customs and MPI would be forgone compared with options and two. Any resulting funding shortfall may have to be funded through a changed cost recovery structure or through replacement Crown funding. Overall assessment 0 + This option is an improvement over option one with respect to all of the considerations. ++ Sustainability and neutrality and efficiency of compliance outweigh the other considerations. This option is an improvement over option two with respect to most of the other considerations and is therefore Inland Revenue’s preferred option. Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Impact Statement Template | 25 IN CONFIDENCE Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Inland Revenue officials consider the preferred option is Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000. Customs officials prefer Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document with a low-value goods threshold of $400. The reason for Inland Revenue’s preference is that Inland Revenue has placed a higher weighting on the efficiency of compliance criterion (in particular the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers and electronic marketplaces, as well as the freight and logistics industry). It is acknowledged that the additional benefits to offshore suppliers, electronic marketplaces and the freight and logistics industry of the $1,000 threshold compared with a threshold of $400 cannot be valued with certainty, whereas the estimated impacts on the government’s financial position are better understood. There is also uncertainty in predicting possible unintended behavioural changes by consumers (as well as other importers and their agents) as a result of a $1,000 threshold. To mitigate these factors and their associated risks, specific monitoring of implementation and compliance will be established, and a post-implementation review of the level of the threshold will be conducted after three years. Customs’ preference is for a low-value goods threshold of $400 (as in options one and two), as this is estimated to collect $303 million of GST over the forecast period compared with $278 million under a $1,000 threshold (option three). The Crown would also forgo up to $8.8 million in tariff duty under option three, and Customs and MPI would forgo at least $48.9 million of departmental revenue over the forecast period if alternative funding arrangements are not put in place. A $1,000 threshold may also reduce the incentive for importers to provide accurate information, potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management. Trade, competition and consumer choice issues Some private submitters expressed concerns that consumers’ access to goods from offshore may be significantly reduced as a consequence of the proposals if they go ahead. These sentiments were echoed by Business NZ and KPMG, who while being broadly supportive of the proposals noted that there is a risk that implementation of the policy will affect consumer choice and trade. Business NZ warned against making the rules overly complicated, noting that a pragmatic and reasonable approach is needed to ensure the impacts on trade, competition and consumer choice are minimal. It was also pointed out there could be reciprocal problems for New Zealand exporters if New Zealand is perceived to be a country to avoid selling to. Private submitters expressing concerns about possible adverse impacts on consumer choice tended to disagree with the analysis of the problem or expressed some reservations about it. In particular, these submitters pointed out that many goods that are being imported by consumers cannot be purchased from New Zealand retailers – or, where they can be purchased domestically, the price difference compared with an overseas supplier tends to be significantly more than 15%. Two submitters expressed particular concern in relation to Impact Statement Template | 26 IN CONFIDENCE clothing and shoes in less common sizes that they could not easily source from domestic retailers and stated that they have little other choice than to purchase these goods from overseas suppliers. A submission from an industry group representing three electronic marketplaces stated that the extraterritorial application of GST will create additional costs for overseas businesses which would serve as a barrier to trade. They considered this to be contrary to both New Zealand’s advocacy for free trade and the spirit of various free trade agreements. They stated that the policy risks reciprocation by other governments on New Zealand exporters, which could stifle entrepreneurship and innovation and decrease exports. As discussed below, a number of design features have been incorporated into option 3 (Customs’ preferred option) and option 4 (Inland Revenue’s preferred option) that are designed to minimise compliance costs for suppliers and electronic marketplaces, and as such are intended to minimise the risk of adverse trade and consumer impacts. Electronic marketplaces Under the rules proposed in the discussion document for electronic marketplaces, where a supply of low-value goods is made through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be deemed to make the supply for GST purposes. The $60,000 registration threshold would therefore apply to the marketplace operator’s deemed supplies to New Zealand consumers, as well as any other taxable supplies the marketplace operator makes. Where the operator of the electronic marketplace is deemed to be the supplier, whether or not the actual supplier of the goods is above the $60,000 registration threshold is irrelevant for determining whether or not GST applies to the supply. The design and scope of the marketplace rules were commented on in many of the submissions received. A number of submissions noted that business models for marketplaces vary widely and as such, a simple extension of the existing rules for cross- border services and intangibles to marketplaces for goods may not be appropriate. Submissions noted that clarity, simplicity and flexibility would be crucial to ensuring the marketplaces rules are workable. Discussions with stakeholders also indicated that clear and simple rules would be crucial to making the marketplace rules workable. Submissions from electronic marketplaces were strongly opposed to the proposed offshore supplier registration system and in particular the proposed rules for electronic marketplaces. Submissions from electronic marketplaces raised the following objections: • The proposed electronic marketplace rules are onerous for marketplaces to implement and are more complex that the rules requiring operators of electronic marketplaces for services and intangibles to collect GST. • Complying with the rules will result in significant compliance costs for marketplaces and it is unfair for the New Zealand Government to impose these costs on marketplaces. These costs may either be passed on to their suppliers, increasing the risk of these suppliers choosing not to ship to New Zealand, or will at least be partly borne by consumers, therefore imposing additional costs on consumers over and above the amount of the tax. Impact Statement Template | 27 IN CONFIDENCE • Marketplaces may not have and may be unable to obtain sufficient information to correctly determine the amount of GST payable. • Marketplaces that do not process transactions between buyers and sellers on their platform may have difficulties in collecting the GST they are liable to remit. • Requiring marketplaces to collect GST on supplies made by third party suppliers below the $60,000 registration threshold would place these suppliers at a disadvantage, would be discriminatory, and would lead to market distortions. • Compliant marketplaces will be at risk of third party sellers that are below the $60,000 registration threshold switching to selling through small or non-compliant marketplaces or to selling on their own websites. • Consumers will seek out small or non-compliant marketplaces or suppliers to avoid the tax, giving an unfair competitive advantage to suppliers and marketplaces that are not complying with the rules and disadvantaging the marketplaces and suppliers that would comply. This may result in decreased compliance with New Zealand regulations in relation to consumer protections and dangerous goods. • Electronic marketplaces that are only caught by the electronic marketplace rules because they set some of the terms and conditions under which offshore sellers make sales on the marketplace would be able to easily structure out of being deemed to be the supplier of the goods by simply ensuring they do not set any of the terms and conditions of sale. This would reduce the level of compliance with New Zealand regulations in relation to consumer protection and prohibited or dangerous goods. As noted in section 3.3, two exceptions to the deemed supplier approach (a Commissioner discretion and the rebuttable presumption model) were considered but ultimately ruled out. The proposed rules for electronic marketplaces are considered to be crucial to the success of the offshore supplier registration system. Without such rules, it is expected that thousands of suppliers that sell through marketplaces would be required to register for GST, meaning that aggregate compliance costs may be higher, compliance would likely be lower and enforcement more difficult. Narrowing the scope of the proposed rules is also unpalatable as the creation of a new boundary would be likely to create opportunities for electronic marketplaces to structure out of the rules, and may distort competition between electronic marketplaces. While still hypothetically possible, these risks are considered to be less significant under the proposed rules. Given the current market dominance of the most prominent electronic marketplaces, the extent to which having electronic marketplaces collect GST on sales by suppliers below the registration threshold would give a competitive advantage to small or non-compliant marketplaces is not entirely clear. For instance, in an online shopping environment, consumers already have strong incentives to purchase from trusted websites. It is not clear that avoiding GST of 15% on a low-value purchase (which may still be significantly cheaper than a similar item sourced domestically) would provide enough incentive for many consumers to switch to shopping on websites that may not be as well- Impact Statement Template | 28 IN CONFIDENCE known or reputable as the larger marketplaces, and therefore which may be less readily trusted by consumers. It is also unclear whether the imposition of GST on what is likely to be only a small proportion of most suppliers’ sales would be a large enough motivator for smaller suppliers to establish their own websites or switch to selling through a marketplace that would likely reach a smaller audience. If these suppliers consider that the revenue from these sales does not justify the costs to them associated with having the marketplace operator charge GST on their sales to New Zealand, a more likely possibility seems to be that these suppliers would simply stop shipping goods to New Zealand, rather than leave the electronic marketplace altogether (at least if they are selling through a global marketplace as opposed to a New Zealand-specific website). However, the extent to which this may eventuate is also unknown, given that the marketplace operator would be fulfilling the bulk of the GST compliance obligations for the supplier (although these compliance costs may be passed on to underlying suppliers). Marketplace operators’ concerns about being provided with incorrect or inadequate information to determine the GST treatment of supplies and any associated liabilities in respect of these supplies should be addressed by the Commissioner discretion to prescribe or agree to a method for determining the GST treatment of supplies. Concerns about bad debts risk for electronic marketplaces that do not actually collect the money from the consumer should also be addressed by the suggested bad debt deduction. Low-value goods threshold Several submitters commented on the $400 threshold that was proposed in the discussion document GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system. Most of these submitters expressed a preference for a $1,000 threshold, which was considered to reduce compliance costs for suppliers (since it is closer to Australia’s low-value threshold of AU$1,000 than $400 is), as well as being better for consumers and for the freight and logistics industry. In comparison, only two submitters expressed a strong preference for a $400 threshold. It appears that this preference was based on concerns about a potential fiscal risk in relation to goods valued between $400 and $1,000, on which GST is (or should be) collected at present. Inland Revenue officials consider that the overall compliance costs to offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers associated with a $1,000 threshold would be lower than the overall compliance costs to these businesses if a $400 threshold is chosen. Implementing a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 would also be more beneficial for New Zealand consumers compared with a $400 threshold. However, Customs has concerns about the potential impacts of a $1,000 threshold on the management of border risk. Impacts on suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers While the vast majority of goods imported by consumers are of a very low value (consumer surveys and Customs import entry data show that the average value is less than $100), a number of e-commerce businesses will also stock goods that may be more expensive, such as certain types of clothing, jewellery, watches and electronics, which some New Zealand Impact Statement Template | 29 IN CONFIDENCE consumers may potentially import. The existence of a low-value goods threshold of any value therefore creates additional complexity for suppliers who supply goods both above and below the threshold, as their checkout systems would need to be set up to charge GST on goods individually valued at or below that threshold and not on those valued above that threshold. Also, because the threshold is defined in New Zealand dollars, the supplier’s systems would also need to perform a currency conversion where the prices of the goods on their website are expressed in a foreign currency for the purposes of determining whether a given good is above or below the low-value goods threshold. By increasing the proposed $400 low-value goods threshold to $1,000, the number of suppliers that may sell goods both above and below the threshold would be reduced. This would decrease the number of suppliers that would need to implement systems to differentiate between high and low-value goods and have differing GST treatments for high and low-value goods (since if they do not stock any goods valued above the threshold they will not need to distinguish and can simply add GST to all of their sales to New Zealand consumers without requiring complex foreign exchange conversions at the time of sale). As Australia has a low-value threshold of AU$1,000 under their equivalent rules, there would be some suppliers that are already registered in Australia that only supply goods below Australia’s threshold. At present, these suppliers do not need to build systems to distinguish between low and high-value goods, as these suppliers can simply add GST to all of their supplies made to Australian consumers. However, some of these suppliers would sell goods both above and below $400 – therefore if New Zealand sets a $400 low-value goods threshold these suppliers would need to build additional systems to those already implemented for Australia in order to comply. This may be much less of an issue with a higher threshold that is much closer to Australia’s threshold, such as $1,000. Impacts on consumers Some submissions from consumers expressed support for removing cost recovery charges collected on consignments valued above the current de minimis. Increasing the proposed low-value goods threshold to $1,000 would see the removal of cost recovery charges and tariffs from most goods imported by consumers. This would mean that consumers importing goods between $400 and $1,000 would actually pay less overall for these goods than they do at present. This would also ensure the overwhelming majority of consumers are no longer surprised or inconvenienced by having to pay additional GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges. Further, Customs would continue to collect cost recovery charges on consignments of goods that have had GST is collected at the point of sale by the supplier where the total consignment is valued above the threshold. A $400 threshold may mean there would be more instances of consumers having to pay these cost recovery charges where they might have expected that they would not have to (as they had already paid GST). Having offshore suppliers collect GST on a broader range of goods (in terms of value) would also provide greater price transparency for consumers, as offshore websites may be more likely to display a GST-inclusive price for all of their goods at the time of purchase. This would provide a fairer price comparison with New Zealand retailers who generally display GST-inclusive prices. A $1,000 threshold is also expected to be less distortionary than a $400 threshold. Anecdotally, many consumers at present limit their online purchases to a maximum of $400 Impact Statement Template | 30 IN CONFIDENCE to avoid having their goods stopped at the border. A $1,000 threshold may mean that less consumers would limit their spending to avoid having goods stopped at the border or to avoid the collection of duties and cost recovery charges. On the other hand, a $1,000 threshold may increase consumers’ incentives to seek out and purchase from unregistered suppliers or to have items purchased and sent to New Zealand by friends and family overseas. Double taxation While the inclusion of the 5 percent rule in option two would be expected to help to reduce compliance costs for a number of suppliers associated with differentiating between low- value and high-value goods, one issue with combining this design option with a threshold of $400 is that it would be likely to further increase the incidence of double taxation. Increasing the proposed threshold to $1,000 however would greatly reduce the potential for double taxation to occur as much fewer consignments valued over $1,000 are imported by consumers, compared with the number of consignments valued over $400. Based on 2017/18 transactional banking data showing goods purchases by New Zealand consumers from offshore suppliers, there were 230,398 transactions between $400 and $1,000 and only 56,671 transactions between $1,000 and $2,000. Furthermore, the vast majority of consignments valued above $1,000 would be imported by GST-registered businesses and would not be subject to the proposed rules. Border and biosecurity risks Importers are incentivised by Customs’ penalty regime to ensure that accurate imported entry information is provided in relation to imported consignments on which revenue is collectable. The penalties for providing inaccurate information for consignments on which no revenue is assessable are however smaller, and therefore provide less incentive for importers to ensure the accuracy of this information; consequently, the quality of information provided in relation to these consignments tends to be poorer. Customs and MPI consider that setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 may therefore reduce the incentive for importers to enter accurate information as there will be no requirement to pay revenue on consignments under $1,000. As well as potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management, poor quality information may also impact on the efficiency of border processes. Customs considers that non-compliance in the valuation of goods to evade duty will continue to exist under a $1,000 threshold. This may also increase costs to both agencies and slow down the clearance of goods at the border. Customs has a range of sanctions to encourage the provision of accurate information and will continue to work with customs brokers, fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post, but it will remain a challenge for both agencies to manage risks. Impacts on goods transporters and customs brokers Setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 may be beneficial for fast freight carriers, customs brokers and New Zealand Post, with fewer goods stopped at the border for revenue collection. This would reduce the costs that New Zealand Post, fast freight carriers and Impact Statement Template | 31 IN CONFIDENCE customs brokers currently incur in transporting consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. New Zealand Post noted in their submission that they currently incur a significant compliance cost burden in facilitating the collection of GST (and other charges) and holding goods in storage on behalf of Customs. New Zealand Post considered that having a $1,000 threshold would therefore reduce their compliance costs. It is also noted that the effects of inflation and the expected continuation of the rapid growth in import volumes experienced over the last few years (and in particular the growth in the volume of low-value goods imported by post) will further exacerbate the existing pressures on border processing of low-value imported goods over time, which may mean that maintaining a low-value goods threshold of $400 may not be cost-effective in the medium term (at least not for New Zealand Post). GST revenue A risk with having a $1,000 threshold is that it may put at risk the GST currently collected by the Crown on imported goods valued between $400 and $1,000. In 2017/18 approximately $4.26 million of GST was collected by Customs on consignments imported by consumers valued under $400, and $22.40 million was collected on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. 14 While a $1,000 threshold does put more currently collected GST at risk, Inland Revenue considers that most of this currently collected GST would continue to be collected under option three. A $1,000 threshold may even have some benefits for GST revenue collection including: • increasing the number of suppliers with a liability to register by increasing offshore suppliers’ level of taxable supplies (as supplies of goods valued between $400 and $1,000 would also be taxable supplies); • reducing the risk of GST not being collected on goods between $400 and $1,000 owing to undervaluation as, even if the supplier undervalued the goods, when the goods are supplied through a marketplace the marketplace will still collect the correct amount of GST; and • reducing the reliance on New Zealand Post to identify when goods sent by post are above the de minimis. Customs’ and MPI’s cost recovery charges Setting the low-value goods threshold at $400 would result in a reduction in Customs’ and MPI’s cost-recovered funding of $2.92 million per year based on the amount collected in 14 W e have assumed that 30% of consignments between the de minimis and $400 and 44% of imported consignments between $400 and $1,000 are imported by GST-registered businesses. These estimates of the business share of imported goods are derived from Australian data, as we do not have any New Zealand data on this. It is possible that the business share of consignments between $400 and $1,000 is higher in New Zealand owing to New Zealand’s lower de minimis (likely resulting in fewer consumers importing consignments above $400). If New Zealand has a higher business share of consignments between $400 and $1,000 then the net amount of GST collected by Customs on consignments imported by consumers would be lower. Impact Statement Template | 32 IN CONFIDENCE 2017/18. Setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 would result in Customs and MPI forgoing more cost-recovered funding. In 2017/18 $17.795 million (GST exclusive) was collected through Customs’ Import Entry Transaction Fee ($10.736 million) and MPI’s Biosecurity System Entry Levy ($7.059 million) on consignments below $1,000. A low-value goods threshold of $1,000 would therefore require a greater amount of Crown funding to replace the additional cost- recovered funding forgone. Customs’ and MPI’s costs of processing goods are also expected to increase due to expected volume growth and ongoing resource impacts. Therefore, regardless of what threshold is chosen, or even if no action is taken, Crown funding for Customs and MPI is likely to need to be increased over time in response to increasing import volumes. Tariff revenue Changing from the current de minimis of $60 duty owing to either a $400 or $1,000 low- value goods threshold will result in the loss of tariff revenue collected between the current de minimis and the low-value goods threshold. In 2017/18 $0.58 million was collected in tariffs on consignments between the current de minimis and $400 and $3.23 million was collected in tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000. These tariffs are mainly collected on clothing and footwear manufactured in certain countries. MFAT does not consider that the loss of $0.58 million in tariffs from having a $400 threshold or of $3.23 million from there being a $1,000 threshold would significantly diminish the value of New Zealand’s remaining tariffs as negotiating coin in current and future Free Trade Agreements. MBIE, the agency responsible for tariff policy, also does not consider the revenue collected from these tariffs to be significant and supports the removal of tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000. If the low-value goods threshold is set at $1,000, the loss of tariff revenue on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000 may potentially be seen as unfair to New Zealand retailers. A retailer that imports a consignment valued above $1,000 containing goods subject to tariffs will need to pay these tariffs to Customs. The tariffs paid by these businesses would ultimately be passed on to their customers. In contrast, if a consumer buys one of those goods directly from an offshore supplier they will not have to pay any tariffs if the good is shipped in a consignment valued at or below $1,000. Compared with setting the low-value goods threshold at $400, setting it at $1,000 does therefore further undermine the principle that taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation, but only in relation to a small subset of transactions. This is not considered to be likely to be significant in its impact as New Zealand has few remaining tariffs (mainly on clothing and footwear) and our free trade agreements have eliminated these tariffs for many countries including China, Australia and the 10 ASEAN countries. If no action is taken, the amount collected from tariffs is likely to continue to reduce over time as a result of current and future free trade agreements. On balance Inland Revenue considers that this concern is outweighed by the efficiency benefits of setting the threshold at $1,000 and relinquishing tariff duty on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Impact Statement Template | 33 IN CONFIDENCE New Zealand businesses importing low-value goods would also benefit from the removal of tariffs (and cost recovery charges) on consignments valued at or below $1,000. Net revenue impact Table 1 below shows the estimated GST revenue net of forgone cost recovery charges over the forecast period (based on actual cost recovery collections on consignments under $400 in 2017/18) under options one and two, based on the 1 October 2019 start date that was originally proposed. The figures in Table 1 have not been revised to take into account the change in the proposed application date and contingency funding for Vote Customs and Vote Biosecurity in Budget 2019 because at the time of revising this impact assessment, options one and two were no longer relevant, as Cabinet had already agreed to implement option three (CAB-19-MIN-0466.01 refers). For this reason, a revised estimate of the fiscal impact of options one and two was not produced. Table 2 shows the estimated GST revenue over the forecast period under option three net of contingency funding in Budget 2019 for Vote Customs and Vote Biosecurity and assuming a 1 December 2019 application date. Table 1: Net revenue over the forecast period of 2019/20 to 2021/22 (in $m) $m – increase/(decrease) $400 threshold 2019/20 (1 October start) 2020/21 2021/22 & out years Total GST 73.000 109.000 121.000 303.000 Cost recovery charges (2.190) (2.920) (2.920) (8.030) GST net of cost recovery charges 70.810 106.080 118.080 294.970 Table 2: Net revenue over the forecast period of 2019/20 to 2021/22 (in $m) $m – increase/(decrease) $1,000 threshold 2019/20 (1 December start) 2020/21 2021/22 & out years Total GST 52.000 100.000 112.000 264.000 Expenditure (13.879) (25.562) (25.596) (65.037) Net fiscal impact 38.121 74.438 86.404 198.963 The tables above do not account for any tariff revenue forgone under options one, two and three. This is because tariff revenue is decreasing over time owing to the phased implementation of New Zealand’s current and future free trade agreements, resulting in an annual reduction in the amount of goods that are subject to tariffs. In the 2017/18 year the amount collected in tariffs on consignments under $400 was $0.58 million and the amount collected under $1,000 was $3.23 million. Impact Statement Template | 34 IN CONFIDENCE Proposed exclusion for business-to-business supplies Under the proposed rules, only supplies of low-value imported goods to New Zealand consumers would be subject to GST. Supplies of low-value imported goods to GST- registered businesses would not be subject to GST. The rationale for excluding business- to-business supplies from the rules is to prevent a revenue risk arising from a resident business claiming a GST deduction for GST charged to them by an offshore supplier, but the offshore supplier not returning this GST to Inland Revenue. Three submissions proposed allowing suppliers to charge GST on business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods. Submitters noted that identifying a customer as a GST-registered business can be difficult for suppliers to do, and that compliance costs arise for both the offshore supplier and the New Zealand business when GST is incorrectly charged. Furthermore, some submitters noted that the revenue risk from allowing suppliers to charge GST on business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods may be relatively low. CA ANZ however was supportive of the proposed exclusion of business-to-business supplies. They noted that the exclusion of business-to-business supplies would mean some suppliers are outside the regime entirely because they only supply to businesses, which they agreed is desirable. They also considered that the exclusion would provide GST-registered recipients with an incentive to notify the supplier of their GST-registered status, which they considered would likely be easier than obtaining a valid tax invoice from the supplier. As noted in section 3.3, allowing offshore suppliers to charge GST on high-value business- to-business supplies was ruled out due to the fiscal risks involved. However, officials consider that the proposed design options under options two and three (of allowing offshore suppliers to issue tax invoices in respect of business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods where the value of such a supply does not exceed $1,000, and allowing suppliers to agree with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an alternative method for determining whether a supply is to a GST-registered persons) should help to reduce compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between supplies to consumers and to GST- registered businesses. Allowing suppliers to charge GST and issue tax invoices in respect of business-to-business supplies valued at or below $1,000 may mean that suppliers would be rarely required to distinguish in practice. Compliance and enforcement A number of submitters were concerned whether the proposed rules could be effectively enforced. The submission from the electronic marketplace industry group suggested that the proposed system would result in only 25 percent of the currently forgone GST being collected, based on the Australian Treasury’s forecasted collection rate for the first year of the Australian legislation. Several submitters stated that where suppliers refuse to comply, it will be difficult and costly for Inland Revenue to enforce compliance from these suppliers. Concern was also raised in some submissions that offshore suppliers would avoid collecting GST by splitting their business into multiple entities in order to get below the $60,000 registration threshold. Impact Statement Template | 35 IN CONFIDENCE Based on the available evidence, officials consider that a relatively small number of suppliers and electronic marketplaces are likely to account for the majority of low-value goods imported by consumers. Retail banking data supplied by Datamine shows that 10 entities account for approximately 25 percent of the amount that consumers spent in 2017/18 on goods valued below $400 from offshore suppliers. Recent research by the International Post Corporation suggests that the five biggest electronic marketplaces account for around 50 percent of goods imported into New Zealand. On this basis, officials consider it is not unreasonable to assume that 75 percent of the GST that would be returned if all liable entities registered and complied will actually be collected (which is the assumption that was used in coming up with the revenue estimates). Application date A number of submissions on the Government discussion document commented on the application date of 1 October 2019 proposed in the document. Retail NZ and Booksellers NZ both expressed support for the earliest possible implementation date. In an earlier version of this Impact Statement published online when the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced, officials considered a 1 October 2019 implementation date to be feasible. However, it was noted that any delays to the introduction or passing of legislation, or major changes to the legislation between introduction and the Royal assent would necessitate reconsideration of the implementation date. Submissions on the Bill expressed concern about the proposed application date of 1 October 2019, noting that this leaves little time between the likely enactment date of the Bill and the start of the new rules. Submitters considered that offshore suppliers cannot be expected to invest in making information technology systems changes until the law is enacted, as the proposed rules are not finalised and may yet be subject to change. They have also noted that there may not be enough time after the rules are finalised for offshore suppliers to register for New Zealand GST and make the systems changes necessary to collect GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers by 1 October 2019. Submissions from electronic marketplaces noted the technical challenges for large electronic marketplaces that service a global customer base, which mean the required systems changes will need to be carefully planned and tested to ensure they do not create errors that interfere with other parts of their systems. A joint submission from Alibaba and eBay noted the risk that electronic marketplaces and suppliers (that do intend to comply with the proposed legislation) may be left with little choice other than to temporarily cease shipping goods to New Zealand from 1 October until the required systems changes are ready. Several submitters (including Alibaba and eBay) specifically suggested 1 April 2020 as a more realistic application date. Amazon recommended an extension of 6-12 months to the proposed 1 October 2019 application date, which suggests a preferred implementation date of 1 April 2020 at the earliest. Impact Statement Template | 36 IN CONFIDENCE On the basis of the submissions received,and comments relayed to officials, it appears that an application date of 1 April 2020 should allow enough time for the affected businesses to make the required systems changes. However, this reduced risk of suppliers being non- compliant or ceasing to ship goods to New Zealand is estimated to come at a significant fiscal cost ($32 million overall in the 2019/20 fiscal year). It is unclear whether the proposed extension to 1 December 2019 will provide adequate time for suppliers and marketplaces to comply. However, it should at least reduce the risks of having lower than expected compliance at the outset of the rules and of suppliers ceasing to ship goods to New Zealand, compared with an application date of 1 October 2019. It also has a much lower fiscal cost than a delay to 1 April ($31.856 million in the 2019/20 fiscal year). 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach 15 Monetised costs and benefits in this table have not been discounted, since for revenue measures the undiscounted figures (as opposed to net present value figures) make more intuitive sense and are the figures that are included in Budget estimates. Affected parties Comment: Impact Evidence certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties The costs to offshore suppliers would include registering for GST (one-off), altering business systems to account for GST on goods sold to New Zealand consumers (one-off), and returns filing and paying the GST collected to Inland Revenue (ongoing). Potentially high upfront systems and medium ongoing compliance costs for offshore businesses above the $60,000 registration threshold. Low Regulators The implementation costs to Inland Revenue are estimated to be up to $460,000, with ongoing administration costs estimated to be approximately $120,000 in the first year and $70,000 per annum thereafter. This includes the costs to change the current registration form for suppliers of cross-border services to accommodate offshore suppliers of low-value goods and other minor systems changes. It also allows for an increase in the volume of work for staff currently processing registrations. Up to $0.7m over the forecast period (not discounted) 15 .

Medium Non-monetised benefits Medium Low Impact Statement Template | 39 IN CONFIDENCE 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Other impacts: GST would be collected on goods from offshore suppliers that are below the $60,000 registration threshold where the sale is made through a GST-registered electronic marketplace. From a revenue standpoint, this may be seen as an advantage, as it is expected that a significant amount of revenue would be collected on sales by offshore suppliers below the registration threshold though electronic marketplaces. Given the rationale of having a registration threshold is to balance compliance and administration costs against the revenue that would be generated if the supplier registered for GST, collecting GST on these supplies may be justified on the basis that the rationale behind the registration threshold is not as relevant, given that the marketplace operator would bear the bulk of the compliance costs. However, this may give rise to concerns about competitive disadvantages for marketplace operators and smaller offshore businesses selling through these marketplaces. Potential risks and uncertainties: If the compliance costs are disproportionately high or are perceived by the relevant collection entities to be too high, there is a risk that some non- resident suppliers or operators of electronic marketplaces may not comply with the rules or may not continue to offer shipping of goods to New Zealand. This risk is thought to be more significant for smaller suppliers that make supplies to New Zealand consumers near or above the $60,000 registration threshold. 16 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 16 It is assumed that non-resident suppliers with annual sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000 would predominantly be large (or at least medium) entities, given that the $60,000 registration threshold applies to their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than their worldwide sales, and that in most cases their sales to New Zealanders would be a small proportion of their total worldwide sales. However, it is likely that there would be some smaller suppliers that would nevertheless have sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000. Impact Statement Template | 40 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The proposal will require amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These amendments are currently being drafted and will be included in an upcoming tax bill. The proposal will also require amendments to some Customs regulations. These regulations will be updated by Order in Council. Both Inland Revenue and Customs will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue and Customs have not identified any concerns with their ability to implement the proposals in a manner consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for regulatory stewardship by government agencies’. Ministers’ preference is that the proposed changes come into effect on 1 December 2019. Inland Revenue and Customs are confident that the proposals can be implemented within this proposed timeline. Inland Revenue has estimated that the one-off costs to implement these proposals will be up to $460,000. Inland Revenue’s ongoing administration costs are estimated to be approximately $120,000 in the first year and $70,000 per annum thereafter. Inland Revenue will self-fund the costs associated with the initiative. Customs expects the costs of systems changes for implementation at 1 December 2019 will be minimal in the short term. These costs will be met within existing baselines. Marketplaces and private sector tax advisors and the fast freight industry, customs brokers and New Zealand Post have suggested 1 April 2020 as a “more reasonable” application date. However, many of the overseas suppliers and marketplaces would have had 17 months of experience complying with Australia’s substantially similar rules and, as such, the systems changes themselves may not be that extensive – although it appears there will be substantial planning and testing of changes required, in addition to potential changes to pricing and contracts or arrangements with third parties. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The primary issue concerning implementation that has been raised through consultation is whether the 1 October 2019 application date proposed in the Bill gives offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers enough time to make the necessary systems changes in order to comply, as well as for the fast freight industry, customs brokers and New Zealand Post to make the required systems changes in relation to border clearance and information required to be provided to Customs. To help mitigate this risk, Ministers propose extending the application date to 1 December 2019. Another implementation risk is that offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers may not be aware of the new rules. To address this risk, Inland Revenue will need to identify and communicate the legislative change to offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re- deliverers who might be required to register in New Zealand. A targeted marketing campaign would be needed to reach all the affected offshore suppliers and aid with compliance. Impact Statement Template | 41 IN CONFIDENCE Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Customs and MPI will monitor the impact on the management of border and biosecurity risks. If the preferred option is implemented and compliance with the new regime is lower than expected after 12 months of its implementation, Inland Revenue will explore options for increasing compliance. This could include joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions that have similar rules, including possible data matching programmes with other jurisdictions and Customs. Officials will monitor the extent to which offshore businesses no longer ship goods to New Zealand by keeping a close watch over articles in the media. Talking with private sector advisors and re-deliverers may also provide some indication of the extent to which this occurs. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Officials from Inland Revenue and Customs will undertake a post-implementation review of the level of the threshold three years after the new rules are implemented. Officials will also continue to monitor the future viability of other collection models to see if the practical issues with these models can be overcome. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme.
Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Business Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Timing To maximise the administrative efficiencies of the proposals, changes need to align with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation timelines for transferring KiwiSaver into its new administrative system. KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred into START on 1 April 2020. To ensure that policy decisions are taken, and legislation passed in this timeframe, this has created a constraint on the time available to analyse options. Despite this, officials are confident that the proposed approach would be the most effective option to address the problem definition. Consultation and testing Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers. However, as a result of time constraints, wider public consultation has not been carried out. Due to the largely technical administrative nature of the changes proposed, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. Moreover, taken as a whole, the package of options proposed would be beneficial to KiwiSaver members. There would be some compliance costs for employers, although these are expected to be small (they would be required to communicate information that they already hold to Inland Revenue, on a one-off or infrequent basis). While not consulted on directly, the RIA has been informed by employer feedback generated as part of public consultation undertaken on similar requirements that were introduced as part of the wider Business Transformation work programme. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis In relation the proposal to guarantee employer contributions, additional funding is not expected to be required. The primary caveat to this is that it assumes static behaviour. If the introduction of the proposal created a behavioural change amongst employers (that is it results in more unpaid employer contributions), this would increase the fiscal cost of the proposed approach. However, given that levels of employer contribution debt are currently comparable to levels of employee contribution debt (which are already guaranteed), this suggests that the proposal should not have a significant impact on employer’s behaviour. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 1 March 2019 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the administration of KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred from its current system to its new administration system on 1 April 2020. This provides an opportunity to make refinements to KiwiSaver settings to improve administrative efficiency and enhance members’ experience with the scheme. The following are areas that would assist in achieving these outcomes: • facilitating the faster transfer of contributions from Inland Revenue to KiwiSaver scheme providers (and between scheme providers); and • improving information flows between members, employers, scheme providers and Inland Revenue. Transfer of contributions Part of Inland Revenue’s role as the central administrator for KiwiSaver, involves receiving KiwiSaver employer and employee contributions from employers and then forwarding these contributions on to KiwiSaver scheme providers. A reduction in the time taken to transfer contributions would improve the efficiency of the central administration of KiwiSaver. Payday filing reforms, which become compulsory from 1 April 2019, will result in Inland Revenue having employer information sooner after a payday (within 2 days of a payday for large employers and with 10 days for smaller employers). This will include information about KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions. The reforms will allow KiwiSaver employee contributions to be passed to scheme providers sooner after a member’s payday. This is because current KiwiSaver settings permit the use of Crown funds to pay employee contributions to scheme providers before contribution amounts have been paid to Inland Revenue by employers (effectively creating a Government guarantee of employee contributions). This Government guarantee does not currently extend to employer contributions. To ensure that the benefits of Inland Revenue being in receipt of earlier payday information are fully realised in relation to KiwiSaver, this RIA considers how to enable Inland Revenue to forward employer contribution amounts to scheme providers as soon as payday reporting information from employers has been received, rather than having to wait until the employer has actually paid the amount of the contribution to Inland Revenue (the current state). This RIA also considers other refinements that would facilitate the faster transfer of contributions. Improving information flows Inland Revenue is in the unique position of having on-going contact with KiwiSaver scheme providers and employers. This means Inland Revenue is able to facilitate the flow of information between relevant KiwiSaver parties (employers, providers and members) and also should have access to information to ensure that members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution entitlements. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Currently, in some instances, Inland Revenue does not have access to sufficient information to effectively police the accuracy of contribution amounts received from employers. For example, Inland Revenue does not receive information from employers about the employer superannuation contribution (ESCT) rates they are taxing employees at (ESCT is the tax payable on employer contribution amounts). However, based on ESCT amounts paid to Inland Revenue, potentially up to 63% of employers could be incorrectly calculating their employees’ ESCT rate. 1 This RIA considers refinements that could be made to improve existing KiwiSaver information flows, to help ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving their correct contribution entitlements. Consideration is also given to how information flows could be utilised to give members increased flexibility (for example whether the application process for changing an employee contribution rate could be simplified for members). 2.2 Who is affected and how? KiwiSaver members Taken as a whole, KiwiSaver members would benefit from the package of proposals – the changes would result in them earning market investment returns on contributions sooner, help ensure they are receiving the correct contribution amounts and give them additional flexibility in respect of how they can change their contribution rate. KiwiSaver scheme providers KiwiSaver scheme providers would benefit from the faster transfer of contributions, as it would result in them having more funds under management. Schemes have also indicated enabling KiwiSaver contribution rates to be changed through providers, would enhance member-provider relationships. Employers Helping to ensure members are receiving correct contribution amounts, would result in employers being required to communicate some additional information they should already hold to Inland Revenue. Employers would not be directly affected by any other proposals. Inland Revenue The proposals would enhance Inland Revenue’s central administration of KiwiSaver and create administrative savings. As implementation of the proposals would be aligned with Business Transformation, there would be no additional implementation costs. 1 Figure based on analysis of early adopters of payday filing reforms for the month of June 2018. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making?

The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Compliance: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Administration: administrative costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Equity: the option should ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving the correct contribution amounts. • Sustainability: the option should be consistent with wider KiwiSaver settings. Option One: Status quo Administration: The status quo would not reduce administrative costs. Compliance: The status quo would not reduce compliance costs. Equity: The status quo results in some KiwiSaver members not receiving employer contributions that other members are receiving (as a result of employers not paying the correct contribution amounts or not paying employer contribution amounts at all). Sustainability: As far as practical, the KiwiSaver regime settings are intended to facilitate administrative efficiency. The problem definition identifies that there are some aspects of the regime that would be more efficient if subject to further refinements. Option Two: build on payday filing reforms This option would build on the improved information available through payday filing reforms to facilitate the faster transfer of employer contributions to scheme providers and to improve the accuracy of contribution entitlements passed to scheme providers. Specifically, it would involve passing employer contribution amounts to scheme providers based on payday information received by employers, before Inland Revenue had received the contribution amount (essentially a Government guarantee, that would align with the existing treatment of employee contributions). Based on the improved information received through payday filing, this option would also align the commencement of interest paid while contributions are held by Inland Revenue with a member’s payday. 2 Administration: This option would increase administrative efficiency, as employer contributions could be passed to scheme providers sooners. However, as it does not include other administrative enhancements to KiwiSaver, savings may not be maximised. Compliance: This option should make it easier for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver accounts with the KiwiSaver contributions recorded on their payslips (as employer contributions would be passed in full to KiwiSaver providers sooner after the member payday). Consequently, this should also reduce the level of contacts from members to scheme providers. Equity: This option would ensure that all KiwiSaver members receive the employer 2 Currently, interest on employee contributions commences on the 15 th of the month the amount was deducted from the member’s salary or wages and interest on employer contributions commences on the 1 st of the month the contribution amount was paid to Inland Revenue. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE contributions amounts they are entitled to. It would also improve the accuracy of interest paid on contributions by Inland Revenue (the current rules result in under and over payment of interest on employee contributions and under payment of interest on employer contributions). However, this option would not address situations where a member’s employer is incorrectly calculating contributions amounts. Sustainability: This option would ensure that the benefit of information obtained via payday filing reforms were fully utilised in the KiwiSaver context. It would also align the treatment of employer contributions with employee contributions and other PAYE deductions (which are guaranteed). Option Three: Additional transfer, information and administrative refinements In addition to the changes proposed under option 2, this option would use the opportunity created by Business Transformation, to make further refinements to KiwiSaver settings. Refinements aimed at facilitating faster transfers would be to reduce the initial KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months (this would mean initial contributions could be transferred to providers a month earlier) and to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and member information, when a member decides to transfer to a new scheme from 35 to 10 days. The later change would only impact non-default providers, as arrangements with default providers already require them to complete transfers in 10-days. Information flows would be utilised to ensure members were receiving their correct contribution amounts, by requiring employers to provide information to Inland Revenue about the income KiwiSaver contributions have been calculated from 3 and the ESCT rate used. This information would be provided in respect of new employees and existing employees where the information had changed. To recognise that members will have different first points of contact for information on their KiwiSaver account, this option also proposes that members should be able to apply to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue (in addition to their employer). As a further administrative refinement, is also proposed that the 3-month grace period – that a person who has been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver has to gain New Zealand residence before their account is shut – be removed. This period has not operated as intended and is not utilised by members. The below analysis of this option against the assessment criteria, identifies impacts that are additional to those set out in the analysis of option 2 above. Administration: Reducing the provisional period and the removing the 3-month grace period would increase administrative efficiency. Compliance: The option would reduce compliance costs for members looking to change contribution rates. There would be some additional compliance costs for scheme providers and employers (relating to the proposals to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and information to a new provider when a member transfers schemes and the additional employer information requirements, respectively). These compliance costs are expected to 3 Some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE are exempt for the purposes of calculating KiwiSaver contribution amounts. Examples includes the value of accommodation and a benefit from an employer share scheme. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 8 IN CONFIDENCE be small. Equity: The additional employer information should make it easier for Inland Revenue to identify situations where contribution amounts have been calculated or taxed incorrectly. Based on this information it would be possible to follow-up with employers, so these issues could be resolved sooner and would not arise again. Sustainability: This option identifies enhancements to KiwiSaver administrative settings in addition to the changes proposed in option 2 – to maximise improvements to KiwiSaver it would be logical to implement all changes. Implementing a package of changes is also more sustainable in terms of the legislation (as opposed to making singular refinements to KiwiSaver legislative settings on an on-going basis). Other options not considered Aligning payment of KiwiSaver contributions with an employee’s payday As part of the work on the payday filing reforms, consideration was given to the option of employers being required to pay PAYE and other deductions from salary or wages (including KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions) to Inland Revenue to align with an employee’s payday. If employers were required to pay KiwiSaver contribution amounts to Inland Revenue sooner after their employees’ payday, this would facilitate the faster transfer of these contributions to scheme providers. However, the decision was made only to require employers to file information sooner after a member’s payday, as feedback from employers was that requiring them to pay the actual monetary amounts of deductions (including KiwiSaver contributions) in a shorter timeframe would be too onerous comply with. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 3. This package of refinements is comprised of the following proposals: • the Crown funding the payment of employer contribution amounts passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers until these amounts are received from the employer (essentially a Government guarantee of employer contributions); • changing the date the calculation of interest on employer and employee contributions commences, to align with the pay date a member’s employer has reported; • reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months; • reducing the maximum period an old scheme provider has to share information and transfer funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes, from 35-days to 10-days; • allowing members to change contribution rates through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, rather than only through their employer; • removing the 3-month grace period for members who have been incorrectly automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence; and • requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with KiwiSaver information about a member’s employer superannuation contribution tax rate and the income their contributions are calculated from. Of the options considered this package would be most effective in facilitating the faster transfer of contributions to (and between) KiwiSaver scheme providers, and reducing on- going administrative costs for Inland Revenue. It is also the most coherent and equitable option for KiwiSaver members as it will help ensure members are receiving the correct contribution amounts and these contribution entitlements are being passed to scheme providers. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 4 A decrease in interest payable on employee contributions would be expected to be offset by an increase in interest on employer contributions for employees with a payday between the 15 th and 23 rd of the month. Affected parties Comment Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members, scheme providers and employers) KiwiSaver members Aligning KiwiSaver interest payments to a member’s payday would result in a reduction in interest paid on employee contributions for some members with paydays after the 15 th of the month. The impact of this would be small given interest is paid at a rate of 0.91% per annum and would be offset by their contributions earning market investment returns sooner and an increase in interest on employer contributions in many cases. 4 Scheme providers Reducing the time scheme providers have to send members’ information and funds to a new provider in scheme transfer situations from 35-days to 10- days would have compliance costs for non-default providers, who are not already required to comply with the 10- day transfer time. Feedback from providers indicates this would be manageable and would align with industry best practice. Employers Employers would need to provide information on KiwiSaver income and employee’s ESCT rates to Inland Revenue. Compliance costs should be small, as employers would already need to hold this information to accurately calculate contribution amounts and the information would only need to be provided about new employees or existing employees where the Low.

There is the potential that the proposal to guarantee employer contributions could have a behavioural impact on employers - that is employer’s may be less likely to pay employer contributions. (While only $2.6 million in employer contribution debt was written-off for the financial year ending 30 June 2018, approximately $2 billion in employer contributions were passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers during this same year). Current levels of employer and employee contribution debt are broadly comparable (as at 30 June 2018, employer contribution debt since the commencement of KiwiSaver was $18 million, while employee contribution debt was $24 million). This suggests that the existing guarantee of employee contributions has had limited behavioural impact on employers and that introducing a guarantee of employer contributions would also have a minimal behavioural impact. Moreover, Inland Revenue has processes to monitor and recover unpaid amounts of employer contributions from employers, which would remain in place after the introduction of this proposal. These include interest and penalties available under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment and the Treasury have been consulted on the proposals and support them. The proposals also reflect feedback on the operation of the KiwiSaver regime from the Financial Markets Authority. Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers (in the form of Business Transformation focused co-design workshops). Providers are supportive of the proposals. General consultation with KiwiSaver members has not been undertaken. On a whole, the package of changes should be beneficial for KiwiSaver members and given the technical nature of the proposed changes, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. The only proposal to directly impact employers would be for them to communicate to Inland Revenue the income amounts a member’s KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from and the member’s ESCT rate. This is information the employer already needs to hold, and they would only be required to provide it to Inland Revenue in relation to new employees or existing employees where the information has changed. While consultation with employers has not been carried out on these specific requirements, the proposal has been informed by the extensive public consultation that has been undertaken as part of the wider Business Transformation programme. In particular, feedback on the discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST: a Government discussion document which was released in November 2015 and sought feedback on the payday filing reforms. This included, proposals aimed at refining the new employee on-boarding process, by merging PAYE and KiwiSaver reporting requirements and requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with additional information about new employees – such as date of birth and other employee details. Although not universally supported, in consultation these new information requirements received majority support from employers. The additional 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 14 IN CONFIDENCE information requirements proposed in this RIA, would support the shifts in employee on- boarding processes. Before the proposals are implemented there will be the opportunity for public consultation, as employers and KiwiSaver members would be able to make submissions on the omnibus taxation Bill the legislative changes are included in. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals would require amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus taxation Bill. To align with the transfer of the administration of KiwiSaver from its current operating system into its new operating system, the changes would come into effect from 1 April 2020. The Minister of Revenue would make an announcement, on the contents of the proposed omnibus taxation Bill (including these proposals) when it is introduced in the House. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Aligning implementation of the proposals with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, would mean the cost of system changes would be absorbed into Business Transformation. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes of the proposals pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Inland Revenue collects KiwiSaver data which could be used to assess the effectiveness of the changes in facilitating the faster transfer of employer contributions and enhancing information flows. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? No formal review is planned. However, the final step in the GTTP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. All KiwiSaver scheme providers have an on-going relationship with Inland Revenue, which includes an annual meeting to discuss policy and operational issues that have arisen over the past year. This would provide an opportunity for scheme providers to give feedback about the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27
| 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Student Loans: Limiting Student Loan Scheme rules relating to the 2013 and prior years S ec ti on 1: G ene ral i nfo r ma ti on Purpose This analysis and advice informs key policy decisions to be taken by the Minister of Revenue ahead of final decisions by Cabinet on whether to proceed with a policy change to reduce the need to amend pre-2013 student loan obligations after April 2020. Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Summary. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis are as follows. Time to enact legislation As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the Student Loan Scheme will be moved to new systems and processes with effect from April 2020. This transfer provides an opportunity to reduce the current complexity of the scheme caused by having to administer rules for previous years that have subsequently been repealed. Any legislative changes that are to apply from 2020 would need to be introduced into Parliament by mid-2019. The timeframe to enact legislation has reduced the time available to develop and analyse the options and to consult with stakeholders. No consultation with external stakeholders Inland Revenue has not consulted with affected borrowers as the number of borrowers likely to be impacted by the proposed option is small and the legislative process provides an opportunity for the public to make submissions on the proposals as the Bill progresses through Parliament. Scale of the problem The scale of the problem in terms of the impact of the status quo on borrower compliance has not been accurately identified. Research suggests that borrowers do not understand how the student loan rules for previous years impact any changes their loan obligations. Impact of proposals on the student loan valuation Proposals that have a material impact on the valuation require a Budget bid and would need to be prioritised alongside other bids for Government funding. In order to proceed with reducing the complexity of changes to prior years’ repayment obligations, officials focussed on options that would not materially impact the student loan valuation. None of the limitations materially affect the analysis. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Melody Guy Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 31 January 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 2 IN CONFIDENCE S ec ti on 2: P robl e m de fi ni ti on and obj ec ti ves 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The underlying problem is the complexity of the student loan rules relating to previous years that no longer feature in the current scheme. This complexity means there is a lack of understanding by borrowers of the rules prior to 1 April 2013. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the Student Loan Scheme will move to new systems and processes in April 2020. This transfer process provides an opportunity to make legislative changes to reduce the complexity of the student loan rules prior to April 2013, make it cheaper and easier to make changes to the scheme in the future, reduce compliance costs (by increasing understanding of rules) for borrowers, and increase consistency between tax and student loans. April 2013 has been chosen as this date captures 93% of all changes to student loan obligations for previous years and is the point where the rules are largely the same as apply today. The Student Loan Scheme was introduced in 1992 and is governed by the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, and loan contracts between the government and each borrower. A significant number of changes have been made to the Student Loan Scheme since its introduction with changes being made in 21 of the last 26 years. Under current legislation, the importance of accurate borrower’s obligations outweighs compliance and administrative costs. For example, either the borrower or Inland Revenue can seek to amend a prior year’s loan obligation, regardless of the amount of money involved. A repayment obligation is changed where an error is identified in the calculation of a borrower’s repayment obligation for a year. Unlike income tax, which generally has a period of 4 years from the date a return is filed to make changes to a tax obligation, student loan obligations can be changed back to the date the loan was taken out, which could be as far back as 1992 when the loan scheme was introduced. Therefore, where a student loan obligation for a previous year changes, the rules relating to that year apply. This requirement to retain rules for previous years has increased the complexity of the Student Loan Scheme administration, reduced the overall customer experience by making it difficult for borrowers to understand changes to their loan balance, and increased the administration costs. A significant number of the rules relating to previous years have since been repealed. Decisions on whether to simplify the Student Loan Scheme are required by March in order for any legislative changes to be enacted in time for an April 2020 application. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Borrowers affected are those whose obligations prior to 2013 are amended. In the 2018 year, of the 700,000 student loan borrowers, less than 0.2 percent had their repayment obligations prior to April 2013 amended (1,314) resulting in increased repayment obligations of $1.2 million. The number of borrows affected is expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s efforts to reduce the number of outstanding tax returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 3 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The major constraint on our analysis is the time to enact legislation. Inland Revenue is part way through a multi-year transformation programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, processes, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. Options to simplify the prior years’ student loan rules require a legislative change. For legislation to be enacted by April 2020, changes would need to be introduced into Parliament in mid-2019 and therefore Cabinet decisions on policy changes are required in March 2019. The timeframe to enact legislation has reduced the time available to consult with stakeholders. Inland Revenue does not intend to consult separately with affected borrowers. However, mitigating factors are that the number of borrowers likely to be impacted by the preferred option is small and public submissions can be made on the proposals at the Select Committee stage as the Bill progresses though Parliament. Another constraint is the impact on the student loan valuation. Options that have an impact on the valuation would require a Budget bid as part of Budget 2019. These options would have to be prioritised together with other Government initiatives. Officials do not propose pursuing options that materially impact on the student loan valuation. S ec ti on 3: O p ti ons i d enti fi ca ti on 3.1 What options have been considered? Transferring the Student Loan Scheme to the new systems and processes provides an opportunity to reduce the administrative complexity of the Student Loan Scheme. Reducing the complexity of the Student Loan Scheme can only be resolved through legislative changes. Officials have considered non-legislative options, such as manually undertaking changes to prior year obligations, but these options may reduce but will not resolve the complexity issue. Therefore, the options proposed to simplify the Student Loan Scheme are legislative only. The options considered are retaining the status quo and two options to simplify the Student Loan Scheme rules relating to the 2013 and prior years. The policy objective is to implement the Student Loan Scheme into the new systems and processes within the timeline (April 2020) and reduce the complexity of the scheme, whilst ensuring equity among borrowers, and no material impact on the student loan valuation. In considering the options, officials evaluated the options against the following criteria: • equity between borrowers (current versus past borrowers, compliant versus non- compliant borrowers, and New Zealand based versus overseas based borrowers); • the impact of the complexity of the scheme on both the compliance costs of borrowers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue; 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 4 IN CONFIDENCE • the impact of the options on the valuation of the Student Loan Scheme; and • the cost and time to make policy changes in the future. Option One: Status quo – implement the rules back to 1992 This option involves implementing all the prior years’ student loan rules back to 1992 into new systems and processes. However, as student loans repayments for New Zealand based borrows are based on income for tax purposes, and as income tax generally has a period of 4 years for making changes to tax obligations, there will be no income generated student loan changes prior to 2013. Changes to loan obligations prior to 2013 would be those where fraud or non-filing of tax returns is involved and it is cost effective to do so, changes in residence status, or changes due to other student loan rules such as repayment holiday entitlement, or entitlement to the voluntary repayment bonus. This option would have no material impact on the student loan valuation and retains the current equity among borrowers. However, it retains the current complex rules prior to April 2013 which would need to be built into new systems and processes. This complexity imposes administration costs on the government and would impact very few borrowers.. Also, future policy changes should still accommodate the rules prior to 1 April 2013. This option is not preferred by officials. Option Two: No new changes to repayment obligations prior to April 2013 Under this option the student loan rules would only be incorporated into new systems and processes back to 1 April 2013. This date was chosen as it captures almost all changes to student loan repayment obligations and the rules applying from April 2013 are largely the same as apply today. The rules relating to policy changes prior to 2013 will not be built into new systems and processes. Changes to repayment obligations prior to this date would only occur in exceptional circumstances such as cases of tax or student loan fraud or non- filing of tax returns showing a significant liability. These cases would be processed manually. This option simplifies the current rules, removes the need to build the rules prior to 1 April 2013 into the new systems and processes, and reduces both compliance and administrative costs. However, there are instances where equity between compliant and non-compliant borrowers would not be retained, such as where a borrower who Inland Revenue considers is New Zealand based is found to have gone overseas prior to April 2013 without notifying Inland Revenue as required in their loan contract. Under this option the borrower would only have interest imposed back to 1 April 2013 not the earlier date when they became overseas based. This option would reduce the cost and time to implement policy changes in the future as changes would not have to accommodate rules prior to April 2013. However, it would also have a material impact on the student loan valuation and for this reason is not preferred by officials. Option Three: Limited changes to loan obligations in relation to the 2013 and prior years (preferred option) This option would incorporate the student loan rules into new systems and processes back to 1 April 2013. For periods prior to 1 April 2013, changes to repayment obligations would only occur where a borrower changes their residence status, for example, Inland Revenue receive new information that a borrower had gone overseas, or in cases of unfiled returns where it is cost effective to do so, or fraud. Where a borrower’s residency status changes, interest would be calculated on their loan balance from the date the borrower’s status changed at the interest rates that applied in the relevant years. Changes in the borrower’s repayment obligation for the period up to 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 5 IN CONFIDENCE April 2013 would be ignored. However, changes to obligations from 1 April 2013 onwards would be assessed as they are now. In cases of fraud, or unfiled tax returns where the obligation is material, a simplified calculation would be used by applying the student loan repayment rate to the amended income figure. A one-off penalty may also apply to penalise the non-compliant action. Late payment interest will only be imposed on adjusted repayment obligations from 1 April 2013 onwards. Imposing late payment interest on repayment obligations for the period 1992 to 2013 can disproportionately increase the debt owed to Inland Revenue to the point where the borrower cannot repay the debt and disengages with the Student Loan Scheme. Adjustments to residency status and the associated interest impact together with situations where under-declared income or fraud is involved have the greatest impact on the loan balance and time to repay the loan. This option incorporates these situations. This option simplifies the calculation of repayment obligations prior to April 2013, removes the need to build these rules into the new systems and processes, reduces the complexity of the scheme and therefore reduces both compliance costs and administrative costs. As this option takes account of residency changes and applies the historical loan interest rates, equity between compliant and non-compliant overseas-based borrowers would be preserved. Also, the inclusion of borrowers who fail to file returns of a material value or commit fraud also retains equity between compliant and non-compliant borrowers. This option has no material impact on the student loan valuation and reduces the time and cost of making policy changes in the future as changes would not have to accommodate rules prior to April 2013. This option is preferred by officials. How each option would work The following examples illustrate the differences in treatment of a borrower under each option. Example 1 A borrower went overseas in 2008, did not advise Inland Revenue and was not picked up through the passenger movement match with NZ Customs. The borrower has been treated as New Zealand-based and therefore not charged loan interest. In 2021 the borrower returns to New Zealand. Inland Revenue identifies that the borrower has been overseas for the preceding years and updates the borrower’s residency status for the time they were away. Under Option One, the borrower’s residency status will be changed with effect from the date they went overseas in 2008 and loan interest, repayment obligations and late payment interest would be imposed from that date. Under Option Three, the borrower’s residency status will be changed with effect from the date they went overseas in 2008 and loan interest will be imposed from that date. However, repayment obligations and late payment interest would only be imposed from 1 April 2013 onwards. Under Option Two no changes would be made to the borrower’s residency status prior to April 2013 but loan interest, repayment obligations, and late payment interest would be imposed from 1 April 2013 onwards. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Example 2 In 2009 the voluntary repayment bonus feature was introduced which rewarded borrowers for making voluntary repayments above what they were required to repay. The bonus applied for 5 years (2009-2013) before being repealed. In 2020 a borrower identifies an error in the calculation of their voluntary repayment bonus for the 2010 year although their income remains unchanged. They apply to have the voluntary repayment bonus recalculated for the 2010 year. Under Option One, the borrower would be able to receive the bonus but under Options Two and Three, they would not. We do not expect lack of retrospective entitlement to the voluntary repayment bonus to be a significant issue, given that few people took it up and there has been a long period during which any affected borrowers could have sought a recalculation of their entitlement. Example 3 A taxpayer has committed fraud through not declaring a large source of income for the 2008 year. This has implications for both their income tax and student loan obligations. The four-year period for making changes to an income tax obligation after a return is filed does not apply where fraud is involved. Therefore, the Commissioner amends the taxpayer’s income tax liability for the 2008 year. Under Options One, Two, and Three, the student loan repayment obligation would also be changed. Under Options One and Two, the student loan repayment obligation would be calculated on both the adjusted income for the year and the relevant student loan rules for that year. Under Option Three, the repayment obligation would only be calculated on the adjusted income and late payment interest would only apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Officials consider Option Three to be the preferred option. This option addresses the policy problem set out in 2.1 and has advantages in terms of ensuring equity between compliant borrowers and non-compliant overseas borrowers, those who under declare income, or those who commit fraud. It also reduces the complexity of the scheme and therefore makes it easier for borrowers to understand their loan obligations and reduces the administration costs for Inland Revenue over the status quo. This option has no material impact on the student loan valuation and reduces the time and cost of making policy changes in the future. S ec ti on 4: I mpa ct A n al ysi s (P r opo sed ap pro ach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 7 IN CONFIDENCE 1 In the 2018 year, of the 700,000 student loan borrowers, less than two percent had their repayment obligations prior to April 2013 amended (1,314). This number is expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s efforts in recent years to reduce the number of outstanding student loan returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. Regulated parties (affected borrowers) 1 The cost to borrowers in reduced accuracy of prior years’ obligations may increase or decrease a borrower’s repayment liability and reduce or increase the time period to repay the loan accordingly. Changes to repayment obligations by Inland Revenue would tend to increase a borrower’s repayment liability. Borrowers not being able to receive the voluntary repayment that they may have been entitled to prior to this change (pre- April 2020). The extent of the impact is dependent on the amount of the assessed obligation, but any impact on a borrower’s repayment time period is expected to be low. Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) None None Wider government None None Other parties None None Total Monetised Cost Financial impact for borrowers Borrowers face either an increased or decreased repayment obligation Non-monetised costs Compliance costs for borrowers Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (affected borrowers) Ongoing compliance costs savings for borrowers affected by a prior year’s repayment obligation. The proposal reduces the need for affected borrowers to understand how the old rules impact their student loan liability. By way of example, borrowers with changes to prior year’s obligations will no longer be required to understand the impact of the voluntary repayment bonus or 3-year repayment holiday on their loan balance. However, they may have had a higher loan balance through not receiving the voluntary repayment bonus. Borrowers who may have been required to pay late payment interest due to a changed repayment obligation prior to 1 April 2013 would not be required to pay this after this change (April 2020) Low/Medium depending on the extent of the changes to repayment obligations and number of years involved Low 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Two different borrowers may be treated differently in the same situation, depending on when the change is identified. For example, assuming no fraud or non-filing of a material amount is involved, a change in a borrower’s income that occurred prior to April 2013 would be included in the borrower’s repayment obligation if the change was identified last year but would not occur if the change was identified after April 2020. The amended repayment obligation would result in the time to repay the loan being varied slightly either earlier (if the repayment obligation increases) or later (if the repayment obligation reduces). The greater the adjustment in repayment obligation the greater the impact on the loan repayment period. Most changes to borrowers’ obligations occur in the first 3-4 years following the tax year. After that the number of changes falls dramatically. In the 2018 year the number of borrowers who had changes to their repayment obligations for the 2013 or prior years was 1,314, and the total increased repayments obligations was $1.2 million (although the amount expected to be collected is less than this). These figures are expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s continued efforts to reduce the number of outstanding tax returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. Regulators (Inland Revenue) Reduced implementation costs for IR. Reduced ongoing costs of changing prior years’ obligations, training staff and retaining administrative processes. These costs will form part of the savings from Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. Low/Medium Wider government None None Other parties None None Total Monetised Benefit None None Non-monetised benefits Reduced compliance costs for borrowers and administrative benefits for Inland Revenue Low/Medium 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 9 IN CONFIDENCE S ec ti on 5: S ta kehol d er vi ew s 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The timeframe to enact legislation and implement student loans into the new systems and processes has limited Inland Revenue’s ability to consult with those borrowers affected by the preferred option. This means that the problem identification, options identification, and impacts have been generated by officials based on the information available. It is recognised that consultation with those affected by a change is an important part of the Generic Tax Policy Process. However, mitigating factors are that the number of borrowers likely to be impacted in future by the preferred option is small and expected to reduce in future. Also, there will be an opportunity for the public to submit on the measure during the Select Committee process and feedback will be considered at that point. The Ministry of Education have been consulted in developing the options and agree with the recommended proposal. S ec ti on 6: I mpl e men ta ti on a nd op era ti on 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? It is intended that the preferred option be included in the next available taxation bill which is expected to be introduced into Parliament later in the year. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the operation of this preferred option and this will form part of its business as usual function. The preferred option will reduce the implementation risks associated with transferring the Student Loan Scheme from the current computer platform to the new systems and processes. It is proposed that legislation apply to limit changes in repayment obligations for the 2013 or prior years where the change occurs on or after April 2020. This will enable sufficient preparation time for Inland Revenue to implement the changes. The proposed approach will be included in the commentary on the taxation bill and consultation by select committee is expected to provide an opportunity for interested parties to express their views on this proposed change. S ec ti on 7: M oni to ri ng, eval uati o n and r evi ew 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed legislation in the first 12 months of operation. If we identify anything that suggests the legislation is not operating as intended, then we will undertake a review. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Inland Revenue currently have metrics to monitor the administration of the Student Loan Scheme. Work is progressing on designing the new system and processes and although work on the metrics to enable ongoing monitoring of volumes of changes to repayment obligations prior to 2013 has not commenced yet, officials expect the new systems and processes to replicate the existing metrics. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified from the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01
Coversheet: Research and Development Tax Incentive - Refundability Advising agencies Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Inland Revenue (IR) The Treasury Callaghan Innovation Decision sought Broader refundability for the R&D Tax Incentive Proposing Ministers Hon Dr Megan Woods (Minister for Research, Science and Innovation) Hon Stuart Nash (Minister of Revenue) Summary: Problem and proposed approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act (the Act), implements an R&D Tax Incentive in New Zealand. The R&D Tax Incentive applies from 1 April 2019 for most businesses. Under the scheme, firms can receive a tax credit equal to 15% of their eligible R&D expenditure. Profitable firms will be able to use this tax credit to reduce their income tax liability. The Act allows for certain firms that have little or no income tax to pay to receive a R&D tax credit refund of up to $255,000 per income year. Credits that are not refunded can be carried forward to future income years provided shareholder continuity criteria are met. The limited refundability rules in the Act are based on the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme. Under these rules, eligibility for refunds is restricted to unlisted companies that meet a 20% R&D wage intensity test and do not derive non-dividend exempt income. These criteria mean that many businesses will not be eligible for refundable tax credits under the R&D Tax Incentive. Partnerships, trusts, listed companies, and companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test will be excluded. Additionally, certain atypical organisations, such as levy bodies, some Māori entities, charities, and local authorities, will be excluded. It is desirable to ensure the law provides clarity as to whether these entities should benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive through the design of a more comprehensive refundability policy. The limited timeframe for developing the Act meant it was not possible to design broad refundability rules for year one. The Government has committed to developing a more comprehensive policy for refundability to apply from year two of the Tax Incentive. The rationale for the R&D Tax Incentive and the importance of raising business expenditure on R&D (BERD) was explained in the previous Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) for the R&D Tax Incentive (http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2018-ria-rdtc-bill/overview). This RIS is focused on options to broaden the refundability of the R&D Tax Incentive. If refundability is not broadened, it is expected that the Tax Incentive will not be as effective as intended at incentivising additional R&D. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 1 Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? Broadening eligibility for refundability The proposed approach is to change the existing limited refundability rules so that R&D tax credit refunds are available to more businesses. It is proposed that all businesses would be eligible for refundability, irrespective of their legal form or whether they are listed. The 20% wage intensity test would also be removed. We expect that making the tax credit available to more R&D-performing firms (and higher incentives for firms to engage in R&D) will increase the amount of R&D undertaken, which will in turn result in an increase in knowledge creation, employment, and labour productivity growth. Knowledge created by R&D flows between firms because of worker mobility, product imitation and reverse engineering. This means firms do not capture the full benefits of their R&D and so they underinvest relative to the socially optimal level. This is why most governments have a policy that will stimulate firms to undertake more R&D. Providing refundable tax credits will enhance the effectiveness of the R&D Tax Incentive at stimulating growth in BERD, because it provides cash closer to the point when firms, particularly R&D intensive firms in the early stages of their development, are undertaking their R&D. This means the tax credit is more likely to incentivise the performance of additional R&D by businesses, which is the goal of the policy. Broadening the refundability available from that provided for year one of the R&D Tax Incentive has always been the intent, and will broaden the reach and effect of the R&D Tax Incentive. Ensuring integrity and managing fraud risk In addition to extending refundability to all businesses, it is proposed to remove the existing $255,000 cap on refundability. Instead, it is proposed to limit the amount of credits refundable to businesses through a cap based on the amount of payroll taxes paid by each business. This payroll cap would include PAYE, fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT) paid by a business. A payroll cap will help ensure the integrity of the scheme is maintained. It is necessary to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims for R&D tax credit refunds which have been problematic (along with an associated fiscal risk) in other jurisdictions with refundable R&D tax credits. The payroll cap would not apply to limit refundability of R&D tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers because it will be easy to verify that these payments have been incurred by a business. The payroll cap would not apply to limit the R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. Levy bodies are empowered to collect levies by statute, definitely have an economic presence in New Zealand, and consequently pose a reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 2 Exempt income recipients Recipients of exempt income are currently ineligible for limited refundability, unless the only exempt income they receive is from dividends. Without refundability, entities that only derive exempt income, such as charities, are unable to receive any cash benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive. This is because they do not have any income tax to pay. As these entities are outside the tax system, it is proposed that they should not benefit further from incentives provided from within the tax system and that they should be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. It is proposed that an exception apply for levy bodies, however, which do not receive the same tax concessions as charities (such as donee tax credit status, GST and FBT concessions). The R&D performed by and funded through levy bodies is fundamentally business R&D. Accordingly, it is proposed that levy bodies are eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive (including refundability), even if they receive exempt income. Further details and the implications of this proposal for particular atypical organisations (including charities, Māori businesses, and local authorities) are discussed further at 3.2. Section B: Summary impacts - benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Businesses in tax loss, or with insufficient income tax liability to fully utilise non- refundable tax credits, will be the main beneficiaries from broader refundability. Refundability can be particularly beneficial for young, innovative firms, at the stage of investing in developing and launching their products (Appelt et al., 2016). The population of firms performing R&D and in a tax loss position is estimated at 750-1200. These are the expected beneficiaries. Under current rules only 350-650 firms are expected to qualify for refundability, and of those 65-130 are expected to hit the cap on refundability. Partnerships, trusts, listed companies, companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test, and atypical organisations such as levy bodies and some Māori business entities will also benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive through the design of a more comprehensive refundability policy. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 3 Where do the costs fall? Fiscal costs The budget for the Tax Incentive provides for the fiscal cost of full refundability. In Budget 2018 the Government appropriated $1,020 million over the first four fiscal years for the R&D Tax Incentive. On 10 September 2018, Cabinet agreed to reprioritise the remaining funding ($528 million) already allocated for Growth Grants over the same period \[CAB-18-MIN-0434 refers\]. We anticipate that allowing broad refundability will increase the take-up of the Tax Incentive compared to limited refundability. This in turn will increase the R&D expenditure performed by firms, and the amount claimed under the Tax Incentive. These fiscal costs will be borne directly by Government and indirectly by the taxpayer. Additional fiscal cost due to broader refundability, compared with the limited refundability available in year one of the R&D Tax incentive, could be for the below reasons: • Increased R&D activity from existing R&D performers • Firms new to R&D enter the scheme We have estimated the fiscal costs of the R&D Tax Incentive with full refundability to be approximately $1,345 million over the first four fiscal years for the R&D Tax Incentive (from when it comes into effect on 1 April 2019 through until 30 June 2022). The model used to prepare these estimates assumed that firms claim the full amount of the eligible R&D expenditure to which they are entitled in the year in which it is incurred. More specifically, it assumes that firms in loss claim the full amount of the Tax Incentive, even without full refundability. Anecdotal evidence from overseas jurisdictions shows that those that have allowed more generous refundability have experienced much greater rise in the costs of their R&D tax incentives. In Australia, R&D in the part of the scheme that was refundable (which applied to small-and-medium enterprises) grew at approximately 15 percent per annum whereas R&D in the non-refundable part experienced no growth. We cannot extrapolate exactly from the Australian experience to New Zealand because in New Zealand broad refundability will be available to all businesses, regardless of size (subject to exclusions discussed above). Moreover, without further analysis, it is not possible to conclude that the presence of refundability drove all the higher growth in Australia; a number of other factors are likely to have also contributed. Nevertheless, if New Zealand were to experience R&D growth equivalent to the refundable part of the Australian scheme, we have estimated that it might add approximately $40 million (over the period of the appropriation) to our estimates of the fiscal costs of the R&D Tax Incentive. Administration costs The increased attractiveness of the regime will increase legitimate claims but may also increase fraudulent claims. The increased risk of fraudulent claims may mean more administrative costs to ensure the legitimacy of claims. However, as the R&D Tax Incentive scheme has already been designed with relatively thorough checks on the R&D activities that are the subject of the claims, it is expected that any increase in administrative costs resulting from broader refundability will be negligible. Compliance costs Compared with the limited refundability rules in year one, compliance costs to firms 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 4 under broader refundability should either decrease or stay the same. The year one refundability rules use the existing corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria from the R&D tax loss cash-out rules, which are relatively complex. The proposed eligibility rules from year two are simpler, so compliance costs could decrease under the proposals. In addition, more firms will have their credits fully refunded rather than carrying them forward. This reduces the complexity of tracking historic credits and testing for continuity breaches. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Risks There are three main risks associated with broader refundability which must be considered as part of the design. These are fiscal risk, fraud risk, and integrity risk. Fiscal risk Overseas experience indicates that R&D and hence fiscal cost growth is faster for the refundable parts of R&D tax credit schemes. This is not a risk in and of itself, because an increase in expenditure because of increased R&D would go towards achieving the objective of the incentive. A ‘payroll’ cap is proposed to help mitigate fiscal risk associated with illegitimate R&D tax credit claims. If the Government decided to constrain expenditure on the incentive in future, the tax credit rate of 15% could be adjusted downwards. Fraud risk This is the risk of a person deliberately attempting to extract money from the tax system dishonestly. Broader refundability provides additional incentives to perpetrate fraud and allows additional opportunities to perpetrate fraud. It is more difficult to recover money paid out in cash via a refund than to cancel a tax credit. To minimise the risk of fraudulent claims, the proposed ‘payroll’ cap ensures the existence of a business and its economic presence are verified before a R&D tax credit refund is paid to the business. The risk of fraudulent claims will also be mitigated through the following steps: • An in-year approval process (included in the Act), which requires claimants to obtain approval of their R&D activities before they file a claim for their R&D tax credits. • A $50,000 minimum threshold of eligible expenditure 1 (included in the Act). Experience in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, indicates that without a minimum threshold there can be a flood of smaller, lower-quality tax credit claims. Integrity risk This is the risk that compliance with the R&D Tax Incentive scheme may deteriorate if it is perceived to be abused by some claimants. This risk can be mitigated by ensuring the Tax Incentive is seen to be robust. In-year approval (included in the Act) and the proposed ‘payroll’ cap should help mitigate this integrity risk. Learning from overseas experience Most overseas R&D tax credit schemes with refundability have some constraints, 1 There is an exception for R&D activities carried out by an Approved Research Provider. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 5 such as capping the amount of refundable tax credit to the amount of other taxes paid by a business (such as PAYE paid on behalf of employees). Appendix 1 summarises the policies applied in other OECD countries that provide refunds and describes the strengths and drawbacks of each policy. There is no uniformity as to how constraints are applied, but some broad observations are: • Some constraint on refundability is the norm. A system with no restrictions on refundability would be an outlier amongst OECD countries. • The different ways in which refundability is limited often reflect differences in the underlying tax incentive scheme. • Some countries limit refundability to SMEs and start-ups. • It is relatively common to limit refunds by reference to other taxes paid by the firm. A common approach in other jurisdictions is to limit refunds to the amount paid in other taxes such as PAYE. 2 This ensures a firm has a tangible economic presence in the country where the claim is being made, the amount refunded is commensurate to activity in the jurisdiction and it reduces the risk that the claim is made by a non- existent entity. Considering the risks associated with refundability and learnings from overseas, we propose broadening the refundability available in year one but having some constraints to mitigate risk. Constraints to mitigate the risks associated with broader refundability The proposal to broaden eligibility for refundability includes a ‘payroll’ cap on refunds to mitigate the fraud, fiscal, and integrity risks associated with paying out cash. It is proposed that all firms are entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (proposed payroll cap). 3 The proposed payroll cap would not apply to limit tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers. The proposed payroll cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. The proposed payroll cap is designed to prevent refundable tax credits being paid out to firms who are fraudulently claiming the tax credit. Limiting R&D tax credit payments to the amount of PAYE paid by a firm, as is done in many overseas jurisdictions, is a simple and unobtrusive measure but overlooks that some firms may legitimately pay little PAYE. 4 Consequently, it is proposed that additional payroll taxes paid be included to reduce the impact of this constraint. Payments to Approved Research Providers will not be capped as it will be easy to verify that these payments have actually been incurred by a firm. That is, R&D credits generated from eligible expenditure on Approved Research Providers will be refundable, even if a business has not paid any payroll taxes. Levy bodies may have low ‘payroll’ taxes where R&D is largely contracted out, but 2 For most firms, the amount of PAYE they pay on behalf of employees will exceed 15% of the amount of R&D they undertake because all employees in the firm will contribute to the PAYE total whereas R&D is usually only one part of the firm’s activities. There will, however, be some firms that (quite legitimately) do not pay PAYE. 3 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 4 For instance, many start-up firms will limit their financial risk by employing staff on contract rather than recruiting them as permanent members of staff. These staff employed on contract may choose to have withholding tax (WT) paid by the firm on their behalf. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 6 they are not subject to the cap due to reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable. Conclusion The above constraint is not anticipated to restrict refunds for the vast majority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some immediate benefit and a few would have less than full refundability. Given the R&D Tax Incentive scheme is relatively broad and accessible, the proposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter the incentives of the scheme. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy for New Zealand represents a comprehensive approach to refundability. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? We are confident of the evidence that refundable R&D tax credit schemes are effective at increasing business R&D. This is based on a range of international studies. It is difficult to predict the actual level by which R&D will increase as a result of broader refundability. Written and oral submissions on the Act emphasised the importance of refundability for supporting R&D. Consultation recently undertaken with businesses on broader refundability has reaffirmed the importance of refundability for incentivising R&D intensive firms to continue to invest in and grow their R&D activities. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: MBIE’s Regulatory Impact Analysis Review Panel has reviewed this Regulatory Impact Statement. Quality Assurance Assessment: The Panel considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement meets the criteria necessary for Ministers to make informed decisions. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 7 Impact Statement: R&D Tax Incentive - Refundability Section 1: General information Purpose This analysis and advice has been produced to inform key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet around broadening the refundability available under the R&D Tax Incentive. MBIE and IR are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. Key limitations or constraints on analysis Estimating the impact of broader refundability on the amount of R&D undertaken and its overall impact on the economy is complicated. Evidence on the impact on both of these is imprecise. There has been no analysis on or impact evaluation of the R&D tax incentive implemented in New Zealand in 2008 (which was fully refundable). So there is no New Zealand evidence to guide our analysis of the impacts of refundability. As a result, the estimates of the anticipated response are based upon evidence from international studies that may not correspond to the situation in New Zealand. Nevertheless, this is the best information available. Responsible Managers (signature and date) Keith Taylor Kirsty Hutchison Policy Manager Manager – Innovation Policy Inland Revenue Ministry of Business, Innovation and 10 / 05 / 2019 Employment 10 / 05 / 2019 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? New Zealand has a low overall expenditure on R&D 5 primarily due to low business investment in R&D in New Zealand. New Zealand’s low business investment in R&D can be explained, in part, by its industrial structure. New Zealand firms have low R&D intensity (Mazoyer, 1999); the size of traditionally R&D intensive industries (such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacturing) in New Zealand is small (Di Maio and Blakeley, 2004); and there are few very large firms, who tend to be more research-active (OECD, 2017). Evidence suggests that there are other reasons for the low business investment in R&D. These include returns to innovation being relatively low in New Zealand 5 New Zealand’s R&D spending in 2018 was equal to 1.37 percent of gross domestic product. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 8 (Wakeman and Conway, 2017), which means New Zealand firms do not have the same incentive to invest in activities that will increase their innovative output. The average rate of public support for business R&D is also “well below the socially efficient level indicated by international empirical studies” (OECD, 2017). This evidence indicates that there is scope for productivity gains from increasing the overall level of support for R&D expenditure. The Government announced a goal of increasing New Zealand’s R&D expenditure to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027. To reach this target, a significant amount of the growth in R&D expenditure is expected to come from business. New Zealand BERD is relatively low and remains concentrated among a small set of firms. To achieve a further boost in BERD, as well as to transform the economy to become more knowledge intensive, requires broadening the base of R&D performing firms within New Zealand while continuing to increase the R&D expenditure of existing R&D-performing firms. R&D performing firms, particularly at the early phase of their development, will often be loss-making. Therefore, providing refundable tax credits to businesses in tax loss is a key element of the effectiveness of the R&D Tax Incentive in achieving significant growth in BERD. Without a refundable tax incentive businesses in tax loss will have minimal incentive to invest in additional R&D. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act (the Act), introduced in October 2018, implements an R&D tax incentive in New Zealand. The R&D Tax Incentive scheme applies from the beginning of the 2019/20 income year. The Act allows for firms that make a loss for tax purposes and satisfy certain criteria to receive a refund of up to $255,000 of tax credits per income year. Credits that are not refunded can be carried forward to future income years provided shareholder continuity criteria are met. Appendix 2 provides examples that illustrate how without refundability, firms do not receive a cash benefit from a tax credit if they are in loss or have insufficient income tax liability. The Act also includes an in-year approval process, which requires claimants to obtain approval of their R&D activities before they file a claim for their R&D tax credits. In addition to the R&D Tax Incentive, there are Callaghan Innovation grants which provide R&D subsidies. These grants include: • Growth Grants: A non-discretionary grant paid to all businesses that spend more than $300,000 and 1.5 per cent of revenue on R&D over the prior two years. The grant funds 20 per cent of a business R&D programme up to a limit of $5 million per year (i.e., $25m of R&D spending), initially for a period of three years with automatic two-year extensions conditional on continuing to meet the criteria. The aim is to provide experienced R&D performers with the funding certainty and stability they need to grow their R&D spending in the long term. There were 316 recipients in 2017/18 at an (estimated) fiscal cost of $172.2M. The Growth Grant scheme will cease on 31 March 2021. No new applications can be made, but existing Growth Grant recipients can extend their Growth Grants until the scheme end date. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 9 • Project Grants: A discretionary grant, allocated to less-experienced R&D performers that do not meet the conditions for a Growth Grant for R&D. It funds 40 per cent of the first $800,000 of the eligible costs of a pre-specified project and 20 per cent of the remainder. There were 344 recipients in 2017/18 at an estimated fiscal cost of $20.3M. There are restrictions on the availability of the R&D Tax Incentive for recipients of existing grants. New Zealand also provides support for businesses performing R&D through the R&D loss tax credit (also known as the R&D tax-loss cash out). New Zealand-resident businesses are able to apply for 28 per cent of their losses associated with eligible R&D expenditure (up to a cap) to be paid out in cash, rather than carrying forward those losses until future years. 350 firms currently claim R&D loss tax credits. There are also tax deductions available for R&D expenditure, and the ability to defer these tax deductions so as not to lose them due to a breach of the shareholder continuity rules. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The objective of the R&D Tax Incentive is to address New Zealand’s low levels of R&D, specifically by increasing BERD, which has a central role in driving innovation and economic growth. The R&D Tax Incentive as introduced in the Act has limited refundability. Limited refundability is available to unlisted companies who satisfy corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria, up to a cap of $255,000. Any remaining R&D tax credits can be carried forward to the next income year provided shareholder continuity requirements are met. Entity eligibility Limited refundability is not available for entities, such as levy bodies, which receive tax exempt income (other than dividends). Discussions of the proposals with levy bodies has indicated that should levy bodies be ineligible for refundable R&D tax credits, this could lead to some levy body members preferring to fund their own R&D. The incentive is not intended to change business behaviour in this way. Limited refundability is also not available for listed companies, partnerships, or trusts. This is problematic, because it is likely that – without refundability – some of these businesses will have insufficient income tax liability to benefit from their R&D tax credits. The Tax Incentive is intended to have broad application and treat all businesses the same, irrespective of their legal form. However, excluding some types of firm from the Tax Incentive biases it toward firms in traditional arrangements (particularly, limited liability companies). Capped refundability Some businesses may be eligible for limited refundability but unable to cash out all of their R&D tax credits because of the $255,000 cap. These businesses will have to carry their R&D tax credits forward into future years until they have sufficient income tax liability to utilise their credits. The ability to carry the credit forward is subject to a shareholder continuity rule that requires a minimum of 49% shareholder continuity to be maintained in order for R&D tax credits to be carried forward. This is problematic, because R&D intensive start-ups are more likely to undergo a significant change in their shareholder base when they seek to raise capital through new investors. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 10 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The Government has introduced the R&D Tax Incentive and indicated that it wants to expand the coverage of refundability. The Government has committed to developing a more comprehensive policy for refundability from year two of the Tax Incentive (corresponding to businesses’ 2020/21 income year). There is a need to use existing legislative vehicles to achieve enactment of policy changes in time for them to apply from year two of the Tax Incentive. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? This proposal has been informed by input from a wide array of private sector organisations. The importance of broad refundability in incentivising business investment in R&D was a strong theme from the consultation conducted by MBIE, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation following the release of the Government Discussion Document on the R&D Tax Incentive in mid-2018. The need for broader refundability was also emphasized in submissions received by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on the Bill, and through additional stakeholder meetings. MBIE, Inland Revenue and Callaghan have discussed refundability proposals with the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group; Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; approximately 25 representatives from R&D performing businesses in tax loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully use non-refundable R&D tax credits; levy bodies; charities; and Māori business representatives. These discussions have helped shape the broader refundability proposals, and have highlighted the desirability of broad eligibility and an accessible process. Agencies asked stakeholders to consider the impact of a $5 million cap and a PAYE cap (used as a proxy to test tangible economic presence). Feedback on $5 million cap Stakeholder engagement revealed that there were a small number of established R&D performers who would be constrained by a $5 million cap. For example, a business in a loss making position undertaking around $80 million of R&D annually would be eligible for $12 million of R&D tax credits. Under a $5 million cap the business would receive a $5 million refund and would have to carry forward the remaining $7 million of R&D tax credits into future years. Because the business spends a large amount of R&D on an on-going basis they are unlikely to be able to fully cash out their accumulation of R&D credits carried forward. There were also a number of established R&D performers who valued the security refundability would bring to their R&D programmes. These businesses are mainly in a tax-paying situation but depending on market fluctuations they could be in a temporary loss-making position in future. Refundability would give these firms surety, allowing them to continue their R&D investment during market down-turns. Some of these established R&D performers would also be constrained by a $5 million cap. The proposal for broader refundability removes the previously proposed $5 million cap on refundability. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 11 Feedback on PAYE cap The PAYE cap, which would limit the amount of R&D tax credits refunded to a firm to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant year, was seen as problematic. Stakeholders advised that a PAYE cap would significantly constrain the benefit that loss-making start-ups would get from the credit. Many start-ups that perform R&D have few employees and rely on contractors to develop their business because of the comparative flexibility afforded by contracting arrangements. R&D intensive start-ups may have fewer non-R&D employees (compared with larger firms), and may also have a higher proportion of non-employee R&D expenditure (such as expenditure on capital assets or consumables). Tangible economic presence test As a result of the stakeholder feedback on the two options above, officials explored a tangible economic presence (TEP) test. The TEP test developed would have allowed firms that did not satisfy a PAYE cap to be verified for TEP from either an external certifier (such as a chartered accountant or lawyer), or directly from Inland Revenue through additional checks. Stakeholders preferred the availability of alternatives to the PAYE cap, and thought that multiple ways of establishing tangible economic presence were preferable to a one-size-fits-all approach. Payroll taxes cap Discussions with United Kingdom (UK) officials found that the risks of fraud in relation to refundability are more pervasive than previously considered. 6 UK officials suggested that relying on a chartered accountant or practising lawyer for certification of TEP may not be robust, and that additional Inland Revenue checks might lead to administration resources being focused on audit rather than the approval of R&D activity. As a result of this feedback, we have included an option that would include a ‘payroll’ taxes cap based on PAYE and other taxes paid by firms (including fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and tax voluntarily withheld from contractor payments (WT)) in order to lessen the impact on affected firms. It is also proposed that any tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers be fully refundable (so not subject to the ‘payroll’ taxes cap). Stakeholder engagement on including additional payroll taxes (such as FBT, ESCT and WT) in the cap indicated that this would be an improvement over a PAYE cap. Although only a small proportion of contractors have opted into the voluntary withholding scheme, more may decide to opt into it if the payroll taxes cap were implemented. Other mechanisms for providing support to R&D intensive start-ups will also be considered as part of further policy work, including reviewing the R&D tax loss cash- out and the Callaghan Innovation Project Grants. 6 In the UK, HM Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document ‘Preventing abuse of the R&D tax relief for SMEs’, April 2019, which proposes that a PAYE-related cap is reintroduced to the R&D tax credit scheme for SMEs. This policy has been driven by a concern over growing levels of fraud within the scheme since the removal of the PAYE cap. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 12 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The framework for assessing the key policy elements and trade-offs of the options under consideration is captured by the following criteria: Criteria for which entities will be eligible for a refund • Incentivise business expenditure on R&D. • Tax-exempt organisations that sit outside the tax system (do not pay income tax) should not benefit further from incentives provided from within the tax system. • Provide clarity about which organisations are eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Criteria for constraining the amount that is refundable • Increased business R&D expenditure • Mitigation of fraud risk/maintaining the scheme’s integrity • Minimise compliance costs for firms • Maximise business certainty over time • Administratively feasible • Minimise fiscal costs/risk 3.2 What options are available to address the problem? There are a range of options for how refundability could be broadened, including the types of entities that are eligible and the constraints that are placed on the scheme to manage risks that refundability creates, particularly to the integrity of the Tax Incentive. Options for which entities will be eligible for a refund The main options available are: • The status quo • General business entities • Levy bodies • Charities • Local authorities • Other tax-exempt organisations Status quo Under the status quo, limited refundability rules restrict eligibility for refunds to unlisted companies that meet a 20% R&D wage intensity test and do not derive non- dividend exempt income. These criteria mean that many businesses will not be eligible for refundable tax credits, including partnerships, trusts, listed companies, and companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test. Additionally, certain atypical organisations, such as levy bodies, some Māori entities, charities, and local authorities, will be excluded. General business entities This change would make listed companies, partnerships and trusts eligible for refundability, and there would be no wage intensity requirement. This change will allow most Māori organisations to be eligible. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 13 Levy bodies Levy bodies would be eligible for refundability under this option. Charities Under this option charitable organisations that perform eligible R&D activities would be ineligible for refundable tax credits. Charities are currently treated as carrying on a business in New Zealand for the purposes of being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Excluding charities means that this rule would be removed for consistency to ensure they are excluded from being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Excluding charities means that businesses wholly-owned by charities are excluded, because these are also considered charities. However, this option does not exclude other associated entities. This means if a tax paying business donates to a charity, even one controlled by that business, this would not invalidate the business’s access to the R&D Tax Incentive. It would also mean that a charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, which could be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. In relation to Māori organisations, a small number of post-settlement governance entities have registered as charities. As discussed above, businesses that are wholly- owned by these charitable entities would also be ineligible. Businesses that are partially controlled by these charities would be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Local authorities Under this option local authorities would be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. However, council controlled organisations would be eligible. Other tax-exempt organisations This option excludes tax-exempt organisations from being eligible to receive refunds. The exclusion would not apply to entities that receive exempt income from dividends (no change from the status quo) or to levy bodies. Options for constraining the amount that is refundable The main options available are: • The status quo • A PAYE cap • A tangible economic presence (TEP) test • A ‘payroll’ taxes cap Status quo The status quo limited refundability rules allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure that meet the corporate and wage-intensity eligibility rules to claim a maximum refund per year of $255,000. A PAYE cap A PAYE cap would allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure to have their R&D tax credits refunded up to a maximum amount equal to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant income year. A TEP test A TEP test would allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure to have their R&D tax credits refunded as long as they satisfied a test of tangible economic presence, up to a maximum of $5 million per year. A TEP test would be designed to ensure that a 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 14 firm has ‘skin in the game’, and that it physically exists with premises and staff, rather than just existing on paper as a shell company. A TEP test would be met where at least one of the following applied: • A business’s PAYE for the year is equal to or greater than their R&D tax credit claim. This ensures a proportionate TEP because the firm is paying tax on behalf of its employees and cannot take out more than it puts in to the tax system. • A chartered accountant or practising lawyer has certified that a business has TEP. The certifier would testify to the firm’s TEP, having actually met the staff/seen the premises. • Inland Revenue has completed a review (for example, checking the tax-paying history of a business; visiting a business’s site; and/or confirming the identity of shareholders or directors) and is satisfied that a business has TEP. • A business’s R&D tax credit claim only includes amounts paid to an approved research provider to perform R&D activities on their behalf. This provides an easily verified audit trail to determine TEP. • If an organisation is established under statute (such as a levy body), the organisation would be deemed to have TEP. The proposal – a ‘payroll’ taxes cap Under the Proposal, firms that have insufficient tax liability would have their credits fully refunded, subject to the following constraint: • R&D tax credits are refundable to the extent they are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year. 7 • The proposed cap would not apply to limit tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. • The proposed cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. Excess credits that are not refunded in a particular year can be carried forward subject to the continuity rules and can be refunded in future years, subject to the same conditions. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? We have assumed the continuation of the R&D Tax Incentive with at least its existing limited refundability, so we have not considered the option of no tax incentive or no refundability. 7 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 15 Section 4: Impact analysis Entity eligibility for refunds General business entities Levy bodies Charities Local authorities Other tax - exempt organisations Incentivising ( ++ ) This change ( ++ ) The R&D ( 0 ) Charities may perform R&D ( 0 ) Although local ( 0 ) Although other BERD would remove limitations on refundability by entity type, except for the existing exclusion of tax-exempt organisations.

The Tax Incentive is focussed on incentivising BERD, rather than all R&D generally. Charities that perform R&D already receive support from the tax system for their activities. A charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, which could be eligible for the Tax Incentive. This would also apply to a small number of post-settlement governance entities that are registered as charities. The exclusion for charities is not expected to have a significant impact on BERD. authorities would not be eligible, council controlled organisations would be eligible. The exclusion for local authorities is not expected to have a significant impact on BERD. tax-exempt organisations would not be eligible, they could still participate in joint ventures with other businesses that could be eligible.

Which entities will be eligible for a refund Based on the above analysis, the preferred combination of options is for general business entities and levy bodies to be eligible for refundability, and for charities, local authorities, and other organisations that receive (non-dividend) exempt income to be ineligible. The effect of these options is that many more business entities would be eligible for refundability, while not bringing in entities that already receive substantial benefits from operating outside of the tax system. This would be a positive change for listed companies, partnerships, trusts, levy bodies and Māori businesses, and would explicitly exclude charities, local authorities, and other tax- exempt organisations, providing clarity in the law. Constraints on refundable amount Based on the above analysis, the two leading options are a ‘payroll’ taxes cap and a PAYE cap. Both options would significantly mitigate the risk of fraudulent claims, as firms could not take out more from the tax system than they put in. They would be simple, have low compliance costs for firms, and be easy to administer. They would provide increased business certainty, with broad and simple eligibility for refundability. The preferred option is to constrain refundability by a ‘payroll’ taxes cap, because this would have a greater impact on BERD, with a comparatively lesser constraint imposed on the benefit received by loss-making start-ups in particular. Benefits of proposed broader refundability The broader refundability proposed will better support the Government’s objectives of incentivising increased BERD. Providing refundable tax credits to businesses that have insufficient tax liability is a key element of the effectiveness of the R&D Tax Incentive in achieving significant growth in BERD. Broadening the refundability available from that provided for year one of the R&D Tax Incentive will broaden the reach and effect of the R&D Tax Incentive. Businesses will receive the financial support of the R&D Tax Incentive earlier or, in some instances, will actually get a benefit where they previously would not have. The key advantage to a refundable tax credit is it provides cash closer to the point when firms, particularly R&D intensive firms, are undertaking their R&D. Broader refundability will provide increased certainty to businesses, with broad and simple eligibility, and receipt of cash refunds each year rather than having to carry forward credits that may be lost due to continuity breaches. The refundability available in year one is expected to be limited to approximately 350- 650 firms, and 65-130 of those are expected to hit the cap on refundability. The proposed broader refundability has simpler eligibility criteria, and would be available to a larger number of firms, estimated at 750-1200 firms in 2019 (or 550-1100 firms, after allowing for some firms to remain on the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant). The wider coverage and increased cash flow to businesses performing R&D is expected to lead to increased R&D investment by those businesses. Increased coverage of R&D-performing firms (and higher incentives for firms to engage in R&D) is expected to result in an increase in innovative activity, 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 23 employment, and labour productivity growth, particularly among firms that did not qualify for limited refundability. A higher level of R&D expenditure will result in greater spillover benefits to other participants in the economy. The proposed constraint on refundability is not anticipated to restrict refunds for the vast majority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some immediate benefit and a few would have less than full refundability. Given the R&D Tax Incentive scheme is relatively broad and accessible, the proposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter the incentives of the scheme. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy represents a comprehensive approach to refundability. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 24 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected Comment : nature of cost or benefit, risks Impact Evidence parties certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action R&D performing firms Compliance costs No need to quantify because negligible.

For existing Growth Grants this is roughly equivalent to a 20% pre-tax subsidy (as per the Growth Grant), 11 all else being equal. 12 For non- recipients of a Growth Grant this will be an increased subsidy.

Firms with insufficient tax liability will be able to refund their 15% tax credit, up to the proposed cap amount.

There is a potential risk that by providing broader refundability, businesses are motivated to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure or make fraudulent claims. The Tax Incentive has been designed to reduce the likelihood of, and opportunities to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure. This includes requiring a close nexus between the R&D activity and the expenses claimed. The proposal to broaden eligibility for refundability includes a ‘payroll’ taxes cap on refunds to mitigate the fraud, fiscal, and integrity risks associated with paying out cash. Businesses would be entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid in 13 the relevant income year. Payments to Approved Research Providers are not included in the cap as it will be easy to verify that these payments have actually been incurred by a firm. Levy bodies are not subject to the cap due to reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable, and some may have low ‘payroll’ taxes where R&D is largely contracted out. Additional measures to mitigate risk include a sample of claims being audited each year, and an in-year approval process (included in the Act), which requires claimants to obtain approval of their R&D activities before they file a claim for their R&D tax credits. The $50,000 minimum threshold of eligible expenditure (included in the Act) is also an important measure in preventing a flood of smaller, lower-quality claims. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s “expectations for the design of regulatory system”? There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Legislation will need to be enacted to give effect to broader refundability. It is proposed that broader refundability come into effect from businesses’ 2020/21 income year. Therefore, it is proposed that the legislative changes needed to give effect to broader refundability be included in a tax bill scheduled to be introduced in June 2019, which would make changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue is leading implementation of the R&D Tax Incentive through the tax system, and will also be responsible for implementing broader refundability. Inland Revenue will identify and mitigate operational risk so that broader refundability can be delivered successfully. Inland Revenue has the necessary capabilities and capacity to implement broader refundability through its systems. 13 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 28 It is expected that broader refundability will pose minimal compliance and administrative costs. No material change is expected for the R&D supplementary return. Instead of carrying forward non-refundable R&D tax credits, most firms will be able to receive R&D tax credit refunds. Any increase in administrative costs would be negligible, because Inland Revenue intends to carry out checks and reviews on claims from year one. The existing core team of Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation officials will continue to work on claims after broader refundability is introduced. Inland Revenue, working with the other agencies, will develop guidance material on the broader refundability proposals and the impact of these on business. Since broader refundability expands on the new R&D Tax Incentive, there are no particular transition issues. Credits not refunded in respect of the 2019/20 tax year, and carried forward to the 2020/21 tax year, may be refunded in that latter year or subsequent years. The proposed eligibility criteria for broader refundability are simpler than the existing eligibility criteria that apply to limited refundability in year one. This may result in a simpler process that is easier for businesses to comply with, so may in fact lead to reduced compliance costs. Officials from all agencies (MBIE, Callaghan Innovation, and IR) have engaged, and will continue to engage, with interested stakeholders. This includes accounting firms, businesses, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ). For some taxpayers, the legislation is expected to receive Royal Assent after the beginning of their 2020/21 income years. This is unlikely to create significant issues, however, because claims will be submitted with taxpayers’ income tax returns which are due after the end of their income year, by which point it is anticipated the legislation will have been enacted. No credits will be refunded under the broader refundability rules until legislation has been enacted. 6.2 What are the implementation risks In submissions on the R&D Tax Incentive, a clear theme was the need for low compliance costs, to the extent this is possible. Feedback highlighted the need for clear guidance and education material. Businesses engaged with on the broader refundability proposals reaffirmed the need for simple rules and low compliance costs. As mentioned above, the broader refundability proposals contain eligibility criteria that are simpler than the year one limited refundability criteria. The proposed broader refundability rules do not require corporate eligibility and wage intensity tests to be satisfied, and rely on the existing (easier) rules of the R&D Tax Incentive. Allowing for broader refundability also reduces the need for continuous tracking of shareholder continuity, because once refunded credits are no longer at risk of being extinguished through breaches of shareholder continuity rules. This is particularly beneficial for smaller, R&D intensive start-ups which may regularly seek new investors to boost funding for their R&D projects. Implementation risks arise where businesses re-characterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure in order to claim a larger tax credit. The incentive for re- characterisation is greater with broader refundability, because firms can receive cash refunds (rather than having to wait until they come into profit to utilise their R&D tax credits). The policy and legislation has been developed to manage this risk, although 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 29 it cannot be eliminated. The proposed ‘payroll’ taxes cap on refunds will be backed up by existing administrative processes, such as in-year approval and IR audits. There needs to be strong uptake of the R&D Tax Incentive by businesses for the incentive to be successful. As indicated by the submissions received on the Bill, broader refundability is an important part of ensuring businesses transition to the scheme. Inland Revenue, Callaghan Innovation and MBIE officials have engaged with stakeholders on the broader refundability proposals. Guidance will also be developed by Inland Revenue, which will sit alongside the tax legislation, to provide claimants with more information about the broader refundability proposals. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The impact of the broader refundability proposals will be monitored as part of the system-level monitoring of the R&D Tax Incentive. The R&D Tax Incentive will be monitored as part of the Research, Science and Innovation portfolio (for example, through publication of the annual System Performance Report). As part of the R&D Tax Incentive, the Government is required to commission an evaluation of the incentive every five years from the commencement of the scheme. This evaluation would include an evaluation of broader refundability. In addition to the 5-year evaluation of the incentive, the business R&D surveys run by Statistics New Zealand can also be used to evaluate the R&D Tax Incentive scheme (which would include broader refundability). This will provide additional information to measure the impact of the R&D Tax Incentive and the broader refundability proposals. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? In addition to the legislated 5-year evaluation of the R&D Tax Incentive, MBIE and IR will monitor the policy in the shorter term. This is so that any issues associated with broader refundability that could compromise the integrity of the Incentive can be quickly identified and remedied. The R&D Advisory Group (RDAG) is a consultative committee comprising representatives from accounting firms and other businesses that functions as a forum for identifying and resolving problems with the R&D Tax incentive. RDAG had its first meeting in January 2019. Officials also have regular meetings and discussions with a broader range of stakeholders, at which policy and implementation issues are discussed. It is expected that RDAG and these regular stakeholder discussions will enable officials to conduct on-going monitoring and review of the impact of broader refundability. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 30 Bibliography Appelt, S., M.

Country Refundability policy Other relevant factors Australia Limits refundability to: • firms with turnover less than A$20m & • subject to a A$4m annual cap. The cap is proposed but legislation not yet passed. It is designed to reduce the costs of the scheme. The cap equates to A$10m eligible expenditure. UK – SMEs Firms in loss can cash out their tax 14 credit at a discount to their value. The UK government is currently consulting on introducing a cap relating to PAYE payments. The SME scheme is more generous than the large firm scheme. SMEs must have: • fewer than 500 employees and • turnover less than EUR 100m. UK – large For non-SMEs, the tax credit is firms paid before tax, so loss making firms benefit equally with profitable firms, subject to not exceeding the amount of PAYE and National Insurance Contribution paid. Norway Full refundability for tax paying entities. The tax credit operates with a very low cap. The maximum credit is (approx.) NZ$2m, and in most cases is NZ$1m. The tax credit is not available to non-taxpayers. Ireland Full refundability, but paid in instalments over 3 years, and subject to limits relating to amounts of corporate income tax paid or amounts of payroll tax paid. Netherlands Full refundability but limited to a firm’s payroll tax liability. Canada The credit is fully refundable for Canadian Controlled Private Corporations up to an expenditure limit of CAD 3 million. Higher expenditure is only 40% refundable. The tax credit rate is 35% up to eligible expenditure of CAD 3 million, and 15% for higher amounts. 14 Firms in loss can cash out 14.5% of surrenderable losses (these are the lesser of their trading loss and 230% of the R&D spend). 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 32 The table above demonstrates different mechanisms can be used for constraining refundability. Here are some brief comments on each of them: Eligibility for refundability based on firm characteristic (generally a measure of size such as turnover) • can target refundability to firms that, potentially, benefit most from it – ie, smaller or early stage firms • creates boundaries which might disincentivise desired behaviours – eg, a firm may choose not to grow to keep turnover below the threshold • relatively simple to understand but measurement would introduce complexity Refundability applies up to a cap; credits above cap carried forward • refundability addresses cash flow needs • less of a boundary issue so less likely to impact on firm behaviours (though incentive to increase R&D spend may diminish above cap) • relatively easy to understand and apply Limit refundability based on other taxes paid • if based on PAYE paid, more like a backstop rather than a fiscal cap as for most businesses the amount of PAYE across the whole firm will exceed 15% of the cost of R&D • useful as a possible fraud deterrent as it should ensure a firm has a tangible economic presence, and may also prevent exploitation of a loophole if that involved claiming credits for high non-wage costs • operates as some form of integrity and fiscal constraint measure, in that a firm cannot “take out” more than it is “putting in” to the tax system. • some firms may not pay PAYE – eg, staff are not employees and are either shareholders who are paid a shareholder salary, contractors or provide sweat equity. This suggests either using a wider definition of taxes paid 15 or making a provision for firms to apply for an exemption • administratively easy to understand and apply (subject to exceptions for firms without employees) Refund credits at a discount • supports loss making firms while providing an incentive to become profitable • provides firms with a choice whether to refund the credit or carry it forward • perhaps less easy to understand but relatively easy to apply Spread refundability over several years • more complex to track a firm’s position • for a firm in a long-term loss making position, will produce similar results to full year refundability after a few years • creates a tail of Government liability Target refundability based on R&D intensity This mechanism is not used by any other country for targeting refundability (though in Australia R&D intensity influences the credit rate for large enterprises) but is worth considering as it is the basis of the year one scheme. • can target refundability to those most deserving of it 15 One possibility would be to include adding withholding taxes paid. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 33 • creates a boundary that might give rise to perverse behaviours • different measures of R&D intensity may favour different types of R&D performing firms • though relatively easy to understand, adds complexity to compliance and administration. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 34 - Appendix 2 The examples below provide a practical illustration of how without refundability, firms do not receive a cash benefit from a tax credit if they are in loss or have insufficient income tax liability.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Timing To maximise the administrative efficiencies of the proposals, changes need to align with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation timelines for transferring KiwiSaver into its new administrative system. KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred into START on 1 April 2020. To ensure that policy decisions are taken, and legislation passed in this timeframe, this has created a constraint on the time available to analyse options. Despite this, officials are confident that the proposed approach would be the most effective option to address the problem definition. Consultation and testing Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers. However, as a result of time constraints, wider public consultation has not been carried out. Due to the largely technical administrative nature of the changes proposed, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. Moreover, taken as a whole, the package of options proposed would be beneficial to KiwiSaver members. There would be some compliance costs for employers, although these are expected to be small (they would be required to communicate information that they already hold to Inland Revenue, on a one-off or infrequent basis). While not consulted on directly, the RIA has been informed by employer feedback generated as part of public consultation undertaken on similar requirements that were introduced as part of the wider Business Transformation work programme. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis In relation the proposal to guarantee employer contributions, additional funding is not expected to be required. The primary caveat to this is that it assumes static behaviour. If the introduction of the proposal created a behavioural change amongst employers (that is it results in more unpaid employer contributions), this would increase the fiscal cost of the proposed approach. However, given that levels of employer contribution debt are currently comparable to levels of employee contribution debt (which are already guaranteed), this suggests that the proposal should not have a significant impact on employer’s behaviour. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 1.

As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the administration of KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred from its current system to its new administration system on 1 April 2020. This provides an opportunity to make refinements to KiwiSaver settings to improve administrative efficiency and enhance members’ experience with the scheme. The following are areas that would assist in achieving these outcomes: •facilitating the faster transfer of contributions from Inland Revenue to KiwiSaver scheme providers (and between scheme providers); and •improving information flows between members, employers, scheme providers and Inland Revenue. Transfer of contributions Part of Inland Revenue’s role as the central administrator for KiwiSaver, involves receiving KiwiSaver employer and employee contributions from employers and then forwarding these contributions on to KiwiSaver scheme providers. A reduction in the time taken to transfer contributions would improve the efficiency of the central administration of KiwiSaver. Payday filing reforms, which become compulsory from 1 April 2019, will result in Inland Revenue having employer information sooner after a payday (within 2 days of a payday for large employers and with 10 days for smaller employers). This will include information about KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions. The reforms will allow KiwiSaver employee contributions to be passed to scheme providers sooner after a member’s payday. This is because current KiwiSaver settings permit the use of Crown funds to pay employee contributions to scheme providers before contribution amounts have been paid to Inland Revenue by employers (effectively creating a Government guarantee of employee contributions). This Government guarantee does not currently extend to employer contributions. To ensure that the benefits of Inland Revenue being in receipt of earlier payday information are fully realised in relation to KiwiSaver, this RIA considers how to enable Inland Revenue to forward employer contribution amounts to scheme providers as soon as payday reporting information from employers has been received, rather than having to wait until the employer has actually paid the amount of the contribution to Inland Revenue (the current state). This RIA also considers other refinements that would facilitate the faster transfer of contributions. Improving information flows Inland Revenue is in the unique position of having on-going contact with KiwiSaver scheme providers and employers. This means Inland Revenue is able to facilitate the flow of information between relevant KiwiSaver parties (employers, providers and members) and also should have access to information to ensure that members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution entitlements. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 5 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Currently, in some instances, Inland Revenue does not have access to sufficient information to effectively police the accuracy of contribution amounts received from employers. For example, Inland Revenue does not receive information from employers about the employer superannuation contribution (ESCT) rates they are taxing employees at (ESCT is the tax payable on employer contribution amounts). However, based on ESCT amounts paid to Inland Revenue, potentially up to 63% of employers could be incorrectly calculating their employees’ ESCT rate. 1 This RIA considers refinements that could be made to improve existing KiwiSaver information flows, to help ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving their correct contribution entitlements. Consideration is also given to how information flows could be utilised to give members increased flexibility (for example whether the application process for changing an employee contribution rate could be simplified for members). 2.2 Who is affected and how? KiwiSaver members Taken as a whole, KiwiSaver members would benefit from the package of proposals – the changes would result in them earning market investment returns on contributions sooner, help ensure they are receiving the correct contribution amounts and give them additional flexibility in respect of how they can change their contribution rate. KiwiSaver scheme providers KiwiSaver scheme providers would benefit from the faster transfer of contributions, as it would result in them having more funds under management. Schemes have also indicated enabling KiwiSaver contribution rates to be changed through providers, would enhance member-provider relationships. Employers Helping to ensure members are receiving correct contribution amounts, would result in employers being required to communicate some additional information they should already hold to Inland Revenue. Employers would not be directly affected by any other proposals. Inland Revenue The proposals would enhance Inland Revenue’s central administration of KiwiSaver and create administrative savings. As implementation of the proposals would be aligned with Business Transformation, there would be no additional implementation costs. 1 Figure based on analysis of early adopters of payday filing reforms for the month of June 2018. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 6 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making?

The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: •Compliance: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. •Administration: administrative costs should be minimised as far as possible. •Equity: the option should ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving the correct contribution amounts. •Sustainability: the option should be consistent with wider KiwiSaver settings. Option One: Status quo Administration: The status quo would not reduce administrative costs. Compliance: The status quo would not reduce compliance costs. Equity: The status quo results in some KiwiSaver members not receiving employer contributions that other members are receiving (as a result of employers not paying the correct contribution amounts or not paying employer contribution amounts at all). Sustainability: As far as practical, the KiwiSaver regime settings are intended to facilitate administrative efficiency. The problem definition identifies that there are some aspects of the regime that would be more efficient if subject to further refinements. Option Two: build on payday filing reforms This option would build on the improved information available through payday filing reforms to facilitate the faster transfer of employer contributions to scheme providers and to improve the accuracy of contribution entitlements passed to scheme providers. Specifically, it would involve passing employer contribution amounts to scheme providers based on payday information received by employers, before Inland Revenue had received the contribution amount (essentially a Government guarantee, that would align with the existing treatment of employee contributions). Based on the improved information received through payday filing, this option would also align the commencement of interest paid while contributions are held by Inland Revenue with a member’s payday. 2 Administration: This option would increase administrative efficiency, as employer contributions could be passed to scheme providers sooners. However, as it does not include other administrative enhancements to KiwiSaver, savings may not be maximised. Compliance: This option should make it easier for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver accounts with the KiwiSaver contributions recorded on their payslips (as employer contributions would be passed in full to KiwiSaver providers sooner after the member payday). Consequently, this should also reduce the level of contacts from members to scheme providers. Equity: This option would ensure that all KiwiSaver members receive the employer 2 Currently, interest on employee contributions commences on the 15 th of the month the amount was deducted from the member’s salary or wages and interest on employer contributions commences on the 1 st of the month the contribution amount was paid to Inland Revenue. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 8 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE contributions amounts they are entitled to. It would also improve the accuracy of interest paid on contributions by Inland Revenue (the current rules result in under and over payment of interest on employee contributions and under payment of interest on employer contributions). However, this option would not address situations where a member’s employer is incorrectly calculating contributions amounts. Sustainability: This option would ensure that the benefit of information obtained via payday filing reforms were fully utilised in the KiwiSaver context. It would also align the treatment of employer contributions with employee contributions and other PAYE deductions (which are guaranteed). Option Three: Additional transfer, information and administrative refinements In addition to the changes proposed under option 2, this option would use the opportunity created by Business Transformation, to make further refinements to KiwiSaver settings. Refinements aimed at facilitating faster transfers would be to reduce the initial KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months (this would mean initial contributions could be transferred to providers a month earlier) and to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and member information, when a member decides to transfer to a new scheme from 35 to 10 days. The later change would only impact non-default providers, as arrangements with default providers already require them to complete transfers in 10-days. Information flows would be utilised to ensure members were receiving their correct contribution amounts, by requiring employers to provide information to Inland Revenue about the income KiwiSaver contributions have been calculated from 3 and the ESCT rate used. This information would be provided in respect of new employees and existing employees where the information had changed. To recognise that members will have different first points of contact for information on their KiwiSaver account, this option also proposes that members should be able to apply to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue (in addition to their employer). As a further administrative refinement, is also proposed that the 3-month grace period – that a person who has been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver has to gain New Zealand residence before their account is shut – be removed. This period has not operated as intended and is not utilised by members. The below analysis of this option against the assessment criteria, identifies impacts that are additional to those set out in the analysis of option 2 above. Administration: Reducing the provisional period and the removing the 3-month grace period would increase administrative efficiency. Compliance: The option would reduce compliance costs for members looking to change contribution rates. There would be some additional compliance costs for scheme providers and employers (relating to the proposals to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and information to a new provider when a member transfers schemes and the additional employer information requirements, respectively). These compliance costs are expected to 3 Some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE are exempt for the purposes of calculating KiwiSaver contribution amounts. Examples includes the value of accommodation and a benefit from an employer share scheme. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 9 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 8 IN CONFIDENCE be small. Equity: The additional employer information should make it easier for Inland Revenue to identify situations where contribution amounts have been calculated or taxed incorrectly. Based on this information it would be possible to follow-up with employers, so these issues could be resolved sooner and would not arise again. Sustainability: This option identifies enhancements to KiwiSaver administrative settings in addition to the changes proposed in option 2 – to maximise improvements to KiwiSaver it would be logical to implement all changes. Implementing a package of changes is also more sustainable in terms of the legislation (as opposed to making singular refinements to KiwiSaver legislative settings on an on-going basis). Other options not considered Aligning payment of KiwiSaver contributions with an employee’s payday As part of the work on the payday filing reforms, consideration was given to the option of employers being required to pay PAYE and other deductions from salary or wages (including KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions) to Inland Revenue to align with an employee’s payday. If employers were required to pay KiwiSaver contribution amounts to Inland Revenue sooner after their employees’ payday, this would facilitate the faster transfer of these contributions to scheme providers. However, the decision was made only to require employers to file information sooner after a member’s payday, as feedback from employers was that requiring them to pay the actual monetary amounts of deductions (including KiwiSaver contributions) in a shorter timeframe would be too onerous comply with. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 10 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 3. This package of refinements is comprised of the following proposals: •the Crown funding the payment of employer contribution amounts passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers until these amounts are received from the employer (essentially a Government guarantee of employer contributions); •changing the date the calculation of interest on employer and employee contributions commences, to align with the pay date a member’s employer has reported; •reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months; •reducing the maximum period an old scheme provider has to share information and transfer funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes, from 35-days to 10-days; •allowing members to change contribution rates through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, rather than only through their employer; •removing the 3-month grace period for members who have been incorrectly automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence; and •requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with KiwiSaver information about a member’s employer superannuation contribution tax rate and the income their contributions are calculated from. Of the options considered this package would be most effective in facilitating the faster transfer of contributions to (and between) KiwiSaver scheme providers, and reducing on- going administrative costs for Inland Revenue. It is also the most coherent and equitable option for KiwiSaver members as it will help ensure members are receiving the correct contribution amounts and these contribution entitlements are being passed to scheme providers. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 11 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 4 A decrease in interest payable on employee contributions would be expected to be offset by an increase in interest on employer contributions for employees with a payday between the 15 th and 23 rd of the month. Affected parties Comment Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members, scheme providers and employers) KiwiSaver members Aligning KiwiSaver interest payments to a member’s payday would result in a reduction in interest paid on employee contributions for some members with paydays after the 15 th of the month. The impact of this would be small given interest is paid at a rate of 0.91% per annum and would be offset by their contributions earning market investment returns sooner and an increase in interest on employer contributions in many cases. 4 Scheme providers Reducing the time scheme providers have to send members’ information and funds to a new provider in scheme transfer situations from 35-days to 10- days would have compliance costs for non-default providers, who are not already required to comply with the 10- day transfer time. Feedback from providers indicates this would be manageable and would align with industry best practice. Employers Employers would need to provide information on KiwiSaver income and employee’s ESCT rates to Inland Revenue. Compliance costs should be small, as employers would already need to hold this information to accurately calculate contribution amounts and the information would only need to be provided about new employees or existing employees where the Low.

For new employees the information would be provided as part of employee on- boarding processes and it is expected that updates to this information for existing employees would be infrequent. 5 Regulators (Inland Revenue) The proposals do not require additional funding. Inland Revenue already writes-off amounts of unpaid employer contributions. For the financial year ending 30 June 2018 the write-off of employer contributions was $2.6 million.

Costs associated with calculating employee contributions from a payday would be negligible (as current under and over payments would broadly offset). contributions being transferred to scheme providers sooner (from Inland Revenue and potentially from other schemes not currently subject to the 10- day transfer rule), which would increase the funds under their management and fees chargeable.

(Currently, where it appears employers may have calculated contributions incorrectly, Inland Revenue will contact the employer to obtain the relevant information). Low.

There is the potential that the proposal to guarantee employer contributions could have a behavioural impact on employers - that is employer’s may be less likely to pay employer contributions. (While only $2.6 million in employer contribution debt was written-off for the financial year ending 30 June 2018, approximately $2 billion in employer contributions were passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers during this same year). Current levels of employer and employee contribution debt are broadly comparable (as at 30 June 2018, employer contribution debt since the commencement of KiwiSaver was $18 million, while employee contribution debt was $24 million). This suggests that the existing guarantee of employee contributions has had limited behavioural impact on employers and that introducing a guarantee of employer contributions would also have a minimal behavioural impact. Moreover, Inland Revenue has processes to monitor and recover unpaid amounts of employer contributions from employers, which would remain in place after the introduction of this proposal. These include interest and penalties available under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment and the Treasury have been consulted on the proposals and support them. The proposals also reflect feedback on the operation of the KiwiSaver regime from the Financial Markets Authority. Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers (in the form of Business Transformation focused co-design workshops). Providers are supportive of the proposals. General consultation with KiwiSaver members has not been undertaken. On a whole, the package of changes should be beneficial for KiwiSaver members and given the technical nature of the proposed changes, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. The only proposal to directly impact employers would be for them to communicate to Inland Revenue the income amounts a member’s KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from and the member’s ESCT rate. This is information the employer already needs to hold, and they would only be required to provide it to Inland Revenue in relation to new employees or existing employees where the information has changed. While consultation with employers has not been carried out on these specific requirements, the proposal has been informed by the extensive public consultation that has been undertaken as part of the wider Business Transformation programme. In particular, feedback on the discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST: a Government discussion document which was released in November 2015 and sought feedback on the payday filing reforms. This included, proposals aimed at refining the new employee on-boarding process, by merging PAYE and KiwiSaver reporting requirements and requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with additional information about new employees – such as date of birth and other employee details. Although not universally supported, in consultation these new information requirements received majority support from employers. The additional 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 15 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 14 IN CONFIDENCE information requirements proposed in this RIA, would support the shifts in employee on- boarding processes. Before the proposals are implemented there will be the opportunity for public consultation, as employers and KiwiSaver members would be able to make submissions on the omnibus taxation Bill the legislative changes are included in. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 16 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals would require amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus taxation Bill. To align with the transfer of the administration of KiwiSaver from its current operating system into its new operating system, the changes would come into effect from 1 April 2020. The Minister of Revenue would make an announcement, on the contents of the proposed omnibus taxation Bill (including these proposals) when it is introduced in the House. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Aligning implementation of the proposals with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, would mean the cost of system changes would be absorbed into Business Transformation. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 17 of 64 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes of the proposals pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Inland Revenue collects KiwiSaver data which could be used to assess the effectiveness of the changes in facilitating the faster transfer of employer contributions and enhancing information flows. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? No formal review is planned. However, the final step in the GTTP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. All KiwiSaver scheme providers have an on-going relationship with Inland Revenue, which includes an annual meeting to discuss policy and operational issues that have arisen over the past year. This would provide an opportunity for scheme providers to give feedback about the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Page 18 of 64 | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Student Loans: Limiting Student Loan Scheme rules relating to the 2013 and prior years S ec ti on 1: G ene ral i nfo r ma ti on Purpose This analysis and advice informs key policy decisions to be taken by the Minister of Revenue ahead of final decisions by Cabinet on whether to proceed with a policy change to reduce the need to amend pre-2013 student loan obligations after April 2020. Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Summary. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis are as follows. Time to enact legislation As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the Student Loan Scheme will be moved to new systems and processes with effect from April 2020. This transfer provides an opportunity to reduce the current complexity of the scheme caused by having to administer rules for previous years that have subsequently been repealed. Any legislative changes that are to apply from 2020 would need to be introduced into Parliament by mid-2019. The timeframe to enact legislation has reduced the time available to develop and analyse the options and to consult with stakeholders. No consultation with external stakeholders Inland Revenue has not consulted with affected borrowers as the number of borrowers likely to be impacted by the proposed option is small and the legislative process provides an opportunity for the public to make submissions on the proposals as the Bill progresses through Parliament. Scale of the problem The scale of the problem in terms of the impact of the status quo on borrower compliance has not been accurately identified. Research suggests that borrowers do not understand how the student loan rules for previous years impact any changes their loan obligations. Impact of proposals on the student loan valuation Proposals that have a material impact on the valuation require a Budget bid and would need to be prioritised alongside other bids for Government funding. In order to proceed with reducing the complexity of changes to prior years’ repayment obligations, officials focussed on options that would not materially impact the student loan valuation. None of the limitations materially affect the analysis.

The underlying problem is the complexity of the student loan rules relating to previous years that no longer feature in the current scheme. This complexity means there is a lack of understanding by borrowers of the rules prior to 1 April 2013. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the Student Loan Scheme will move to new systems and processes in April 2020. This transfer process provides an opportunity to make legislative changes to reduce the complexity of the student loan rules prior to April 2013, make it cheaper and easier to make changes to the scheme in the future, reduce compliance costs (by increasing understanding of rules) for borrowers, and increase consistency between tax and student loans. April 2013 has been chosen as this date captures 93% of all changes to student loan obligations for previous years and is the point where the rules are largely the same as apply today. The Student Loan Scheme was introduced in 1992 and is governed by the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, and loan contracts between the government and each borrower. A significant number of changes have been made to the Student Loan Scheme since its introduction with changes being made in 21 of the last 26 years. Under current legislation, the importance of accurate borrower’s obligations outweighs compliance and administrative costs. For example, either the borrower or Inland Revenue can seek to amend a prior year’s loan obligation, regardless of the amount of money involved. A repayment obligation is changed where an error is identified in the calculation of a borrower’s repayment obligation for a year. Unlike income tax, which generally has a period of 4 years from the date a return is filed to make changes to a tax obligation, student loan obligations can be changed back to the date the loan was taken out, which could be as far back as 1992 when the loan scheme was introduced. Therefore, where a student loan obligation for a previous year changes, the rules relating to that year apply. This requirement to retain rules for previous years has increased the complexity of the Student Loan Scheme administration, reduced the overall customer experience by making it difficult for borrowers to understand changes to their loan balance, and increased the administration costs. A significant number of the rules relating to previous years have since been repealed. Decisions on whether to simplify the Student Loan Scheme are required by March in order for any legislative changes to be enacted in time for an April 2020 application. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Borrowers affected are those whose obligations prior to 2013 are amended. In the 2018 year, of the 700,000 student loan borrowers, less than 0.2 percent had their repayment obligations prior to April 2013 amended (1,314) resulting in increased repayment obligations of $1.2 million. The number of borrows affected is expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s efforts to reduce the number of outstanding tax returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 Page 20 of 64 | 3 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The major constraint on our analysis is the time to enact legislation. Inland Revenue is part way through a multi-year transformation programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, processes, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. Options to simplify the prior years’ student loan rules require a legislative change. For legislation to be enacted by April 2020, changes would need to be introduced into Parliament in mid-2019 and therefore Cabinet decisions on policy changes are required in March 2019. The timeframe to enact legislation has reduced the time available to consult with stakeholders. Inland Revenue does not intend to consult separately with affected borrowers. However, mitigating factors are that the number of borrowers likely to be impacted by the preferred option is small and public submissions can be made on the proposals at the Select Committee stage as the Bill progresses though Parliament. Another constraint is the impact on the student loan valuation. Options that have an impact on the valuation would require a Budget bid as part of Budget 2019. These options would have to be prioritised together with other Government initiatives. Officials do not propose pursuing options that materially impact on the student loan valuation. S ec ti on 3: O p ti ons i d enti fi ca ti on 3.1 What options have been considered? Transferring the Student Loan Scheme to the new systems and processes provides an opportunity to reduce the administrative complexity of the Student Loan Scheme. Reducing the complexity of the Student Loan Scheme can only be resolved through legislative changes. Officials have considered non-legislative options, such as manually undertaking changes to prior year obligations, but these options may reduce but will not resolve the complexity issue. Therefore, the options proposed to simplify the Student Loan Scheme are legislative only. The options considered are retaining the status quo and two options to simplify the Student Loan Scheme rules relating to the 2013 and prior years. The policy objective is to implement the Student Loan Scheme into the new systems and processes within the timeline (April 2020) and reduce the complexity of the scheme, whilst ensuring equity among borrowers, and no material impact on the student loan valuation. In considering the options, officials evaluated the options against the following criteria: • equity between borrowers (current versus past borrowers, compliant versus non- compliant borrowers, and New Zealand based versus overseas based borrowers); • the impact of the complexity of the scheme on both the compliance costs of borrowers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue; 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 Page 21 of 64 | 4 IN CONFIDENCE •the impact of the options on the valuation of the Student Loan Scheme; and •the cost and time to make policy changes in the future. Option One: Status quo – implement the rules back to 1992 This option involves implementing all the prior years’ student loan rules back to 1992 into new systems and processes. However, as student loans repayments for New Zealand based borrows are based on income for tax purposes, and as income tax generally has a period of 4 years for making changes to tax obligations, there will be no income generated student loan changes prior to 2013. Changes to loan obligations prior to 2013 would be those where fraud or non-filing of tax returns is involved and it is cost effective to do so, changes in residence status, or changes due to other student loan rules such as repayment holiday entitlement, or entitlement to the voluntary repayment bonus. This option would have no material impact on the student loan valuation and retains the current equity among borrowers. However, it retains the current complex rules prior to April 2013 which would need to be built into new systems and processes. This complexity imposes administration costs on the government and would impact very few borrowers.. Also, future policy changes should still accommodate the rules prior to 1 April 2013. This option is not preferred by officials. Option Two: No new changes to repayment obligations prior to April 2013 Under this option the student loan rules would only be incorporated into new systems and processes back to 1 April 2013. This date was chosen as it captures almost all changes to student loan repayment obligations and the rules applying from April 2013 are largely the same as apply today. The rules relating to policy changes prior to 2013 will not be built into new systems and processes. Changes to repayment obligations prior to this date would only occur in exceptional circumstances such as cases of tax or student loan fraud or non- filing of tax returns showing a significant liability. These cases would be processed manually. This option simplifies the current rules, removes the need to build the rules prior to 1 April 2013 into the new systems and processes, and reduces both compliance and administrative costs. However, there are instances where equity between compliant and non-compliant borrowers would not be retained, such as where a borrower who Inland Revenue considers is New Zealand based is found to have gone overseas prior to April 2013 without notifying Inland Revenue as required in their loan contract. Under this option the borrower would only have interest imposed back to 1 April 2013 not the earlier date when they became overseas based. This option would reduce the cost and time to implement policy changes in the future as changes would not have to accommodate rules prior to April 2013. However, it would also have a material impact on the student loan valuation and for this reason is not preferred by officials. Option Three: Limited changes to loan obligations in relation to the 2013 and prior years (preferred option) This option would incorporate the student loan rules into new systems and processes back to 1 April 2013. For periods prior to 1 April 2013, changes to repayment obligations would only occur where a borrower changes their residence status, for example, Inland Revenue receive new information that a borrower had gone overseas, or in cases of unfiled returns where it is cost effective to do so, or fraud. Where a borrower’s residency status changes, interest would be calculated on their loan balance from the date the borrower’s status changed at the interest rates that applied in the relevant years. Changes in the borrower’s repayment obligation for the period up to 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 Page 22 of 64 | 5 IN CONFIDENCE April 2013 would be ignored. However, changes to obligations from 1 April 2013 onwards would be assessed as they are now. In cases of fraud, or unfiled tax returns where the obligation is material, a simplified calculation would be used by applying the student loan repayment rate to the amended income figure. A one-off penalty may also apply to penalise the non-compliant action. Late payment interest will only be imposed on adjusted repayment obligations from 1 April 2013 onwards. Imposing late payment interest on repayment obligations for the period 1992 to 2013 can disproportionately increase the debt owed to Inland Revenue to the point where the borrower cannot repay the debt and disengages with the Student Loan Scheme. Adjustments to residency status and the associated interest impact together with situations where under-declared income or fraud is involved have the greatest impact on the loan balance and time to repay the loan. This option incorporates these situations. This option simplifies the calculation of repayment obligations prior to April 2013, removes the need to build these rules into the new systems and processes, reduces the complexity of the scheme and therefore reduces both compliance costs and administrative costs. As this option takes account of residency changes and applies the historical loan interest rates, equity between compliant and non-compliant overseas-based borrowers would be preserved. Also, the inclusion of borrowers who fail to file returns of a material value or commit fraud also retains equity between compliant and non-compliant borrowers. This option has no material impact on the student loan valuation and reduces the time and cost of making policy changes in the future as changes would not have to accommodate rules prior to April 2013. This option is preferred by officials. How each option would work The following examples illustrate the differences in treatment of a borrower under each option. Example 1 A borrower went overseas in 2008, did not advise Inland Revenue and was not picked up through the passenger movement match with NZ Customs. The borrower has been treated as New Zealand-based and therefore not charged loan interest. In 2021 the borrower returns to New Zealand. Inland Revenue identifies that the borrower has been overseas for the preceding years and updates the borrower’s residency status for the time they were away. Under Option One, the borrower’s residency status will be changed with effect from the date they went overseas in 2008 and loan interest, repayment obligations and late payment interest would be imposed from that date. Under Option Three, the borrower’s residency status will be changed with effect from the date they went overseas in 2008 and loan interest will be imposed from that date. However, repayment obligations and late payment interest would only be imposed from 1 April 2013 onwards. Under Option Two no changes would be made to the borrower’s residency status prior to April 2013 but loan interest, repayment obligations, and late payment interest would be imposed from 1 April 2013 onwards. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 Page 23 of 64 | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Example 2 In 2009 the voluntary repayment bonus feature was introduced which rewarded borrowers for making voluntary repayments above what they were required to repay. The bonus applied for 5 years (2009-2013) before being repealed. In 2020 a borrower identifies an error in the calculation of their voluntary repayment bonus for the 2010 year although their income remains unchanged. They apply to have the voluntary repayment bonus recalculated for the 2010 year. Under Option One, the borrower would be able to receive the bonus but under Options Two and Three, they would not. We do not expect lack of retrospective entitlement to the voluntary repayment bonus to be a significant issue, given that few people took it up and there has been a long period during which any affected borrowers could have sought a recalculation of their entitlement. Example 3 A taxpayer has committed fraud through not declaring a large source of income for the 2008 year. This has implications for both their income tax and student loan obligations. The four-year period for making changes to an income tax obligation after a return is filed does not apply where fraud is involved. Therefore, the Commissioner amends the taxpayer’s income tax liability for the 2008 year. Under Options One, Two, and Three, the student loan repayment obligation would also be changed. Under Options One and Two, the student loan repayment obligation would be calculated on both the adjusted income for the year and the relevant student loan rules for that year. Under Option Three, the repayment obligation would only be calculated on the adjusted income and late payment interest would only apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Officials consider Option Three to be the preferred option. This option addresses the policy problem set out in 2.1 and has advantages in terms of ensuring equity between compliant borrowers and non-compliant overseas borrowers, those who under declare income, or those who commit fraud. It also reduces the complexity of the scheme and therefore makes it easier for borrowers to understand their loan obligations and reduces the administration costs for Inland Revenue over the status quo. This option has no material impact on the student loan valuation and reduces the time and cost of making policy changes in the future.

This number is expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s efforts in recent years to reduce the number of outstanding student loan returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. Regulated parties (affected borrowers) 1 The cost to borrowers in reduced accuracy of prior years’ obligations may increase or decrease a borrower’s repayment liability and reduce or increase the time period to repay the loan accordingly. Changes to repayment obligations by Inland Revenue would tend to increase a borrower’s repayment liability. Borrowers not being able to receive the voluntary repayment that they may have been entitled to prior to this change (pre- April 2020). The extent of the impact is dependent on the amount of the assessed obligation, but any impact on a borrower’s repayment time period is expected to be low. Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) None None Wider government None None Other parties None None Total Monetised Cost Financial impact for borrowers Borrowers face either an increased or decreased repayment obligation Non-monetised costs Compliance costs for borrowers Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (affected borrowers) Ongoing compliance costs savings for borrowers affected by a prior year’s repayment obligation. The proposal reduces the need for affected borrowers to understand how the old rules impact their student loan liability. By way of example, borrowers with changes to prior year’s obligations will no longer be required to understand the impact of the voluntary repayment bonus or 3-year repayment holiday on their loan balance. However, they may have had a higher loan balance through not receiving the voluntary repayment bonus. Borrowers who may have been required to pay late payment interest due to a changed repayment obligation prior to 1 April 2013 would not be required to pay this after this change (April 2020) Low/Medium depending on the extent of the changes to repayment obligations and number of years involved Low 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 Page 25 of 64 | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Two different borrowers may be treated differently in the same situation, depending on when the change is identified. For example, assuming no fraud or non-filing of a material amount is involved, a change in a borrower’s income that occurred prior to April 2013 would be included in the borrower’s repayment obligation if the change was identified last year but would not occur if the change was identified after April 2020. The amended repayment obligation would result in the time to repay the loan being varied slightly either earlier (if the repayment obligation increases) or later (if the repayment obligation reduces). The greater the adjustment in repayment obligation the greater the impact on the loan repayment period. Most changes to borrowers’ obligations occur in the first 3-4 years following the tax year. After that the number of changes falls dramatically. In the 2018 year the number of borrowers who had changes to their repayment obligations for the 2013 or prior years was 1,314, and the total increased repayments obligations was $1.2 million (although the amount expected to be collected is less than this). These figures are expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s continued efforts to reduce the number of outstanding tax returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. Regulators (Inland Revenue) Reduced implementation costs for IR. Reduced ongoing costs of changing prior years’ obligations, training staff and retaining administrative processes. These costs will form part of the savings from Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme.

The timeframe to enact legislation and implement student loans into the new systems and processes has limited Inland Revenue’s ability to consult with those borrowers affected by the preferred option. This means that the problem identification, options identification, and impacts have been generated by officials based on the information available. It is recognised that consultation with those affected by a change is an important part of the Generic Tax Policy Process. However, mitigating factors are that the number of borrowers likely to be impacted in future by the preferred option is small and expected to reduce in future. Also, there will be an opportunity for the public to submit on the measure during the Select Committee process and feedback will be considered at that point. The Ministry of Education have been consulted in developing the options and agree with the recommended proposal. S ec ti on 6: I mpl e men ta ti on a nd op era ti on 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? It is intended that the preferred option be included in the next available taxation bill which is expected to be introduced into Parliament later in the year. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the operation of this preferred option and this will form part of its business as usual function. The preferred option will reduce the implementation risks associated with transferring the Student Loan Scheme from the current computer platform to the new systems and processes. It is proposed that legislation apply to limit changes in repayment obligations for the 2013 or prior years where the change occurs on or after April 2020. This will enable sufficient preparation time for Inland Revenue to implement the changes. The proposed approach will be included in the commentary on the taxation bill and consultation by select committee is expected to provide an opportunity for interested parties to express their views on this proposed change. S ec ti on 7: M oni to ri ng, eval uati o n and r evi ew 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed legislation in the first 12 months of operation. If we identify anything that suggests the legislation is not operating as intended, then we will undertake a review. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 Page 27 of 64 | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Inland Revenue currently have metrics to monitor the administration of the Student Loan Scheme. Work is progressing on designing the new system and processes and although work on the metrics to enable ongoing monitoring of volumes of changes to repayment obligations prior to 2013 has not commenced yet, officials expect the new systems and processes to replicate the existing metrics. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified from the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 Page 28 of 64 Coversheet: Research and Development Tax Incentive - Refundability Advising agencies Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Inland Revenue (IR) The Treasury Callaghan Innovation Decision sought Broader refundability for the R&D Tax Incentive Proposing Ministers Hon Dr Megan Woods (Minister for Research, Science and Innovation) Hon Stuart Nash (Minister of Revenue) Summary: Problem and proposed approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act (the Act), implements an R&D Tax Incentive in New Zealand. The R&D Tax Incentive applies from 1 April 2019 for most businesses. Under the scheme, firms can receive a tax credit equal to 15% of their eligible R&D expenditure. Profitable firms will be able to use this tax credit to reduce their income tax liability. The Act allows for certain firms that have little or no income tax to pay to receive a R&D tax credit refund of up to $255,000 per income year. Credits that are not refunded can be carried forward to future income years provided shareholder continuity criteria are met. The limited refundability rules in the Act are based on the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme. Under these rules, eligibility for refunds is restricted to unlisted companies that meet a 20% R&D wage intensity test and do not derive non-dividend exempt income. These criteria mean that many businesses will not be eligible for refundable tax credits under the R&D Tax Incentive. Partnerships, trusts, listed companies, and companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test will be excluded. Additionally, certain atypical organisations, such as levy bodies, some Māori entities, charities, and local authorities, will be excluded. It is desirable to ensure the law provides clarity as to whether these entities should benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive through the design of a more comprehensive refundability policy. The limited timeframe for developing the Act meant it was not possible to design broad refundability rules for year one. The Government has committed to developing a more comprehensive policy for refundability to apply from year two of the Tax Incentive. The rationale for the R&D Tax Incentive and the importance of raising business expenditure on R&D (BERD) was explained in the previous Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) for the R&D Tax Incentive (http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2018-ria-rdtc-bill/overview). This RIS is focused on options to broaden the refundability of the R&D Tax Incentive. If refundability is not broadened, it is expected that the Tax Incentive will not be as effective as intended at incentivising additional R&D. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 1 3. Page 29 of 64 Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? Broadening eligibility for refundability The proposed approach is to change the existing limited refundability rules so that R&D tax credit refunds are available to more businesses. It is proposed that all businesses would be eligible for refundability, irrespective of their legal form or whether they are listed. The 20% wage intensity test would also be removed. We expect that making the tax credit available to more R&D-performing firms (and higher incentives for firms to engage in R&D) will increase the amount of R&D undertaken, which will in turn result in an increase in knowledge creation, employment, and labour productivity growth. Knowledge created by R&D flows between firms because of worker mobility, product imitation and reverse engineering. This means firms do not capture the full benefits of their R&D and so they underinvest relative to the socially optimal level. This is why most governments have a policy that will stimulate firms to undertake more R&D. Providing refundable tax credits will enhance the effectiveness of the R&D Tax Incentive at stimulating growth in BERD, because it provides cash closer to the point when firms, particularly R&D intensive firms in the early stages of their development, are undertaking their R&D. This means the tax credit is more likely to incentivise the performance of additional R&D by businesses, which is the goal of the policy. Broadening the refundability available from that provided for year one of the R&D Tax Incentive has always been the intent, and will broaden the reach and effect of the R&D Tax Incentive. Ensuring integrity and managing fraud risk In addition to extending refundability to all businesses, it is proposed to remove the existing $255,000 cap on refundability. Instead, it is proposed to limit the amount of credits refundable to businesses through a cap based on the amount of payroll taxes paid by each business. This payroll cap would include PAYE, fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT) paid by a business. A payroll cap will help ensure the integrity of the scheme is maintained. It is necessary to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims for R&D tax credit refunds which have been problematic (along with an associated fiscal risk) in other jurisdictions with refundable R&D tax credits. The payroll cap would not apply to limit refundability of R&D tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers because it will be easy to verify that these payments have been incurred by a business. The payroll cap would not apply to limit the R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. Levy bodies are empowered to collect levies by statute, definitely have an economic presence in New Zealand, and consequently pose a reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 2 Page 30 of 64 Exempt income recipients Recipients of exempt income are currently ineligible for limited refundability, unless the only exempt income they receive is from dividends. Without refundability, entities that only derive exempt income, such as charities, are unable to receive any cash benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive. This is because they do not have any income tax to pay. As these entities are outside the tax system, it is proposed that they should not benefit further from incentives provided from within the tax system and that they should be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. It is proposed that an exception apply for levy bodies, however, which do not receive the same tax concessions as charities (such as donee tax credit status, GST and FBT concessions). The R&D performed by and funded through levy bodies is fundamentally business R&D. Accordingly, it is proposed that levy bodies are eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive (including refundability), even if they receive exempt income. Further details and the implications of this proposal for particular atypical organisations (including charities, Māori businesses, and local authorities) are discussed further at 3.2. Section B: Summary impacts - benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Businesses in tax loss, or with insufficient income tax liability to fully utilise non- refundable tax credits, will be the main beneficiaries from broader refundability. Refundability can be particularly beneficial for young, innovative firms, at the stage of investing in developing and launching their products (Appelt et al., 2016). The population of firms performing R&D and in a tax loss position is estimated at 750-1200. These are the expected beneficiaries. Under current rules only 350-65 0 firms are expected to qualify for refundability, and of those 65-130 are expected to hit t he cap on refundability . Partnerships, trusts, listed companies, companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test, and atypical organisations such as levy bodies and some Māori business entities will also benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive through the design of a more comprehensive refundability policy. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 3 Page 31 of 64 Where do the costs fall? Fiscal costs The budget for the Tax Incentive provides for the fiscal cost of full refundability. In Budget 2018 the Government appropriated $1,020 million over the first four fiscal years for the R&D Tax Incentive. On 10 September 2018, Cabinet agreed to reprioritise the remaining funding ($528 million) already allocated for Growth Grants over the same period \[CAB-18-MIN-0434 refers\]. We anticipate that allowing broad refundability will increase the take-up of the Tax Incentive compared to limited refundability. This in turn will increase the R&D expenditure performed by firms, and the amount claimed under the Tax Incentive. These fiscal costs will be borne directly by Government and indirectly by the taxpayer. Additional fiscal cost due to broader refundability, compared with the limited refundability available in year one of the R&D Tax incentive, could be for the below reasons: •Increased R&D activity from existing R&D performer s •F irms new to R&D enter the schem e We have estimated the fiscal costs of the R&D Tax Incentive with full refundability to be approximately $1,345 million over the first four fiscal years for the R&D Tax Incentive (from when it comes into effect on 1 April 2019 through until 30 June 2022). The model used to prepare these estimates assumed that firms claim the full amount of the eligible R&D expenditure to which they are entitled in the year in which it is incurred. More specifically, it assumes that firms in loss claim the full amount of the Tax Incentive, even without full refundability. Anecdotal evidence from overseas jurisdictions shows that those that have allowed more generous refundability have experienced much greater rise in the costs of their R&D tax incentives. In Australia, R&D in the part of the scheme that was refundable (which applied to small-and-medium enterprises) grew at approximately 15 percent per annum whereas R&D in the non-refundable part experienced no growth. We cannot extrapolate exactly from the Australian experience to New Zealand because in New Zealand broad refundability will be available to all businesses, regardless of size (subject to exclusions discussed above). Moreover, without further analysis, it is not possible to conclude that the presence of refundability drove all the higher growth in Australia; a number of other factors are likely to have also contributed. Nevertheless, if New Zealand were to experience R&D growth equivalent to the refundable part of the Australian scheme, we have estimated that it might add approximately $40 million (over the period of the appropriation) to our estimates of the fiscal costs of the R&D Tax Incentive. Administration costs The increased attractiveness of the regime will increase legitimate claims but may also increase fraudulent claims. The increased risk of fraudulent claims may mean more administrative costs to ensure the legitimacy of claims. However, as the R&D Tax Incentive scheme has already been designed with relatively thorough checks on the R&D activities that are the subject of the claims, it is expected that any increase in administrative costs resulting from broader refundability will be negligible. Compliance costs Compared with the limited refundability rules in year one, compliance costs to firms 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 4 Page 32 of 64 under broader refundability should either decrease or stay the same. The year one refundability rules use the existing corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria from the R&D tax loss cash-out rules, which are relatively complex. The proposed eligibility rules from year two are simpler, so compliance costs could decrease under the proposals. In addition, more firms will have their credits fully refunded rather than carrying them forward. This reduces the complexity of tracking historic credits and testing for continuity breaches. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Risks There are three main risks associated with broader refundability which must be considered as part of the design. These are fiscal risk, fraud risk, and integrity risk. Fiscal risk Overseas experience indicates that R&D and hence fiscal cost growth is faster for the refundable parts of R&D tax credit schemes. This is not a risk in and of itself, because an increase in expenditure because of increased R&D would go towards achieving the objective of the incentive. A ‘payroll’ cap is proposed to help mitigate fiscal risk associated with illegitimate R&D tax credit claims. If the Government decided to constrain expenditure on the incentive in future, the tax credit rate of 15% could be adjusted downwards. Fraud risk This is the risk of a person deliberately attempting to extract money from the tax system dishonestly. Broader refundability provides additional incentives to perpetrate fraud and allows additional opportunities to perpetrate fraud. It is more difficult to recover money paid out in cash via a refund than to cancel a tax credit. To minimise the risk of fraudulent claims, the proposed ‘payroll’ cap ensures the existence of a business and its economic presence are verified before a R&D tax credit refund is paid to the business. The risk of fraudulent claims will also be mitigated through the following steps: • An in-year approval process (included in the Act), which requires claimants to obtain approval of their R&D activities before they file a claim for their R&D tax credits. • A $50,000 minimum threshold of eligible expenditure 1 (included in the Act). Experience in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, indicates that without a minimum threshold there can be a flood of smaller, lower-quality tax credit claims. Integrity risk This is the risk that compliance with the R&D Tax Incentive scheme may deteriorate if it is perceived to be abused by some claimants. This risk can be mitigated by ensuring the Tax Incentive is seen to be robust. In-year approval (included in the Act) and the proposed ‘payroll’ cap should help mitigate this integrity risk. Learning from overseas experience Most overseas R&D tax credit schemes with refundability have some constraints, 1 There is an exception for R&D activities carried out by an Approved Research Provider. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 5 Page 33 of 64 such as capping the amount of refundable tax credit to the amount of other taxes paid by a business (such as PAYE paid on behalf of employees). Appendix 1 summarises the policies applied in other OECD countries that provide refunds and describes the strengths and drawbacks of each policy. There is no uniformity as to how constraints are applied, but some broad observations are: •Some constraint on refundability is the norm. A system with no restrictions o n refundability would be an outlier amongst OECD countries. •The different ways in which refundability is limited often reflect differences in the u nderlying tax incentive scheme . •Some countries limit refundability to SMEs and start-ups. •It is relatively common to limit refunds by reference to other taxes paid by the firm. A common approach in other jurisdictions is to limit refunds to the amount paid in other taxes such as PAYE. 2 This ensures a firm has a tangible economic presence in the country where the claim is being made, the amount refunded is commensurate to activity in the jurisdiction and it reduces the risk that the claim is made by a non- existent entity. Considering the risks associated with refundability and learnings from overseas, we propose broadening the refundability available in year one but having some constraints to mitigate risk. Constraints to mitigate the risks associated with broader refundability The proposal to broaden eligibility for refundability includes a ‘payroll’ cap on refunds to mitigate the fraud, fiscal, and integrity risks associated with paying out cash. It is proposed that all firms are entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (proposed payroll cap). 3 The proposed payroll cap would not apply to limit tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers. The proposed payroll cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. The proposed payroll cap is designed to prevent refundable tax credits being paid out to firms who are fraudulently claiming the tax credit. Limiting R&D tax credit payments to the amount of PAYE paid by a firm, as is done in many overseas jurisdictions, is a simple and unobtrusive measure but overlooks that some firms may legitimately pay little PAYE. 4 Consequently, it is proposed that additional payroll taxes paid be included to reduce the impact of this constraint. Payments to Approved Research Providers will not be capped as it will be easy to verify that these payments have actually been incurred by a firm. That is, R&D credits generated from eligible expenditure on Approved Research Providers will be refundable, even if a business has not paid any payroll taxes. Levy bodies may have low ‘payroll’ taxes where R&D is largely contracted out, but 2 For most firms, the amount of PAYE they pay on behalf of employees will exceed 15% of the amount o f R&D they undertake because all employees in the firm will contribute to the PAYE total whereas R&D is usually only one part of the firm’s activities. There will, however, be some firms that (quite legitimately) do not pay PAYE. 3 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and w ithholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 4 For instance, many start-up firms will limit their financial risk by employing staff on contract rather than recruiting them as permanent members of staff. These staff employed on contract may choose to have withholding tax (WT) paid by the firm on their behalf. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 6 Page 34 of 64 they are not subject to the cap due to reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable. Conclusion The above constraint is not anticipated to restrict refunds for the vast majority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some immediate benefit and a few would have less than full refundability. Given the R&D Tax Incentive scheme is relatively broad and accessible, the proposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter the incentives of the scheme. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy for New Zealand represents a comprehensive approach to refundability. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? We are confident of the evidence that refundable R&D tax credit schemes are effective at increasing business R&D. This is based on a range of international studies. It is difficult to predict the actual level by which R&D will increase as a result of broader refundability. Written and oral submissions on the Act emphasised the importance of refundability for supporting R&D. Consultation recently undertaken with businesses on broader refundability has reaffirmed the importance of refundability for incentivising R&D intensive firms to continue to invest in and grow their R&D activities. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: MBIE’s Regulatory Impact Analysis Review Panel has reviewed this Regulatory Impact Statement. Quality Assurance Assessment: The Panel considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement meets the criteria necessary for Ministers to make informed decisions. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 7 Page 35 of 64 Impact Statement: R&D Tax Incentive - Refundability Section 1: General information Purpose This analysis and advice has been produced to inform key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet around broadening the refundability available under the R&D Tax Incentive. MBIE and IR are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. Key limitations or constraints on analysis Estimating the impact of broader refundability on the amount of R&D undertaken and its overall impact on the economy is complicated. Evidence on the impact on both of these is imprecise. There has been no analysis on or impact evaluation of the R&D tax incentive implemented in New Zealand in 2008 (which was fully refundable). So there is no New Zealand evidence to guide our analysis of the impacts of refundability. As a result, the estimates of the anticipated response are based upon evidence from international studies that may not correspond to the situation in New Zealand. Nevertheless, this is the best information available. Responsible Managers (signature and date) Keith Taylor Kirsty Hutchison Policy Manager Manager – Innovation Policy Inland Revenue Ministry of Business, Innovation and 10 / 05 / 2019 Employment 10 / 05 / 2019 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? New Zealand has a low overall expenditure on R&D 5 primarily due to low business investment in R&D in New Zealand. New Zealand’s low business investment in R&D can be explained, in part, by its industrial structure. New Zealand firms have low R&D intensity (Mazoyer, 1999); the size of traditionally R&D intensive industries (such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacturing) in New Zealand is small (Di Maio and Blakeley, 2004); and there are few very large firms, who tend to be more research-active (OECD, 2017). Evidence suggests that there are other reasons for the low business investment in R&D. These include returns to innovation being relatively low in New Zealand 5 New Zealand’s R&D spending in 2018 was equal to 1.37 percent of gross domestic product. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 8 Page 36 of 64 (Wakeman and Conway, 2017), which means New Zealand firms do not have the same incentive to invest in activities that will increase their innovative output. The average rate of public support for business R&D is also “well below the socially efficient level indicated by international empirical studies” (OECD, 2017). This evidence indicates that there is scope for productivity gains from increasing the overall level of support for R&D expenditure. The Government announced a goal of increasing New Zealand’s R&D expenditure to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027. To reach this target, a significant amount of the growth in R&D expenditure is expected to come from business. New Zealand BERD is relatively low and remains concentrated among a small set of firms. To achieve a further boost in BERD, as well as to transform the economy to become more knowledge intensive, requires broadening the base of R&D performing firms within New Zealand while continuing to increase the R&D expenditure of existing R&D-performing firms. R&D performing firms, particularly at the early phase of their development, will often be loss-making. Therefore, providing refundable tax credits to businesses in tax loss is a key element of the effectiveness of the R&D Tax Incentive in achieving significant growth in BERD. Without a refundable tax incentive businesses in tax loss will have minimal incentive to invest in additional R&D. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act (the Act), introduced in October 2018, implements an R&D tax incentive in New Zealand. The R&D Tax Incentive scheme applies from the beginning of the 2019/20 income year. The Act allows for firms that make a loss for tax purposes and satisfy certain criteria to receive a refund of up to $255,000 of tax credits per income year. Credits that are not refunded can be carried forward to future income years provided shareholder continuity criteria are met. Appendix 2 provides examples that illustrate how without refundability, firms do not receive a cash benefit from a tax credit if they are in loss or have insufficient income tax liability. The Act also includes an in-year approval process, which requires claimants to obtain approval of their R&D activities before they file a claim for their R&D tax credits. In addition to the R&D Tax Incentive, there are Callaghan Innovation grants which provide R&D subsidies. These grants include: • Growth Grants: A non-discretionary grant paid to all businesses that spend more than $300,000 and 1.5 per cent of revenue on R&D over the prior two years. The grant funds 20 per cent of a business R&D programme up to a limit of $5 million per year (i.e., $25m of R&D spending), initially for a period of three years with automatic two-year extensions conditional on continuing to meet the criteria. The aim is to provide experienced R&D performers with the funding certainty and stability they need to grow their R&D spending in the long term. There were 316 recipients in 2017/18 at an (estimated) fiscal cost of $172.2M. The Growth Grant scheme will cease on 31 March 2021. No new applications can be made, but existing Growth Grant recipients can extend their Growth Grants until the scheme end date. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 9 Page 37 of 64 • Project Grants: A discretionary grant, allocated to less-experienced R&D performers that do not meet the conditions for a Growth Grant for R&D. It funds 40 per cent of the first $800,000 of the eligible costs of a pre-specified project and 20 per cent of the remainder. There were 344 recipients in 2017/18 at an estimated fiscal cost of $20.3M. There are restrictions on the availability of the R&D Tax Incentive for recipients of existing grants. New Zealand also provides support for businesses performing R&D through the R&D loss tax credit (also known as the R&D tax-loss cash out). New Zealand-resident businesses are able to apply for 28 per cent of their losses associated with eligible R&D expenditure (up to a cap) to be paid out in cash, rather than carrying forward those losses until future years. 350 firms currently claim R&D loss tax credits. There are also tax deductions available for R&D expenditure, and the ability to defer these tax deductions so as not to lose them due to a breach of the shareholder continuity rules. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The objective of the R&D Tax Incentive is to address New Zealand’s low levels of R&D, specifically by increasing BERD, which has a central role in driving innovation and economic growth. The R&D Tax Incentive as introduced in the Act has limited refundability. Limited refundability is available to unlisted companies who satisfy corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria, up to a cap of $255,000. Any remaining R&D tax credits can be carried forward to the next income year provided shareholder continuity requirements are met. Entity eligibility Limited refundability is not available for entities, such as levy bodies, which receive tax exempt income (other than dividends). Discussions of the proposals with levy bodies has indicated that should levy bodies be ineligible for refundable R&D tax credits, this could lead to some levy body members preferring to fund their own R&D. The incentive is not intended to change business behaviour in this way. Limited refundability is also not available for listed companies, partnerships, or trusts. This is problematic, because it is likely that – without refundability – some of these businesses will have insufficient income tax liability to benefit from their R&D tax credits. The Tax Incentive is intended to have broad application and treat all businesses the same, irrespective of their legal form. However, excluding some types of firm from the Tax Incentive biases it toward firms in traditional arrangements (particularly, limited liability companies). Capped refundability Some businesses may be eligible for limited refundability but unable to cash out all of their R&D tax credits because of the $255,000 cap. These businesses will have to carry their R&D tax credits forward into future years until they have sufficient income tax liability to utilise their credits. The ability to carry the credit forward is subject to a shareholder continuity rule that requires a minimum of 49% shareholder continuity to be maintained in order for R&D tax credits to be carried forward. This is problematic, because R&D intensive start-ups are more likely to undergo a significant change in their shareholder base when they seek to raise capital through new investors. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 10 Page 38 of 64 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The Government has introduced the R&D Tax Incentive and indicated that it wants to expand the coverage of refundability. The Government has committed to developing a more comprehensive policy for refundability from year two of the Tax Incentive (corresponding to businesses’ 2020/21 income year). There is a need to use existing legislative vehicles to achieve enactment of policy changes in time for them to apply from year two of the Tax Incentive. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? This proposal has been informed by input from a wide array of private sector organisations. The importance of broad refundability in incentivising business investment in R&D was a strong theme from the consultation conducted by MBIE, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation following the release of the Government Discussion Document on the R&D Tax Incentive in mid-2018. The need for broader refundability was also emphasized in submissions received by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on the Bill, and through additional stakeholder meetings. MBIE, Inland Revenue and Callaghan have discussed refundability proposals with the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group; Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; approximately 25 representatives from R&D performing businesses in tax loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully use non-refundable R&D tax credits; levy bodies; charities; and Māori business representatives. These discussions have helped shape the broader refundability proposals, and have highlighted the desirability of broad eligibility and an accessible process. Agencies asked stakeholders to consider the impact of a $5 million cap and a PAYE cap (used as a proxy to test tangible economic presence). Feedback on $5 million cap Stakeholder engagement revealed that there were a small number of established R&D performers who would be constrained by a $5 million cap. For example, a business in a loss making position undertaking around $80 million of R&D annually would be eligible for $12 million of R&D tax credits. Under a $5 million cap the business would receive a $5 million refund and would have to carry forward the remaining $7 million of R&D tax credits into future years. Because the business spends a large amount of R&D on an on-going basis they are unlikely to be able to fully cash out their accumulation of R&D credits carried forward. There were also a number of established R&D performers who valued the security refundability would bring to their R&D programmes. These businesses are mainly in a tax-paying situation but depending on market fluctuations they could be in a temporary loss-making position in future. Refundability would give these firms surety, allowing them to continue their R&D investment during market down-turns. Some of these established R&D performers would also be constrained by a $5 million cap. The proposal for broader refundability removes the previously proposed $5 million cap on refundability. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 11 Page 39 of 64 Feedback on PAYE cap The PAYE cap, which would limit the amount of R&D tax credits refunded to a firm to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant year, was seen as problematic. Stakeholders advised that a PAYE cap would significantly constrain the benefit that loss-making start-ups would get from the credit. Many start-ups that perform R&D have few employees and rely on contractors to develop their business because of the comparative flexibility afforded by contracting arrangements. R&D intensive start-ups may have fewer non-R&D employees (compared with larger firms), and may also have a higher proportion of non-employee R&D expenditure (such as expenditure on capital assets or consumables). Tangible economic presence test As a result of the stakeholder feedback on the two options above, officials explored a tangible economic presence (TEP) test. The TEP test developed would have allowed firms that did not satisfy a PAYE cap to be verified for TEP from either an external certifier (such as a chartered accountant or lawyer), or directly from Inland Revenue through additional checks. Stakeholders preferred the availability of alternatives to the PAYE cap, and thought that multiple ways of establishing tangible economic presence were preferable to a one-size-fits-all approach. Payroll taxes cap Discussions with United Kingdom (UK) officials found that the risks of fraud in relation to refundability are more pervasive than previously considered. 6 UK officials suggested that relying on a chartered accountant or practising lawyer for certification of TEP may not be robust, and that additional Inland Revenue checks might lead to administration resources being focused on audit rather than the approval of R&D activity. As a result of this feedback, we have included an option that would include a ‘payroll’ taxes cap based on PAYE and other taxes paid by firms (including fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and tax voluntarily withheld from contractor payments (WT)) in order to lessen the impact on affected firms. It is also proposed that any tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers be fully refundable (so not subject to the ‘payroll’ taxes cap). Stakeholder engagement on including additional payroll taxes (such as FBT, ESCT and WT) in the cap indicated that this would be an improvement over a PAYE cap. Although only a small proportion of contractors have opted into the voluntary withholding scheme, more may decide to opt into it if the payroll taxes cap were implemented. Other mechanisms for providing support to R&D intensive start-ups will also be considered as part of further policy work, including reviewing the R&D tax loss cash- out and the Callaghan Innovation Project Grants. 6 In the UK, HM Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document ‘Preventing abuse of the R&D tax relief for SMEs’, April 2019, which proposes that a PAYE-related cap is reintroduced to the R&D tax credit scheme for SMEs. This policy has been driven by a concern over growing levels of fraud within the scheme since the removal of the PAYE cap. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 12 Page 40 of 64 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The framework for assessing the key policy elements and trade-offs of the options under consideration is captured by the following criteria: Criteria for which entities will be eligible for a refund • Incentivise business expenditure on R&D. • Tax-exempt organisations that sit outside the tax system (do not pay income tax) should not benefit further from incentives provided from within the tax system. • Provide clarity about which organisations are eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Criteria for constraining the amount that is refundable • Increased business R&D expenditure • Mitigation of fraud risk/maintaining the scheme’s integrity • Minimise compliance costs for firms • Maximise business certainty over time • Administratively feasible • Minimise fiscal costs/risk 3.2 What options are available to address the problem? There are a range of options for how refundability could be broadened, including the types of entities that are eligible and the constraints that are placed on the scheme to manage risks that refundability creates, particularly to the integrity of the Tax Incentive. Options for which entities will be eligible for a refund The main options available are: • The status quo • General business entities • Levy bodies • Charities • Local authorities • Other tax-exempt organisations Status quo Under the status quo, limited refundability rules restrict eligibility for refunds to unlisted companies that meet a 20% R&D wage intensity test and do not derive non- dividend exempt income. These criteria mean that many businesses will not be eligible for refundable tax credits, including partnerships, trusts, listed companies, and companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test. Additionally, certain atypical organisations, such as levy bodies, some Māori entities, charities, and local authorities, will be excluded. General business entities This change would make listed companies, partnerships and trusts eligible for refundability, and there would be no wage intensity requirement. This change will allow most Māori organisations to be eligible. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 13 Page 41 of 64 Levy bodies Levy bodies would be eligible for refundability under this option. Charities Under this option charitable organisations that perform eligible R&D activities would be ineligible for refundable tax credits. Charities are currently treated as carrying on a business in New Zealand for the purposes of being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Excluding charities means that this rule would be removed for consistency to ensure they are excluded from being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Excluding charities means that businesses wholly-owned by charities are excluded, because these are also considered charities. However, this option does not exclude other associated entities. This means if a tax paying business donates to a charity, even one controlled by that business, this would not invalidate the business’s access to the R&D Tax Incentive. It would also mean that a charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, which could be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. In relation to Māori organisations, a small number of post-settlement governance entities have registered as charities. As discussed above, businesses that are wholly- owned by these charitable entities would also be ineligible. Businesses that are partially controlled by these charities would be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Local authorities Under this option local authorities would be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. However, council controlled organisations would be eligible. Other tax-exempt organisations This option excludes tax-exempt organisations from being eligible to receive refunds. The exclusion would not apply to entities that receive exempt income from dividends (no change from the status quo) or to levy bodies. Options for constraining the amount that is refundable The main options available are: •The status qu o •A PAYE cap •A tangible economic presence (TEP) test •A ‘payroll’ taxes ca p S tatus quo The status quo limited refundability rules allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure that meet the corporate and wage-intensity eligibility rules to claim a maximum refund per year of $255,000. A PAYE cap A PAYE cap would allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure to have their R&D tax credits refunded up to a maximum amount equal to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant income year. A TEP test A TEP test would allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure to have their R&D tax credits refunded as long as they satisfied a test of tangible economic presence, up to a maximum of $5 million per year. A TEP test would be designed to ensure that a 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 14 Page 42 of 64 firm has ‘skin in the game’, and that it physically exists with premises and staff, rather than just existing on paper as a shell company. A TEP test would be met where at least one of the following applied: • A business’s PAYE for the year is equal to or greater than their R&D tax credit claim. This ensures a proportionate TEP because the firm is paying tax on behalf of its employees and cannot take out more than it puts in to the tax system. • A chartered accountant or practising lawyer has certified that a business has TEP. The certifier would testify to the firm’s TEP, having actually met the staff/seen the premises. • Inland Revenue has completed a review (for example, checking the tax-paying history of a business; visiting a business’s site; and/or confirming the identity of shareholders or directors) and is satisfied that a business has TEP. • A business’s R&D tax credit claim only includes amounts paid to an approved research provider to perform R&D activities on their behalf. This provides an easily verified audit trail to determine TEP. • If an organisation is established under statute (such as a levy body), the organisation would be deemed to have TEP. The proposal – a ‘payroll’ taxes cap Under the Proposal, firms that have insufficient tax liability would have their credits fully refunded, subject to the following constraint: • R&D tax credits are refundable to the extent they are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year. 7 • The proposed cap would not apply to limit tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. • The proposed cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. Excess credits that are not refunded in a particular year can be carried forward subject to the continuity rules and can be refunded in future years, subject to the same conditions. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? We have assumed the continuation of the R&D Tax Incentive with at least its existing limited refundability, so we have not considered the option of no tax incentive or no refundability. 7 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 15 Page 43 of 64 Section 4: Impact analysis Entity eligibility for refunds General business entities Levy bodies Charities Local authorities Other tax - exempt organisations Incentivising ( ++ ) This change ( ++ ) The R&D ( 0 ) Charities may perform R& D ( 0 ) Although loca l ( 0 ) Although othe r B ERD would remove limitations on refundability by entity type, except for the existing exclusion of tax-exempt organisations.

Which entities will be eligible for a refund Based on the above analysis, the preferred combination of options is for general business entities and levy bodies to be eligible for refundability, and for charities, local authorities, and other organisations that receive (non-dividend) exempt income to be ineligible. The effect of these options is that many more business entities would be eligible for refundability, while not bringing in entities that already receive substantial benefits from operating outside of the tax system. This would be a positive change for listed companies, partnerships, trusts, levy bodies and Māori businesses, and would explicitly exclude charities, local authorities, and other tax- exempt organisations, providing clarity in the law. Constraints on refundable amount Based on the above analysis, the two leading options are a ‘payroll’ taxes cap and a PAYE cap. Both options would significantly mitigate the risk of fraudulent claims, as firms could not take out more from the tax system than they put in. They would be simple, have low compliance costs for firms, and be easy to administer. They would provide increased business certainty, with broad and simple eligibility for refundability. The preferred option is to constrain refundability by a ‘payroll’ taxes cap, because this would have a greater impact on BERD, with a comparatively lesser constraint imposed on the benefit received by loss-making start-ups in particular. Benefits of proposed broader refundability The broader refundability proposed will better support the Government’s objectives of incentivising increased BERD. Providing refundable tax credits to businesses that have insufficient tax liability is a key element of the effectiveness of the R&D Tax Incentive in achieving significant growth in BERD. Broadening the refundability available from that provided for year one of the R&D Tax Incentive will broaden the reach and effect of the R&D Tax Incentive. Businesses will receive the financial support of the R&D Tax Incentive earlier or, in some instances, will actually get a benefit where they previously would not have. The key advantage to a refundable tax credit is it provides cash closer to the point when firms, particularly R&D intensive firms, are undertaking their R&D. Broader refundability will provide increased certainty to businesses, with broad and simple eligibility, and receipt of cash refunds each year rather than having to carry forward credits that may be lost due to continuity breaches. The refundability available in year one is expected to be limited to approximately 350- 650 firms, and 65-130 of those are expected to hit the cap on refundability. The proposed broader refundability has simpler eligibility criteria, and would be available to a larger number of firms, estimated at 750-1200 firms in 2019 (or 550-1100 firms, after allowing for some firms to remain on the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant). The wider coverage and increased cash flow to businesses performing R&D is expected to lead to increased R&D investment by those businesses. Increased coverage of R&D-performing firms (and higher incentives for firms to engage in R&D) is expected to result in an increase in innovative activity, 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 23 Page 51 of 64 employment, and labour productivity growth, particularly among firms that did not qualify for limited refundability. A higher level of R&D expenditure will result in greater spillover benefits to other participants in the economy. The proposed constraint on refundability is not anticipated to restrict refunds for the vast majority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some immediate benefit and a few would have less than full refundability. Given the R&D Tax Incentive scheme is relatively broad and accessible, the proposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter the incentives of the scheme. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy represents a comprehensive approach to refundability. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 24 Page 52 of 64 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected Comment : nature of cost or benefit, risks Impact Evidence parties certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action R&D performing firms Compliance costs No need to quantify because negligible.

For existing Growth Grants this is roughly equivalent to a 20% pre-tax subsidy (as per the Growth Grant), 11 all else being equal. 12 For non- recipients of a Growth Grant this will be an increased subsidy.

Firms with insufficient tax liability will be able to refund their 15% tax credit, up to the proposed cap amount. The maximum amount paid under a Growth Grant to firms in tax loss is $5 million per year. 12 Assuming eligible R&D expenditure is the same. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 26 Page 54 of 64 researchers, etc.), but effects have not been monetised.

There is a potential risk that by providing broader refundability, businesses are motivated to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure or make fraudulent claims. The Tax Incentive has been designed to reduce the likelihood of, and opportunities to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure. This includes requiring a close nexus between the R&D activity and the expenses claimed. The proposal to broaden eligibility for refundability includes a ‘payroll’ taxes cap on refunds to mitigate the fraud, fiscal, and integrity risks associated with paying out cash. Businesses would be entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid in 13 the relevant income year. Payments to Approved Research Providers are not included in the cap as it will be easy to verify that these payments have actually been incurred by a firm. Levy bodies are not subject to the cap due to reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable, and some may have low ‘payroll’ taxes where R&D is largely contracted out. Additional measures to mitigate risk include a sample of claims being audited each year, and an in-year approval process (included in the Act), which requires claimants to obtain approval of their R&D activities before they file a claim for their R&D tax credits. The $50,000 minimum threshold of eligible expenditure (included in the Act) is also an important measure in preventing a flood of smaller, lower-quality claims. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s “expectations for the design of regulatory system”? There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Legislation will need to be enacted to give effect to broader refundability. It is proposed that broader refundability come into effect from businesses’ 2020/21 income year. Therefore, it is proposed that the legislative changes needed to give effect to broader refundability be included in a tax bill scheduled to be introduced in June 2019, which would make changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue is leading implementation of the R&D Tax Incentive through the tax system, and will also be responsible for implementing broader refundability. Inland Revenue will identify and mitigate operational risk so that broader refundability can be delivered successfully. Inland Revenue has the necessary capabilities and capacity to implement broader refundability through its systems. 13 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and w ithholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 28 Page 56 of 64 It is expected that broader refundability will pose minimal compliance and administrative costs. No material change is expected for the R&D supplementary return. Instead of carrying forward non-refundable R&D tax credits, most firms will be able to receive R&D tax credit refunds. Any increase in administrative costs would be negligible, because Inland Revenue intends to carry out checks and reviews on claims from year one. The existing core team of Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation officials will continue to work on claims after broader refundability is introduced. Inland Revenue, working with the other agencies, will develop guidance material on the broader refundability proposals and the impact of these on business. Since broader refundability expands on the new R&D Tax Incentive, there are no particular transition issues. Credits not refunded in respect of the 2019/20 tax year, and carried forward to the 2020/21 tax year, may be refunded in that latter year or subsequent years. The proposed eligibility criteria for broader refundability are simpler than the existing eligibility criteria that apply to limited refundability in year one. This may result in a simpler process that is easier for businesses to comply with, so may in fact lead to reduced compliance costs. Officials from all agencies (MBIE, Callaghan Innovation, and IR) have engaged, and will continue to engage, with interested stakeholders. This includes accounting firms, businesses, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ). For some taxpayers, the legislation is expected to receive Royal Assent after the beginning of their 2020/21 income years. This is unlikely to create significant issues, however, because claims will be submitted with taxpayers’ income tax returns which are due after the end of their income year, by which point it is anticipated the legislation will have been enacted. No credits will be refunded under the broader refundability rules until legislation has been enacted. 6.2 What are the implementation risks In submissions on the R&D Tax Incentive, a clear theme was the need for low compliance costs, to the extent this is possible. Feedback highlighted the need for clear guidance and education material. Businesses engaged with on the broader refundability proposals reaffirmed the need for simple rules and low compliance costs. As mentioned above, the broader refundability proposals contain eligibility criteria that are simpler than the year one limited refundability criteria. The proposed broader refundability rules do not require corporate eligibility and wage intensity tests to be satisfied, and rely on the existing (easier) rules of the R&D Tax Incentive. Allowing for broader refundability also reduces the need for continuous tracking of shareholder continuity, because once refunded credits are no longer at risk of being extinguished through breaches of shareholder continuity rules. This is particularly beneficial for smaller, R&D intensive start-ups which may regularly seek new investors to boost funding for their R&D projects. Implementation risks arise where businesses re-characterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure in order to claim a larger tax credit. The incentive for re- characterisation is greater with broader refundability, because firms can receive cash refunds (rather than having to wait until they come into profit to utilise their R&D tax credits). The policy and legislation has been developed to manage this risk, although 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 29 Page 57 of 64 it cannot be eliminated. The proposed ‘payroll’ taxes cap on refunds will be backed up by existing administrative processes, such as in-year approval and IR audits. There needs to be strong uptake of the R&D Tax Incentive by businesses for the incentive to be successful. As indicated by the submissions received on the Bill, broader refundability is an important part of ensuring businesses transition to the scheme. Inland Revenue, Callaghan Innovation and MBIE officials have engaged with stakeholders on the broader refundability proposals. Guidance will also be developed by Inland Revenue, which will sit alongside the tax legislation, to provide claimants with more information about the broader refundability proposals. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The impact of the broader refundability proposals will be monitored as part of the system-level monitoring of the R&D Tax Incentive. The R&D Tax Incentive will be monitored as part of the Research, Science and Innovation portfolio (for example, through publication of the annual System Performance Report). As part of the R&D Tax Incentive, the Government is required to commission an evaluation of the incentive every five years from the commencement of the scheme. This evaluation would include an evaluation of broader refundability. In addition to the 5-year evaluation of the incentive, the business R&D surveys run by Statistics New Zealand can also be used to evaluate the R&D Tax Incentive scheme (which would include broader refundability). This will provide additional information to measure the impact of the R&D Tax Incentive and the broader refundability proposals. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? In addition to the legislated 5-year evaluation of the R&D Tax Incentive, MBIE and IR will monitor the policy in the shorter term. This is so that any issues associated with broader refundability that could compromise the integrity of the Incentive can be quickly identified and remedied. The R&D Advisory Group (RDAG) is a consultative committee comprising representatives from accounting firms and other businesses that functions as a forum for identifying and resolving problems with the R&D Tax incentive. RDAG had its first meeting in January 2019. Officials also have regular meetings and discussions with a broader range of stakeholders, at which policy and implementation issues are discussed. It is expected that RDAG and these regular stakeholder discussions will enable officials to conduct on-going monitoring and review of the impact of broader refundability. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 30 Page 58 of 64 Bibliography Appelt, S., M.

Country Refundability policy Other relevant factors Australia Limits refundability to: •firms with turnover less tha n A$20m & •subject to a A$4m annual cap. The cap is proposed but legislation not yet passed. It is designed to reduce the costs of the scheme. The cap equates to A$10m eligible expenditure. UK – SMEs Firms in loss can cash out their tax 14 credit at a discount to their value. The UK government is currently consulting on introducing a cap relating to PAYE payments. The SME scheme is more generous than the large firm scheme. SMEs must have: •fewer than 500 employee s and •turnover less than EUR 100m. UK – large For non-SMEs, the tax credit is firms paid before tax, so loss making firms benefit equally with profitable firms, subject to not exceeding the amount of PAYE and National Insurance Contribution paid. Norway Full refundability for tax paying entities. The tax credit operates with a very low cap. The maximum credit is (approx.) NZ$2m, and in most cases is NZ$1m. The tax credit is not available to non-taxpayers. Ireland Full refundability, but paid in instalments over 3 years, and subject to limits relating to amounts of corporate income tax paid or amounts of payroll tax paid. Netherlands Full refundability but limited to a firm’s payroll tax liability. Canada The credit is fully refundable for Canadian Controlled Private Corporations up to an expenditure limit of CAD 3 million. Higher expenditure is only 40% refundable. The tax credit rate is 35% up to eligible expenditure of CAD 3 million, and 15% for higher amounts. 14 Firms in loss can cash out 14.5% of surrenderable losses (these are the lesser of their trading loss a nd 230% of the R&D spend). 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:31:31 32 Page 60 of 64 The table above demonstrates different mechanisms can be used for constraining refundability.

1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Modernising the correction of errors in PAYE information Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Summary, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. This Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) updates an earlier version completed on 7 February 2018 to reflect decisions around social policy obligations for student loan repayments, KiwiSaver employee contributions and child support. Additional information to reflect these decisions has been included in sections 2.1 and 3.1 with all other parts substantively unchanged since the original RIA. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis that follows are: • Consultation and testing: Although there has been consultation with employers and payroll providers, employers with small payrolls who do not use payroll software were underrepresented in submissions. • Quality of data used for impact analysis: We have been unable to accurately estimate the monetary value of expected changes in administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for employers and payroll software developers. Neither limitation materially affects the analysis. Responsible Manager Mike Nutsford Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 28 February 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 2 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? PAYE error correction “PAYE error correction” describes the process by which employers advise Inland Revenue of changes to income, PAYE and other deductions, such as KiwiSaver when an error has been made in, or an adjustment is required to, the information originally filed with Inland Revenue. For many reasons, including human error and late receipt of information, payroll errors 1 are inevitable. There are three types of errors that require amendment to PAYE information: 1. Reporting errors arise when the employee(s) were paid and taxed correctly but reporting to Inland Revenue does not accurately reflect what was paid and/or withheld. 2. Payroll overpayment errors arise when an employee is overpaid, correcting the overpayment requires consequential change to the amounts withheld for PAYE and related deductions such as KiwiSaver. 3. Interpretation errors arise when the employee receives the correct pay but an incorrect tax treatment is applied, for example a benefit is treated as tax free when it should have been subject to PAYE. Because salary and wage earners are taxed when they are paid underpayments are taxed when they are paid and so there is no requirement to correct the information already provided to Inland Revenue. The current PAYE error correction process is set out in operational guidance from Inland Revenue and is largely manual. The current PAYE error correction guidelines require all errors to be corrected by filing an amendment to the original return. This requirement imposes considerable compliance costs on employers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. The guidelines would need to be updated to reflect the changes proposed in the Taxation (Annual rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill (The Bill). This Bill introduces “payday reporting” 2 . In general, payday reporting would require employers to file “employment income information” with Inland Revenue within 2 to 10 working days of payday. This information is currently provided to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. Payday reporting will allow some errors to be identified and corrected more 1 Payroll staff often distinguish between “errors” and “adjustments” with the latter category arising from timing events such as the late receipt of information. For simplicity these are all referred to in this document as errors. 2 This Bill is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee and the proposed changes are due to be mandatory from April 2019, employers can voluntarily adopt payday filing from April 2018.. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 3 IN CONFIDENCE quickly but it will reduce the amount of time available to employers to correct information before it is sent to Inland Revenue and, when an error has continued for several pay periods, it will require more returns to be amended. Therefore, in the absence of any other changes, payday reporting will increase the overall number of errors reported to Inland Revenue. This is the status quo position. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme provides an opportunity to reduce compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue by modernising the PAYE error correction process using employers’ payroll software and taking advantage of the capabilities in Inland Revenue’s new computer system. This could be achieved by revising some of Inland Revenue’s requirements and coding PAYE error correction requirements into payroll software and Inland Revenue’s system. To achieve this outcome the requirements would need to provide certainty and must be accessible to employers and developers of payroll software. The requirements must also cater for those organisations which do not use payroll software. We note that the Bill proposes that the requirements for PAYE error correction can be set out in regulations. The PAYE system is also used to help administer social policy obligations. • Student loan repayments: employees with a student loan have repayment deductions made from PAYE income over the student loan threshold amount. Additional student repayment rates may also apply if they have requested by the employee or required by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. • KiwiSaver: for employees enrolled in KiwiSaver, employers must make deductions from the employee’s PAYE income for employee contributions, pay employer contributions and withhold and pay ESCT on that amount. • Child support: in some cases, child support obligations are administered via deductions from PAYE income which is then paid to Inland Revenue. We have identified a subset of interpretation errors which require alternate treatment. This is for errors which affect the amount of a student loan repayment obligation, KiwiSaver contributions or child support deductions that have not resulted from an incorrect interpretation and calculation of the gross PAYE income payment. Other problems with PAYE error correction In addition, a matter affecting PAYE error correction has arisen which relates to the definition of PAYE income in the Income Tax Act 2007. The objective of providing certainty in relation to the requirements for PAYE error correction requires that this issue should be resolved as soon as possible so that it can be included in advice to providers of payroll software and employers. The problem concerns the taxable status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid. Inland Revenue’s legal position is that an overpayment which is not repaid is not taxable unless it has been obtained fraudulently or has become a bonus or salary advance. Consultation with employers suggests that at least some employers treat this income as 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 4 IN CONFIDENCE taxable and that any change to their approach would incur additional compliance costs and could reduce the likelihood of the employee agreeing to repay the net amount overpaid. Some employers who treat overpaid income which is not repaid as subject to PAYE seek a refund of PAYE and other deductions, when they obtain agreement from the employee that the net amount will be repaid 3 , others wait until the net amount is fully repaid. 3 If the employee subsequently defaults on the repayment these employers submit a further error correction to reinstate the outstanding amount as income and pay PAYE on it. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2.2 Who is affected and how? Employers would be most affected by the current situation and those who responded to consultation generally supported the proposed changes on the basis that they would help to reduce their compliance costs. Payroll software developers would also be affected by the proposals for PAYE error correction. They generally support the proposed changes because they would provide certainty and would simplify reporting. Employees could be potentially affected. If the requirements for PAYE error correction are unclear or too complex employers could ignore them and adopt approaches which could be unfair for employees whose records of income and deductions might be affected. Some tax professionals do not support the proposed change to the status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid because it would tax an amount which is not currently defined as PAYE income and denies the employer the refund of PAYE that is currently available. The individual employers who responded to consultation on this point nevertheless supported the proposed change. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The common law principle that wage and salary earners are taxed when they are paid is a constraint. This principle means that underpayments are taxed when they are paid; there is therefore no “error” from a tax perspective and no requirement on the employer to amend earlier tax returns. No change is proposed and this issue is not analysed further in this impact summary. The Bill’s changes to PAYE reporting are a constraint as they require more frequent filing of PAYE information. These changes form part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. One objective of this programme is to, as much as possible; integrate tax obligations with normal business processes by using business software to automate processes. Automation requires the rules to be set out clearly and centrally so that they can be coded. The proposed changes would be consistent with a largely automated approach to error correction. In most cases, this would allow an employer using payroll software to generate the information required by Inland Revenue as a consequence of updating their own records. Because a significant group of employers do not use payroll software the requirements for PAYE error correction should also cater for employers who would manually correct their PAYE information. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 6 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tificatio n 3.1 What options have been considered? Modernising PAYE error correction Criteria • Minimise compliance costs to the extent possible for employers and payroll software developers: • Minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue, including consistency with the objectives of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. • Maintain the equity of the tax system. This means allowable approaches to PAYE error correction should not disadvantage employees to whom the income and deductions belong. • Maintain the integrity of the tax system. Options for error correction • Option 1: All corrections would be made by amending the original return (status quo). • Option 2: Employers would be able to make corrections by either; amending the original return or reporting the correction in a subsequent return. The ability to amend in a subsequent return would exist even if the error occurred in a previous tax year. Additional sub-options have been considered for interpretation errors and these are discussed below. Analysis of options for each error type against the stated criteria 1. Reporting errors Option 1 is preferred over option 2 for dealing with reporting errors. If reporting errors were not corrected in the original return there could be a mismatch in the reported information and the amount paid. This would give rise to reconciliation problems which give rise to compliance costs and administrative costs. Amending the original return would also ensure that employees would not be disadvantaged by the income or deductions actually received being reported in a later period. Option 2 does not address the problem. 2. Overpayment errors Option 1 would involve higher compliance costs for users of payroll software, compared with option 2. This is particularly true in the context of payday reporting - that is, if an error has continued for more than one payday, an employer who pays more often than monthly would have more returns to correct. Option 2 would involve a reduction in compliance costs for employers using payroll software, compared with option 1. These reductions would arise because employers would be able to report overpayment errors in a subsequent return which would 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 7 IN CONFIDENCE eliminate the requirement for a separate error correction return. Because it provides choices option 2 would also cater for employers who do not use payroll software and who prefer to make corrections by amending the original return. Option 2 would not give rise to integrity concerns. If the overpayment error occurred in a previous tax year option 2 would more often ensure that the reduction in an employee’s income feeds through into their annual assessment and social policy position. For this reason option 2 is also preferred on equity grounds as fewer employees would need to seek a reassessment to ensure the reduction in their income feeds through to an assessment. Option 2 would not be fully available to employers until Inland Revenue’s new computer system takes over the full processing of PAYE; this is not expected until 2020. Until then employers would only report overpayment errors in a subsequent return if the net amount reported were a positive number. 3. Interpretation errors Option 1 Requiring all interpretation errors to be corrected by amending the original return (the status quo) would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option 2. There would not be equity or integrity of the tax system concerns with this option. Option 2 Allowing the employer to choose to correct the error either by amending the original return or by including the correction in a subsequent return would have lower compliance and administrative costs than option 1. However if the ability to correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return is unconstrained employees could be disadvantaged by having a significant increase in their income reported in a single payday return when they have not had an increase in available cash 4 . This concern led to consideration of sub option 2a below. In addition, concern for the integrity of the tax system led to consideration of a further sub option as set out in sub option 2b below. Option 2a This sub option would permit employers to choose to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return up to a threshold of PAYE on the error being less than 10% of the employee’s PAYE in the payday return. Larger interpretation errors would need to be corrected by amending the original return(s). Option 2a would mitigate the risk of disadvantaging employees but it would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option 2. 4 This situation could arise if a taxable benefit such as subsidised accommodation had been treated as tax free, if the value of this benefit is all reported in one payday return the employee has higher income reported but no more cash. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 8 IN CONFIDENCE Option 2b In addition to the 10% threshold proposed in sub option 2a concern for the integrity of the tax system lead to a further proposal: that an employer could only correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return if they had made less than $10,000 of upward reassessments in that tax year. This sub option would have significantly higher compliance costs that options 2 and 2a but it has the advantage of reducing the likelihood that the correcting interpretation errors in a subsequent return could conceal widespread non-compliance. 4. Interpretation errors which affect student loans, KiwiSaver or child support Option 1 Requiring all interpretation errors to be corrected by amending the original return (the status quo) would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option 2. Option 2 Allowing the employer to choose to correct the error either by amending the original return or by including the correction in a subsequent return would have lower compliance and administrative costs than option 1. Option 2 would permit employers to choose to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return up to a threshold of PAYE on the error being less than 10% of the employee’s PAYE in the payday return. Larger interpretation errors would need to be corrected by amending the original return(s). Option 2 would mitigate the risk of disadvantaging employees, however it still requires employers to distinguish between whether PAYE on an error exceeds 10% of the PAYE on the employee’s PAYE for the subsequent payday. When an error is corrected by netting off the relevant values in a subsequent period, Inland Revenue won’t be aware that it includes a portion which relates to a previous period. Given that there are system rules which are linked to the gross PAYE income amount, there is a concern that if a subsequent return included social policy deductions which related to a previous period, these would cause errors and might not be accepted by Inland Revenue’s system. This problem is less likely to occur if the PAYE income is also corrected as proportionality in deductions will be preserved. Options for amending definition of PAYE income Three options are considered using the criteria set out at the beginning of this section. • Option 1: no amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. This is the status quo option. • Option 2: no amendment to the Income Tax Act and a significant investment by Inland Revenue in employer education in an effort to change employer behaviour. • Option 3: amend the Income Tax Act 2007 so that overpaid PAYE income that is not 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 9 IN CONFIDENCE repaid remains subject to PAYE. Analysis of options Option 1 This option retains the current definition of PAYE income. Some employer submissions indicated that this option would be inconsistent with current employer practice and with how their payroll software is currently configured. Continuing with the status quo may undermine the objective of automating error correction through software and is likely to result in continuing non-compliance which undermines the integrity of the tax system. This option could also be seen as inequitable because it treats an employee who repays overpaid PAYE income as having the same income as an employee who does not repay it. Option 2 Under this option there would be no change to the definition of PAYE income in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Inland Revenue would widely publicise its view of the law in an effort to change employer practice and how payroll software is configured. The objective would be to enable payroll software to be used to report such errors to Inland Revenue and recover overpaid PAYE and other deductions as soon as an overpayment is identified and regardless of whether it is repaid or not. This option would have significant one-off educational costs for Inland Revenue and might not be successful. Those employers consulted view the status of overpaid PAYE income as wages or salary subject to PAYE. In addition, employers have reasons under employment law for not coding the amount as an overpayment in their payroll system until agreement to repay has been reached. If this option resulted in a change in employer behaviour employers would benefit by being able to recover PAYE and other deductions from Inland Revenue regardless of whether they had recovered the net amount from the employee. Option 3 This option would expand the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid PAYE income not repaid would be subject to PAYE. This option would have lower compliance and administrative costs than the alternatives as it accords with how (some) employers currently treat such income and with how their software is configured. This option supports the integrity of the tax system as overpayments not repaid may become taxable as debt remittance income. However, because employees would be unlikely to be aware of this obligation it is unlikely that tax would be paid on such income. Option 3 would expand the definition of PAYE income and could be seen as unfair for employers because it denies employers refunds of PAYE and related deductions that they are currently entitled to. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 10 IN CONFIDENCE It could also be seen as unfair to employees who have been overpaid because the overpaid amount would be taxed. As noted above, there are countervailing equity arguments that suggest that Option 3 is preferable on equity grounds because for social policy purposes it would recognise an employer who repaid overpaid income as on a lower income than someone who received an equivalent overpayment but did not repay it. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 11 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Error Correction 1. Reporting errors: Option 1 (all corrections to be made by amending the original return) is the proposed approach as it is preferable on all criteria. 2. Overpayment errors: Option 2 (allowing the employer the choice between amending the original return and correcting in a subsequent period) is the proposed approach as it reduces compliance and administrative costs and is preferable on equity grounds. 3. Interpretation errors: Option 2a (allowing the employer the choice between amending the original return and correcting in a subsequent period subject to PAYE on the correction being less than 10 percent of the employee’s PAYE in the return) is the preferred approach. This option represents the best trade-off between reducing compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue without the possibility of unfair impacts on employees. 4. Social policy errors which do not result from an error in gross taxable income: Option 1 (all corrections to be made by amending the original return) is the preferred option as it ensures these errors won’t cause an exception in the information submitted to Inland Revenue. This should be re-considered once student loans, KiwiSaver and child support has been moved into Inland Revenue’s new computer system. (Student loans and KiwiSaver are planned for 2020, child support is planned for 2021). If an amount is in error due to an incorrectly calculated PAYE income payment then it is appropriate to allow corrections in a subsequent period, subject to the 10% threshold restriction outlined in option 2a for interpretation errors. Definition of PAYE income The taxable status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid: Option 3 (amending the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid remains subject to PAYE) is the preferred approach as it is preferable on all criteria. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 12 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits PAYE Error correction: the error correction items are considered together as costs are principally driven by the requirement to amend original returns. When there is a continuing requirement to correct errors by amending the original return employers who use software should experience reduced compliance costs owing to automation. Employers who do not use payroll software but who have internet connectivity would be able to access their already filed and processed returns through myIR and self-correct earlier returns; this should reduce costs for this segment. Employers who report PAYE on paper would continue to have access to a paper form for PAYE error corrections and for simple corrections should be able to make them over the telephone. Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Providers of payroll software would need to upgrade their products to support the electronic submission of error corrections in line with the proposed methods for error correction. Software providers could integrate this change into the regular update cycle. Work to create an automated channel for the status quo position is already underway in advance of the proposed regulations, as part of business transformation changes. These are transitional costs. Employers would have transitional costs of understanding the new approach in order to take advantage of it. Very low Very low Regulators Inland Revenue would need to ensure that employers and payroll providers are provided with appropriate education and support and that its new computer system is effectively set up and tested in order to receive negative values from 2020. These are transitional costs. Very low Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Cost NA NA Non-monetised costs Very low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Providers of payroll software: Have additional certainty that their payroll offerings are compliant with requirements.

The ability to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return should reduce costs of reporting these errors. These benefits are ongoing. Regulators Inland Revenue once the new system has bedded in and employers can use their payroll systems to correct overpayment errors and minor interpretation errors in a subsequent return, including those showing negative values the cost of administering the PAYE system should reduce. Low Wider government Government employers are expected to have the same experience as private sector employers. The changes are also expected to benefit the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation which pay PAYE income to beneficiaries and to recipients of New Zealand superannuation and accident compensation. Medium Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Benefit NA NA Non-monetised benefits . Low/medium Overpaid PAYE income subject to PAYE Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Software providers would have no costs as we understand their systems currently support the proposed approach. Employers: we understand that what is proposed aligns with how (some) employers currently treat this income and reflects how their systems work. Even though the proposed change would preclude employers from receiving a refund of PAYE on the overpaid income (some) employers are not currently claiming this refund. Unless this practice changed the increased cost would be theoretical, rather than real. Further, employers argue that continuing to treat overpaid income as subject to PAYE would make it more likely that the employee would repay the employer because repayment would be the only way their record of income for social policy purposes is corrected. To the extent this view is valid the theoretical increase in costs 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 14 IN CONFIDENCE identified below would reduce. Employer costs have been estimated as very low; this reflects the fact that the situation is not a common one and assumes that some employers do seek a refund of PAYE on overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid. Very low Regulators Inland Revenue: the proposal reflects the way the system is currently operating so no additional costs would be incurred. No change Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Cost NA NA Non-monetised costs As noted above (some) employers have advised us that what is proposed is how they currently operate. For these employers there would be no increase in costs. The costs have been entered as very low on the assumption that some employers are recovering PAYE on overpaid income not repaid. Very low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Payroll providers will have certainty that their systems could be used as currently configured to seek a refund of overpaid income when repayment is agreed or made. Employers would have certainty that the widespread current approach, that treats this income as subject to PAYE, is consistent with the law. Employees would be freed of any obligation to pay tax on the overpaid PAYE income when and if it becomes debt remittance income. Low Regulators Inland Revenue would no longer have to deal with ambiguity around the current position. Low Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Benefit Non-monetised benefits The primary benefit is increased certainty around how this income should be treated for tax purposes. Low 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 15 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The proposed legislative change to deem overpaid PAYE that is not repaid as subject to PAYE would improve equity between overpaid employees. Under existing law two employees who are overpaid the same amount of PAYE income would be treated as having the same income for social policy purposes (for example working for families payments, student loan repayments and child support payments) despite one employee having repaid the money and the other not having done so. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Inland Revenue consulted with a number of providers of payroll software and employers and with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand prior to releasing an official issues paper in August 2017. An officials’ issues paper, PAYE error correction and adjustment, was released through Inland Revenue’s normal channels and in addition was sent to the members of the Payroll Practitioner’s Association, to providers of payroll software and to representatives of more than thirty employers who had indicated interest in the subject. Thirteen submitters responded some representing more than one employer. Submitters generally agreed with the problem analysis and the proposed regulatory approach with the exception of the original proposal for an employer level threshold for interpretation errors. Submitters argued that the employer level threshold could not be automated and that manual tracking would involve disproportionate compliance costs. In response to feedback the employer level threshold has been dropped. Concern was also expressed by some respondents that the 10% threshold for interpretation errors at the employee level was unduly low. This threshold has been retained at 10% because the amount could be material for someone on a low income. One respondent felt that the proposals were unduly complex. However an employer who wishes to minimise complexity will have the option to correct all errors by amending the original returns. No change has been made in response to this submission. Most respondents agreed with the proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007, deeming overpaid PAYE income not repaid as subject to PAYE. The Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand however disagreed. The Corporate Taxpayers Group considered that the proposal would disadvantage employers by taxing an amount that is not employment income. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand submitted that whether the net amount was recovered or not was a private matter between the employer and employee and the amount should not be taxed unless it became debt remittance income. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 16 IN CONFIDENCE In addition, one software provider submitted that if an employer had made an adjustment when agreement to repay the overpaid amount was repaid they should not be required to make a further adjustment if the employee subsequently defaulted on the repayment. No changes were made in response to the submissions received on the proposal to amend the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid income not repaid is subject to PAYE. A number of technical questions were raised by payroll software providers and these will be considered in the process of developing the technical specifications. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 17 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals relating to reporting errors, overpayment errors and interpretation errors would be given effect through regulations. Clause 235C of the Taxation (Annual Rates 2017 -18, Employment and Investment Income and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes that the Governor General may, by Order-in- Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue and following appropriate consultation, make regulations for the correction of errors in employment income information. The proposed timing provides adequate time for employers to understand the proposed changes and become familiar with the new options. In general the proposed regulations introduce additional options, with continuing to file amendments on the current basis being one option. Having options provides a means of managing implementation risk including risks that arise from a relative lack of engagement with employers with small payrolls. Inland Revenue’s systems are being upgraded to accept automatic error correction schedules from 1 April 2018. Issues relating to the effectiveness of the automated process should be resolved by the time the regulations, which permit a greater number of errors to be correcting in a subsequent return, come into effect on 1 April 2019. The proposal relating to the tax status of overpaid PAYE income not repaid will be managed through a proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. It is intended that the amendment will be included in the next available taxation omnibus bill with a proposed effective date of 1 April 2019. Consultation by select committee is expected to provide a further opportunity for interested parties to express their views on this proposed change. The proposed change to the legislation reflects how many employers are understood to currently treat such income, implementation risks are not therefore considered to be material. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 18 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Information on the number of errors and adjustments to employment income information that are corrected at the employer’s request is currently available. There is no way to deconstruct the totals into different error types. Once the systems changes are made and the regulations are in place Inland Revenue will know how many automated error correction schedules are filed and the number of changes made. If the system is working as intended the number of changes that are made by amending earlier returns should reduce after it becomes possible for employers to file returns which include negative values (estimated as 2020). Inland Revenue will not know how many employers exercise the option of correcting overpayment and small interpretation errors in a subsequent return as this option eliminates the need to separately file error correction information. Implementation and operational issues will be identified through feedback from payroll software providers and through our call centres, account managers and specialised units such as those established to support large enterprises. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The arrangements will be reviewed as part of the post implementation review of phases three and four of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. In addition if monitoring shows unanticipated spikes in the numbers of error corrections being made to employment income information Inland Revenue will investigate the reasons and consider whether the issue: • is insufficient education; • reflects a problem with the specifications for payroll software or with Inland Revenue’s processing of error correction information; • stems from the regulations. Employers will have the opportunity to raise any concerns with our call centres and account managers and payroll software providers can do so through Inland Revenue’s Software Liaison Unit. If employees consider that they are unfairly affected by the actions of employers pursuant to the proposed regulations or legislative change they will be able to make their concerns known through our call centres or by asking the Commissioner to reassess their income. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49
New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 1 Impact Summary: New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Quality of data used for impact analysis In developing this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), Inland Revenue used information provided by the New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy (the Trust) in an in- confidence business case, and subsequent telephone and email contact. External information about tourism patterns in France were used to verify or test some of the assumptions underpinning the business case. Not all information in the business case could be verified, however, and the level of donor support beyond 2021–22 cannot be readily determined. Options considered This RIA considers whether the Trust should be granted overseas donee status. The decision is binary, and as such, this RIA considers only two options. There are other options that would provide direct Government assistance to the Trust, such as grants. The Trust, however, has signalled that it is not seeking such assistance at this time. Consultation Consultation on this issue was in the form of email and telephone conversations between Government agencies, the Trust’s Chair and the Trust’s advisor. Private sector consultation was not carried out. Sensitivity to tax benefits Inland Revenue has been informed by the Trust that its potential donors are sensitive to the tax effects of their donations in their decision-making whether to donate. Inland Revenue does not have information to assess the effect of tax benefits on donor decision to donate. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Brandon Sloan Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 26 July 2018 New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 2 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? This RIA considers whether a New Zealand charity, the New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy (pronounced le-ken-wah) should be granted overseas donee status by Cabinet. The main objective behind the policy underpinning overseas donee status is to indirectly support New Zealand’s overseas development aid programme by providing tax benefits, such as tax credits or tax deductions, under the Income Tax Act 2007, to a specified class of charity whose purposes are largely directed at the relief of poverty, or improving education or economic outcomes in developing countries, as set out in criteria set out by Cabinet in 1978. The Trust’s purposes fall outside the main objective, and its approval would be an exception to the current policy framework. A decision to grant the Trust overseas donee status could therefore create a precedent for tax purposes, and raise expectations that Cabinet will look more favourably on future requests from charities whose purposes are not directed at overseas development. New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy The Trust is proposing to create a memorial museum (the Museum) in Le Quesnoy, France. The Trust is currently raising funds to support the project and wants monetary donations to the Trust to be eligible for tax benefits, so that it can further its objects and tell the story of Le Quesnoy as the cornerstone of the New Zealand First World War military story. Specifically, the Trust’s purposes are: • To own and operate a Museum in Le Quesnoy, France, that will provide information and learning resources to visitors, and raise awareness of New Zealand’s participation in and contribution to the First World War; and • Develop a programme of cultural and educational exchanges between New Zealand and Le Quesnoy, France, for all people in New Zealand and in France. The trustee’s vision for the Trust is to establish a permanent war memorial in Le Quesnoy, in the form of a Museum, in remembrance of the New Zealanders who fought in France. The proposed Museum would create a complex with functional exhibition space and include self- catering accommodation facilities, which the Trust believes by 2021 will fund the Museum’s ongoing operations. Inland Revenue notes that the project is likely to support economic development (tourism) in the region by adding accommodation capacity to the town. The liberation of Le Quesnoy on 4 November 1918 was New Zealand’s last major action during the First World War and, as such, has been viewed as a significant milestone in our military history. The liberation was achieved without the loss of any civilian lives. The town of Le Quesnoy maintains links with New Zealand, and a special connection exists between New Zealand and the people of Le Quesnoy. Le Quesnoy is located in Northern France (12 km from the Belgium boarder) and its current population is approximately 5,000. Le Quesnoy has fairly limited local amenities (shopping, accommodation and entertainment). The Mayor of Le Quesnoy supports and is an advocate of, the development of the Museum and accommodation project. The Museum is one of a New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 3 number of economic development activities being carried out in the region. The Trust is not part of any Government initiative relating to the First World War Centenary Programme (WW100). The project is a private endeavour. Problem definition The Trust’s purposes are outside New Zealand and its donations do not currently qualify for tax benefits. Further, the Trust’s purposes fall outside the normal framework used by Cabinet to grant overseas donee status (see Overseas donee status – Cabinet’s approval criteria below). The Trust is therefore seeking to be granted overseas donee status as an exceptional case. As with all overseas donee status approvals, legislation is needed to specify that the Trust is a donee organisation (with overseas donee status) for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007 and allow donations to qualify for tax benefits (such as the donations tax credit or tax deductions – see Tax benefits for monetary donations to charities). The trustees want to advise potential donors about the Government’s decision to facilitate fundraising well before the commemorations at Le Quesnoy on 4 November 2018. A decision to grant overseas donee status to the Trust would result in the Government indirectly committing funds (through reduced tax revenue) to the Le Quesnoy project, albeit on a successful efforts basis given that the support ultimately depends on the trustees’ success in fundraising. Tax policy Tax benefits for monetary donations to charities Since 1962, the tax system has provided tax benefits for monetary donations to New Zealand charities (including benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural organisations) whose purposes are largely limited to New Zealand. Under current tax policy settings, the tax benefits include: • the donation tax credit of 33 1 / 3 % of the value of any monetary donations made by a New Zealand resident individual taxpayer, capped to the amount of their taxable income; and • income tax deductions if the monetary donation is from a New Zealand resident company or Māori authority, capped to the amount of their net income. Eligibility for the tax benefits is subject to certain statutory limitations on the charities’ purposes and application of funds, which must relate “wholly or mainly” to purposes in New Zealand. 1 Generally, the availability of tax benefits for donations is limited to charities with New Zealand purposes only. New Zealand charities that support activities overseas and want their donors to be eligible for tax benefits (in particular, the donation tax credit) must be specifically listed in the Income Tax Act 2007 (overseas donee status). Broadly, governments seek to promote charitable giving: 1 There are a number of interpretations of the phrase “wholly or mainly”. Inland Revenue is currently analysing submissions on a draft interpretation statement PUB00295 Income Tax: Donee organisations – meaning of wholly or mainly applying funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 4 • to further social objectives, • for the wider benefits to society (externalities), which may be over and above the value of the benefit provided via the tax system, and • because donations can be effective indicators of when extra goods and services should be provided in market conditions that might otherwise not exist. Overseas donee status – Cabinet’s approval criteria In 1978, Cabinet refined the policy position set in 1962, 2 by setting the parameters of overseas charitable activities that may be supported by the tax system: The basic criteria for adding an organisation to the list of approved “overseas” charities: (i) the funds of the charity should be principally applied towards: the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster; or the economy of developing countries\*; or raising the educational standards of a developing country\*; (ii) charities formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cult or political creed should not qualify; \* developing countries recognised by the United Nations. \[CM 78/14/7 refers\] The criteria set out in CM 78/14/7 have, except in a few instances, been applied consistently in Cabinet decision-making over the last forty years. Currently 138 charities and other organisations are listed in the Income Tax Act and have overseas donee status. All but four of the charities named on the list meet Cabinet’s approval criteria (CM 78/14/7) and are engaged in overseas development. Of the four organisations that do not meet the criteria and granted overseas donee status, three are Government initiatives and have direct Government oversight or financial support. The other organisation is Amnesty International, a large internationally recognised charity with significant New Zealand donor support. The eligible purposes set out in the criteria are aligned with the government’s overseas development objectives (disaster relief, provision of humanitarian aid, and assisting developing countries). The eligible purposes are narrower than the common-law meaning of “charitable purpose” and the legislative framework in the Charities Act 2005. Assessing donee status, including overseas donee status, remains the responsibility of Inland Revenue because of the tax benefits attached to monetary donations. The process does not overlap the work of the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services. 2 At the time, four charities with overseas purposes were specifically named as donee organisations for income tax purposes, and the government acknowledged that charities could be added to the list of names from time to time as comparable cases arise. The four charities were: the Red Cross Society Incorporated, the Council of Organisations for Relief Services Overseas (CORSO), and two leprosy missions. Source: 1962 Budget statement. New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 5 Decisions to grant overseas donee status are implemented using legislation. In 2016, advice to Inland Revenue from the Legislative Design and Advisory Committee confirmed that the use of legislation to implement decisions to give overseas donee status was appropriate, given that approvals are a special case, because: • determining overseas donee status has (or might have) a political and moral dimension; and • it ensures decision-making transparency, and promotes a bipartisan approach. Analysing requests for overseas donee status Inland Revenue analyses a number of factors when considering a charity’s request to be granted overseas donee status. The purpose of the analysis, consistent with CM 78/14/7 and CBC Min (09) 12/2, 3 is to establish whether the charity is capable of meeting its purposes and is accountable for the funds it collects by: 1. reviewing the charity’s governing documents (constitution and trust deed) to ensure the activities and purposes are consistent with Cabinet’s criteria, 2. requiring the purposes stated in the charity’s governing documents to be entirely within the scope of paragraph (i) of the Cabinet criteria and that no personal pecuniary profit can be derived, 3. looking at the clauses governing the nature and extent of the trustees’ discretionary powers, the winding-up clause, and the trustees’ ability to amend the governing documents, 4. looking at the charity’s past, current, and proposed activities, 5. requesting that the trustees provide Inland Revenue with the charity’s financial statements, 6. considering the trustees’ degree of control over the application of the charity’s funds overseas, and procedures in place to ensure accountability for funds, 7. considering the planning, monitoring, and evaluation processes used by the trustees in respect of the application of the charity’s funds, including how recipients use the funds, as well as the processes used to select beneficiaries and/or projects to support, 8. asking whether the charity has a legal presence in New Zealand and if it has registered under the Charities Act 2005, 9. considering each request on the basis of other generic tax policy objectives, such as fiscal implications (including risk to the New Zealand tax base), consistency with other current Government policy objectives, and the precedent effect, and 10. consulting with other Government agencies such as the Treasury and the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is also consulted to identify if any concerns exist with the charity or sensitivities with the countries in which the charity operates. Inland Revenue also uses the New Zealand Police’s vetting service in connection with the charity’s trustees or directors. 3 In November 2009, Cabinet endorsed the processes used by tax policy officials to analyse charities requesting overseas donee status, resulting in the release of Guidelines for using the Cabinet Criteria for Overseas Donee Status. New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 6 In this particular case, points 1 and 2 were ignored, as the purposes of the Trust fall outside the scope of the Cabinet criteria. However, the Trust’s deed has the required constraints prohibiting the trustees from deriving any personal pecuniary profit from the Trust’s activities, over and above what would be expected from an arm’s length transaction. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The Trust is currently raising funds to support the project and wants monetary donations to the Trust to be eligible for tax benefits. The trustees have informed Inland Revenue that its potential donors are tax sensitive, and may not make donations to the Trust if they do not give rise to tax benefits. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? For present purposes, the Trust wants to influence donor decision-making by offering tax benefits for the monetary donations it receives. This has narrowed the options considered in this RIA to those that concern the tax system. Alternative Government responses, such as financially supporting the Trust via grants or alternative co-governance structures (public/private partnerships) have not been considered. The Trust is not at this time wanting direct Government support. This analysis therefore does not consider the wider issue of whether the New Zealand Government should directly support (financially or otherwise) the creation of a war memorial museum in France. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? Acknowledging that the Trust is seeking overseas donee status to support its fundraising efforts, the following criteria have been applied to assess the options: • Effectiveness: Does the option incentivise donations to the Trust? • Sustainability: Does the option maintain the integrity of the tax system and operate coherently with the frameworks used? • Fairness and equity: Is the option consistent with previous decisions regarding granting overseas donee status? • Tax administration: Does the option introduce complexity in tax administration? Tax compliance implications have not been considered because there is little difference between the options in terms of impact on the Trust. From the Trust’s perspective, the main criterion is effectiveness in terms of encouraging donations to the Trust. From Inland Revenue’s perspective, the main criterion is sustainability, that is, the option should be consistent with current tax frameworks. As entitlement to tax benefits for monetary donations to charities with overseas purposes is prescribed by legislation, non-legislative responses, apart from the status quo, are not viable. Two options have been considered: New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 7 • the Trust’s request for overseas donee status is declined (status quo option); or • the Trust’s request for overseas donee status is accepted (exception option) Option one: Decline the Trust’s request for overseas donee status (maintain the status quo) Under the status quo, monetary donations to the Trust would be ineligible for tax benefits. This would affect the Trust’s ability to fundraise and, among other things affect the completion of the proposed Museum. As such, this option does not meet the effectiveness criterion. It is noted that, irrespective of the Trust being granted overseas donee status, other environmental factors, such as the location of Le Quesnoy, and the absence of tourism infrastructure in the area, may have a more direct impact on the viability of the project promoted by the Trust. Declining the Trust’s request for overseas donee status meets the sustainability and fairness and equity criteria because: • the Trust’s purposes are outside the scope of Cabinet’s approval criteria (CM 78/14/7 refers), and • declining the request would be consistent with earlier Cabinet decisions to decline overseas donee status for charities that do not meet the criteria in CM 78/14/7. There are wider issues to do with whether New Zealand should have a war memorial museum in France to commemorate the military service of New Zealand during the First and Second World Wars, but this question is beyond the immediate scope of this RIA. Declining the Trust’s request for overseas donee status does not impact on Inland Revenue’s administration of the tax system and confirms existing policy frameworks and practices. Feedback from government agencies who were consulted as part of Inland Revenue’s analysis of the Trust supported its request for overseas donee status being declined. Option two: Grant the Trust’s request for overseas donee status Under option two, monetary donations to the Trust would be eligible for tax benefits. This meets the effectiveness criterion. Ultimately, however, the benefit accruing to the Trust depends on its fundraising efforts, as this option only provides indirect Government support to the Trust’s project on a successful efforts basis. The trustees report that about $6 million of donations would be made in the current tax year (2018–19) if the Trust received overseas donee status. The trustees estimate that $15 million is needed to complete the complex to a point where it can open to the public. Option two does not meet the other criteria because: • From a sustainability process granting the Trust overseas donee status would create a precedent. It could raise expectations that Cabinet will look favourably on future requests from charities whose purposes are not directed at overseas development. • From a fairness and equity perspective, granting the Trust overseas donee status would be inconsistent with previous historical Cabinet decisions that have declined charities with, for example, religious purposes, plant conservation purposes, animal welfare purposes, and animal conservation purposes. New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 8 • From a tax administration perspective, granting the Trust overseas donee status may introduce uncertainty about the decision-making process for granting overseas donee status. This could affect the cohesiveness of the approval process and make it more difficult to manage charities’ expectations about being granted overseas donee status. Tax policy concerns aside, granting the Trust overseas donee status does not create any implementation concerns, provided that legislation implementing the approval is enacted before 31 March 2019. There are no implications for Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Inland Revenue’s preferred option is that the Trust’s request is declined for the following reasons: Concerns over visitor assumptions and financial viability The information and assumptions supporting the project suggest that the viability of the project, in the absence of an additional direct long-term financial commitment from the Government, is doubtful, if • forecasting donor support does not materialise, • expected visitor numbers to the Museum and the number of those who stay at the accommodation complex are not realised. The business case notes that the Museum will be a loss-making exercise and relies on projected revenue from the accommodation complex to produce a surplus. Le Quesnoy is in Northern France (12 km from the Belgium boarder) and the current population is approximately 5,000. There are fairly limited local amenities (shopping, accommodation and entertainment) in Le Quesnoy. Research to develop Ngā Tapuwae (a Government WW100 initiative, which developed a trail of key First World War sites relating to New Zealand, which includes Le Quesnoy) noted that many New Zealanders who visit the battlefields in France use Arras, which has well-developed tourist infrastructure, as a base to visit Le Quesnoy. Revenue assumptions regarding visitors to the Museum and visitor occupation (30,000 per annum, from an unofficial estimated annual day-tripper visitor base of 100,000) 4 appear high, relative to official visitor numbers in the region and to more well-known and established memorials. For example, in 2017, the Tourism Office in Le Quesnoy had 5,205 in-person visitor centre enquiries and 10,000 visitors in its Leisure park, while official statistics record: 5 • Mémorial Canadien, Vimy 6 (opened 2005); 121,000+ visits, • La Carrière Wellington, Arras (opened in 2008); 7 65,000+ visits, and 4 The Trust notes that a planned cycle way connecting the local towns in the area may increase tourist numbers. 5 Source: Hauts-de-France Tourism Council 2017/18. 6 The Canadian National Vimy Memorial has iconic national status for Canadians. 7 A local French funded project, the Wellington Quarry in Arras, is an underground museum founded to the memory of the British Army and Dominion Forces and tells the story of the New Zealand Tunneling Company. The community project charges €7 (euros), but this is situated in a big city and has an attraction beyond battlefield visitors. Arras is typically used as a base from which tourists visit other war memorials in the region, including Le Quesnoy. New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 9 • Australian Memorial at Fromelles (opened in 1998); 32,000 visits. The Trust is proposing to charge €6 (euros) entry to the Museum. Comparable memorials are free – such as the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and the St John Monash Centre, Australian National Memorial, Villers-Bretonneux (the latter is cutting edge in terms of museum design and content). Concerns about whether the Trust can meet it s charitable purposes Inland Revenue notes that detailed provisions have not been made for the cost of acquiring artefacts or curating the Museum. Artefacts that are over 100 years old are subject to an approval process under the Protected Objects Act 1975 if they are leaving New Zealand. The Trust has not developed plans or policies to implement the cultural exchange programme that underpinned its registration as a charity under the Charities Act 2005. The Trust has explained that cultural exchanges are not a priority at this time. Purposes of the Trust are inconsistent with current policy frameworks The project being advanced by the Trust is a private endeavour, and although it is not seeking direct Government assistance, it wants indirect assistance in the form of tax benefits for monetary donations. To achieve this aim, the Trust is asking to be granted overseas donee status as an exceptional case. Granting overseas donee status is a Government decision, and it has in four instances granted overseas donee status to organisations that do not meet the normal Cabinet criteria to further wider government objectives. Typically, organisations granted overseas donee status in these circumstances are either directly funded by the Government or the Government has governance oversight. The only other exception is Amnesty International, which was granted overseas donee status in 1983 on the grounds that it was widely respected, recognised worldwide and was strongly supported in New Zealand. The last exception was made in 1987 for the Hillary Commission for Recreation and Sport, a public authority. Neither the direct Government support principle nor all the grounds applying to Amnesty International are present in support of the Trust’s request that it be granted overseas donee status. Conclusion Inland Revenue considers the Trust should not be given overseas donee status because: • the Trust’s purposes are outside the normal policy parameters for approving overseas donee status, and • the future viability of the Trust, at this point in time, is far from certain. Neither option has areas of incompatibility with the Government’s expectation for the design of regulatory systems.

New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 11 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Inland Revenue notes that, at this point of time, there are too many unknowns regarding the proposed operation of the Museum and accommodation complex, and it is hard to assess the viability of the proposal. A potential risk arising from the project promoted by the Trust is that it may put pressure on the Government to provide additional and ongoing Government contributions (either direct or indirect) to ensure the Trust’s long-term and continued operations. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The Treasury, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, and the New Zealand Defence Force were consulted in the preparation of the attached Cabinet paper. Comments from agencies generally questioned the need for the war memorial museum as promoted by the Trust (there are a number of existing memorials commemorating New Zealand’s service during the First World War, including a memorial wall at Le Quesnoy). The Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services was also consulted, and the New Zealand Police’s vetting service was used for the trustees of the Trust. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were informed. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Legislative change to the Income Tax Act 2007 is necessary to implement option two. If the Trust is granted overseas donee status, a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill will be prepared. The changes would apply to monetary donations made on and after 1 April 2018. The Trust has not highlighted any concerns regarding compliance with the Inland Revenue Acts if is granted overseas donee status. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed legislative changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. Inland Revenue has assessed the magnitude of the administrative impacts and considers that a decision to grant the Trust overseas donee status can be implemented for the start of the 2018–19 income year (1 April 2018), subject to amending legislation being enacted before 31 March 2019. Total Monetised Benefit $5 million + reduction in Government revenue over the forecast period 2018 to 2021. Non-monetised benefits Medium New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: tax benefits for monetary donations (overseas donee status) Impact Summary Template | 12 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the Trust to confirm that it is meeting its purposes if it is granted overseas donee status. Monitoring the Trust would be done through existing relationships Inland Revenue has with relevant stakeholders and their advisors, as part of its administration of the Inland Revenue Acts (the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985). 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The process for granting overseas donee status is based on an upfront analysis and vetting process. Charities that are granted overseas donee status may be the subject of routine audit or investigation by Inland Revenue if information comes to hand that warrants administrative intervention. Irrespective of Inland Revenue’s tax administration, charities that are granted overseas donee status are required to comply with the requirements of the Charities Act 2005. Non-compliance with the Charities Act, evidence of wrong-doing, or other action that is contrary to the application of the Inland Revenue Acts may warrant further advice to the Government to the effect that the charity’s overseas donee status should be removed.
Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 1 Coversheet: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act - flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought How best to reduce compliance costs and administrative costs by providing earlier certainty to taxpayers and Inland Revenue about the application of tax law when there is a legislative anomaly that results in an inconsistency with policy intent and practice. Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) has limited ability to deal with situations when a provision is not consistent with the intended policy (legislative anomalies). This ties up taxpayer and Commissioner resources in outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practice and/or expectations. Taxation laws are public goods provided by the government. Only government action can remedy uncertainty caused by a legislative anomaly. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposed approach would enable regulations to be made, or administrative action by way of an exemption issued by the Commissioner to be taken, to address legislative anomalies. The power would be subject to safeguards including consistency with the existing policy and the principles supporting the integrity of the tax system; the outcomes would be optional for taxpayers to apply and would expire in three years. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 2 Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The proposed approach would have no direct impact because it would only enact an empowering provision. The main expected beneficiaries of any regulations or exemptions made under the power would be the full range of taxpayers, including individual taxpayers through to large corporates. The expected benefit would be increased certainty for taxpayers and reduced compliance costs. Where do the costs fall? The main costs of the proposal would fall on Inland Revenue in having to administer the system. Some minor costs would fall on taxpayers in having to maintain awareness of any regulations or exemptions made. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? The introduction of the power could raise risks for the rule of law. However, there are various elements of the proposed approach that would mitigate the risks to the rule of law including the limited scope of the power, the procedural safeguards (including parliamentary oversight), and the temporary nature of any modifications or exemptions created under the power. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue is confident that the evidence supports the policy proposal. Analysis has been undertaken to determine the impact of the current problem, including the length of time taken to remedy anomalies under the current system. Analysis has also been undertaken of comparative regimes overseas, including the recently enacted Australian regime.

Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies Regulatory Impact Analysis and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: A previous version of this RIA completed on 15 February 2018 was assessed as meeting the quality assurance criteria. This RIA has been updated to reflect changes introduced through a redraft of the proposals. Further detail on this process is included in section 2.5 of this document. This revised version also meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 4 Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act - flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 5 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There are two limitations on the analysis because there is some uncertainty about: • the number of suggested applications of the exemption power that could be proposed by taxpayers, and so the resource impact on Inland Revenue in having to deal with the proposed applications; and • any possible increase in judicial review applications. Level of suggestions Taxpayers would be able to suggest instances when the proposed power could be used. There is some uncertainty about the number of suggested applications that might be submitted by taxpayers, so there is some uncertainty about the resources Inland Revenue would need to process them. There is only a small risk that there would be a significant number of suggestions because there is evidence of the number of legislative anomalies that are discovered each year and the number suitable for the remedial power is likely to be a subset of those issues. 1 Inland Revenue received 140 referrals from all sources for remedial amendments between October 2015 and October 2017. Only a small subset of those referrals is likely to be appropriate for the proposed option. Furthermore, under the similar Australian provision only 22 applications were received in the first six months. Of those only two were considered appropriate for the remedial power. It is acknowledged that although the Australian provision is similar to the preferred option discussed below, the differences in the tax systems might lead to a different number of suggestions being made. Overall, the evidence suggests that the proposed option is unlikely to require a significant amount of resource for Inland Revenue to manage the process, and the analysis proceeds on that basis. Increase in judicial review applications There is some uncertainty about the impact of any possible judicial review of the use, or failure to use, the proposed power. However, Inland Revenue considers the risk to be small because the application of any exemption is optional so taxpayers are unlikely to judicially review the application of the exemption power and the courts have been reluctant to allow judicial review challenges that are seen as collateral attacks on a tax assessment. 2 . Inland Revenue considers the risk is so small that it will not have any meaningful impact on the analysis. 1 The number of remedial referrals is contained in an internal database. 2 Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] NZSC 158. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 6 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 24 January 2019 Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 7 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? Taxation laws are public goods provided by the government. Only government action can remedy uncertainty caused by a legislative anomaly. If the government does not remedy the anomaly, then the taxpayer bears the risk of being found not to have complied with the law, or they must bear the unintended costs. New Zealand’s tax system is very complex, and it undergoes significant change regularly. The nature and volume of the tax law changes mean that unforeseen or unintended outcomes (legislative anomalies) arise often. This is likely to continue to be the case into the future given the increasing complexity of tax law and rapidly evolving business practices. Ideally, any such anomalies would be remedied by an amending Act, given the constitutional importance of tax and the certainty that primary legislation gives to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. In some cases this will be both necessary and achievable. However, under the current approach, it takes on average 670 days to remedy a legislative anomaly through primary legislation once it has been identified as needing legislative change. During that time, taxpayers are required to file different returns in different periods. For example, GST returns often need to be filed every two months and income tax returns every year. Taxpayers, therefore, might need to file several returns in the period during which an anomaly is being remedied. It is noted that similar problems arise in Inland Revenue’s non-tax functions (such as the administration of social policies). Clarifying that the care and management provision applies to the Commissioner’s non-tax functions is intended to be progressed as part of the Making Tax Simpler project to modernise the administration of social policy. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The elements of the current regulatory system that are relevant for dealing with legislative anomalies are set out below: • In some situations, a purposive approach to interpreting the relevant legislation will mean that an anomaly that may arise on the plain reading of the relevant provision does not arise. However, sometimes the legislation cannot be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the policy intent. • Some anomalies can be remedied quickly through the legislative process if their discovery aligns with an existing bill. However, this does not often happen and so the average time to remedy a remedial issue is approximately 670 days. • The Commissioner also has some administrative flexibility under the existing care and management provision. The current provision does not allow the Commissioner to administratively remedy legislative anomalies. 3 Instead, the flexibility allows the 3 Interpretation statement “Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 10 (November 2010). Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 8 Commissioner to decide not to allocate her resources to investigate situations when there is a known anomaly. This does not provide certainty for a taxpayer when Inland Revenue becomes aware of an issue because the Commissioner does not have a general power to suspend the application of the law. As it is only an administrative undertaking by the Commissioner, it provides limited protection for taxpayers who rely on it and so do not comply with the law. In those circumstances, the Commissioner would continue to have a duty to apply the law, even when it would produce outcomes that are not consistent with the purpose or object of the law. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The existing approach to resolving legislative anomalies in tax law can create uncertainties and is costly for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The process creates uncertainties because when the legislation does not align with the intended policy, then taxpayers are unsure how to apply the law. To a limited extent this uncertainty can be resolved by binding rulings and other forms of advice. However, such advice can only clarify the meaning of the legislation and cannot resolve issues when the legislation cannot be interpreted consistently with the intended policy. Taxpayers either have to comply with the legislation as interpreted either by themselves or the Commissioner, so incurring unintended costs or compliance requirements; or comply with the intended policy and risk being penalised for not complying with the law. The uncertainty makes it harder for taxpayers to organise their affairs, invest or plan for the future. The uncertainty can also undermine the integrity of the tax system, by encouraging taxpayers to ignore the relevant tax law and comply with the policy. It can also be seen to undermine the rule of law when there is uncertainty about whether the law is intended to be complied with. The rule of law has been described as an elusive constitutional principle that includes at its heart the requirement that all persons (including the State) should be bound by the laws publicly made. 4 This has been developed further to suggest that the law should be clear, predictable, accessible and not made arbitrarily. When the only avenue to resolve the issue is through legislative amendment, then there can be a substantial period of uncertainty. This can create compliance costs for taxpayers by requiring them to seek advice either from an external advisor or Inland Revenue as to the correct approach to the relevant provision in the interim period. This also increases the administrative costs for Inland Revenue in dealing with the issue. 4 Ross Carter et al Subordinate Legislation in New Zealand (LexisNexis, Wellington, 2013) 26. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 9 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There were no particular constraints on the scope of options considered. The options tie in with the broader work that is being undertaken to modernise the Tax Administration Act 1994. Specifically, the work on updating the type of advice provided by Inland Revenue deals with situations when the legislation can be interpreted in a way that aligns with the policy intent. The work on advice is aimed at better communicating the Commissioner’s position to taxpayers through different forms of advice tailored to the needs of different taxpayers. The current issue deals with situations when the legislation cannot be interpreted consistently with the policy intent. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The problem affects all taxpayers and there are various stakeholders that have an interest. Significant consultation has been undertaken which has resulted in four options being developed. The consultation process is set out below. The policy proposal was originally included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. During their consideration of the Bill, the Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended that the proposal be removed from the Bill pending further engagement between Inland Revenue and the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. This resulted in a substantial change to the legislative drafting and minor changes to the originally preferred policy proposal. Stakeholders who have been consulted on the revised legislative drafting are still broadly supportive of the proposal. Problem identification Taxpayers highlighted the lack of speed and certainty in rectifying legislative anomalies in the Tax Administration for the 21 st century conference in June 2014. The conference’s purpose was to explore options for making tax easier (by reducing both compliance and administration costs) and increasing voluntary compliance balanced against core tax policy objectives such as raising revenue, and ensuring fairness and efficiency. First discussion document proposed options In response to the identified problem (and other problems), the Government released a discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act in 2015 which suggested two possible options: • extend the Commissioner’s current discretionary or determination-making powers that attach to specific provisions (referred to as “option 3” in this RIA); or • a clarification to the care and management provision to deal with some legislative anomalies (referred to as “option 4” in this RIA). The consultation included an online forum and presentations to submitters. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 10 The proposal to clarify the care and management provision was based on some criteria set out in R v Inland Revenue Commissioners; Ex parte Wilkinson \[2005\] UKHL 30, which discussed the scope of the Commissioners’ discretionary powers under the similarly worded United Kingdom care and management power. The option would allow the Commissioner to use her discretion in relation to: • minor legislative anomalies; • transitory legislative anomalies; • cases when the relevant legislation has failed to adequately deal with the particular situation because a statutory rule is difficult to formulate; • a long-standing established practice of both the Commissioner and taxpayers; • cases of unfairness at the margins. The discretion would only be exercised consistently with policy intent, and not allow for a policy-making ability. The exercise of the discretion would be time-limited and could not exceed three years. After this time, if the issue was on-going, an amendment to the primary legislation would be required. Consultation prior to the exercise of the discretion would be required, and any exercise of the discretion would be published to ensure transparency. The discretion would also be exercised only by Inland Revenue officers with an appropriate level of expertise. Submissions on the care and management proposal suggested various safeguards Submissions were generally supportive of the proposal to clarify the care and management provision. They commented that it should be a positive step for taxpayers and ensure the Commissioner had the ability to direct her resources where they were most needed. It was also noted that the proposal needed to be supported by a change in mind-set within Inland Revenue to support use of the care and management provision. Submissions suggested: • Any enhanced administrative flexibility should only be exercised in favour of the taxpayer, and the amendment should expressly state this rule to avoid any doubt. • Any care and management power should be guided by a set of principles – including those in sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act. • There needed to be a principle which establishes whether the policy is clear enough such that the Commissioner could depart from the ordinary meaning of the words – for example, “persons reading the relevant legislation would in most cases agree what the policy intent of the legislation is”. • A balancing of a collection of factors was suggested, including: cost to the taxpayer; cost to the Commissioner; a ceiling of an amount of tax at issue if the legislation is applied as written (compared to if the Commissioner has the flexibility to take another approach); and perhaps a time period. Submissions reflected in proposed safeguards and options The submissions were taken into account in developing a refined proposal that was consulted on in a subsequent Government discussion document, Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act (December 2016). The consultation included an online forum and Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 11 workshops with submitters. The revised proposal retained the listed criteria and set out the relevant safeguards that would apply, including that it would be optional for taxpayers. The submissions on the specific criteria and safeguards suggested: • While there was support for each of the listed criteria for when the discretion could be exercised, there was some uncertainty about the scope of the criteria. • There were differing views on whether the exercise of the discretion should be limited to taxpayer-friendly situations or whether it should be optional for taxpayers to apply. • The discretion should be applied consistently and only in appropriate circumstances, but that these safeguards should not impede the exercise of the discretion in an effective manner. • Guidance was needed to ensure taxpayers had a clear understanding of how the provision would apply. • The power should not be exercised if it would not be in the public interest to do so. • The exercise or non-exercise of the discretion should be a reviewable decision. • There should be some flexibility around the requirement to consult as whilst consultation might be beneficial in some cases, in many cases it would result in significant delay of the effective exercise of the discretion. • The requirement to publish the exercise of the discretion should be subject to a public interest requirement. Submitters proposed other options A concern was raised that not all taxpayers would have access to decisions made by the Commissioner under an extended care and management power, which would result in a body of private law. Some submitters suggested exploring further the option of granting the Commissioner a regulation-making power in the form of disallowable legislative instruments like those proposed in Australia. Alternatively, it was suggested that the Commissioner should be allowed to anticipate legislative changes by issuing interpretation statements that then apply as binding interpretations. Submitters, and the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, supported having a range of options by which the discretion could be exercised (a “tool box approach”). This approach is similar to the suite of powers available to the Financial Markets Authority under the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011 and Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The Crown Law Office was concerned about the implications for the rule of law of the proposed extension to the Commissioner’s care and management power, but noted that those concerns were, to a limited extent, addressed by the specific safeguards. The Crown Law Office considered that it would be preferable if the power could be exercised only by Order in Council. These concerns and comments led to the development of the proposal referred to as “option 5” in this RIA. Workshop with submitters Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 12 Following the submissions on the discussion document, and the comments above, Inland Revenue organised a workshop with submitters (including Crown Law) on the various proposals. The discussion focused on option 5. During the workshop, submitters suggested: • The proposal should adopt a principle-based approach. This would allow the discretion to be used when the legislation did not align with the intended policy without being limited by any specific criteria. • There should be a tool-box of options by which legislative anomalies could be dealt with, including Orders in Council, Commissioner-made determinations, and administrative action. • Any exercise of the discretion should be optional for taxpayers to apply. Summary The consultation comments were taken into account in developing the options discussed below. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? There are five options considered in this analysis: • Option 1: Address legislative anomalies using existing processes (status quo). • Option 2: Increase resources to address legislative anomalies using existing processes. Increasing the resources directed at remedying legislative anomalies would involve redirecting existing resources or increasing the resources directed to law development. This option does not require legislation and could be used in conjunction with any of the other options. • Option 3: Provide for more discretionary provisions in legislation. This option would extend the Commissioner’s current discretionary or determination-making powers that attach to specific provisions. It would provide the Commissioner with increased administrative flexibility to deal with legislative anomalies in specific situations. • Option 4: Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. This option would extend the Commissioner’s care and management provision to provide some more administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. • Option 5: Regulations and exemptions 5 to temporarily remedy anomalies (preferred option). This option would provide a power to make regulations or take administrative action by issuing an exemption to remedy a legislative anomaly. 5 The exemption-making power would enable the Commissioner to exempt taxpayers from provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. If necessary, an exemption may come with terms and conditions (including specifying an alternative means of compliance) that must be met for taxpayers to apply it. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 13 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The overarching objective is to reduce compliance costs and administrative costs by providing earlier certainty to taxpayers and Inland Revenue about the application of tax law when there is a legislative anomaly that results in an inconsistency with policy intent and practice. The options have been assessed against the objective and the following criteria: • Sustainability: The options should support the rule of law and maintain the integrity of the tax system. • Compliance costs: Compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as practicable. • Administrative costs: Administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as practicable. The objective of the proposal is to balance the compliance cost and administrative cost reduction criteria against the sustainability criterion. This would be achieved through the limitations included in the options considered. Overlaps between criteria There is likely to be an overlap between reductions in compliance costs for taxpayers and reductions in administrative costs for Inland Revenue, in that a reduction in the former is likely to cause a reduction in the later under the relevant options. This is because the simpler the option for taxpayers the less likely they will need advice from Inland Revenue. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Some submitters suggested that one option could be to re-interpret the current care and management provision, so as to provide the Commissioner with greater administrative flexibility without the need for a legislative amendment. The preferred option suggests retaining the current care and management provision but supplementing it with further flexibility in certain circumstances. As a result, the proposal does not prevent a broader interpretation being taken of the scope of the current provision. However, it is considered that while the current provision does provide the Commissioner with flexibility about the allocation of her resources, it does not provide her with the flexibility to administratively remedy legislative anomalies. Further, it is considered that the scope of any such power, and the safeguards that would apply, should be specified in the legislation to protect the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. As a result, the option of re- interpreting the current provision was ruled out because it would risk the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 14 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? No action Option 1 Option 2 (Providing greater resources) Option 3 (Enact more discretionary provisions) Option 4 (Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances) Option 5 (, Regulations, and admin action) (Preferred option) Criterion (Sustainability) 0 0 Although remedying all issues through legislative amendment would seem to support this criterion, the lengthy legislative process would mean taxpayers would be required to follow either the policy or the law for a substantial time . This would harm the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. + This option would support the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law, but it would be difficult to predict any issues so the problem is likely to still arise in many cases. As a result, in most cases taxpayers would be required to follow either the policy or the law, harming the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. - This option would support sustainability by remedying anomalies quicker. However, it would be at the discretion of the Commissioner and it would not be subject to Parliamentary oversight. + This option would remedy the anomalies and would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, thereby supporting the rule of law. This option would mean taxpayers could choose the best option so supporting the integrity of the tax system. Criterion (Compliance costs) 0 + It would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs because more attention woul d be paid to problematic issues but it would still take time to resolve , so taxpayers would incur costs working out what to do in the interim. 0 – It would only be effective when the problem could be anticipated so taxpayers would still likely have significant compliance costs in most cases. Relying on discreti ons would involve moving away from the efficiency objective of self- assessment, and so would incur further compliance costs for taxpayers than the status quo. + The speed by which the issues could be resolved would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs. However, the remedy would not provide legal certainty so taxpayers might still need to seek advice as to the consequences. + Anomalies could be resolved quickly, and this would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs. However, taxpayers would incur som e costs associated with understanding the process and choosing whether to apply the remedy or the black letter of the law. Criterion (Administrative costs) 0 - Devoting more resources to the policy development process would divert resources from elsewhere, or require more funding. - Additional administrative costs in determining on a case-by-case basis whether the issue is within a discretionary power. + The ease of remedying anomalies would reduce administrative costs but there would be risks of challenges to the use of the discretion. + This option would reduce administration costs by quickly remedying anomalies. However, there would be some increased costs for Inland Revenue in deciding whether the discretion should be exercised. Overall assessment 0 0 + ++ See below for more detailed analysis Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 15 Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 16 Further analysis: Option 2 (Increase resources) Sustainability This option would seem to support the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law as it reflects the constitutional importance of tax and the certainty that primary legislation gives to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. However, under the current approach it takes on average 670 days to remedy a legislative anomaly through primary legislation once it has been identified as needing legislative change. It is not clear that increasing the policy resources would substantially reduce this time period, as it is mainly driven by the legislative process. The time period involves the lead-in time to get a remedial item added to a bill (including the relevant reporting requirements) and the passage of the bill through the House. As a result, it is likely that even with more policy resources it might still take a similar time to resolve the relevant legislative anomalies. The substantial time taken by the legislative process would mean taxpayers either comply with the legislation as interpreted, so incurring unintended costs or compliance requirements; or comply with the intended policy and risk being penalised for not complying with the law. This would result in no change from the status quo for the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. The uncertainty makes it harder for taxpayers to organise their affairs, invest or plan for the future. Compliance costs Under this option there would be some reduction in taxpayers’ compliance costs because more attention would be paid to problematic issues, and so taxpayers could be better informed about the correct approach. However, the Commissioner could only provide administrative guidance prior to the legislation being enacted and so taxpayers would not have any certainty about the outcome in that period. Taxpayers would still need to decide during the time taken to remedy the problem whether they would follow the existing law or the policy. Often this would require taxpayers to consult a professional advisor or Inland Revenue to work out what to do in the interim. In some circumstances, taxpayers and Inland Revenue might still end up in disputes that are inconsistent with both parties’ expectations. This would impose compliance costs on taxpayers. Administrative costs Increasing resources, or directing existing resources towards fixing anomalies, both come with an opportunity cost for Inland Revenue for other functions those resources could have been directed towards. As a result, this option would increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Overall assessment Increasing resources to policy development to fix more anomalies would result in some compliance gains for taxpayers while maintaining the sustainability under the status quo. However, the option would increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Option 3 (Provide for more discretionary provisions) Sustainability Enacting the discretionary provisions as part of the primary legislation would support the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. However, if an issue can be foreseen then they are currently addressed in the primary legislation. This might be through a specific discretion or by allowing determinations to be made on the relevant issue. As a result, it is Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 17 considered that the current problem is unlikely to be one that can be foreseen. Taxpayers, therefore, would still be required to follow either the policy or the law in most cases, so harming the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. Compliance costs Given that the problem really relates to those situations when it is not possible to anticipate the likely issue, adopting this option is unlikely to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers compared with the status quo. In addition, relying on Commissioner discretions would mean that taxpayers would not have certainty from the legislation and would need to consider when the Commissioner would exercise her discretion. There may also be compliance costs in applying to the Commissioner to exercise her discretion or make a determination and the approach could in any case be inconsistent with a tax system based on self-assessment. Administrative costs This option would impose additional administrative costs on the Commissioner because she would be required to consider whether to exercise a particular discretion in a situation. The consideration of the use of the discretion would require resources. The amount of resources would depend on the number of discretionary provisions and the number of possible situations when the discretion could apply. As a result, the more discretionary provisions included in the Revenue Acts to deal with anticipated anomalies, the more resources the Commissioner would potentially have to commit to the various issues. Overall assessment This option would meet the criteria for the issues that could be identified in advance. However, Inland Revenue considers that the majority of anomalies could not be foreseen, and this option would not satisfy the criteria for those issues. Option 4 (Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances) Sustainability Option 4 would reduce sustainability because it would be subject to challenge and would raise rule of law concerns that the Commissioner was not bound to the published law. The proposed safeguards would limit the concerns to some extent. Specifically: • The limited criteria, and the requirement that any exercise of the discretion must be consistent with existing policy, would mean that the scope of the discretion is very limited; • The requirement to consult on any exercise of the discretion would reduce the risk of challenge because concerns could be dealt with before any exercise of the discretion; and • The time limitation would mean any exemptions would only be temporary, which would reduce rule of law concerns. Compliance costs Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 18 This option would allow anomalies to be remedied quickly. This would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by providing them guidance on the intended policy outcome. However, as the remedy would not be legislative and would only be administrative, it would not provide legal certainty for taxpayers. This would mean that taxpayers might still need to seek advice as to the likelihood of the remedy being overturned. There would also be a small increase in compliance costs in having to become familiar with the new process, and having to keep up- to-date with any exercise of the discretion. Taxpayers would also have to monitor any challenges to the exercise of the discretion. Administrative costs The ease of remedying anomalies would reduce administrative costs for Inland Revenue in having to provide less advice about the anomaly, and having less disputes about outcomes that were not intended. However, there would be some increase in administrative costs in having to set-up and administer the new process. This would include providing guidance to taxpayers about how the new process would work, although this is expected to taper over time. There might also be additional costs from any challenges to the exercise of the administrative power. Even so, it would be optional for taxpayers to apply, and so the risk would be small. Overall assessment This option would reduce compliance and administrative costs but could undermine the sustainability of the tax system. The lack of any parliamentary oversight of the process might raise rule of law issues. Option 5 (Regulations, and administrative action) Sustainability Using Orders in Council or disallowable exemptions to remedy anomalies would support the sustainability of the process of remedying the anomalies by enabling parliamentary oversight of the process. Parliamentary oversight would be provided by the disallowance process and the oversight of the Regulations Review Committee. In many cases, the issue would still need to be resolved through the normal legislative process, with the new process providing a temporary bridge until that could occur. This option would support the rule of law by enabling Parliament to disallow any remedies that were considered to be the proper domain of Parliament. The temporary nature of the remedies and the fact that they do not override the primary law also support the sustainability of the system. The optionality of the remedies would mean taxpayers could choose the best option so supporting self-assessment and the integrity of the tax system. Compliance costs This option would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by providing them with faster remedies for legislative anomalies. As noted previously, this would overcome a specific issue raised by taxpayers. It would reduce the need for taxpayers to seek advice either from professional advisors or Inland Revenue on the operation of the relevant provision (when it seems to be inconsistent with the intended policy). It reduces the risks for taxpayers of getting it wrong, and so encourages investment and planning for the future. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 19 The option would increase compliance costs for taxpayers to a limited extent. There would be a small increase in compliance costs in having to become familiar with the new process, and having to keep up-to-date with any exercise of the discretion. It would increase the overall complexity of the tax system. This option would be more complicated than Option 4 given the two possible remedies. However, the use of regulations and disallowable exemptions under Option 5 would make it easier to keep track of any remedies, so reducing the increased compliance costs to some extent. Some compliance costs may be incurred by taxpayers in having to submit on the draft remedies during the process. Finally, taxpayers would need to determine whether any remedy would be favourable for them in their own circumstances, which would increase compliance costs for them. Inland Revenue considers the reduction in compliance costs from providing certainty for taxpayers more quickly under this option would significantly outweigh the increased compliance costs. Administrative costs The option would reduce the overall administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Providing greater certainty for taxpayers more quickly would reduce the need for them to contact Inland Revenue seeking advice and would prevent disputes arising when the legislation does not align with the policy. This would reduce the resources Inland Revenue needed to commit to such issues. As previously noted, the average time taken to remedy an anomaly spans several return periods so providing certainty to taxpayers sooner could reduce the resources Inland Revenue needs to assist to amend previous tax positions. There will be an increase in administrative costs for Inland Revenue in establishing the process and processing any suggested applications of the power from Inland Revenue staff or taxpayers. The Australian experience would suggest there would not be a large number of applications so this cost is not expected to be large. When the anomaly needed to be fixed subsequently through the normal legislative process, the costs incurred in providing a temporary solution could be seen as a duplication, but many of the subsequent elements of the process would not need to be repeated. For example, if the problem had been identified and a remedy consulted on before the making of a regulation, then it may not need to be repeated to the full extent when the permanent legislative amendment is being subsequently proposed. Overall assessment Inland Revenue prefers this option. It would support the sustainability of the tax system by incorporating Parliamentary oversight through the disallowance process and the Regulations Review Committee. The option would also reduce compliance and administrative costs. As a result, this option best meets the stated criteria. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 20 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Inland Revenue prefers option 5 for the following reasons: • It provides a process by which legislative anomalies could be quickly dealt with, while supporting the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. • It would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs in dealing with legislative anomalies, while aligning with the self-assessment system. • It would reduce the administrative costs for Inland Revenue in dealing with anomalies. Although there would be some increased costs in identifying and providing a remedy for the relevant issues, the current number of remedial issues and the Australian experience with their similar provision, suggest these costs would be relatively small. • It is the option most favoured by submitters because it has sufficiently broad scope, it is optional for taxpayers to apply, and because it has appropriate safeguards in place. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (taxpayers) Cost of gaining an initial understanding of how the new process would operate.

There is a risk of adverse public perception that tax laws are being changed through Order in Council or by the use of the Commissioner’s exemption-making power. Such a perception could undermine the integrity of the tax system and the perception of the rule of law. This risk would be mitigated by several elements. The most important element would be the fact that the tax laws would not be overridden, and it would be optional for taxpayers to apply any remedial actions. Further, both Orders in Council and exemptions issued by the Commissioner would be subject to parliamentary disallowance, so protecting the role of parliament in the process. In addition, any remedial actions would be only temporary and would expire in three years after having been made. Another risk could be that the public perceive that lobby groups influence issues which are considered. The consultation and publication requirements would mitigate this risk to some extent. Further, the fact that any regulations or exemptions made under the power would be subject to disallowance would add to the transparency. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The preferred option is compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The preferred option should deliver, over time, a stream of benefits in terms of lower compliance and administrative costs that are in excess of its costs or negative outcomes. The optional nature of the preferred option means that it has the least adverse impact on property rights and individual autonomy. It conforms to established legal and constitutional principles and is similar in nature to the statutory remedial power recently enacted in Australia. The empowering provision under the preferred option would have scope to evolve in response to changing circumstances or new information on the system’s performance. The two methods of exercising the remedial power in the preferred option provide that flexibility to evolve. Non-monetised benefits - Medium High Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 23 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option will need to be implemented by a legislative amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Specifically, an empowering provision would need to be enacted to allow regulations and exemptions to be made. The amendment could be included in the next available tax bill. The amendment could apply from the date of enactment. Explanation of the amendment and its effect could be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill received Royal assent. The implementation of the preferred option would require an internal Inland Revenue process to determine if a recommendation should be made to use the power to seek an Order in Council or deal with the anomaly by way of an exemption issued by the Commissioner. The internal process will be developed by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers and agents will be able to suggest cases when it could be appropriate to use the power. They will also be involved during the consultation process examining any proposed use of the power. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is a risk that there could be a large number of issues raised by taxpayers with Inland Revenue that need to be considered under the proposed power. However, as noted above, this risk is considered to be low because there is evidence of the number of legislative anomalies that are discovered each year and the number suitable for the remedial power is likely to be a subset of those issues. Inland Revenue received 140 referrals from all sources for remedial amendments between October 2015 and October 2017. Only a small subset of those referrals is likely to be appropriate for the proposed option. Furthermore, under the similar Australian provision only approximately 22 applications were received in the first six months. Of those only two were considered appropriate for the remedial power. It is acknowledged that while the Australian provision is similar to the preferred option discussed below, the differences in the tax systems might lead to a different number of suggestions being made. Overall, the evidence suggests that the proposed option is unlikely to require a significant amount of the resources for Inland Revenue to manage the process, and the analysis proceeds on that basis. There is a small risk of an increase in judicial review but as discussed above this risk is considered to be small. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 24 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. The monitoring would involve a review of any regulations and exemptions made under the empowering provision within that period to see whether they were consistent with the intended policy. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. The Regulations Review Committee would have a role in monitoring and reviewing any regulations or exemptions (being disallowable instruments) made. The committee examines all regulations, investigates complaints about regulations, and examines proposed regulation-making powers in bills for consistency with good legislative practice. The committee reports to the House and other committees on any issues it identifies. The House can “disallow” a regulation, and would have the ability to disallow exemptions issued by the Commissioner (as these would be disallowable instruments), meaning it no longer has force.
Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The Government decided to implement the Tax Working Group’s recommendation for the disclosure of IRD numbers on transfers of main homes as soon as possible. Therefore, there has been a relatively short time available to prepare this analysis, and consultation with key external stakeholders has been limited. There has however been previous analysis of the current proposal. The requirement for an IRD number and overseas tax information to be provided upon transfer of property (with an exemption for the main homes of individuals) was introduced in 2015. The proposal to require IRD numbers and tax information numbers from main home owners was the preferred approach of Inland Revenue, as stated in the Regulatory Impact Statement that was prepared for the 2015 change 1 . Further, this recommendation was made by the Tax Working Group in its final report. The Group’s recommendations to the Government to improve the fairness, structure and balance of the tax system were made following their consideration of public submissions. There has been limited consultation specifically on the current policy proposal. One of the important reasons for consultation is identifying likely impacts of a policy proposal. We consider that this is a less complex proposal than most tax policy proposals, and therefore unintended consequences are less likely to occur. We have also considered the comments raised by submitters who commented in 2015 on the Land Transfer Act Amendment Bill which introduced the requirement to provide IRD numbers and overseas tax information upon transfer of property. Some of those submissions noted disadvantages with the main home exemption, which included the fact that the exemption was relatively complex. We intend to consult with key stakeholders on the legislative drafting and the design of the forms. 1 The RIS prepared for the 2015 change can be found at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2015-ris -liopi- bill/overview Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Responsible Manager (signature and date): Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 17 May 2019 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Currently, transferors (sellers) and transferees (purchasers) must each complete a Land Transfer Tax Statement when a property is transferred. The Land Transfer Tax Statement collects information relating to property ownership, for statistical purposes and the purpose of improving compliance with the tax rules around property, including the r ules targeting property speculation. The tax information required for a Land Transfer Tax Statement includes the transferor or transferee’s IRD number and, if applicable, information about the person’s overseas tax residence (the person’s overseas tax information number (TIN) and the jurisdiction in which they are tax resident) . The IRD number and property details are then supplied to Inland Revenue for use in its property tax compliance work. The overseas tax information is supplied to Inland Revenue to share with other countries in accordance with New Zealand’s tax treaties to help prevent global tax evasion. Transferors and transferees are not currently required to include their IRD number and overseas tax information if the property transfer qualifies as a “non-notifiable transfer”. The most common reason a property transfer is a non-notifiable transfer is because the property being transferred is used as the transferor or transferee’s main home. 2 However, trusts must still provide IRD numbers and overseas tax information, even if it is the settlor’s main home. Problem Initial analysis of property transactions by Inland Revenue to determine compliance with the bright-line rule 3 has detected some non-compliance. (The level of non-compliance cannot be accurately determined owing, in part, to the incomplete tax information collected for transfers of main homes.) The fairness of the tax system is undermined where taxpayers don’t comply with their tax obligations. Where Inland Revenue suspects instances of non-compliance with the property tax rules, it follows these up. However, having many transactions for which an IRD number is not supplied, based upon a non-notifiable transfer which is self-determined, makes it more difficult to detect and therefore remedy the true levels of non-compliance. The main home exemption for IRD numbers creates a gap in information provided to Inland Revenue and consequently decreases the enforcement benefits from collecting tax information at the point of property transfer. 2 A transfer cannot be a non-notifiable transfer if the transferor or transferee is an “offshore person” (for example, if they are a non-New Zealand resident and they do not have a residence class visa, or they are a citizen or hold a residence class visa but have not physically been in New Zealand for a certain period of time). 3 The bright-line rule was introduced in 2015 and originally deemed the disposal of residential land to be taxable if disposal occurred with 2 years of acquisition. It was amended in 2018 to now apply to residential property disposed of within 5 years of acquisition. Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 4 IN CONFIDENCE The transfer of a property may be taxable even when a person acquired the property intending to use it as their main home. For example, the sale of these properties can be taxable if: • The person changes their use of the property from being their main home to being an investment property or similar (and the sale is taxable under the bright-line test or other land-sale rules). • The person engages in a regular pattern of selling main homes (for example, habitual renovators). Not requiring IRD numbers for people’s main homes means Inland Revenue does not have visibility of these situations and means Inland Revenue is unable to obtain a full picture around overall compliance with, and ability to enforce, the property tax rules. The exemption from providing information about the person’s overseas tax residence means that the current rules are not as effective as they could be at deterring global tax evasion. It is well known internationally that the provision of TINs generally in third party reporting has a strong deterrent effect on tax evasion. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are property conveyancers and transferors and transferees of main homes. Property conveyancers would be required to include their clients’ IRD numbers and any TINs on Land Transfer Tax Statements even if the property was or will be a client’s main home. Transferees and transferors of main homes will need to ensure their IRD number and any TINs are provided to their property conveyancer. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Due to the timelines we have been only been able to undertake limited consultation with external stakeholders. Therefore, we are unable to consider additional options stakeholders may have raised before seeking a Cabinet decision on the proposal. Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Enforcement – the option should increase the effective enforcement of current tax rules relating to property transactions and help prevent non-residents from evading foreign tax on their transfer of New Zealand property. • Compliance costs – the option should not unnecessarily increase compliance costs for property conveyancers and transferees and transferors of properties. • Administration costs – the option should not unnecessarily increase administration costs for LINZ and Inland Revenue. Option 1: Status Quo Under the status quo, IRD numbers and overseas tax information (TINs and country of residence) are not required on the Land Transfer Tax Statement if the property was the transferor’s main home or will be the transferee’s main home. Option 2: Require IRD numbers and TINs to be provided on the Land Transfer Tax Statement with an indicator of whether the property was or will be a main home (proposed option). Under this option, IRD numbers and TINs would be required to be provided on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property was or will be a main home. Under this option, transferees and transferors of property would still need to indicate on the Land Transfer Tax Statement whether the property was or will be a main home. However, it is intended to re-draft this test to make it simpler to apply than the existing “main home test”. This option would be the best from an enforcement perspective. The provision of IRD numbers on all property transactions means Inland Revenue will have visibility of situations in which a transaction may be taxable despite involving a main home. Furthermore, the requirement to provide an IRD number on the Land Transfer Tax Statement for main homes may have a deterrent effect on people who may be considering tax evasion through property. Requiring the provision of TINs when transferring main homes without exemptions will help to ensure that data provided to treaty partners is easily available to be matched to the correct person. The retention of an indicator on the Land Transfer Tax Statement for whether a property is a main home would allow Inland Revenue to identify taxpayers who should be sent follow up information and correspondence advising of property tax rules and those who are unlikely to have tax obligations arising from the property transfer. This option would result in a slight increase in compliance costs relative to the status quo as property conveyancers would need to obtain their client’s IRD number and any TINs and include these on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property is a main home. Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 6 IN CONFIDENCE The RIS that was prepared for the 2015 change commented in relation to this option that: “The actual compliance costs likely to be imposed by the proposal have not been accurately determined, but are not expected to be high given that identity verification information is already supplied to LINZ. A conveyancer is likely to spend an additional 1-5 minutes entering information into Landonline, resulting in an additional cost of between $4 and $20 for purchaser and seller.” We do not have further information to suggest whether or not this assessment was correct. In the year ended 30 June 2018 there were 179,178 property transfers. Since the Land Transfer Tax Statement was introduced until 28 February 2019 the main home exemption has been claimed by transferors 27% of the time and by transferees 37% of the time. While this option would increase compliance costs for the 27% of transferors and 37% of transferees who claim the main home exemption (and their respective conveyancers), the provision of IRD numbers or overseas tax information is not an onerous compliance cost. We expect that the vast majority of individuals who own, or will own homes, will already have an IRD number, and be able to find it out relatively simply. Furthermore, the provision of IRD numbers is already required in many other situations such as when a person starts a new job, opens a bank account or switches KiwiSaver provider. Likewise, for homeowners who have a tax residence in another country, and who are not offshore persons, the provision of their TIN and country of tax residence is not expected to be an onerous compliance cost given that this information is now required in other circumstances when dealing with financial institutions (e.g. in order to open a New Zealand bank account). However, there is a risk that as IRD numbers and overseas tax information would be required in more circumstances there may be an increase in instances of property transfers being held up owing to this information not being provided. This option would result in a one-off increase in administration costs for Inland Revenue and LINZ compared to the status quo. These include updating relevant forms, changes to Landonline 4 and slight modifications to the data interface between LINZ and Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue may also need to make some minor system changes to enable more efficient use of the data for compliance purposes. The increased volume of IRD numbers provided will have a corresponding increase on the manual work required by Inland Revenue to correct any IRD numbers provided in error (which may involve checking with the conveyancer). The option may also result in some small one-off administration costs for Statistics New Zealand related to updating systems to handle the changes to the Land Transfer Tax Statement. Inland Revenue and Statistics New Zealand may also need to alter the interface used to transfer some additional or altered Land Transfer Tax Statement information. The total increase in administration costs from this option is not expected to be significant. Option 3: Require IRD numbers and TINs to be provided on the Land Transfer Tax Statement with no indicator of whether the property was or will be a main home. 4 Landonline is an online transaction centre where property professionals can securely search, lodge and update title dealings and survey data. Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Under this option, IRD numbers and TINs would be required to be provided on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property was or will be a main home. However, unlike option 2, there would be no indicator on the form as to whether a property is or will be a main home. While this option would likely be better from an enforcement perspective than the status quo, the lack of an indicator of whether a property was or will be a main home would make it difficult for Inland Revenue to distinguish between taxpayers who should be included in property compliance campaigns from those who are unlikely to have tax consequences under the property tax rules. Like option 2, this option would result in a slight increase in compliance costs relative to the status quo as property conveyancers would need to obtain their client’s IRD number and/or TIN and include this on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property is a main home. Where it is not clear whether a person’s property is a main home, this option would likely reduce compliance costs slightly relative to the status quo as property conveyancers would not need to determine whether a property is a main home. While in many cases it will be obvious whether a property was or will be a main home, it can be difficult to determine in cases when a person owns multiple homes. The administration costs of this option are comparable to option 2. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 2 as it would best enhance the effective enforcement of current tax rules relating to property. While this option would increase compliance and administration costs relative to the status quo, these increases in costs are likely to be low and are justified by the improvements to Inland Revenue’s enforcement of tax rules relating to property. The proposed approach is generally aligned with the Government’s expectations for the design of regulatory systems. However, there has been limited opportunity for affected parties to comment on the proposal before it is formally proposed.

Low Total Monetised Benefit N/A Non-monetised benefits Medium Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 9 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? There might be a small increase in the data quality available to Statistics New Zealand due to Inland Revenue’s improved ability to verify data that has been provided. Acquiring IRD numbers for more transferors and transferees may also improve the ability for additional data to be linked to information gathered from Land Transfer Tax Statements to provide further statistical insights. We do not anticipate that the proposed approach would have any other impacts. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The Government decided to implement the Tax Working Group’s recommendation as soon as possible. Limited consultation on this proposal has been undertaken on the proposed approach owing to these timelines. Feedback from stakeholders has been mixed but all acknowledged the rationale for removing the main home exemption. One stakeholder commented that the proposal would be an improvement on the current process by moving towards a standardised approach for transfers. Another stakeholder commented that the proposal would provide Inland Revenue with richer data on which to enforce the brightline property rules. One stakeholder noted that the current rules had bedded down and that there would be some compliance cost for conveyancing lawyers having to explain the change to clients who would now have to provide their IRD number. They commented that the increase in the number of IRD numbers received would also increase the compliance costs and time involved by Inland Revenue and lawyers to validate and correct any errors in the IRD numbers provided. One stakeholder commented that given the proposal requires more people to provide IRD numbers, this process should be simplified as much as practicable. Two stakeholders also commented that it would be desirable to have the current forms streamlined. A number of submissions were received when the requirement to provide IRD numbers to LINZ as part of the land registration process, but with an exemption for the main home, was being considered in 2015 by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee (FEC). Several submitters to FEC commented that the exemption from providing IRD numbers and overseas tax information for transfers of main homes was problematic. Reasons for this lack of support were that it would increase complexity of the rules and reduce the usefulness of the information for Government. No submitters to the 2015 Bill expressed support for the exemption from providing tax information for transfers of main homes. The proposed option would address those submitters’ concerns that the exemption for transfers of main homes reduces the usefulness of the information for Government. It would address submitters’ concerns around the complexity of the rules to some degree, as the Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 10 IN CONFIDENCE main home indicator is intended to be less complex than the current question relating to whether a property is a main home. Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Following Cabinet approval of the proposed approach, the required amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 will be drafted for inclusion as a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Committee of the whole House stage. The amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 would have a commencement date of 1 January 2020. The proposed option would require new forms to be developed in consultation with key stakeholders and for the required changes to be made in Landonline. Transitional provisions would be necessary to allow for contracts that have been entered into but not settled at commencement. People will have contracted on the basis of the rules at the time of signing and there is the potential for the legislative amendments to affect existing contracts and therefore impose unexpected compliance costs if transitional provisions are not enacted. The transitional provisions in Schedule 1AA of the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 (which introduced the Land Transfer Tax Statements) could serve as a model. For example, it could provide that transfers entered into on or before 1 January 2020 and registered before 1 July 2020 are still eligible for the exemption from providing IRD numbers and overseas tax information for transfers of main homes. Slight modifications would need to be made to the current LINZ/Inland Revenue data interface to reflect the proposed changes in the data being collected. Inland Revenue may also need to make some minor system changes to enable more efficient use of the data for compliance purposes. However, these changes are not expected to be significant. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Monitoring the impact of the new arrangements will be done through assessing how the additional data collected assists with the effective enforcement of the tax rules relating to property. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Officials from Inland Revenue expect that, once the proposals are enacted, affected stakeholders will raise with them and/or LINZ any concerns they have with how the rules are working in practice. Any necessary changes identified as a result could be considered for addition to the Government’s tax policy work programme.
Impact Summary: extending the Targeting Serious Crime information sharing agreement Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for lhe analysis and advice set out in 1his Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for informing final decisions to proceed with changes to be 1aken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis ------------------ Volume of data shared It's currently not possible to know how much data will be shared with the two agencies being included in this agreement extension (that is the Serious Fraud Office and Customs). Although initially the number of requests from the Serious Fraud Office is expected to be low (estimated to be less than 20 requests per year), the potential number of requests from NZ Customs will likely be considerably higher (estimated lo be more than 200 requests per year). The low volume of requests has not influenced the preferred choice. However. in the long term. the flexibility provided by the AISA would provide a more sustainable framework for I :::::~::::~:::n~; 0 :r 5 \_:\_-r;\_:\_:~\_at\_:\_r~m\_e\_:\_·n\_d\_da\_t\_e\_): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ -\_ -\_ -\_ -\_ -~-----·~ I Martin Neyla n Senior Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy - Inland Revenue 20 August 2019 · n:::t1$,1f;•:~12-:;,;}4t!·•~ I n·r,~<;I Su1r11n~11 y: ~~:.,;mdin.1 :h~ T ;.,· t;+-1. ·•·:.: SE-!r i•::•11s (;, i111E-! i11rrn11m:iu11 shuil'I•~ ~Jtl•~~•r ~1111 1 IN CONFIDENCE ' Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides a strict rule of taxpayer i confidentiality, meaning Inland Revenue (IR) is not allowed to share a taxpayer's information with other agencies. Inland Revenue is not authorised to proactively send individual information to other agencies and is also very restricted in its ability to respond to information requests. Responding to requests from other agencies is only permitted where there is an express statutory exoeption to confidentiality, and these exceptions are very limited. In 2014, IR became party to an approved information sharing agreement (AISA) with the New Zealand Police (Police) to help reduce the level of serious crime 1 committed in New Zealand. The original intent behind the implementation of the agreement was to provide an all-of-Government response to law enforcement, which identified, among other things, the need for improved information sharing. Al the time the agreement between IR and the Police was introduced, numerous other government departments in the enforcement area expressed interest in information held by JR to enable them to work more effectively, but for various reasons did not take part in the agreement. More recently. the NZ Customs Service (Customs) and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) demonstrated interest in receiving information from IR for tackling serious crime. The agreement between IR and the Police has proved successful. facilitating the investigation of over 500 cases, and an average cost below S14,000 per year in the last three years of operation. Officials have been looking al ways to facilitate the sharing of IR information with SFO and Customs to further help tackle serious crime. Sharing information with these agencies would enable better use of their resources and achieve improved results in the area of law enforcement. The proposed initiative is to facilitate the sharing of information between IR and the SFO and Customs to assist identification, investigation and prosecution of serious crimes involving fraud and corruption or cross-border crime. ·---·······--------------------------~ 2.2 Who is affected and how? Increased sharing of tax information carries potential societal benefits in the area of law enforcement. The primary benefit of making IR information more available in the law enforcement area is that the Government is better able to enforce its laws in relation to serious crime, including serious financial crime. This improves New Zealand's reputation as a safe place, for New Zealanders as well as overseas parties to deal or transact in and as a country with effective Government institutions. The group affected by this sharing <?.!\_information would be people engaged in serious ~Serious crime is defined in the Serious Crime AISA as an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of four years or more, Treag .Jr~·:~7208' ~ .. ·~ Impact Summary: exterdin~ the Targeting Sed~us Crirr:e information sharing agreement 2 IN CONFIDENCE criminal activity. Implementing information sharing between agencies for targeting serious crime may drive change of behaviour of people in this group, making them less inclined to be involved in serious crime not only within New Zealand, but also overseas, of people who may currently perceive New Zealand as an easy environment for committing crime (cross-border crime usually involves an overseas and a New Zealand party, and since information will be shared with Customs, ii would be easier to track associations). At the same time. it is not , expected that sharing information for serious crime would impact on tax compliance as the ! public is supportive of information sharing for this purpose. Public opinion~ indicates that information should flow freely across Government departments: that serious criminals should not be protected by privacy laws; and that easier sharing of information across the Government would result in more resources being freed up and ' ' increase the detection of people committing serious crimes. At an individual level. people • would like their information to be kept confidential, but at a community level. people believe absolute confidentiality should not be extended to those engaging in illegal behaviour, provided that good processes are in place to manage any sharing of information. The initiative is consistent with the Government's commitment to making communities safer and reducing crime. It also supports the Government's objective of giving the New Zealand Police and the New Zealand Customs Service the resources they need to "crack down" on gangs, organised crime and drug trafficking. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The analysis has considered different models for the sharing of information, which include the flows of information and the structure of the sharing. The sharing should maintain the current state of the information sharing bel\\veen the Police and IR, justified by the successful operation of the current agreement. The information sharing for serious crime only builds a stronger case to get support from the public. Regarding the sharing model structure, a "one-to-many" sharing agreement (meaning one agency, being IR, sharing with all the others), and a ''many-to-many" sharing agreement (meaning sharing occurring between all agencies) have been considered. A one-to-many model is the preferred one, given the legal complexities involved in a many-to-many model. . 1 Regarding the flows of information. a one-way (proactive and reactive) sharing agreement will be introduced between IR and SFO/Customs. This is based on the existing sharing agreement with the Police. IR will provide information to SFO/Customs upon request or I proactively when IR identifies evidence of a potential serious crime relevant to those agencies. The provision of information from the other agencies lo Inland Revenue relies on one of the exceptions to Privacy Principle 11 of the Privacy Act, 3 and therefore has not been included in th~ original or the proposed information sharing. 2 Public consultation undertaken in 2014 for the Serious Clime AISA between IR and NZ Police 3 Privacy Principle t t: Limits on disclosure of personal information -An agency that holds personal information shall not disclose the information to a person or body or agency unless the agency believes, on reasonable grounds, (0) that non-compliance is necessary (i) to avoid prejudice to the maintenance of the law, and (iii) for the protection of the public revenue. -.

Earlier this year, there were changes made to the TAA in relation to the confidentiality rules. However, the impact of those changes on this proposed agreement is not a constraint, but rather an enhancement. One of the changes concerns the reuse of information: "information gathered for one purpose being used for other purposes within Inland Revenue", That change in particular can potentially affect the proposed information sharing agreement positively, making it more flexible and efficient. 4 http:l..'W\\\\l\\v.ssc.govt.nz.,'resourcesiconsult-0tion-state-sector-act-reforrnl :-, cas .JI v:3 7 2no.afl•1:I Impact SlJmm~ry: ~xle1'ldin9 lllE-! ·r .;trgf::!ling Seriovs Crime .,formc:1tion ~h<1ri11g c:19reem entl 4 IN CONFIDENCE Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? In considering the options for this initiative the following criteria have been used to shape the I decision-making process: • Efficiency of administration -gain efficiencies through a more collaborative, cross- agency work, including timeliness of implementation, coverage of agreement (wider inclusion of government agencies), and costs for the Government • Fairness and integrity -maintain the integrity of the tax and benefit systems, and ensure sufficient protection of people's privacy and a proper level of security and transparency • Sustainability of the public sector -provide a framework that is flexible enough to respond to Government's priorities, and facilitate changes going forward. As the problem is a lack of legislative authority to share information between the agencies, there are no non-regulatory options to enable information sharing to occur. The following options have been considered to enable the infonnation sharing: Option One: Status quo I Efficiency of administration: IR is bound by the confidentiality rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994, so the information sharing cannot occur. Fairness and integrity: this option protects people ·s privacy by not sharing taxpayer . information IR holds. On the other hand. for serious crime, being able to share informalion I held by multiple government agencies can help with building a picture more precisely and ' more efficiently. If agencies do not have the flexibility to do so, it may limit or hinder an investigation of serious crime. Sustainability of the public sector: This is not a sustainable option because it does not enable agencies to work together and is nol effective at achieving lhe policy objective. Option Two: Sharing information under an AISA under the Privacy Act, which is allowed for under section 18E(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (preferred option) Efficiency of administration: This option enables cross-agency collaboration and provides a framework that allows subsequent amendments to be made in an efficient manner. Fairness and integrity: The AISA clarifies and improves the rules around how agencies share personal information, while ensuring safeguards are in place to protect an individual's privacy. It would provide certainty around the purpose of information sharing, use of information, and management of privacy risks; it can also modify privacy principles when justified. AISAs provide a transparent approach to sharing, as all agreements are made public and consultation is required for any agreement. Sustsinsbifity of the public sector: An AISA is easier and faster to amend to include sharing of additional information ~nd also including other agencies in comparison to the process tor I 't=l$uf;•::J72C648•l3 Impact Summary: cxtcnoing ll'.C T ~f9~~ing SBfiou~ CfimA infofm~li<1n $h~fin~ ~9f~ttm entl :5 IN CONFIDENCE changing legislation, providing a more future-proof framework for sharing information j Option Three: Legislating specific exceptions to the tax confidentiality rules to enable information sharing between the agencies to occur. Efficiency of administration: This option is time consuming to enact and any subsequent amendment to that legislation would also be time consuming. It's also limited by the fact that · it is very specific. ; I I Fairness and integrity: This option has the advantage of being the most transparent. The information sharing would face Parliamentary scrutiny and would be recorded in primary legislation. Sustainability of the public sector: while this option enables sharing of information between agencies, it is a rigid model and doesn't provide a framework on which other agencies can build on. This is not a sustainable option because ii does not provide the required flexibility going forward. Option Four: Sharing information under section 18F of the Tax Administration Act which requires an Order in Council Efficiency of administration: This option takes about the same time to implement as option 2 (AISA). However, an AISA is considered the most appropriate mechanism to share personal information, even when the share involves some non-personal information. Fairness and integrity: This option ensures sufficient protection of people's privacy and a proper level of security and transparency. It requires consultation with the Privacy Commissioner and affected organisations before an Order in Council is made to enable the information sharing. Sustainability of the public sector: Section 18F is a mechanism more appropriate for sharing non-personal information. This is not the case for serious crime, which involves personal information.

For the reasons outlined in section 3.1 above, the most appropriate mechanism for sharing information in this case, and therefore the proposed approach, is an AtSA (option two). Since there is an AtSA for tackling serious crime between IR and the Police, a decision has been made to extend the agreement to include information sharing with the SFO and Customs. rather than creating a new agreement for the same purpose. The new (extended) agreement will retain the same framework used to share information with the Police, which means the same purpose of sharing and the rules around it will be maintained.

In the case of organised criminal activity, the benefits to society of sharing information outweigh the reduction in privacy of certain individuals and the risks to the voluntary , compliance model on which our tax system is based. This has been confirmed by research undertaken about infonnalion sharing and its impact on compliance, which reports that people's trust in government and compliance would not be affected, as long as the purpose for the information sharing is clearly defined. 5 Serious crime has a number of components that may be taken into account when considering the big picture. Being able to share information held by multiple government agencies can help with building that picture more precisely and more efficiently. This, in turn, will prevent harm to other businesses and individuals, and promote public confidence in the integrity of New Zealand's personal and business environment, benefiting the New Zealand economy as a whole. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The following agencies have been consulted and either support or do not object to the proposed agreement: • the New Zealand Police • the Min is try of Justice • the Treasury • the Department of lhe Prime Minister and Cabinet and • the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner was consul1ed during the initial AISA drafting process and will continue to participate in active consultation with IR. the SFO and Customs as the AISA progresses through public consultation and as operational processes are developed. Two submissions were received from public consultation, both from organisations -the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), and the New Zealand Law Society (NZLS ). Submitters raised very similar concerns to the ones raised in previous consultation on the Serious Crime AISA. The points raised, and the officials' responses are I as follows: I inland Revenue's officers do not have the appropriatG experience or expertise to correclly I identify possible criminal offences outside their area of action (e.g. smvggling or drug 5 ThinkPface, Information Sho,ring anrJ Tax Compfance, How might peop/r, r.h:,nge their l,c,h.,viour?, July 2018 Tr~c ~'--ry:S72:l8i6• .. 3 lmp3ct Summar}·: extending the Targetir.g Serious Crime information sharin~ agreement! HJ IN CONFIDENCE offences). -A small dedica.ted team comprised of experienced investigators with specialised training would be managing the information sharing with the other agencies. In addition to undergoing a 'test for sharing', information would only be shared proactively when identified during the team's normal course of activities. I Using taxpayer information for non-tax purposes unjustifiably limits taxpayers' fundamental rights and undermines the integrity of the tax system. The A/SA extension cmduly infringes I taxpayer's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and the privileges against self-incrimination. - The AISA extension does not change the exercise of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's statutory powers or curtails taxpayers' fundamental rights. Officials believe that the benefits of sharing information for reducing societal harm from criminal activity outweigh the reduction in privacy in those specific cases. The AISA is consistent with the Information Privacy Principles· exceptions in the Privacy Act which already exist alongside the privilege against self-incrimination in the Evidence Act. In addition, the proposal simply extends to Inland Revenue an exception that already applies to most Government agencies, and at the same time provides parameters to control and limit the information sharing. Innocent third parties may be affected by the information sharing and their interests should be protected. -For every request for information, the relevance of obtaining information about linked parties needs to be justified. There is a strict test to be applied before any information can be shared (proactively or on request). A victim's consent should be sought before their personal information is shared. -The 'test for sharing' is applied to ensure the information has relevance to the investigation and the intent of the sharing. In some cases, informing and obtaining consent from the victim may prejudice the investigation and have an adverse effect. In cases of serious crime covered by Customs (e.g. money laundering, drug trafficking) generally there isn't a victim as an individual. In the case of the Serious Fraud Office, the crimes being committed may have multiple victims (e.g. fraud committed against a large group of people) and may be . impractical lo obtain consent from all the victims. People should be informed when providing information to Inland Revenue under compulsion that the information may be provided to other agencies. - Inland Revenue advises taxpayers either at the point of collection (e.g. fonns) or through information published on its website that their information may be shared with other agencies. and that collection is authorised by law. When the information is collected under coercive powers (e.g. sections 17 and 17B of the TAA), Inland Revenue is required lo consider the provenance of information and whether any particular security arrangements are needed, rather than having a blanket restriction on sharing that information. Information obtained under compulsion under sections 171 and 17J of the TAA is not currently shared and is of limited use to other agencies given that the sections restrict how this informalion may be used in court. The agreement extension does not propose to change that, and clarifies that infonnation obtained under these sections would not be shared, unless the other agency has the same power to obtain that information. Further, the AISA includes a provision to dispense with giving notice of adverse action to the individual affected (in accordance with section 96R of the Privacy Act) because giving notice , would "tip off' an alleged serious criminal offender.

It is planned that the AISA will be enacted in the first half of 2020, after an Order in Council is made. IR is the lead agency for the agreement and responsible for introducing 1he 'Request for lnfonnation · requirements 1o the other agencies. This work has been already assessed and requires minor changes to the current process that is used to share infonnation with the Police. System or Te(;hnology Impacts For IR, implementation impacts would be minimal. The current process would be replicated for the other additional agencies, and the same operational units would continue to handle the requests for information utilising existing resources. The proposed changes do not include any systems or technology changes as the information shared is compiled manually on a case-by-case basis and sent by secure email (SeeMail). For the SFO, there would be no or little implementation impact. The SFO is already equipped to receive, store and review information from IR as appropriate. and would use existing channels to continue to do so. Customs would use existing information technology systems and processes to manage information shared by IR, with appropriate mechanisms to ensure confidentiality of taxpayer informalion. Implementation costs For all three agencies, implementation costs would be minimal, and funding will be undertaken within departmental baselines.

IR is required to report to the Privacy Commissioner each year on the operation of the AISA. The report is concerned with whether the agreement is meeting its goals and may cover: • the costs and benefits of sharing • difficulties experienced • audits undertaken • amendments and safeguards put in place • complaints received • number of individuals whose information has been shared • number of transac1ions that have occurred, and • number of adverse actions taken as a result. Reports are administered and stored by the lnfom,ation Sharing Team at IR. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? \_J , AISAs are subject to review by the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner can , review the operation of the agreement on his or her own initiative 12 months after the i Order in Council approving the agreement has been made and at any time that the I Commissioner considers appropriate for subsequent reviews. Any review by the Privacy Commissioner would cover whether the agreement is failing to I meet its goal in facilitating public services, unreasonably infringing privacy, or operating in an unforeseen way. It would also cover whether the costs of sharing are outweighing the benefits. If there are reasonable grounds to believe any of these are occurring, the Privacy Commissioner will prepare a report for the Minister of Revenue, which will also be tabled in Parliament, recommending changes or termination of the agreement.

Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Coversheet: Extending tax exemption for non-resident oil rig and seismic vessel operators Advising agencies Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Decision sought Whether to extend the current income tax exemption for non- resident oil rigs and seismic vessels which is scheduled to expire on 31 December 2019 Proposing Ministers Hon Dr Megan Woods (Energy and Resources), Hon Stuart Nash (Revenue) Su mma r y : Pr o ble m a n d Pr o po se d Ap pr o ac h Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? There is currently an exemption from New Zealand income tax for non-resident-owned oil rigs and seismic vessel operators. The aim of this exemption is to remove a tax distortion that incentivises operators to churn 1 rigs and vessels, thereby slowing resource development, increasing operators’ costs, and reducing tax and royalty revenue. This exemption was first introduced in 2004 for five years and was subsequently extended in 2009 and again in 2014. The most recent extension is due to expire on 31 December 2019. This RIA considers whether the exemption should be further extended. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? This exemption was introduced to discourage oil rigs and seismic vessels from leaving New Zealand before 183 days to avoid being treated as a New Zealand tax resident under a double tax agreement. Extending this exemption would prevent this churning reoccurring. Sec tio n B: Su mma r y Imp a c ts : Be ne fits a n d c o s ts Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The main beneficiaries are petroleum prospectors, explorers and miners with New Zealand petroleum permits, and the Crown. These miners would incur lower costs and undertake greater exploration which would have flow on benefits to the New Zealand economy and tax and royalty revenue. 1 Having one rig leave the country and another enter to complete the work. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Where do the costs fall? Although the exemption will theoretically make the non-resident rig and seismic vessel operators exempt from tax, in practice they were not paying New Zealand income tax anyway as they were leaving New Zealand before 183 days. Extending the exemption has no fiscal cost. If the exemption is left to expire, a reduction in tax revenue forecasts would arise as a result of increased tax deductions from churning. Forecast baselines include an assumption that the exemption would be renewed. Absent that renewal, we anticipate a behavioural change toward churn of rigs and consequential reduction in tax revenue forecasts arising from the expense of that churn. Officials do not anticipate that the rigs would start paying tax if the exemption is not extended. There are also small one- off costs for regulators of extending the exemption. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? The proposal risks leading to increased domestic carbon emissions; however, the impact is expected to be minor, as carbon emissions from New Zealand’s oil and gas production are very small. Given New Zealand’s high environmental standards, the environmental footprint from developing oil, gas and mineral resources in New Zealand is likely to be less than many other countries we would otherwise source them from. As nearly all New Zealand oil is exported, increased New Zealand production will have no effect on the Government’s international commitments. The proposal carries some other environmental risks, but these are low due to New Zealand’s tight regulation and standards. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The proposal is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Sec tio n C: Ev id e nc e c er ta in ty a n d q u ality a ss u ra n ce Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is a degree of uncertainty on the future level of petroleum exploration as this is determined by a number of factors, including the future oil price and other discoveries. However, historical comparison before and after the introduction of the exemption in 2004 provides a high degree of certainty that the policy achieves its desired goal of eliminating tax-driven rig and seismic vessel churning. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Extending tax exemption for non-resident oil rig and seismic vessel operators RIA prepared by Inland Revenue and MBIE and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue and MBIE are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis A constraint affecting the consideration of the options is that of time – the existing tax exemption expires at the end of 2019. Accordingly, any extension of the exemption should be enacted before the end of 2019. A limitation concerning the analysis is that there is some degree of uncertainty regarding the behaviour of rig operators if the exemption were to be removed. This affects our ability to reliably estimate the fiscal impacts of removing the exemption. However, MBIE’s best judgement (based on the rig operators’ behaviour before the introduction of the exemption) is that if the exemption was removed, rig operators are likely to modify their behaviour and begin churning again.

Seismic vessels are used to gather data on potential oil and gas finds, and rigs are used to drill for oil and gas, in the exploration and development stages of petroleum mining. These are very specialist and expensive pieces of equipment that are owned by businesses that specialise in providing these services to petroleum miners who have permits for a specific area. These rigs and vessels do not generally work offshore in winter weather for health and safety reasons. While there is a worldwide industry in rigs and seismic vessels, no New Zealand companies own these assets, so any company seeking to explore natural resources in New Zealand waters needs to use a rig or seismic vessel provided by a non-resident owner. Offshore rigs and seismic vessels owned by non-residents are covered by an income tax exemption that is due to expire on 31 December 2019. Wells generally take between 30 and 90 days to drill and there is significant cost in bringing a rig or vessel to and from New Zealand. Because of this, operators often align their plans in order to conduct their work using the same rig or vessel in the same summer period. There is usually a programme of work that forms the core activities of the rig or vessel, and then there may be opportunistic wells or surveys added because the rig or vessel is already coming. These opportunistic wells or surveys are at particular risk from the expiry of the existing exemption as completing these could result in the rig or vessel being in New Zealand long enough to become a New Zealand tax resident and therefore taxable on income derived from exploration and development activities in New Zealand waters, including from already completed contracts for core activities. In the absence of an exemption these operators leave New Zealand before this time to prevent a New Zealand income tax liability arising. Between 2009 and 2017, there have been nine non-resident offshore drilling rigs operating in New Zealand. The average length of stay of these rigs has been 315 days. By contrast, between 2000 and 2005 (before the exemption was introduced), no rigs stayed in New Zealand waters beyond six months. At this early stage, we anticipate at least one rig to be operating within New Zealand waters in 2019/20. Twelve seismic vessels have operated in New Zealand since 2009, with an average duration of 108 days, and with one high-value survey extending through to 200 days. Before 2005, the average length of stay was around four months. Maintaining the exemption removes a barrier for lengthier stays (which have been fewer but are typically more lucrative). There have been 73 offshore wells drilled since 1 January 2009. Twenty of these wells have been exploratory in nature, with some hosting sub-commercial discoveries. All of these efforts, successful or not, improve our knowledge of the Crown mineral estate, which is critical to making economic discoveries. A substantial discovery has the potential to significantly benefit the economy and the Government’s fiscal position by way of direct economic benefits, royalties, increased tax revenue, and other indirect benefits (e.g. supporting goods and services and consumption). It is likely that a number of wells would not have been drilled without the tax exemption, as 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 6 IN CONFIDENCE the application of income tax would likely have created too large a barrier (due to the high cost of mobilisation and demobilisation and the associated delays caused) for discretionary wells. Mobilisation and demobilisation costs can exceed $750,000 per day and, depending on where the rig comes from, the transition time and associated cost can be significant and in the order of $14 million. Extending the exemption is likely to ensure oil and gas prospecting, exploration and production is not impeded compared with letting the exemption expire. This increases the chance of successful discoveries and consequentially oil and gas production, which increases economic development activity, and tax and royalty revenue. Increased oil and gas production could result in an increase in carbon emissions. However, given New Zealand’s high environmental standards, the environmental footprint from developing oil, gas and mineral resources in New Zealand is likely to be less than many other countries we would otherwise source them from. Therefore, from a global emissions perspective, developing some of these resources in New Zealand could provide better environmental outcomes. In the context of climate change, gas is internationally recognised as a transition fuel. In particular, natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide than coal when used to generate electricity. Thus, gas could play a role in New Zealand meeting its climate commitments in the short-term. Furthermore, New Zealand’s gas reserves are only sufficient to cover a decade of annual gas demand at current demand levels. To prevent the situation of gas reserve depletion interrupting our energy supply, new sources of gas would need to be found within the next few years. This could be by way of new gas finds, or extension of existing fields, but either of these would involve some lead-time to production. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand generally taxes non-residents on income that has a source in New Zealand. However, our double tax agreements (DTAs) provide that non-residents are only taxable on their New Zealand-sourced business profits if they have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. Many of our DTAs (such as the New Zealand/United States DTA) have a specific rule providing that a non-resident enterprise involved in exploring for natural resources only has a permanent establishment in New Zealand if they are present for a particular period of time, often 183 days in a year. Once a non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, they are taxed on all their New Zealand business profits starting from their first day in New Zealand. While this 183 day rule does not apply outside of DTAs, in practice, no rigs or seismic vessels come from non-DTA countries. Ordinarily, a broad-base, low-rate framework applies to the tax system. A consistent application of this framework will normally minimise any distortions caused by tax rules. However, with seismic vessels and rigs used for exploration and development work, the normal tax rules do not provide the right outcome. The exemption was introduced to address an issue caused by this DTA provision – rigs and seismic vessels used in petroleum exploration and development were leaving New Zealand waters before the 183 day threshold was reached to avoid being subject to New Zealand tax. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 7 IN CONFIDENCE This meant that rigs and vessels would leave before 183 days and a different rig or vessel was mobilised to complete the exploration programme, if it was completed. This increased the cost for companies engaged in exploration and delayed exploration drilling and any subsequent discovery of oil or gas. It also meant that there was no income tax collected from owners of rigs and seismic vessels. Because of the limited supply of offshore drilling rigs, it could also result in exploration activity not taking place when it otherwise would. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? If the status quo is maintained (i.e. the temporary exemption is left to lapse at the end of 2019), it is likely that rigs and seismic vessels would resume leaving New Zealand waters before 183 days, so that the operators are not subject to tax. This would mean that the cost of offshore exploration and development activity would increase for New Zealand companies that engage offshore rig and seismic vessel services, as a new rig would have to be engaged to continue exploration and development work. Mobilising and demobilising such rigs has a cost of around $14 million per rig. This would have flow-on effects for tax revenue, as the cost would be deductible to the New Zealand company. The churn would also cause a delay in any potential revenue from successful exploration and development activity, which would have an impact on the present value of royalties received. However, this would be partially offset by the delay in the deductions associated with that additional exploration and development activity. The underlying cause of the problem is that the normal tax rules increase costs for business by creating an incentive for seismic vessels and rigs to “churn”, that is, move in and out of New Zealand waters within a 183-day period where income is exempt under many of our DTAs. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? It is not possible to efficiently resolve this issue by renegotiating New Zealand’s DTAs. These DTAs are part of an international framework and it is not feasible to alter this particular article, particularly given this would require renegotiation of each of the DTAs which New Zealand is currently party to and would be dependent on our treaty partners being agreeable to such a change. New Zealand is a global advocate for fossil fuel subsidy reform. While there are a range of definitions of what constitutes a subsidy, the most widely internationally accepted definition is that adopted by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. New Zealand has no fossil fuel subsidies as this term is defined by the WTO. The non-resident rig and seismic vessel income tax exemption has been in place since 2004 and is not considered a subsidy. This position was also confirmed in a 2015 peer review of fossil fuel subsidies by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Targeted consultation has been undertaken with the oil and gas industry representative body, the Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand (PEPANZ), which supports making the exemption permanent. The Treasury and the Ministry for the Environment support extending the exemption for a further five years to balance the need for business certainty while leaving scope for future changes at a time when tax and environmental policy is evolving. Sec tio n 3 : O p tio n s id e n tific a tio n 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Three options have been considered: • Option 1 – Status quo: Do not extend the exemption. The current exemption will expire on 31 December 2019. After this date non-resident oil rig and seismic vessel operators will be subject to New Zealand income tax from the day they arrive if they are present in New Zealand for at least 183 days. • Option 2 – Temporary exemption: Extend the current exemption for a further five years. • Option 3 – Permanent exemption: Remove the expiry date from the current exemption so it applies permanently. Both options 2 and 3 address the problem by effectively removing the 183 day test so that non-resident operators do not face an incentive to churn rigs and vessels by leaving New Zealand prior to 183 days. These options are mutually exclusive and are the same options considered when the exemption has previously been due to expire in 2009 and 2014. No non-regulatory options are possible as the liability for income tax is determined through legislation. Option 2 and option 3 are both unique to New Zealand. Officials are not aware of any other country having a similar exemption due to a combination of factors, such as: not having an offshore petroleum industry; having a sufficiently large market to have domestic owned rig and seismic vessel operators; being closer to other countries, so that mobilisation costs are much lower; and having different wording in their applicable DTAs, so that the 183 day threshold does not apply. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The options have been assessed against the following criteria: 1. Economic efficiency and neutrality – The tax rules should generate funding for Government expenditure rather than influence whether a rig or seismic vessel remains in New Zealand. The use of tax instruments to implement non-tax outcomes should be approached with caution. The level of oil and gas exploration and development activity should be determined by what is economically efficient in conjunction with wider Government policies, and not by unintended consequences of tax rules. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 9 IN CONFIDENCE 2. Certainty of tax treatment – The tax rules should provide certainty of tax treatment. 3. Administration costs – Administration costs should be minimised as far as possible. In addition to costs arising to government agencies under the option, this includes policy and law-making costs. 4. Compliance costs – Compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. Criterion one is the most important as tax should not be influencing petroleum miners’ decisions to act in ways that are economically inefficient, and care should be taken before using tax rules to implement non-tax policies, where other more direct, and transparent measures may be available. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Renegotiating New Zealand’s DTAs to increase or reduce the number of days an operator can be in New Zealand without becoming a tax resident was not within scope. This would require individual renegotiation with each of New Zealand’s treaty partners and would be inconsistent with international norms. This could not be achieved before expiry of the current exemption if it could be achieved at all, therefore this option is considered impractical. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4 : Imp ac t An a ly s is Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Status Quo – Letting exemption expire Option 2 – Temporary exemption Option 3 – Permanent exemption Efficiency/neutrality 0 ++ An exemption will prevent tax rules incentivising operators to leave New Zealand prior to 183 days. The level of exploration and development will be determined by the market and specific Government policies rather than an unintended consequence of tax rules. Petroleum miners able to coordinate rigs and seismic vessels and incur lower planning costs, thus improving efficiency. ++ As with the temporary exemption. Certainty 0 + Petroleum miners and operators will have certainty of tax treatment for a 5-year planning horizon. ++ As with the temporary exemption, with the benefit of additional certainty for petroleum miners and operators planning beyond the expiry of a temporary exemption. Compliance costs 0 + No impact on tax compliance costs (as no tax obligation on operators with or without exemption) but reduction in costs of complying with other Government regulation for operators and petroleum miners. ++ As with the temporary exemption, with the benefit of less compliance costs for exploration and development near to expiry of a temporary exemption. Administration costs 0 + Consistent with current (pre-December 2019) treatment, so less update needed to internal and external knowledge bases and other guides. ++ As with the temporary exemption, as well as removing need for further update when the temporary exemption expired, and only one-off policy and law-making costs. Overall assessment 0 ++ This option is significantly better than the status quo, as tax will not be an impediment to operators acting in an efficient manner. This option will not impose any additional costs on government or taxpayers. However, it is not the preferred option as it creates less certainty for taxpayers and imposes costs on officials, Parliament and stakeholders in reconsidering the exemption each time it expires. ++ This is the preferred option. It has all the benefits of option 2 with the additional benefits of providing greater certainty for stakeholders and fewer administration costs as a result of not needing to periodically renew the exemption. Key: ++ Much better than doing nothing/the status quo - Worse than doing nothing/the status quo + Better than doing nothing/the status quo - - Much worse than doing nothing/the status quo 0 About the same as doing nothing/the status quo 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident of fshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 5 : Co n clu s io n s 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Having an exemption beyond 31 December 2019 is significantly better than letting the exemption lapse and both Inland Revenue and MBIE recommend that this exemption is permanent rather than for a further five year period. As these rigs are planned well in advance, the additional certainty of a permanent exemption is supported by the petroleum industry. An exemption removes a tax distortion that results in economically inefficient outcomes, and imposes no ongoing revenue cost to the Government, while negative environmental impacts are expected to be low. Removing the churn of oil rigs and seismic vessels has a number of benefits, including: • opportunistic exploration not being hindered by the lack of availability of rigs and vessels; • additional exploration increasing petroleum miners’ and the Government’s knowledge of the mineral estate; • reduced costs of petroleum exploration and development resulting in higher revenue from taxes and royalties; • increased domestic emissions from more production (but noting some reduction in carbon emissions as a result of fewer rigs and vessels travelling to and from New Zealand); and • rigs and vessels may stay in New Zealand beyond 183 days for repairs and maintenance which would increase output of supporting industries. There is a high degree of confidence in the assumptions and evidence used in this RIA as this exemption is already in place and data before and after its introduction can be compared. Making the exemption permanent will significantly reduce the policy and parliamentary resources required to be dedicated to this issue. As the exemption has been in place since 2004, fiscal forecasts include the ongoing impact of this exemption. If the exemption is not extended increased churn costs would result in forecast tax revenue needing to be reduced by approximately $4m per year. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident of fshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators | 12 IN CONFIDENCE 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach 2 $14 million cost / 0.06 (discount rate applied in RIA) = $233.33m rounded to $233 million. 3 $4 million tax cost / 0.06 (discount rate applied in RIA) = $66.67 million rounded to $67 million.

The preferred approach is likely to increase oil and gas exploration and development (or not decrease it) compared with the status quo. This increases the chance of successful discoveries and consequentially increased oil and gas production, which increases economic development activity, tax revenue and royalties. Increased oil and gas production risks increasing carbon emissions. However, nearly all of New Zealand oil production is exported, so this increased production would have no effect on the Government’s international commitments. Officials consider the impact of increased carbon emissions would be minor as the production in New Zealand of oil and gas has very little impact on consumption of oil and gas and, relative to international output, New Zealand production is so small that increases in production will not affect the world price. Other environmental risks are also low due to New Zealand’s tight regulation and standards which have seen over 200 offshore wells drilled since the 1960s without a significant incident. As New Zealand is a net importer of oil, any increase in domestic production is likely to reduce the balance of payments deficit. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The preferred option is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Non-monetised benefits Medium Medium 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident of fshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6 : Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option would involve amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 to remove the 31 December 2009 expiry date. This would continue the operation of the exemption, broadly as it has applied since 2004. As with other legislative changes this would be signalled in a Tax Information Bulletin shortly after the enactment of the bill containing the proposals as well as other documents published throughout the parliamentary process. Owing to the high mobilisation costs, the schedules for rigs and seismic vessels are frequently planned well in advance of the rig or vessel arriving in New Zealand. Thus, the industry would welcome timely advice of a Cabinet decision on the exemption. Cabinet approval of the preferred option would allow the necessary legislative changes to be included in the upcoming tax omnibus bill which is expected to be enacted in 2019. A press release is intended to be released after the Cabinet decision. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There are no risks with implementing a temporary or permanent exemption as this would be effectively continuing the law as it has applied since 2004. If there are delays in announcing an extension of the exemption and inclusion in a bill, or if the Government decides not to extend the exemption, this risks creating uncertainty in the market which could result in reduced operation of non-resident rigs and seismic vessels in New Zealand. If the preferred option is supported by Cabinet but not included in the upcoming bill there may not be a suitable tax bill enacted before the end of 2019 that could include this amendment. This would require the amendment to either be included as a Supplementary Order Paper to another bill – which would not allow the same ability for public consultation – or for the amendment to be enacted retrospectively after the end of 2019 – which provides less certainty for the petroleum industry and is less desirable than prospective legislation. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident of fshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lu a tio n a n d rev ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? MBIE monitors the number and duration of rigs and seismic vessels operating in New Zealand. Comparison of behaviour prior to and after the 2004 introduction of the exemption suggests that the exemption is successful in removing the incentive to leave New Zealand prior to 183 days. As the exemption is in place now, if extended we do not expect any change in behaviour. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? MBIE will continue to monitor the petroleum mining sector more generally. As the exemption has been working as intended since 2004, if the exemption is permanently extended it is not anticipated that further review will be necessary which will reduce administration costs compared with a temporary exemption, and reduce compliance costs compared with letting the exemption expire. Inland Revenue and MBIE have ongoing interaction with the petroleum mining sector which will provide that sector with the ability to raise concerns in the unlikely event they arise. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21
1 April 2019 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Base erosion and profit shifting – administrative measures Introduction This is the final version of the special report on administrative measures for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The rules were enacted on 27 June 2018 in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. This special report was also published in the April 2019 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 31 Number 3). Contents Definit ion o f large mult inat ional group ...................................................................................2 Requesting information from large mult inat ional groups ........................................................4 Collecting unpaid tax from large multinational groups .......................................................... 10 Country-by-Country reports .................................................................................................. 11 2 DEFINITION OF LARGE MULTINATIONAL GROUP Section YA 1 The new legislation introduces the term “large multinational group”, which is relevant as Inland Revenue’s increased powers to assess tax or collect information only apply to members of large multinational groups. Background The rules in the new legislation that increase Inland Revenue’s powers to assess tax or collect information are limited so they only apply to members of large multinational groups. These rules are: • The permanent establishment anti-avoidance rule in new section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which can only be applied to members of large multinational groups. • New section HD 30 which allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to collect tax that is owed by a non-resident member of a large multinational group from a wholly-owned group member who is a New Zealand resident or that has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. • New section 17(1CB) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 extends the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s powers to request information so they also apply to information or documents relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group and that is held by any member of that large multinational group, including group members who are outside New Zealand. • New section 21BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 can be used to apply consequences to a member of a large multinational group that fails to provide an adequate response to a section 17 request for information or documents within a reasonable timeframe. These consequences enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a tax assessment based on the information she has available and to prevent information that was requested, but not provided to the Commissioner, from being admitted as evidence in a dispute or court proceeding. • New section 139AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the ability for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to apply a civil penalty of up to $100,000 on a member of a large multinational group that does not co-operate with requests for information. • Large multinational groups whose ultimate owner is a New Zealand resident parent entity are required to file a country-by-country report with Inland Revenue under new section 78G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Key features A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 as a consolidated accounting group that has annual consolidated group revenue for the preceding income year or period prior to the relevant income year of more than EUR €750m (which is the exemption threshold described in paragraph 5.52 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines). 3 This EUR €750m revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define the large mult inat ional groups that are required to file Country-by-Country reports with relevant tax authorities. Example M is a multinational group which has a member which is resident in New Zealand. M’s consolidated accounts reported revenues of US $1.8b for the year ending 31 December 2018. Because these revenues are more than EUR €750m on 31 December 2018, for M’s next income year beginning 1 January 2019, M will satisfy the definition of a large multinational group. To qualify as a large multinational group, the group must also have a member resident in New Zealand or income with a source in New Zealand and a member who is resident in a country or territory other than New Zealand. There is no requirement that the group members be companies, so the revenues for consolidated group could include revenues that are earned through partnerships or trusts. 4 REQUESTING INFORMATION FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL GROUPS Sections 17(1CB), 21BA, 139AB and 142GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The new legislation amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with additional powers to request information from large multinational groups in order to assist a tax investigation of the relevant multinational. Background To combat BEPS, Inland Revenue needs to be able to properly investigate complex tax positions taken by multinationals. One of the main practical difficulties that Inland Revenue has encountered in conducting these investigations is a lack of willingness by some mult inat ionals to provide information. The information required in an investigation can include legal contracts and evidence about commercial and economic activities carried on by offshore entities. This information is often held by an offshore group member of the multinational, rather than in a New Zealand company or office. For example, it is common for multinationals to prepare and retain transfer pricing documentation within a specialist transfer pricing unit in their head office in another jurisdiction. As the OECD notes in paragraph 5.15 of chapter V of their Transfer Pricing Guidelines: “It may often be the case that the documents and other information required for a transfer pricing audit will be in the possession of members of the MNE group other than the local affiliate under examination. Often the necessary documents will be located outside the country whose tax administration is conducting the audit. It is therefore important that the tax administration is able to obtain directly or through information sharing, such as exchange of information mechanisms, information that extends beyond the country’s borders.” In addition to transfer pricing, Inland Revenue needs to access offshore information to apply other international tax rules. These include the permanent establishment rules which determine whether New Zealand can tax the business profits of a non-resident company (and if so, how much of that profit New Zealand can tax), and the general anti-avoidance rule, which may be used to challenge cross-border tax avoidance. Key features The new rules in relation to requesting information only apply to members of large multinational groups. A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 as a consolidated accounting group that has annual consolidated group revenue exceeding EUR €750m for the preceding income year or period prior to the relevant income year. The group must also have a member resident in New Zealand or income with a source in New Zealand and a member who is resident in a country or territory other than New Zealand. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has a power under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to request specific information or documents from a person as part of a tax 5 investigation. This person would typically be resident of New Zealand or have a physical presence such as an office in New Zealand. New section 17(1CB) expands the scope of the existing section 17 power by allowing it to also be used to request information or documents that are held by any member of a large multinational group. This includes members that are non-residents, such as a parent or a sister company. The information must be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group, as opposed to an investigation concerning the tax position of someone who is outside the group such as a customer. For multinational tax investigations the relevant information sought will typically be about companies rather than natural persons. In some cases customer information may be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group. For example a contract with a customer may be relevant to applying the transfer pricing rules to determine whether a related party arrangement has arm’s length conditions and an arm’s length amount of consideration. New section 21BA is designed to bolster Inland Revenue’s ability to require multinationals to comply with a request for information under section 17 by setting out some specific consequences that can be applied if the multinational fails to provide an adequate response within a reasonable timeframe. These consequences enable the Commissioner to make a tax assessment based on the information she has available and to prevent information that was requested, but not provided to the Commissioner, from being admitted as evidence in a dispute or court proceeding. New section 139AB provides the ability for Inland Revenue to apply a civil penalty of up to $100,000 on large multinational groups which do not co-operate with requests for information. Application date The amendments to insert new sections 17(1CB), 21BA, 139AB and 142GB into the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply fro m 27 June 2018, which is the date that the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act received Royal assent. This means that these new administrative powers and penalties can be used by Inland Revenue after 27 June 2018 when pursuing current or new investigations, even if those investigations include income years prior to the date of enactment. Detailed analysis Section 17(1CB): Allowing Inland Revenue to request information held by non-resident members of large multinational groups New section 17(1CB) allows the Commissioner to apply section 17(1) to request information or documents that are in the knowledge, possession, or control of a member of a large multinational group, including members that are non-resident. The requested information must be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group, as opposed to an investigation concerning the tax position of someone who is outside the group 6 such as a customer. For mult inat ional tax invest igations the relevant informat ion sought will typically be about companies rather than natural persons. In some cases customer information may be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group. For example a contract with a customer may be relevant to applying the transfer pricing rules to determine whether a related party arrangement has arm’s length conditions and an arm’s length amount of consideration. Although section 17(1CB) can be used to request information from any member of the large multinational group, in practice, it is anticipated that the Commissioner would request the information from the group member who is resident or potentially subject to tax in New Zealand. In some cases, that group member may already hold or be able to access (e.g. through a shared internal document system) the information themselves. If the group member does not hold or have access to the information themselves, they will need to source the required information from other members of their group and then pass on the requested information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. For example, the Commissioner could ask a New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational corporation to provide transfer pricing documentation that was held by their offshore parent. The New Zealand subsidiary would ask their parent to provide this documentation to them, and they would then supply it to the Commissioner. Inland Revenue understands that large mult inational groups typically have processes whereby information requests from tax authorities are escalated and approved by their head office (this can include cases where the relevant information is already held in New Zealand). The head office will have the authority to require the other group members to provide the information. Further information about Inland Revenue’s operational procedures for issuing notices under section 17 is available in Operational Statement OS 13/02 1 which outlines the procedures. Alt hough this Operational Statement has not been updated to reflect the new section 17(1CB) the intention of section 17(1CB) is simply to expand the scope of Inland Revenue’s existing section 17 power so it also applies to information held by any member of a large mult inational group. The existing operational procedures include: • Where information is to be demanded under section 17, a notice will be issued in writing. Generally a section 17 notice will only be issued following a failure to provide information previously requested or where specific issues have been identified and attempts to resolve these issues have failed. • The Commissioner will only require disclosure of information considered necessary or relevant and that is reasonably required in the circumstances of the case. The Commissioner will be reasonable in relation to the quantity of information sought and the timeframe for providing that information. Reasonable time will be allowed where there is genuine difficulty in obtaining and/or providing the information requested. Section 21BA: Consequences from failure to provide information New section 21BA is designed to bolster Inland Revenue’s ability to require multinationals to comply with a request for information under section 17 by setting out some specific consequences that can be applied if the multinational fails to provide an adequate response 1 http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/op-statements/os-1302-sec-17-notices.html 7 within a reasonable timeframe. These consequences enable the Commissioner to make a tax assessment based on the information she has available and to prevent information that was requested, but not provided to the Commissioner, from being admitted as evidence in a dispute or court proceeding. It is similar to section 21 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which can be applied in relation to requests for information from a person claiming a deduction for a payment that the person has made to an offshore person. New section 21BA applies when all of the following requirements are met: The Commissioner has requested, under section 17, information or documents from a large multinational group member and the information relates to the large multinational group or to a member of the large multinational group; and That group member has failed to provide a response within three months, or has provided a misleading, incomplete or otherwise inadequate response; and The Commissioner has provided a further notice to the group member and the member has still failed to provide a sufficient response within 1 month of the further notice. If these requirements are met section 21BA allows the Commissioner to impose the following consequences on the large multinational group: • the Commissioner may rely on information that she holds to make a tax assessment of the group member or another member of the large multinational group and to apply any relevant criminal or civil penalt ies to the large mult inat ional group. Any result ing assessment should be soundly based on the law and the information that is available to the Commissioner. • If the large multinational group disputes the assessment or penalties the requested information will not be allowed as evidence in the dispute in a court proceeding (unless a court or authority determines that the information request was unreasonable and admitting the evidence is necessary to avoid manifest injustice). Subsection 21BA(1) outlines the scenarios where section 21BA can be applied. Subparagraph (a) deals with the case where no response is provided within three months. Subparagraph (b) deals with cases where a response is provided but the Commissioner considers the response to be misleading, including where relevant informat ion has been omitted from the response. Subparagraph (c) deals with cases where the response omits the information that the Commissioner requires to check compliance with the transfer pricing rules or attributing income to a permanent establishment. Subparagraph (c) can apply regardless of whether or not the relevant information is in the knowledge, possession, or control of the member. This ensures the consequences under section 21 can still be applied where the information does not exist because the multinational group has not prepared transfer pricing documentation or has not attempted to calculate the profits attributable to a permanent establishment. In the absence of this subparagraph, multinationals would be incentivised not to prepare or retain this information. 8 Subparagraph (d) deals with any other case where a response has been provided but the Commissioner does not consider the response fulfils the requirement of the section 17 request. Civil penalty for failure to provide the requested information New section 139AB provides the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to impose a civil penalty of up to $100,000 on large multinational groups which fail to comply with a section 17(1CB) request for information or documents. Section 17(1CB) is explained above, but for this section to apply the information or document must be relevant to the taxation of the large multinational group and be in the knowledge, possession, or control of the member or another member of the large multinational group. Like other civil penalties, the civil penalty in section 139AB is treated as an additional tax liability for the purpose of late payment penalties and the use of money interest rules. Section 142GB provides that the due date for the civil penalty is the date specified by the Commissioner in the notice of the assessment of the penalty but which must be at least 30 days after the date the notice is issued. Criminal penalties cannot typically be applied in relation to a request made in relation to information held by another member of the large multinational group under section 17(1CB). The criminal penalties in section 143 and 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are not modified by the new legislation. There are some existing defences which mean the criminal penalties in section 143(2) and 143A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 do not apply when the information is not in the knowledge, possession or control of the person or a non-resident who is controlled by the person. 9 Example As part of an investigation of transfer pricing positions taken by S Co, a New Zealand subsidiary of a large multinational group, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue asks the New Zealand subsidiary to provide certain transfer pricing documentation including the local file of S Co and certain information from the local file of H Co, a group member in Singapore which has entered into transfer pricing arrangements with S Co. S Co provides their local file but does not provide any of the requested information from the local file of H Co. On 1 August, the Commissioner provides in writing a section 17 notice to S Co to formally request certain information from the local file of H Co. S Co does not respond to the request. On 1 November (3 months after the issue of the section 17 notice), the Commissioner provides a second notice to notify that if S Co does not provide the further information by 1 December (30 days after the second notice was issued) that section 21BA may be applied. S Co responds indicating it is not able to provide the requested information. The Commissioner makes an assessment of S Co based on the information available in S Co’s local file as well as other information on comparable arrangements from databases and issues a notice of proposed assessment to S Co stating that she has applied section 21BA(2) when making this assessment as she does not have access to the information requested from H Co’s local file. The assessment is for additional tax of $4m as well as a civil penalty of $100,000 under section 139G from failing to comply with the section 17 request. Due to section 21BA(3), S Co will typically be unable to use the transfer pricing documentation from H Co’s local file that was previously requested and not provided to the Commissioner to dispute the Commissioner’s assessment of S Co’s tax positions. 10 COLLECTING UNPAID TAX FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL GROUPS Section HD 30 Background Inland Revenue has strong powers to collect revenue from persons who are residents of New Zealand or who have a physical presence here. However, it can be difficult for Inland Revenue to collect tax from non-resident companies that have no physical presence in New Zealand, including in cases where they are a member of a large multinational group which does have a subsidiary or permanent establishment in New Zealand. Key features New section HD 30 will allow Inland Revenue to collect tax owed by a non-resident member of a large multinational group from another wholly-owned group member who is a New Zealand resident or that has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. The rule does this by treating the other group member as an agent for the unpaid tax of the principal member (the non-resident) that owes the tax. The rule will only apply if the principal member (the non-resident) fails to pay the unpaid tax and if the Commissioner notifies the wholly-owned group member that they will be treated as an agent for the unpaid tax. The agent can be a non-resident who is treated as having a permanent establishment in New Zealand under the new section GB 54 (Arrangements involving establishments and non- resident businesses). The agent will have the same dispute rights as the principal member. The rights of an agent are given by section 44 of the Tax Administration Act and include rights of objection under section 44(3) to an assessment under section 44(2). Application date New section HD 30 applies from 27 June 2018, which is the date that the Act received the Royal assent. This means that these new powers can be used by Inland Revenue after 27 June 2018 when pursuing current or new investigations, even if those investigations cover income years prior to the date of enactment. 11 COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY REPORTS Section 78G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background One of the OECD’s BEPS recommendations was to require large multinational groups (those with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR €750m or more in the previous financial year) to provide a Country-by-Country report which contains certain high-level information on the groups’ global activities to tax authorities who would then exchange this informat ion with each other. The following aggregate information will need to be collected for 2016 and subsequent years for each jurisdiction in which the impacted groups operate: • gross revenues (broken down into related party and unrelated party categories); • profit (loss) before income tax; • income tax paid (on cash basis); • income tax accrued (current year); • stated capital; • accumulated earnings; • number of employees; and • tangible assets other than cash and cash equivalents. In addition, impacted groups will need to list all of their entities that are resident in each jurisdiction, noting also the main business activity of each entity. This information will assist tax authorities in providing them with a starting point for assessing risk and potentially requesting more detailed information that could be used to investigate a mult inat ional’s tax posit ion. Inland Revenue requires New Zealand headquartered multinational groups with annual consolidated group revenue of EUR €750m or more in the previous financial year to file a Country-by-Country report for all income years beginning on or after 1 January 2016. This requirement currently applies to about 20 multinational groups, who have been notified by Inland Revenue. A specific legislative provision to require multinationals to file Country-by-Country reports is not strictly necessary as Inland Revenue is already able to use section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enforce these requirements. A specific provision is useful because it will provide a more explicit signal to the affected multinationals and other countries of New Zealand’s commitment to Country-by-Country reporting. For example, accounting firms produce information about each country’s relevant reporting requirements and they may not realise New Zealand is requiring Country-by-Country reports to be prepared and filed if they are not mentioned in our relevant tax legislation. Section 17 allows the Commissioner to request a taxpayer to provide specific information. 12 Application date Section 78G applies from 27 June 2018, which is the date that the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act entered into force. For the periods from 1 January 2016 to 27 June 2018, Inland Revenue will continue to use the existing requirement in section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to require the affected New Zealand headquartered multinational groups to provide Country-by-Country reports. Detailed analysis New section 78G applies to large multinational groups with an ultimate owner who is a resident of New Zealand. A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 as a consolidated accounting group that has annual consolidated group revenue of more than EUR €750m (which is the exemption threshold described in paragraph 5.52 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines). This EUR €750m revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define the large multinational groups that are required to file Country-by-Country reports with relevant tax authorities. The revenue threshold is measured using the consolidated accounts for the preceding income year or period prior to the relevant income year. Example X Co is a resident of New Zealand and is the parent company of a multinational group. X Co’s consolidated accounts reported revenues of NZ $1.2b, which exceeds EUR €750m for the year ending July 2018. For their next income year ending July 2019, X Co will be required to file a Country-by-Country report with Inland Revenue. In the income year ending July 2019 X Co’s consolidated accounts has reported revenues of NZ $1.1b, which for that year is less than EUR €750m. For their next income year ending July 2020, X Co will not be required to file a Country-by-Country report. To be a “large multinational group” under section YA 1 of New Zealand’s legislation, the group must also have a member resident in New Zealand or income with a source in New Zealand and a member who is resident in a country or territory other than New Zealand. Unlike some other provisions in Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Act 2018) which apply to all large multinational groups (as defined in section YA 1), the Country- by-Country reporting requirement in section 78G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 only applies to large multinational groups whose ultimate owner is a resident of New Zealand (approximately 20 groups). The “ultimate owner” is the parent entity that is required to prepare consolidated accounts that includes their subsidiaries (these consolidated accounts will include consolidated amounts from the other group members) and for which there is no other entity that owns directly or indirectly a controlling interest in the parent whereby that other entity would be required to prepare consolidated accounts that include the parent ent ity. 13 New Zealand’s financial reporting requirements currently require large entities (including companies, partnerships and limited partnerships) to prepare accounts regardless of whether the entity is listed on a stock exchange. For these preparation requirements “large” is defined in the Financial Reporting Act 2013 as entities that earn over NZ$30m of consolidated revenues (which is smaller than EUR 750m) or that have over NZ$60m of consolidated assets in the previous two years. New Zealand is a relatively small jurisdiction which allows Inland Revenue to readily identify any large organisation headquartered here that should be subject to Country-by-Country reporting requirements. In the very unlikely event that such an organisation did not prepare consolidated financial statements, Inland Revenue would use section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specifically request this information. Example Y Co is a resident of New Zealand and is a member of a large multinational group. However, Y Co is a subsidiary of Z Co which is a resident of Australia. Z Co is the parent company of the multinational group. Y Co will not be required to file a country-by-country report in New Zealand, but Z Co is required to file a Country-by-Country report with the Australian Tax Office in Australia. Inland Revenue will receive Z Co’s Country-by-Country report information when these reports are exchanged under the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the exchange of Country-by-Country Reports. Large multinational groups with an ult imate owner that is a resident of New Zealand are required to disclose a Country-by-Country report to the Commissioner that includes: • The information described in Annex III of Chapter V of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. This annex includes the OECD template for the Country-by-Country report. • Other information as may be required by the Commissioner. This provides flexibility for future changes to the Country-by-Country report or any additional information that the Commissio ner may require. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines include a template for the Country-by-Country report and instructions and definitions for the compiling the information in the template in Annex III of Chapter V of the guidelines. The deadline for filing a Country-by-Country report is within the 12 months after the 12 month period to which the information in the report relates. For example a Country-by-Country report relating to 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 would need to be filed with Inland Revenue on or before 31 December 2020. Inland Revenue would then exchange this report with other countries by July 2021.
1 April 2019 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Base erosion and profit shifting – hybrid and branch mismatch rules Introduction This is the final version of the special report on the hybrid and branch mismatch rules for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The rules were enacted on 27 June 2018 in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. This special report was also published in the April 2019 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 31 Number 3).

This is often referred to as double non- taxation. The OECD, as part of Action 2 of its BEPS Action Plan, has made a series of recommendations for domestic law changes to help countries neutralise the tax advantages from hybrid and branch mismatches. These recommendations have been picked up (or are being picked) by several countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, the members of the European Union and (to a more limited extent) the United States. Subpart FH of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains the core aspects of the OECD recommendations with suitable modification for the New Zealand context. 1 There are consequential amendments to other tax regimes including the FIF (foreign investment fund), NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) and thin capitalisat ion rules. Background Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements exploit the different ways that countries treat financial instruments (hybrid instruments) and entities (hybrid entities and branches) to create tax advantages. Take the simple example of a hybrid financial instrument issued by a subsidiary to its parent company (resident in another country) that makes a quarterly coupon payment. The instrument is treated as debt by the subsidiary and the coupons result in deductible interest. The instrument is treated as equity by the parent and the coupons are treated as non-assessable dividend income. The hybrid financial instrument results in double non-taxation as there is a deduction in the subsidiary country for an amount that is not taxed in the parent country. Double non-taxation of this kind is difficult to deal with because it arises even though both countries’ tax rules are being complied with. However, a response is desirable because the double non-taxation causes distortions in investment patterns, results in an unintended reduction in aggregate tax revenues, and generally gives multinationals an unfair co mpet itive advantage over local businesses. To counter such double non-taxation, the OECD made a series of recommendations to address hybrid and branch mismatches through the release of two reports in 2015 and 2017. 2 The reports describe the recommendations as comprised of two kinds of rules. 1 Subpart FH was inserted into the Income Tax Act 2007 by the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–2019, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 made a number of amendments to subpart FH which have the same effective date as the rest of the subpart. These amendments are incorporated into this commentary. 2 Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (2015) and Neutralising the Effects of Branch Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (2017). 3 The first kind are rules to reduce the likelihood of such mismatches arising. For example, the OECD recommended that countries include a rule so that a foreign dividend exemption in the payee country is not available to the extent the dividend payment is deductible to the payer. New Zealand already has such a rule in section CW 9. The second kind are “linking rules” which apply where the mismatch has not been prevented by other domestic rules. The linking rules effectively adjust the tax outcomes under a hybrid or branch mismatch in one country in order to align them with the tax outcomes in the other country. Though separately categorised, both types of rules have a common feature. The tax effect of a payment in one country depends on its tax treatment in another country. Consistent with the approach adopted by several countries around the world, New Zealand has chosen to adopt the OECD recommendations in a comprehensive manner with suitable modification for the New Zealand context. The linking rules are introduced through subpart FH and there are consequential amendments to other tax regimes as well, including the FIF, NRWT and thin capitalisation rules. While the new rules are relatively complex, it is important to bear in mind that they will have no impact for taxpayers who are New Zealand owned and operate solely in New Zealand. With the exception of structured arrangements, their impact will be limited to taxpayers that are related to persons subject to tax in one or more other countries, or are themselves subject to tax in another country. Taxpayers who are potentially affected by the rules will need to ensure they understand how payments made to or by them are treated by their counterparty for tax purposes. Attached at the end of this document is a check-list, intended to assist taxpayers to identify when they should be considering the rules. Key features Subpart FH includes rules to address the hybrid and branch mismatches arising from the following: • hybrid financial instruments (sections FH 3 and 4); • disregarded hybrid payments and deemed branch payments (sections FH 5 and 6); • reverse hybrids and branch payee mismatches (section FH 7); • deductible hybrid and branch payments resulting in double deductions (sections FH 8 and 9); • dual resident payers (section FH 10); and • imported mismatches (section FH 11). Where there are two or more parties to a mismatch, the rules generally only apply if there is some degree of association between the parties to the arrangement, or if the arrangement has been structured to achieve a mismatch. Mismatch amounts, which are deductions denied or assessable income added under sections FH 5–6 and FH 8–10, can be offset against surplus assessable income through the application 4 of section FH 12. 3 The section generally operates by granting a deduction to a taxpayer upon successfully offsetting a mismatch amount against surplus assessable income. Subpart FH provides some ways for taxpayers to simplify the application of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules to their arrangements. In particular, in respect of: • inbound hybrid financial instruments, the taxpayer may elect to treat the instrument as a share for New Zealand income tax purposes (section FH 13); and • wholly-owned outbound foreign hybrid entities existing on 6 December 2017 (the date the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill was introduced), the taxpayer may irrevocably elect that the entity should be treated as a company for New Zealand income tax purposes (section FH 14). The introduction of the linking rules in subpart FH of the Act has flow on implications for other New Zealand tax regimes, including the FIF, NRWT and thin capitalisation rules. Application dates The majority of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. There are two exceptions to this application date. The first exception is in respect of the financial instrument rule in sections FH 3 and FH 4 for certain banking or insurance regulatory capital instruments issued on or before 6 September 2016 (the date the Government discussion document on Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements was released). This regulatory capital has been grand-parented until the first date on which the person has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the financial instrument without penalty. The second exception is in respect of the imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 for non- structured imported mismatches. For payments under non-structured imported mismatches, the rule will apply for income years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. 3 Surplus assessable income is a reflection of the OECD concept of dual inclusion income. 5 CORE PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS Sections FH 1 and FH 2 The hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduce a number of new concepts to tax legislation. This section highlights a number of the key concepts and principles before considering the specific hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduced in subpart FH and the consequential amendments from those rules. For simplicity, the rules will generally be referred to interchangeably as the “hybrid and branch mismatch rules” and the “hybrid rules”. This is consistent with the definition of “hybrid mismatch legislation” in section FH 15 which covers both the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports The OECD as part of Action 2 of its BEPS Action Plan has made a number of recommendations to help countries change their domestic law so as to neutralise the tax advantages from hybrid and branch mismatches through two reports issued in 2015 and 2017. 4 The hybrid mismatch report outlined comprehensive recommendations to deal with hybrid mismatch arrangements in October 2015. This report considered mismatches that are the result of differences in the tax treatment or characterisation of an instrument or entity. While some of the hybrid mismatches identified in the report involved branches, it did not directly consider similar issues that can arise through the use of branch structures. The branch mismatch report considering these issues was issued in 2017. The report considered mismatches that arise as a result of differences in the allocation of income and expenditure between a branch and head office, including situations where the branch country does not treat the taxpayer as having a taxable presence in that country. The hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduced in subpart FH closely follow the OECD recommendations with suitable modification for the New Zealand context. While the terminology used in the OECD hybrid and branch reports and the legislation is not necessarily the same, the intent is broadly similar and some of the examples in this commentary have been adapted from the OECD reports. Therefore, in addition to the guidance in this commentary, the OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports may generally be used as interpretive aids for the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements are cross-border arrangements where differences in the tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch under the laws of two or more countries mean that income tax is eliminated, reduced or deferred. This can result in double non-taxation, including long term tax deferral. 4 Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (2015) and Neutralising the Effects of Branch Mismatch Arrangements, Action 2: Inclusive Framework on BEPS (2017). 6 D/NI and DD mismatches There are two broad types of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements addressed in the OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports: deduction/non-inclusion (D/NI) arrangements and double deduction (DD) arrangements. D/NI mismatch arrangements occur when a payment results in a deduction in one country wit h no corresponding income taxed in the recipient country, if that outcome is the result of the different tax treatment of an instrument, entity or branch. DD mismatch arrangements occur when a taxpayer is entitled to a deduction in two countries for the same payment. D/NI and DD hybrid and branch mismatches can arise in several ways involving financial instruments, hybrid entities or branches. The OECD identified several ways in which the mismatches can arise and has developed recommendations to neutralise the tax advantages they can provide in the reports noted above. These ways include mismatches that arise through the use of hybrid financial instruments, disregarded hybrid payments, structures producing double deductions, reverse hybrids, dual resident entities, imported mismatches, and deemed branch payments and payee mismatches. Each of these hybrid or branch mismatch arrangements is covered by the rules in subpart FH and discussed in detail later in the special report. OECD recommendations The OECD recommended two kinds of rules to address hybrid and branch mismatches. The first kind are rules to reduce the likelihood of such mismatches arising. For example, the OECD recommended that jurisdictions include a rule so that a foreign dividend exemption in the payee country is not available to the extent the dividend payment is deductible to the payer. New Zealand already has a rule to cover this circumstance in section CW 9. The second are “linking rules” which apply where the mismatch has not been prevented by any other domestic rules. The linking rules effectively adjust the tax outcomes under a hybrid or branch mismatch in one country in order to align them with the tax outcomes in the other country. Since both countries may have a provision to adjust the tax outcomes under a particular hybrid or branch mismatch arrangement, in a number of cases, there is an order of application through “primary” and “defensive” rules. This ensures that, in situations where both countries have implemented hybrid and branch mismatch rules that would counter a particular arrangement, only one country will counter the mismatch. The primary rule is broadly that the payer country should deny a deduction to the extent it is: • not included in the taxable income of the recipient country (for a D/NI mismatch); and • claimed with respect to expenditure of a resident that is also deductible in another country (for a DD mismatch). If the primary rule is not applied because the payer country has not implemented the hybrid and branch mismatch rules, then the defensive rule can apply: • requiring the deductible payment to be included in taxable income of the recipient (for a D/NI mismatch); or 7 • denying the deduction in the country where the payment is made (for a DD mismatch). Table 1 summarises how the OECD recommendations have been implemented into domestic law. The recommendations are numbered in accordance with the OECD hybrid mismatch report with the corresponding branch mismatch recommendation (if any) showed separately alongside the hybrid recommendations. Restructuring considerations The intended outcome of the introduction of hybrid and branch mismatch rules is to reduce the incidence of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements. Generally, if a taxpayer chooses an ordinary arrangement or structure over one that exploits a mismatch the tax advantage will be removed, without any need to apply the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Even if this choice does not result in additional tax revenue for the New Zealand Government, this is a desirable outcome. Taxpayers should be able to restructure out of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements into ordinary structures without attracting tax avoidance risks. Take the example of a foreign company (resident in a country without hybrid rules) that funds a New Zealand subsidiary company with the use of a hybrid financial instrument. Interest paid by the New Zealand subsidiary under the instrument would be subject to deduction denial under section FH 3 of the hybrid rules (see below for discussion of this rule). The foreign company decides to refinance its New Zealand investment in response to the introduction of New Zealand hybrid rules. The replacement financing might be an ordinary debt arrangement under which the New Zealand subsidiary would pay interest not subject to deduction denial under FH 3, and taxable in the foreign country. This type of refinancing should not be considered tax avoidance despite the possibility that a valid deduction could have replaced a deduction that would have been denied under the hybrid rules, thereby reducing New Zealand taxable income. Similarly, a foreign company that owns a hybrid entity in New Zealand (such as an unlimited liability company) may wish to restructure its New Zealand operations in response to the introduction of New Zealand hybrid rules. A replacement structure may be a limited liability company with expenditure that is not subject to deduction denial under sections FH 5 and FH 9 (see below for discussion of these rules). This type of restructure should not be considered tax avoidance even if denied deductions of a hybrid entity in New Zealand would be replaced by valid deductions that are not part of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. 8 Table 1: New Zealand’s implementation of the OECD recommendations Linking rule recommendations Section Rec.

A correction will be posted in the next edition. This is the correct version of the table. 9 Scope of the linking rules Where there are two or more parties to a mismatch, the rules generally only apply if there is some degree of association between the relevant parties to the arrangement, or if the arrangement has been structured to achieve a mismatch. There are four key definitions that determine whether the rules potentially apply: “act together”, “control group”, “related” and “structured arrangement”. We discuss these terms individually in the following section on key definitions. Ordering of the linking rules Hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements can arise in several ways and, it is possible, that more than one of the hybrid mismatch rules in subpart FH may apply to a taxpayer. Section FH 2 outlines the order in which the hybrid mismatch rules in sections FH 3 to FH 11 should be applied by a taxpayer. Subsection FH 2(1) outlines the order of the application of the sections that disallow deduction. These are set out in table 2. Table 2: The order for applying the rules that disallow deduction Order Section Rule 1 FH 3 Hybrid financial instrument mismatch – primary rule 2 FH 5 Disregarded hybrid payment mismatch – primary rule 3 FH 7 Payments made to a reverse hybrid 4 FH 11 Imported mismatch 5 FH 8 Deductible payment made by a hybrid entity mismatch – primary rule 6 FH 9 Deductible payment made by a hybrid entity mismatch – defensive rule 7 FH 10 Deductible payment made by dual resident payer mismatch Subsection FH 2(2) outlines the order of the application of the sections that treat receipts as assessable income. These are set out in table 3. Table 3: The order for applying the rules that treat receipts as assessable income Order Section Rule 1 FH 4 Hybrid financial instrument mismatch – defensive rule 2 FH 6 Disregarded hybrid payment mismatch – defensive rule 10 Elections Sections FH 13 and FH 14 provide that, in some circumstances, taxpayers may opt out of the potential application of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules to some of their arrangements. In particular: • For inbound hybrid financial instruments, the taxpayer may elect to treat the instrument as a share for New Zealand income tax purposes (section FH 13); and • For a foreign hybrid entit y 6 wholly-owned by a person on 6 December 2017 (the date of the introduction of the Bill), the owner may irrevocably elect to treat the entity as a company for New Zealand income tax purposes (section FH 14). This election must be made by the time the owner files their tax return for the first year in which the hybrid rules apply to the owner. 6 A foreign hybrid entity is one that is fiscally transparent for New Zealand tax purposes and fiscally opaque for the purposes of the foreign country in which it is formed. 11 KEY DEFINITIONS Section FH 15 The hybrid and branch mismatch rules introduce a number of new concepts to the New Zealand tax lexicon. We outline the key definitions that apply broadly across the rules below. Financial instrument, hybrid entities and deducting branches Financial instrument “Financial instrument” is defined in section FH 15. It is relevant for sections FH 3 and FH 4 (and the borrower election to treat a hybrid financial instrument as a share in section FH 13). The definition is intended to encompass all forms of debt and equity. It builds on the existing financial arrangement definition, which is deliberately very broad. There are then a number of addit ions, including for: • shares: this inclusion may be of less significance given the deductible foreign equit y dividend exclusion in section CW 9, but it would be odd to leave shares out of the definit ion; • annuities: which are excluded from the financial arrangements rules only because they are taxed under their own regime; • farm-out arrangements; • share lending arrangements: share repurchase agreements (share repos), and share lending arrangements which do not meet the statutory definition of a share lending arrangement in section YA 1, are financial arrangements. Share lending arrangements which do meet the statutory definition are excluded from the financial arrangement definition, but should be included as “financial instruments” for the purposes of the hybrid and branch mismatch rules, as they may be hybrid financial transfers, subject to either sections FH 3 or FH 4; and • loans in New Zealand currency described in section EW 5(10): these are interest-free, repayable on demand loans that are excluded from the financial arrangement definition for the lender. Hybrid entity No entity is inherently a hybrid entity. Hybridity exists only as a result of the inconsistent tax classification of the entity by two countries’ tax systems. This is reflected in the definition of a “hybrid entity” in section FH 15 which provides that it means a person or other entity that is recognised as a person subject to tax (that is, is taxed like a company) in a country that treats it as a tax resident, and not recognised as a person that is subject to tax (that is, is taxed like a partnership or a branch) in another country. For example, a limited partnership may be taxed as a resident entity in the country in which it was incorporated, but taxed as a disregarded (or flow- through) entity in a partner (investor) country. The hybrid entity definition is relevant for sections FH 8 and FH 9 (primary and defensive rules applying to payments resulting in double deductions) to help to define when those rules apply, and section FH 14 to define the kind of entity in respect of which an opaque election can be made. The term is also used in section FH 12 (which is concerned with surplus assessable 12 income). Although the term is not used in sections FH 5 and FH 6, those sections will often apply to payments made by hybrid entities. Deducting branch “Deducting branch” is defined in section FH 15. It is relevant for sections FH 5 and 6 (primary and defensive rules for disregarded hybrid payment mismatches), sections FH 8 and 9 (primary and defensive rules applying to payments resulting in double deductions) and section FH 11 (imported mismatches). A deducting branch is a branch, permanent establishment or other activity of a person in a country or territory where the expenditure or loss attributed by the person to the branch is deductible (or gives rise to other tax relief) in that country or territory against income of the person. This includes a deemed permanent establishment under the new rules in respect of permanent establishments. Control groups, related parties and structured arrangements The hybrid and branch mismatch rules generally apply when the mismatch is between related parties (broadly twenty five percent common ownership) or control groups (broadly fifty percent common ownership), or the mismatch arises from a payment under a structured arrangement. These terms are defined in section FH 15. Related The definition of “related” is important for sections FH 3 and FH 4 (primary and defensive rules applying to hybrid financial instrument mismatches). It is also relevant to section FH 8 (primary rule applying to payments resulting in double deductions). The definit io n of “related” is closely based on the associated person definitions in subpart YB, except that: • for two companies, it imposes a twenty five percent common ownership test (rather than a fifty percent common ownership test); • it applies the same twenty five percent rule to a general partnership as for a limited partnership (which means that a partner in a general partnership is not automatically ‘related’ to that partnership as would be the case for the “associated persons” definition); and • there is a common control test, which also aggregates interests of persons who act together, as defined in section FH 15. Control group Many of the hybrid and branch mismatch provisions only apply to payments between members of a control group (unless there is a structured arrangement). The “control group” definition in section FH 15 is generally intended to include persons who are commonly controlled or meet a fifty percent common ownership threshold. For companies and partnerships (whether formed under New Zealand or foreign law) these tests are well established for other purposes, and the definition used in the hybrid and branch mismatch rules incorporates these other definitions. 13 For trusts, it is more difficult to determine ownership (whether by reason of control or economic interests), and accordingly the legislation uses the same tests that apply to determine whether or not parties are associated in sections YB 5 to 11. In addition, the meaning of “control group” is defined to include: • members that are consolidated for accounting purposes and/or prepare group financial statements; and • a common control test, which aggregates the interests of persons who act together, as defined in section FH 15. Act together The “act together” definition is relevant for determining whether two persons are in a control group or are related persons by virtue of paragraphs (g) or (h) of the control group and related definit ions. Paragraphs (g) and (h) include two persons in a control group if one effectively controls the other or the same group of persons effectively controls both. In both cases, interests held by persons who are related or who act together are aggregated. The intent of the acting together test is to: • prevent taxpayers from avoiding the related party or control group tests by transferring their rights or interests to another person that continues to act under their direction in respect of those interests; and • target taxpayers who individually hold minority stakes in an entity, but enter into arrangements that would allow them to act together (or under the direction of a single controlling mind) to enter into hybrid mismatch arrangements in respect of one or more of them. The definition of “act together” is highly fact dependent. For instance, two persons will act together if one typically acts in accordance with the wishes of the other, or if their actions are typically controlled by a third person. There are a number of limbs that determine whether two parties are acting together. The definition is met where two persons (the holders) each have voting rights or equity interests in a person or other entity and at least one of the criteria below are met: • the holders are associated under section YB 4 (two relatives); • a holder typically acts in the way preferred by the other holder because of the other holder’s preferences; • the holders have entered into an arrangement that has an effect on the value or control o f the rights or interests that is more than incidental and does not arise from a restriction on the sale of the rights or interests; • the actions of the holder are controlled or expected to be controlled, whether that be legally or typically, by a third person or group of persons (the co-ordinator); • the holders and a co-ordinator enter an arrangement affecting the ownership or control of the rights and interests and having an effect on the value or control of the rights and interests that is more than incidental; or 14 • the holders agree with a co-ordinator that the co-ordinator can act on behalf of the holders in relation to the rights and interests. Subsection FH 15(2) provides an exclusion from the “act together” definition for the last three limbs above where the co-ordinator manages two investment funds that hold voting rights or equity interests in the same person or entity, but the two funds do not act together in relation to their rights and interests. We comment on these limbs below. Relatives Limb (a) of the definition focuses on natural persons and deems a person to hold any voting rights or equity interests that are held by members of that person’s family as determined under section YB 4 (Relatives). Typically acts in the way preferred by the other holder Under limb (b) of the definition, a person will be treated as acting in the way preferred by another holder where the person is legally bound to act in accordance with the other holder’s instructions or if it can be established that the person is expected to act, or typically acts, in accordance with the other holder’s instructions. The focus of the test is on the actions of that person in relation to the voting rights or equity interests. The test is not intended to treat as acting together two or more shareholders that typically vote in a similar way to each other, but make their decisions independently and without reference to each other. It is intended to apply where a holder typically acts in a way preferred by another holder because it is preferred by the other holder. Entered into an arrangement that has a more than incidental effect on the value or control of the rights and interests Under limb (c) of the definition, a person will be treated as holding the equity or voting interests of another person if they have an entered into an arrangement that has an effect on the value or control of the rights or interests that is more than incidental. The test covers arrangements concerning the exercise of voting interests and/or regarding beneficial entitlements, such as an entitlement to profits or eligibility to participate in distributions. In addition, it covers arrangements concerning the ownership of those rights, such as options to sell rights. The test is intended to capture arrangements that are entered into with other investors and does not cover arrangements that are simply part of the terms of the equity or voting interest concerned, or that operate solely between holder and issuer. The arrangement regarding the control of the voting rights or equity interests must have a more than incidental effect on the value of those rights or interests. The more than incidental threshold means that an investor will not have their rights or interests treated as part of a common holding arrangement simply because the investor is party to a commercially standard shareholder agreement that does not have a significant impact on the ability of the investor to exercise ownership or control over their interests. 15 Example 1: Commercially standard shareholder agreement Aardvark Co together with a number of other investors holds one hundred percent of the shares in Badger Co. Aardvark Co is the single largest shareholder holding forty percent, with the remaining 12 investors each holding five percent. The shareholders enter into a shareholders’ agreement that provides Aardvark Co with a first right of refusal on any disposal of the shares and drag-along and tag-along provisions in the event that an offer is made for a majority of the shares in Badger Co. Question Are Aardvark Co and the other investors in Badger Co acting together within the scope of limb (c) of the “acting together” definition? Answer No (generally). The right to buy other shareholders’ shares at market value, as well as the drag along and tag along rights are relatively standard terms in a shareholders’ agreement for a company that is not widely held. These types of provisions will not generally have a material impact on the value of the holder’s equity interest and therefore should not be taken into account for the purposes of limb (c) of the acting together requirement. Example 2: Shareholders subscribe for proportional debt There are 10 investors in Crab Co with each holding ten percent of its shares. The 10 investors enter into a shareholders’ agreement to subscribe for proportional debt in Crab Co. The proportional debt is a hybrid financial instrument for some of the investors, but not all of them, depending on their tax residence. The 10 investors each voted positively for Crab Co to issue the proportional debt, but exercised their voting rights independently of each other. Question Are the investors in Crab Co acting together within the scope of limb (b) or (c) of the “acting together” definition? Answer No (generally). If some, or (in this case) all, of the investors agree that they will fund the company pro rata in a certain way, that should not, in and of itself, mean that the investors typically act in the way preferred by the other holders because of the holder’s preference per limb (b). While the shareholders’ agreement may provide for the issue of proportional debt, it should not generally have a more than incidental impact on the value of the shares. For instance, if Crab Co issues $10m of proportional debt, both its assets and liabilities should increase by $10m, leaving the value of its equity unchanged so limb (c) should not apply. Co-ordinator Under limbs (d) to (f) of the definition, two persons or a group of persons will be treated as acting together if their interests are managed, controlled or affected in a way that is more than merely incidental by another person or group of persons (the co-ordinator). These limbs will not apply to treat two persons as acting together if they are members of different investment funds that hold voting rights or equity interests in the same person or entity, if the two funds do not act together in relation to their rights and interests. This conclusion holds regardless of whether or not the funds have a common co-ordinator. 16 Example 3: Co-ordinator Take the facts of example 2, except that instead of investing directly into Crab Co, each investor invests into an investment partnership that holds one hundred percent of Crab Co. The investment partnership has a general partner that decides on the investments of the partnership. The investment partnership makes a debt investment in Crab Co. This debt is a hybrid financial instrument for some of the investors, but not all of them as they are resident in different countries. Question Are the investors of the partnership acting together in relation to their interest in Crab Co due to the presence of a co-ordinator within the scope of limbs (d) to (f) of the “acting together” definition? Answer The partners are acting together in relation to their interest in Crab Co via their investment partnership under limb (d) of the definition as their investments are controlled by the general partner. The partners will also be acting together based on the partnership agreement if that provides for the decision-making rights of the general partner. (The exception to the co-ordinator rule in FH 15(2) does not apply as there is only one relevant investment vehicle.) The effect of this is that Crab Co is related to each of the partners under paragraph (g) of the definition, and must separately analyse payments attributable to each investor to determine whether or not a deduction may be denied under subpart FH. This conclusion is not affected by whether or not the investment partnership is treated as an entity for New Zealand tax purposes. Structured arrangement The “structured arrangement” definition in section FH 15 is relevant throughout the hybrid and branch mismatch rules. This is because it is used to define the situations where a hybrid or branch mismatch between persons who are not related or in a control group is subject to the rules. OECD recommendation The structured arrangement definition is consistent with recommendation 10 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. In this regard, paragraphs 318 to 319 of the report state that: “The purpose of the structured arrangement definition is to capture those taxpayers who enter into arrangements that have been designed to produce a mismatch in tax outcomes while ensuring taxpayers will not be required to make adjustments under the rule in circumstances where the taxpayer is unaware of the mismatch and derives no benefit from it. The test for whether an arrangement is structured is objective. It applies, regardless of the parties’ intentions, whenever the facts and circumstances would indicate to an objective observer that the arrangement has been designed to produce a mismatch in tax outcomes. The structured arrangement rule asks whether the mismatch has been priced into the terms of the arrangement or whether the arrangement’s design and the surrounding facts and circumstances indicate that the mismatch in tax outcomes was an intended feature of the arrangement.” These principles have been taken into account in incorporating the definition of structured arrangement into domestic legislation. 17 Definition The definit io n of “structured arrangement” in section FH 15 is divided into two limbs, which both must be satisfied for there to be a structured arrangement in a particular case. The first limb in (a) outlines two (potentially overlapping) circumstances that will be a structured arrangement. The first is where the pricing is based on the existence of a hybrid mismatch. The second is where the facts or circumstances indicate that the arrangement is intended to rely on or produce a hybrid mismatch. The second limb in (b) is person-specific and reflects that a structured arrangement should only exist for a person where they (or a member of their control group) could reasonably have been expected to have been aware of the mismatch regardless of whether they benefited from it or not. This means that it is possible, albeit not necessarily common, that what may be a structured arrangement to one person will not be a structured arrangement to another. We discuss these elements of the definition below. Price assumes existence of a hybrid mismatch The price of the arrangement will assume the existence of a hybrid mismatch if the mismatch has been factored into the calculation of the return under the arrangement. This test looks to the actual terms of the arrangement, as they affect the return on the arrangement, and as agreed between the parties, to determine whether the pricing of the transaction is different from what would have been agreed had the mismatch not arisen. This is a legal and factual test that looks only to the terms of the arrangement itself and the allocation of risk and return under the arrangement, rather than taking into account broader factors such as the relationship between the parties or the circumstances in which the arrangement was entered into. The test would not take into account the consideration paid by a taxpayer to acquire a hybrid financial instrument from another holder (for example, where the instrument is acquired at a premium or a discount from a third party) unless the instrument is issued and sold as part of the same arrangement. 18 Example 4: Hybrid mismatch priced into the terms of the arrangement Dolphin Co (a company resident in Country D) and Elk Co (a company resident in Country E) are unrelated parties. Elk Co issues a bond that pays an annual coupon to Dolphin Co. The bond is treated as a debt instrument under the laws of Country E but as an equity instrument under the laws of Country D. Country D generally exempts foreign dividends under its domestic law but taxes interest income. Therefore the payment results in a D/NI outcome that is a hybrid mismatch. The formula for calculating the coupon payment on the bond provides for a discount to the market rate of interest which is calculated by reference to the company tax rate in Country D (that is, the coupon formula is equal to market rate × (1 − 0.5 of the tax rate)). Question Whether the bond is a structured arrangement for Elk Co? Answer Yes. The mismatch has been factored into the calculation of the coupon under the bond so limb (a)(i) of the definition is met. Elk Co could reasonably be expected to be aware of the sharing of the tax benefit that arises to it from the mismatch as the coupon formula reflects a below market rate of interest so limb (b) of the definition is met as well. Facts or circumstances indicate an intention to rely on or produce a hybrid mismatch The facts and circumstance test is a wider test than the pricing test noted above and looks to a number of factors to determine whether the arrangement is intended to rely on or produce a hybrid mismatch. These factors include the relationship between the parties, the circumstances under which the arrangement was entered into, the steps and transactions that were undertaken to put the arrangement into effect, the terms of the arrangement itself and the economic and commercial benefits of the transaction. Facts and circumstances that indicate an arrangement is intended to produce a hybrid mismatch include the following: • an arrangement that is designed, or is part of plan, to create a hybrid mismatch; • an arrangement that incorporates a term, step or transaction to create a mismatch; • an arrangement that is marketed, in whole or in part, as a tax-advantaged product where some or all of the tax advantage is derived from the hybrid mismatch; • an arrangement that is primarily marketed to taxpayers in a country where the hybrid mismatch arises; • an arrangement that contains features that alter the terms under an arrangement, including the return, in the event that the hybrid mismatch is no longer available; and • an arrangement that would produce a negative return absent the hybrid mismatch. The fact that an arrangement produces a combination of tax and commercial benefits does not prevent the arrangement from being a structured arrangement if, on an objective basis, it would be concluded that part of the explanation for the arrangement was to generate a hybrid mismatch. 19 Reasonably be expected to be aware Whether an arrangement is a structured arrangement is person-specific as it depends on whether a person (or a member of that person’s control group, whether or not a New Zealand resident) could reasonably have been expected to be aware of the mismatch. This limb of the definition is consistent with paragraphs 342 to 343 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report which state that: “A person will be a party to a structured arrangement when that person has a sufficient level of involvement in the arrangement to understand how it has been structured and what its tax effects might be. A taxpayer will not be treated as a party to a structured arrangement, however, where neither the taxpayer nor any member of the same control group was aware of the mismatch in tax outcomes or obtained any benefit from the mismatch. The test for whether a person is a party to a structured arrangement is intended to capture situations where the taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer’s control group was aware of the mismatch in tax outcomes and should apply to any person with knowledge of the arrangement and its tax effects regardless of whether that person has derived a tax advantage under that arrangement.” 20 Example 5: Arrangement marketed as a tax-advantaged product Flamingo Co (a company resident in Country F) subscribes for bonds paying an annual coupon issued by Gorilla Co (an unrelated company resident in Country G). Flamingo Co subsequently sells the bond to Hedgehog Co, another unrelated company resident in Country H. Due to differences in the treatment of the underlying instrument under the respective laws of Country G and Country H, the coupon payments give rise to a hybrid mismatch resulting in a D/NI outcome. Flamingo Co subscribed for these bonds after receiving an investment memorandum that included a summary of the expected tax treatment of the instrument (including the fact that payments on the instrument will be eligible for tax relief in Country H). A similar investment memorandum was sent to a number of other potential investors in Country H. Question 1 Is the bond a structured arrangement for Flamingo Co? Answer 1 The bonds will give rise to a structured arrangement to Flamingo Co because: (i) the facts indicate that the bond has been marketed as a tax-advantaged product and has been primarily marketed to persons who can benefit from the mismatch; and (ii) Flamingo Co acquired the bond on initial issuance and was aware of the potential mismatch in tax treatment from the investment memorandum. However, provided F Co is taxable on the return from the bonds, there is no D/NI mismatch to counter. Question 2 Is the bond a structured arrangement for Hedgehog Co? Answer 2 Whether or not the bonds are a structured arrangement to Hedgehog Co will depend on the facts. The bond was marketed as a tax-advantaged product and was primarily marketed to persons who could benefit from the mismatch, including persons in Country H. However, it may not be a structured arrangement to Hedgehog Co, if Hedgehog Co paid market value for the bond and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware of the mismatch in tax treatment. Hybrid mismatch The “hybrid mismatch” definition is used in section FH 11, the imported hybrid mismatch section, and the definition of structured arrangement. It is a broad definition that effectively covers D/NI and DD mismatch arrangements. Hybrid mismatch legislation “Hybrid mismatch legislation” is defined to mean subpart FH and legislation of other countries or territories that has an intended effect corresponding to subpart FH (or a provision in subpart FH). In this regard, foreign legislation will correspond to subpart FH if it is consistent with the effect of the recommendations of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and/or branch mismatch report. This question is most relevant for the defensive rules in sections FH 4, 6 and 9, because if the foreign country has an equivalent of the corresponding primary rule then the taxpayer will not apply the defensive rule in New Zealand. It is also relevant to the imported mismatch rule in 21 section FH 11. Generally that rule will not apply to a payment made to a payee in a country with hybrid rules. Whether foreign legislation has an intended effect corresponding to the hybrid mismatch rules will need to be determined at the time of the mismatch. For example, if another country has a rule that denies deductions for duplicate tax losses this could be considered to have the same effect as hybrid rules relating to DD mismatches. The other country would not need to have rules that correspond to each of the recommendations in the OECD hybrid report and/or branch report. It would only need to have a rule that corresponds to the particular hybrid or branch mismatch that would be countered in New Zealand if not addressed by the foreign country. It is not expected that another country’s legislation will be exactly the same as New Zealand’s. This means that the amount that New Zealand might counteract, in a given situation, could be different from that which would be counteracted by another country’s rules in that same situation. Alternatively, another country’s rules may only apply to certain types of payments (for example, interest and royalty payments but not others). These circumstances should not prevent that other country’s rules qualifying as hybrid mismatch legislation. However, the question of whether a defensive rule in subpart FH applies or not is not determined simply by whether or not the other country has hybrid rules. For instance, section FH 6, which is discussed in detail below, is a defensive rule that only grants priority to another country’s hybrid mismatch legislation if that country’s rule applies to the relevant payment and payer in the income year. The US dual consolidated loss (DCL) rules are an example of hybrid mismatch legislation. Inland Revenue understands that these rules generally operate as follows: • A US company is denied the ability to reduce its US tax in relation to losses that are used under the laws of a foreign country to offset income that is not taxed by the US. These may be losses incurred by a foreign branch of the US company, through a foreign hybrid owned by the US company, or by a dual resident company. • The denial can be turned off if the US company makes a domestic use election. This election requires the company to elect not to use the loss under the laws of another country to offset income which the US does not tax. The non-foreign use period is limited to five years following the year of the loss. • If a domestic use election is made, but the loss is used to offset income which the US does not tax during the five year period, or other “triggering events” occur (such as a sale of the foreign hybrid that incurs the loss), the US tax reduction resulting from the US use of the loss is recaptured and there is also an interest charge. If the loss is so used (or another triggering event occurs) after the five year period, there is no penalty. On the basis of this understanding, the US DCL rules appear to be hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to section FH 8. Expenditure incurred by a US taxpayer, or a New Zealand hybrid entity which is deductible by a US owner, will not be subject to section FH 9 so long as the US taxpayer is subject to the DCL rules and has not made a domestic use election. If the US taxpayer has made a domestic use election, then section FH 9 will apply to deny a deduction for the expenditure. That is because the domestic use election is an election that the DCL rules do not apply to the US taxpayer in respect of the relevant expenditure. During the five year “non-foreign use” period imposed by the terms of the domestic use election, this should not be a practical issue, since the terms of the domestic use election will in any event prohibit the use in New Zealand of that expenditure against income which the US does not tax. Once that period has passed, the US DCL rules will not deny the US person the ability to use the expenditure in 22 New Zealand against income which the US does not tax. However, section FH 9 will continue to apply, to similar effect. Mismatch situation “Mismatch situation” means a situation that may give rise to denial of a deduction, or assessable income, under sections FH 5, FH 6, or FH 8 to FH 10. The definition is important as mismatch situations result in “mismatch amounts” discussed below, which are where the hybrid counteraction may be offset against surplus assessable income in section FH 12. A situation can be a mismatch situation in a year even if there is no denial of a deduction (or inclusion of income under FH 6) in the relevant year. A person can be involved in more than one mismatch situation. Further, a single mismatch situation can give rise to more than one kind of mismatch. For instance, a New Zealand resident hybrid entity can make payments which are subject to both section FH 5 (because they are made to a foreign owner who disregards the entity) and section FH 9 (because they are deductible in New Zealand and a foreign country). Mismatch amount “Mismatch amount” means an amount, arising from a mismatch situation, for which a deduction is denied or assessable income is increased under sections FH 5, FH 6, FH 8, FH 9, or FH 10. Deduction denials or assessable income increases under these sections can be reversed if the amounts are set off in a tax year against an amount of surplus assessable income. 23 HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RULE Sections FH 3 and FH 4 Background The hybrid financial instrument rule is recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and addresses D/NI mismatches. Hybrid mismatches that fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in sections FH 3 and FH 4 can be split into two categories: character mismatches and timing mismatches. Recommendation 2.1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report, which recommends that countries should not grant an exemption for dividends that are treated as deductible in a foreign country, is also important in considering the application of this rule. Character mismatch Figure 1 illustrates a character mismatch arising from a financial instrument that pays coupons. Figure 1 Interest / Dividend B Co + Loan − A Co In this character mismatch, the financial instrument (loan) is treated as debt by B Co and the coupons are treated as deductible interest. However, the instrument is treated as equity by A Co and the coupons are treated as non-assessable dividends. This results in double non-taxation. Timing mismatch Figure 2 illustrates an example of a timing mismatch arising from a financial instrument that pays interest upon maturity. 24 Figure 2 Contingent interest A Co B Co + Loan − In this timing mismatch, A Co and B Co enter into a five-year term loan where interest accrues on the loan, but is only payable at maturity or earlier at the discretion of B Co. The loan is treated as debt by both A Co and B Co. Interest payments on the loan are treated as deductible by B Co in the year the interest accrues but will only be treated as income by A Co when (and if) such interest is actually paid. This results in double non-taxation in the sense that there is a significant deferral (up to five years) between when the interest is deductible to B Co and when it is assessable to A Co. Summary of legislative response Sections FH 3 and FH 4 implement recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. They are respectively the primary and defensive rules relating to hybrid financial instruments (which include, but are not limited to, financial arrangements plus shares). Section FH 3 is the primary rule and applies to inbound investment to deny a New Zealand income tax deduction for a payment under a hybrid financial instrument taking into account the extent to which it is subject to tax in the payee country. Denial of a deduction prima facie has no effect on the payer’s obligation to pay NRWT. The payment is still treated as interest, unless the payer elects to treat the debt as a share for tax purposes, under section FH 13 (discussed below). Denial of a deduction will be taken into account in determining whether the loan gives rise to non-resident financial arrangement income (as discussed below). Section FH 4 is the defensive rule and applies to outbound investment to tax a payment under a hybrid financial instrument in New Zealand taking into account the extent to which it is deductible in the payer country. Section FH 4 is expected to have limited application in New Zealand as deductible payments under a hybrid financial instrument would not qualify as exempt foreign dividends under existing section CW 9. The definition of “deductible foreign equity distribution” has also been amended in section YA 1. 25 Application date Sections FH 3 and 4 apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This means that section FH 3 applies to payments for which deductions are claimed in that income year or subsequently. The date on which the payment giving rise to the deduction is paid is not relevant. Section FH 4 on the other hand applies only to payments received on or after the start of a person’s income year beginning on or after 1 July 2018. There is an exception to section FH 3 for banking and insurance regulatory capital entered into on or before 6 September 2016 (the date the Government discussion document Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements was released). Such regulatory capital is grand-parented until the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the financial instrument without penalty. Detailed analysis Section FH 3 – primary rule Section FH 3 is the primary rule of recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. It applies with priority over the defensive rules of foreign countries. It applies when a person is a party to a financial instrument under which the person makes a payment if: • the person incurs in an income year expenditure that relates to the financial instrument and does not arise solely from a foreign exchange fluctuation; • the expenditure is deductible (in the absence of the hybrid mismatch rules); • the tax law of a country outside New Zealand treats the payment when made as received by a person in that country (who may be a resident of that country or a non-resident carrying on business there). It does not matter if the other country will not treat the payment as received until a later year than the year in which the deduction for the payment arises in New Zealand; • the financial instrument is, or is part of, a structured arrangement, or the payer and payee are related; and • the tax treatment of the payee in its country meets either subsection (2) or subsection (3). Subsection (2) relates to character mismatches and subsection (3) relates to timing mismatches. 26 Example 6: No mismatch with respect to measurement of foreign exchange differences Falcon Co (a company resident in Country F) owns all the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand). Falcon Co provides Kiwi Co with an ordinary loan denominated in F$ (FD). Interest on the loan is payable annually in arrears at a market rate and the principal on the loan is payable at maturity. The loan is treated as a debt instrument under the laws of both Country F and New Zealand and the countries take a consistent position on the characterisation of the payments made under the loan. The interest payable on the loan is deductible in Kiwi Co and included in ordinary income under the laws of Country F. The value of NZD falls in relation to FD while the loan is still outstanding so that payments of interest and principal under the loan become more expensive in NZD terns. Under NZ law, Kiwi Co is entitled to a deduction for this increased cost. There is no similar adjustment under Country F law as it is simply receiving the payments it expected to receive in FD. Question Does the adjustment under New Zealand law for the increase in costs attributable to the fall in the value of NZD against FD give rise to a hybrid mismatch within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 3? Answer No. While the fall in the value of NZD gives rise to a deduction under NZ law that is not reflected by a corresponding inclusion in Country F, this difference does not give rise to a D/NI outcome provided the proportion of the interest and principal payable under the loan is the same under the laws of both countries. Gains and losses that result from converting foreign exchange into local or functional currency are attributable to the way countries measure the value of money, rather than the value of the payment itself. Character mismatches Subsection (2) applies to character mismatches. Character mismatches arise if two criteria are met. The first criterion is that neither the foreign payee country, nor any other foreign country, recognises the payment as ordinary income of the payee. For instance, if the foreign payee’s country of residence did not recognise the payment as ordinary income, but it was included as part of the ordinary income of the payee in another country through a branch, then the first criterion would not be met (that is, there could be no character mismatch). The second criterion is that the payment would be recognised as ordinary income in the payee country if the classification of the payment or payment instrument were varied, and the payee had the usual tax status for a person or entity of the payee’s class. This criterion is based on two key principles: • The rule should only apply where the mismatch in tax treatment between the two countries is attributable to how the payee and payer countries treat the instrument for tax purposes The primary example of a character mismatch is where the payer country treats the instrument as debt and the payee country treats the instrument as equity resulting in deductible interest in the payer country and exempt dividends in the payee country. The D/NI mismatch in such a case is attributable to the classification of the payment or payment instrument. The test the legislation effectively sets is whether the D/NI mismatch would cease to exist if the payee country treated the financial instrument and/or payment in the same way as New Zealand. Taking this approach to the example in the preceding paragraph, if the 27 payee country treated the instrument as debt (instead of equity), it would treat the payments received as taxable interest (rather than exempt dividends). Therefore, as long as the interest payments would be treated as ordinary income in the payee country (assuming a usual tax status of the payee as discussed below), the D/NI mismatch would cease to exist, which means that there is a character mismatch. • The rule should not apply where the mismatch is solely attributable to the status of the taxpayer or the context in which the instrument is held This reflects that D/NI results can be due to factors other than the hybridity of a financial instrument. However, character mismatches should only arise because of the contrasting ways in which the payee and payer countries treat the instrument for tax purposes. For example, a vanilla loan paying interest could produce a D/NI result where the payee is a sovereign wealth fund or tax resident in a country with no income tax or a territorial tax regime. However, this would not be a hybrid mismatch. The test the legislation applies is whether the mismatch would still arise if the classification of the instrument were varied in the payee country, and the instrument was held by a payee of usual or ordinary status for a person in the payee’s class. If it would, then the mismatch should be attributed to the classification of the instrument, rather than the status of the taxpayer or the context in which the instrument is held, and section FH 3 can apply to the New Zealand payer. Example 7: Hybrid financial instrument Zebra Co (a company resident in Country Z) owns all the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in NZ). Zebra Co lends money to Kiwi Co. The loan carries a market rate of interest which is payable every six months in arrears. Payments of interest and principal under the loan are subordinated to the ordinary creditors of NZ Co and can be suspended in the event Kiwi Co fails to meet certain solvency requirements. New Zealand treats the subordinated loan as a debt instrument, while Country Z treats the loan as akin to equity and treats payments under the loan as exempt foreign-sourced dividends. The payments on the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule. Country Z does not recognise the arrangement between Zebra Co and Kiwi Co as giving rise to ordinary income for Zebra Co, as it is an exempt dividend that is not taxed at the payee’s full marginal rate. If the classification of the arrangement were varied such that Country Z viewed the arrangement as an ordinary loan, the payments would be recognised as interest income that is fully taxable to Zebra Co. As a result, the counterfactual requirement in FH 3(2) is satisfied. Kiwi Co is denied a deduction for its interest expenditure under FH 3(4). 28 Example 8: Interest payment to an exempt person Elephant Co (a company resident in Country E) owns forty percent of the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in NZ). Elephant Co lends money to Kiwi Co. The loan carries a market rate of interest which is payable every six months in arrears. Payments of interest and principal under the loan are subordinated to the ordinary creditors of NZ Co and can be suspended if Kiwi Co fails to meet certain solvency requirements. Both Country E and New Zealand treat the subordinated loan as a debt instrument. Elephant Co is a sovereign wealth fund established under Country E law that is exempt from tax on all income. E Co is therefore not taxable on the interest payment. If it were not tax exempt, it would be taxable on interest income from Kiwi Co, but not taxable on dividend income from Kiwi Co. Question 1 Do the interest payments under the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 3? Answer 1 No. The interest payments under the loan give rise to a mismatch in tax outcomes as they are deductible under NZ law, but are not included in ordinary income under Country E law. However, the D/NI result is not dependent on the classification of the financial instrument (that is, the subordinated loan). Rather, it applies solely because of the tax exempt status of Elephant Co as a sovereign wealth fund. The mismatch in tax outcomes would not have arisen had the interest been paid to a taxpayer of usual status (say a company), so cannot be attributed to the classification of the instrument. Question 2 Does the outcome described above change if the subordinated loan is instead a hybrid financial instrument that is treated as an equity instrument by Country E (with dividends treated as exempt if derived by a company) but a debt instrument by New Zealand (with interest treated as deductible)? Answer 2 Yes. The D/NI result now arises for two reasons: (1) Elephant Co is a tax exempt sovereign wealth fund; and (2) Country E treats the hybrid financial instrument as an equity instrument but Kiwi Co treats it as a debt instrument. Whether there is a character mismatch under subsection FH 3(2) then depends on whether there would be a D/NI result if Elephant Co had the usual tax status for a person of the its class (say a company in this case). This will depend on how Elephant Co would be taxed if it were not specifically tax exempt. In this case, Elephant Co would be taxed on the payments on the instrument if it were treated as interest in Country E. In that case there would be a character mismatch under subsection FH 3(2). 29 Example 9: Interest payment to a person established in a no-tax jurisdiction Horse Co (a company resident in Country H) owns all the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand). Horse Co lends money to Kiwi Co. The loan carries a market rate of interest which is payable every six months in arrears. Payments of interest and principal under the loan are subordinated to the ordinary creditors of Kiwi Co and can be suspended in the event Kiwi Co fails to meet certain solvency requirements. Both H Co and Kiwi Co treat the subordinated loan as a debt instrument. Country H does not have a corporate tax system and Horse Co does not have a taxable presence in any other country. Horse Co is therefore not liable in any country on payments of interest under the loan. Question 1 Do the interest payments under the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 3? Answer 1 No. The interest payments under the loan give rise to a mismatch in tax outcomes as they are deductible under New Zealand law, but are not included in ordinary income under Country H law. However, the D/NI result is not dependent on the classification of the financial instrument (that is, the subordinated loan). Rather, it applies because Country H does not have a corporate tax system for any taxpayers. Question 2 Does the outcome described above change if the subordinated loan is instead a hybrid financial instrument that is treated as an equity instrument by Horse Co but a debt instrument by Kiwi Co (with interest treated as deductible)? Answer 2 No. The D/NI result would still arise if Horse Co treated the subordinated loan as a debt instrument (mirroring Kiwi Co’s treatment of it). This is because Country H has no corporate tax system. 30 Example 10: Interest payment to a taxpayer resident in a territorial tax regime Tiger Co (a company resident in Country T) owns all the shares in Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand). Tiger Co lends money to Kiwi Co. The loan carries a market rate of interest which is payable every six months in arrears. Payments of interest and principal under the loan are subordinated to the ordinary creditors of Kiwi Co and can be suspended in the event Kiwi Co fails to meet certain solvency requirements. Both Tiger Co and Kiwi Co treat the subordinated loan as a debt instrument. Country T has a pure territorial tax system and does not tax income unless it has a domestic source. Interest income paid by a non-resident is treated as foreign source income and is exempt from tax. Question 1 Do the interest payments under the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 3? Answer 1 No. The interest payments under the loan give rise to a mismatch in tax outcomes as they are deductible under New Zealand law, but are not included in ordinary income under Country T law. However, the D/NI result is not dependent on the classification of the financial instrument (that is, the subordinated loan). Rather, it applies because Country T taxes on a purely territorial basis. Question 2 Does the outcome described above change if the subordinated loan is instead a hybrid financial instrument that is treated as an equity instrument by Tiger Co but a debt instrument by Kiwi Co (with interest treated as deductible)? Answer 2 No. The D/NI result would still arise if Tiger Co treated the subordinated loan as a debt instrument (mirroring Kiwi Co’s treatment of it). This is because Country T has a pure territorial tax system and the interest income paid by a non-resident is treated as foreign source income. Ordinary income is defined in subsection (9). It is income taxed at the full (or usual) marginal rate of a person for income from financial instruments, and which is not eligible for any exemption, exclusion, credit or tax relief, other than for withholding tax imposed on the payment. Example 11: Ordinary income An offshore parent tax resident in Country A lends money to a New Zealand subsidiary on the basis that the loan is subordinated to general creditors and interest payments are subject to a solvency requirement. If the interest is not paid, it compounds. The loan is treated as a share under Country A tax law, and payments are treated as dividends. Country A taxes only ten percent of any dividend received from a foreign subsidiary. The tax rate imposed on this ten percent is the same as the tax rate imposed on interest income. In this case, ninety percent of the interest payment is not taxed as ordinary income. However, it would be taxed as ordinary income if the loan were treated as a debt instrument for purposes of Country A tax law. Accordingly, the payment meets the requirements of subsection FH 3(2). 31 Example 12: Ordinary income II Take the facts of example 11, but now assume that Country A also has a rule that denies the ninety percent exclusion to dividends from foreign subsidiaries if they are deductible to the subsidiary (similar to section CW 9(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007). In this case section FH 3 would not apply. The interest would remain deductible, since it is taxable as ordinary income to the offshore parent. It should not matter if there is a timing difference between when the payment is treated as deductible to the New Zealand subsidiary (that is, interest deducted on an accrued basis under the financial arrangements rules) and when it is taxable to the offshore parent (that is, when it is received) under subsection FH 3(2), unless subsection FH 3(3) relating to timing mismatches applies. Varied facts Now suppose that the loan from the offshore parent is to the New Zealand branch of a subsidiary also resident in Country A, and the offshore subsidiary and the offshore parent are in a tax consolidated group in Country A, pursuant to which payments between the two companies are disregarded for Country A tax purposes. In that case, the payment would not be included in the offshore parent’s income regardless of the classification of the payment or the loan. Accordingly, the payment is not subject to section FH 3 (though it may well be subject to section FH 5). Timing mismatches Subsection (3) applies to “timing mismatches”. These arise if: • an amount of a payment is recognised as ordinary income; • the financial instrument, including extensions contemplated by the financial instrument, does not have a duration of three years or less; and • the payee is not using a reasonable accrual method to recognise income from the payment and the payment is not, or is not reasonably expected to be, recognised in the payee country in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the year in which the amount is deductible. One example of where a timing mismatch can arise is where the instrument is treated as equity in the payee country and the payee country has adopted hybrid recommendation 2. Recommendation 2 will ensure the (dividend) payment is taxable, but may not put it on an accrual recognition basis. Example 13: Timing mismatch I An offshore parent company makes an advance to a New Zealand subsidiary company, with interest accruing but payable only if demanded by the parent. The loan has no specified maturity date. The New Zealand subsidiary deducts interest as it accrues, but the parent only recognises the interest when it is paid under the tax law in its country of residence. In this case, although demand for repayment of the advance could be made at any time, there is no requirement for the advance to be repaid within three years, so the three year de minimis does not apply. In the absence of section FH 3, the group can expect to generate a tax advantage by the subsidiary not paying the interest. Accordingly, unless there is some evidence to support an expectation that the interest will be paid within the required period, the interest payment will be subject to deduction denial under subsection FH 3(4). 32 If the New Zealand subsidiary in example 12 does pay interest to its offshore parent in the future, the New Zealand subsidiary will receive a deduction for any interest previously denied under subsection FH 3(7) to the extent the interest payment is recognised as income by the parent. Hybrid counteraction Subsection (4) defines the amount for which the payer is denied a deduction when subsection (1) is satisfied. The deduction has two components. The first component is for the incurred amount. This is the expenditure incurred by the payer relat ing to the payment instrument and the payee. For financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency, the expenditure should be calculated taking into account the effect of changes in the NZD value of both the principal amount and the payment itself (to the extent these changes are otherwise taken into account in determining income). In such cases, the incurred amount in subsection (4) is also intended to include both amounts. The second component is a formula with a fraction, which is: 1 – payee tax / ordinary tax. This is intended to reduce the deduction denied to the extent that foreign tax is imposed on the payment. Payee tax is the total of: • the tax for which the payment is liable in the payee country within the timing in subsection (6), and to the extent that the payment is ordinary income in the payee jurisdiction. This could be tax on income recognised in the payee country in the same year as the deduction is claimed in New Zealand, but also includes tax on income recognised in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the year in which the deduction is claimed in the payer country. It is calculated by multiplying the amount of the payment that is recognised as income by the applicable rate of tax; and • the amount of income tax actually imposed on the income under CFC rules in another country again within the timing in subsection (6). In relation to this second element, there must be actual tax payable on the income. This test will not be met if the CFC tax is reduced by losses or credits, other than credits for withholding tax imposed by New Zealand on the payment. Ordinary tax is the amount of tax which would be imposed on the payment if it were ordinary income in the payee country. Example 14: Timing mismatch II Take the facts of example 11. In this case the incurred amount is the deduction claimed by the payer in a given year. If a payment is made, or is reasonably expected to be made, within the 24-month timing in subsection (6) for which the deduction is claimed, “payee tax” will include an amount equal to ten percent of the payment times the payee’s ordinary tax rate. The formula in section FH 3(4) will deny a deduction for the incurred amount times ninety percent. If the timing requirement is not met, payee tax will be zero, and the full amount of the deduction will be denied. If tax is later paid by the payee outside the 24-month timing in subsection (6), a deduction will be allowed to that extent, under subsection (7). 33 Example 15: Variable rates Rimu Ltd is a New Zealand company that is wholly owned by a foreign limited partnership, Redwood LP. Redwood LP has funded Rimu Ltd through a combination of shares and debt. Redwood LP has a number of individual investors in Country U. Those investors treat the debt in Rimu Ltd as shares. The investors are taxable on dividends at a flat rate of 20%. However, the interest payments on the hybrid shareholder debt can sometimes be treated as a return of capital in Country U. If the debt were treated as debt in Country U, the payments would be treated as interest, and taxable at each investor’s marginal rate. In this case, none of the income of the investors is recognised as ordinary income. Accordingly, all of the deductions for the payments will be denied, even though a significant amount of foreign tax is paid. This is the same tax outcome as would apply if the shareholder loan were replaced by non-hybrid equity. Redwood LP may wish to replace the hybrid debt with non-hybrid debt, so that the interest is again fully deductible in New Zealand. Subsection (7) applies to amounts for which a deduction is denied because of a timing mismatch (that is, the amounts fall within subsection (6)). Once the payment is recognised as ordinary income in the payee country, the payer is allowed a deduction for the amount previously denied under subsection (4). Example 16: Reversal of timing mismatch Take the facts of example 11. Suppose that $1,000 of expenditure has been incurred, of which $900 is not taxed to the offshore parent, and $100 is taxed, but not within the time frame in subsection (6). The $900 will never be deductible, but the $100 will be deducted when the payment is made by New Zealand subsidiary and recognised by Offshore Parent. The intention of subsection (8) is to deal with the effect of foreign currency gains of a person who, but for such gains, would be denied a deduction for expenditure incurred under a financial arrangement because it falls within subsection (2). If such a person has net income from the financial arrangement due to the foreign currency gain, subsection (8) provides that the income will be excluded income. If the deduction for the payment would have been only partially denied, the income is excluded income in the same proportion. Section FH 4 – defensive rule Section FH 4 is the defensive rule of recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. Section FH 4 applies when a person subject to New Zealand tax receives a payment under a financial instrument if: • the payment would not give rise to assessable income of the payee, or gives rise to assessable income not meeting the timing requirements in subsection (7). The timing requirements are that the income must be allocated to an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the accounting period to which the deduction is claimed in the payer country; • the payment is treated in another country as deductible (or entitled to equivalent tax relief) to a person in that country; • that country does not have an equivalent to section FH 3 (the primary rule for hybrid financial instruments); 34 • the financial instrument is part of a structured arrangement or the payee and payer are related; and • the payment meets the requirements of subsection (2) or (3). Subsection (2) relates to character mismatches and subsection (3) relates to timing mismatches. Character mismatches Subsection (2) applies to character mismatches, which arise when a payment does not give rise to assessable income to the payee, but would do so if the classification of the payment or the financial instrument were varied. Generally, it is not expected that subsection (2) would apply to a dividend, since New Zealand already taxes deductible dividends (as the section CW 9 exemption does not apply to deductible dividends). Nor is it intended that section FH 4 would apply to payments under a finance lease where the payer in another country treats the lease as an operating lease and claims a deduction for the entire amount of the payment. In this case, so long as the instrument remains a financial instrument, there is no variation to its terms that would result in the payments being assessable to the extent they represent a payment of principal in respect of the deemed loan under the finance lease. Example 17: Deemed interest on interest-free loan Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand) lends money to Beetle Co (a company resident in Country B) on interest-free terms. The laws of Country B allow Beetle Co to claim a deduction for tax purposes as if it had paid interest on the loan at a market rate. NZ treats the loan as a debt instrument. Question Does the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule in section FH 4? Answer The loan does not fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule because there is no payment under the loan that gives rise to a deduction for tax purposes in Country B. (Note that this example does not consider the application of the transfer pricing rules. If the transfer pricing rules apply to the loan, they may also treat Kiwi Co as earning income under the loan.) 35 Example 18: Potential character mismatch Camel Co (a company resident in Country C) issues 10 year redeemable preference shares (RPS) to Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand), which owns one hundred percent of the voting interests in Camel Co. The RPS pay an annual return (dividend) that accrues daily and, to the extent accrued dividends are unpaid, forms part of the redemption price. In Country C, the RPS are treated as debt for tax purposes and the coupons are ordinarily deductible as they accrue. Country C does not have a tax rule equivalent to the primary rule for recommendation 1 of the OECD hybrid report. Question Does the RPS fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument relating to character mismatches in section FH 4(2)? Answer In New Zealand, the coupons would be assessable as dividend income because the exemption in section CW 9 for foreign dividends does not apply to a deductible foreign equity distribution. Therefore, there is no D/NI mismatch arising from the RPS that section FH 4(2) might counter. Timing mismatches Subsection (3) applies to timing mismatches. It applies to a payment under a financial instrument which does not have a duration, including extensions contemplated by the financial instrument, of three years or less. Subsection (3) applies if the payment gives rise to assessable income, but the gap between the year in which the deduction is claimed by the payer in its country and the derivation of assessable income in New Zealand meets the requirements of subsection (7). An amount meets the requirements of subsection (7) if it is not included, or is not reasonably expected to be included, in income in New Zealand in an income year beginning within 24 months of the end of the accounting period in which it is deductible in the payer country. Example 19: Timing mismatch of RPS Take the facts in Example 18 (“Potential character mismatch”. Question Does the RPS fall within the scope of section FH 4(3)? Answer Yes, depending on the facts. If there is no expectation the RPS will be redeemed within 24 months of the end of the foreign tax year in which Camel Co claims a deduction, Kiwi Co will need to recognise the income in the same year Camel Co deducts the expense. 36 Example 20: Prepaid interest Kiwi Co (a company resident in New Zealand) owns one hundred percent of the voting interests in Donkey Co (a company resident in Country D) and provides it with an interest-bearing loan for a fixed term of three years. Donkey Co pays the interest upfront in a lump sum payment for which it is entitled to an immediate deduction in the foreign country. Kiwi Co returns the interest payment on an accruals basis over the three-year term. Question 1 Does the loan fall within the scope of the hybrid financial instrument rule relating to timing mismatches in section FH 4? Answer 1 The loan will not give rise to a timing mismatch under section FH 4(3) for Kiwi Co as it has a term of three years (limb (b)). Question 2 Does the answer change if the loan is for a five-year term instead? Answer 2 The loan will give rise to a timing mismatch under section FH 4(3). The portion of the interest income which under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW would not be derived in or before the income year beginning 24 months after the end of the borrower’s income year would be taxed upfront on receipt under section FH 4(4), instead of spread on an accruals basis under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. The remaining portion of the interest income would be taxed in the usual way. Hybrid counteraction Subsection (4) is the main operative subsection for a character mismatch. It provides that a payment which is subject to the section gives rise to assessable income equal to the amount that would be assessable if the classification of the financial instrument were varied. Under subsection (6), this income is allocated to the year in which: • in the case of a character mismatch, it would be derived if the terms of the instrument were varied so that the payment gave rise to income; or • in the case of a timing mismatch, the relevant deduction is allowable in the payer country. Replacement payment under returning share transfer Subsection (5) provides for the case where a New Zealand taxpayer receives a replacement payment under a returning share transfer. Replacement payments are taxable income. However, if the returning share transfer is also a share lending arrangement as defined in section YA 1, the replacement payment can carry an imputation credit (section OB 64). If the share borrower is entitled to a deduction in its country for the replacement payment, the attachment of such a credit would give rise to a hybrid mismatch. In order to reverse this, the imputation credit is denied. 37 Deductible foreign equity distribution definition The exclusion in section CW 9(2)(c) for deductible foreign equity distributions will continue to apply to such distributions with priority over the hybrid mismatch rules (including the defensive hybrid financial instrument rule) of other countries, consistent with the OECD’s recommendation 2.1. For example, the adoption of hybrid rules in Australia will have no effect on the tax treatment of a New Zealand company in respect of a deductible dividend received from an Australian company. The definition of “deductible foreign equity distribution” has been amended in section YA 1 to include distributions on shares in a foreign company for which a deduction against income or equivalent tax relief or tax benefit is allowed, or would be allowed in the absence of the hybrid mismatch legislation (including situations where the distribution is sourced directly or indirectly from an amount paid to the foreign company that is deductible). 38 Example 21: Foreign unit trust Koala Trust is a unit trust established and managed in Westland (a foreign country). Kauri Co (a company resident in New Zealand) holds 40% of its units. In the year to 30 June 2019, Koala Trust earns W$200,000, and passes resolutions sufficient to ensure that this amount is treated for Westland tax purposes as the income of its beneficiaries (including Kauri Co). These resolutions mean that sum is absolutely vested in the unit holders. If these resolutions had not been passed, the income would have been taxed in Westland to the trustee at a tax rate of 48%. Question 1 Assume Koala Trust’s income is sourced from a third country. The effect of the source of Koala Trust’s income and the vesting of the income in the beneficiaries of Koala Trust (including Kauri Co) is that Westland does not impose any tax on that income. What is the tax treatment of this income in New Zealand? Answer 1 The absolute vesting of the 2019 year income means that Kauri Co is deemed to have received a dividend of W$80,000 (due to Kauri Co’s 40% interest in Koala Trust), under section CD 9. Generally, this dividend would be exempt under section CW 9(1). However, in this case the dividend is not exempt because it is a deductible foreign equity distribution. The definition of deductible foreign equity distribution (as amended) includes an amount giving rise to a deduction or equivalent tax relief or tax benefit. The vesting of the income in unitholders results in a tax benefit (as there is no tax paid in Westland), so the amount will be a taxable dividend in New Zealand for Kauri Co. Question 2 Now assume that Koala Trust’s income is passive income sourced in Westland. If the income were not income of the beneficiaries, it would be taxed to the trustee of Koala Trust at a rate of 48% under Westland law. However, due to the resolutions vesting the income in beneficiary unitholders, in Westland it is taxed as income of (a) the trustee, but taxable at 15%; and (b) the beneficiaries, taxable at the 15% rate, with a credit for tax paid by the trustee. What is the tax treatment of Kauri Co’s share of the income in New Zealand? Answer 2 Again, due to the tax benefit that results from vesting the Koala Trust income in its beneficiaries, the amount will be a deductible foreign equity distribution and taxable dividend for Kauri Co. Question 3 Finally, assume that Koala Trust’s income is active income sourced in Westland. It is taxed under Westland law at the usual rate applying to foreign entities doing business in Westland which is 30%. Both the trustee and the unitholder are liable to tax. What is the tax treatment of the income in New Zealand? Answer 3 The amount vested in Kauri Co is still a deductible foreign equity distribution and a taxable dividend in New Zealand unless the rate applying to the income due to its vesting is the same as the rate that would apply if the income was undistributed. 39 DISREGARDED HYBRID PAYMENTS AND DEEMED BRANCH PAYMENTS Sections FH 5 and FH 6 Background The disregarded hybrid payment rule is recommendation 3 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. The deemed branch payment rule is recommendation 3 of the OECD branch mismatch report. Disregarded hybrid payments Figure 3 illustrates an example of a disregarded hybrid payment mismatch. Such mismatches always involve a payment by a hybrid entity. A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but opaque for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In Figure 3, B Co is the hybrid entity. Figure 3 A Co + InterestLoan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co − An interest payment from a hybrid entity (B Co) to its investor (A Co) will be deductible in Country B and disregarded in Country A. This results in a D/NI hybrid mismatch. The mismatch results in double non-taxation if B Co groups its tax loss with the income of another entity (B Sub 1 in the example) whose income is not taxable in Country A. 40 Deemed branch payments The same outcome can arise if B Co is instead a branch of A Co in Country B and is entitled in Country B to a deduction for a charge made to it by A Co, if that charge is not also recognised as income in Country A. Summary of legislative response Sections FH 5 and FH 6 identify amounts of expenditure relating to: • payments that are deductible in the country of the payer and are disregarded in the country of the payee due to the status of the payer; and • mismatches in the deductibility and recognition of charges by a head office to a branch in another country which are deductible for tax purposes in the branch country, generally as a way of a branch country ensuring that it taxes only that portion of a multinational entity’s income that corresponds to the activities undertaken in the branch country. These charges are only subject to the sections to the extent they do not reflect a simple allocation of actual third party costs. For example, these sections would apply to a profit margin charged by head office to a branch, or a charge for some internally-performed function. Section FH 5 applies where the deduction is in New Zealand, whereas FH 6 applies where New Zealand is not including a payment (or deemed payment) as income and the payment (or deemed payment) is deductible in another country. These identified amounts are treated as non-deductible under FH 5 or are included as assessable income under FH 6. A deduction for them is provided under section FH 12 to the extent they do not exceed surplus assessable income under the offsetting rule in that section. Application date The rules apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Section FH 5 applies to payments for which deductions are claimed in that income year or subsequently. Section FH 6 applies only to payments that are paid on or after the start of the payee’s income year. Detailed analysis Section FH 5 – primary rule Section FH 5 is the primary rule for recommendation 3 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and recommendation 3 of the OECD branch mismatch report. It applies with priority over the defensive rules of foreign countries. The primary rule concerns New Zealand residents and New Zealand branches of non-residents that incur an amount of expenditure relating to disregarded hybrid payments, or a charge relating to deemed branch payments. Subsection (1) sets out the conditions that must be satisfied for the primary rule to apply. They include that: 41 • there must be an amount of expenditure relating to either a disregarded hybrid payment under subsection (2) or a deemed branch payment under subsection (3); • the expenditure or charge is deductible in New Zealand; • the payment or charge is treated as not being received in a foreign country due to the status of the payer; • the payment or charge would be treated as received in a foreign country if the tax status of the payer were different; • the payment or charge does not give rise to tax under CFC rules in a foreign country. For the primary rule to apply to a disregarded payment, subsection (2) must be satisfied in addition to (1). Subsection (2) requires that: • the payee is a non-resident and is not receiving the payment through a New Zealand taxable branch; and • the payer (who can be a New Zealand resident or a branch of a non-resident) either makes a payment to another person in the same control group or makes the payment under a structured arrangement. This requirement is set out separately because it is not necessary for the deemed branch payments context. A disregarded hybrid payment structure of note is a consolidated group of entities resident in a foreign country (such as Australia) where one of those entities operates in New Zealand through a branch. Payments made by an entity through its branch to a consolidated entity might be disregarded in the foreign country, which would be a D/NI outcome. Section FH 5 would deny a deduction to the payer in this instance. For the primary rule to apply to a deduction claimed by a New Zealand branch for a charge paid to a non-New Zealand part of the same legal entity (deemed branch payments) the charge must satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) and some further requirements set out in subsection (3). The purpose of these requirements is to distinguish deduction for allocation of third party expenditure (which are dealt with by section FH 9) from true intra-entity charges. 7 Where the relevant conditions are met, the payer of the payment is denied a deduction for all expenditure (including foreign exchange gains and losses) relating to the payment, under subsection (4). However, under section FH 12, if the payer has surplus assessable income the mismatch amount may be set off against that amount. 7 See paragraphs 85–88 of the OECD Branch Mismatch Report for a fuller discussion of the difference between deductions for allocation of third party expenditure and true intra-entity charges. 42 Example 22: Disregarded hybrid payment mismatch (primary rule) Jefferson Co, a foreign company resident in Washington Country (a foreign jurisdiction) owns one hundred percent of Hamilton Co, an unlimited liability company resident in New Zealand. Jefferson Co provides Hamilton Co with a foreign currency loan under which interest is payable annually. In the relevant income year, the foreign currency strengthens relative to the New Zealand dollar. The interest payments and any foreign currency movements on the loan are deductible (before applying the hybrid rules) to Hamilton Co in New Zealand. The laws of Washington Country allow Jefferson Co to treat Hamilton Co’s income and expenditure as attributable to Jefferson Co because of Hamilton Co’s unlimited liability. This means that the interest payment is disregarded in Washington Country due to the status of the payer (Hamilton Co). If Hamilton Co were treated differently, for example if it were treated as a separate entity in Washington Country, the interest payment would be treated as received by Jefferson Co. Question 1 How does section FH 5 apply to Hamilton Co? Answer 1 Under section FH 5(5), Hamilton Co has a mismatch amount for its incurred expenditure on the debt instrument. This expenditure is non-deductible under section FH 5(4). Hamilton Co would have to apply section FH 12 to determine whether a deduction can be claimed. Variation of facts Suppose that even though Hamilton Co is disregarded for Washington Country tax purposes, Washington Country exempts the income earned through Hamilton Co from tax, on the basis of an active offshore branch income exemption. Suppose also that because of this exemption, for Washington Country tax purposes, Jefferson Co is denied a deduction for a portion of its interest expense. Question 2 Will this interest deduction denial in Washington Country affect the application of section FH 5? Answer 2 No. 43 Example 23: Deemed branch payment mismatch (primary rule) Root Co, a foreign company resident in Ashes Country (a foreign jurisdiction) operates through a branch in New Zealand. Root Co manufactures cricket bats in Ashes Country, and sells them to retail stores in various countries, generally via branches of Root Co in those countries, including the one in New Zealand. Root Co transfers its cricket bats from Ashes Country to its branch in New Zealand. Each cricket bat transfer is compensated for tax purposes by a $250 charge from the branch to Root Co representing $150 of costs per cricket bat to Root Co as well as a $100 arm’s length mark-up in recognition of the profit generating activities of the manufacturing process in Ashes Country. This $100 mark-up is approximately the same as the marginal profit Root Co receives upon selling a cricket bat in Ashes Country. Currently, the entirety of the $250 charge is deductible to Root Co’s branch in New Zealand and can be offset against income earned by the branch for cricket bat sales. Ashes Country exempts active branch income from taxation. The $250 is potentially within scope of proposed section FH 5 as a deemed branch payment. The $150 cost component of the charge is not within scope of section FH 5. This is because it does not satisfy section FH 5(3)(c) due to the amount being determined by reference to the actual costs of Root Co. (though this amount may be subject to section FH 9). However, the $100 arm’s length mark-up component of the charge meets the requirements of section FH 5(3)(b) as it is a profit-based amount and so it is not determined by reference to any payments made by Root Co. or any other person in a control group with Root Co. To the extent that the $100 mark up portion of the transfer price for each bat is not treated as income of Root Co. in Ashes Country, it will be denied a deduction under section FH 5(4). It will also be a mismatch amount under FH 5(5) until there is surplus assessable income against which it may be set off under section FH 12. Section FH 6 – defensive rule Section FH 6 is the defensive rule for recommendation 3 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. It also applies as a defensive rule for recommendation 3 of the OECD branch mismatch report, though the report does not recommend a defensive rule. The defensive rule mirrors the primary rule and is targeted at: • payments that are deductible to a foreign entity but disregarded in New Zealand; and • foreign branches of New Zealand persons who are entitled to a deduction in another country for a deemed branch payment or charge. Subsection (1) of section FH 6 sets out the following requirements for the defensive rule to apply: • A non-resident, or foreign branch of a New Zealand resident, must be treated by the relevant foreign country as having made a payment (a disregarded hybrid payment) meeting the requirements of subsection (2) to a person in New Zealand or having incurred a deemed branch payment meeting the requirements of subsection (3). • The relevant foreign country allows the payer a deduction for the payment or equivalent tax relief. • The relevant foreign country does not have hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to section FH 5 (the primary rule) that applies to the payer and the charge for any part of the relevant year (in that case, the foreign country’s primary rule would take priority). • The person in New Zealand does not derive assessable income from the payment. 44 • The payment would result in assessable income for the person in New Zealand if: – in the case of a hybrid mismatch, the tax status of the payer were different. New Zealand tax law does not generally provide for foreign entities to be entirely disregarded. Even if they are fiscally transparent, such as partnerships, a payment by the entity to a member is generally taken account of for tax purposes (albeit that inclusion by the member of the payment may be largely offset by attribution to the member of a share of the deduction – this deduction means the payment is potentially subject to section FH 9). One case where a payment can be disregarded in this way is where it is made by one member of a tax consolidated group to another member see section FM 8(2); or – in the case of a branch mismatch, the payer and payee were separate persons. For the defensive rule to apply to a disregarded payment, subsection (2) must be satisfied in addit ion to subsection (1). Subsection (2) requires that the relevant parties are a payee in New Zealand that is in the same control group as the payer (who can be a non-resident or a foreign branch of a New Zealand resident) or that the payment is made under a structured arrangement. For the defensive rule to apply to a deemed branch payment from a foreign branch of a New Zealand person, that charge must satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) and some further requirements set out in subsection (3). As with section FH 5(3), the purpose of these requirements is that section FH 6 should only apply to a mismatch arising because of an intra- group charge deduction in a foreign country being unmatched by income in New Zealand. Section FH 8 rather than FH 6 is intended to apply to double deductions arising due to the allocation of the same expenditure to two countries. Where the conditions referred to above are met, the amount of the payment or charge is assessable income (it is treated as being zero, if the payment or charge gives rise to a loss, for example, due to foreign exchange fluctuations), under subsection (4). This assessable income is derived in the year in which it would be derived if the payer and payee were separate persons or the payer’s tax status was different, under subsection (5). The assessable income is further treated as a mismatch amount under subsection (6), which can be reversed if the taxpayer has surplus assessable income under section FH 12 to offset against it. Because New Zealand taxes income of foreign branches, section FH 12 generally will mean that there is a deduction under section FH 12 to match the section FH 6 inclusion. This will not be the case if foreign branch income taxable in New Zealand is less than the amount of the foreign charge. Subsection (7) prevents a mismatch amount under subsection (5) from being carried forward if the payer country introduces hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to the primary rule for disregarded hybrid payment and/or deemed branch payment mismatches. 45 Example 24: New Zealand consolidated group and disregarded hybrid payment Figure 4 Ro yalty pay men t Y or k New Zealand Clement CoMcKenzie Co Foreign branch The Conchord Group McKenzie Co and Clement Co are two companies resident in New Zealand in the entertainment business. They are both part of a consolidated group (the Conchord group) under New Zealand law. Clement Co has a branch in York, a foreign country that does not have hybrid rules. Clement Co makes a royalty payment to McKenzie Co through its foreign branch. Under the laws of York, Clement Co is entitled to a deduction for the payment. Under New Zealand’s consolidation rules in subpart FM, the payment is treated as excluded income for McKenzie Co with no deduction for Clement Co. The counterfactual test in FH 6(1)(d) is satisfied because if Clement Co’s tax status were changed such that it is no longer consolidated with McKenzie Co, the payment would be assessable income for McKenzie Co. McKenzie Co must include the royalty payment as assessable income. This amount is a mismatch amount. If McKenzie Co’s foreign branch earns income which meets the definition of surplus assessable income in section FH 12 (considered below), then the group will be entitled to a deduction to offset the hybrid inclusion. 46 REVERSE HYBRID RULE AND BRANCH PAYEE MISMATCH RULE Section FH 7 Background Section FH 7 implements recommendation 4 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report, denying a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid in certain cases. It also implements recommendation 2 of the OECD branch mismatch report, denying a deduction for a payment which is not taxed due to a branch mismatch in certain cases. Figure 5 illustrates an example of a reverse hybrid mismatch. Such mismatches always involve a payment to a reverse hybrid entity. A reverse hybrid entity is opaque for tax purposes in the country of an investor (Country A) but transparent for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established (Country B). In the diagram below, B Co is the reverse hybrid. Figure 5 A Co Interest Loan Country B Country A B Co Country C + − C Co If B Co receives a payment that is deductible for the payer (C Co), that payment may not be taxed in Country A or Country B. This is because Country B views the payment as being earned by A Co, while Country A views the payment as being earned by B Co. If the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co to A Co, this is a deduction/no inclusion (D/NI) hybrid mismatch outcome. A similar outcome can arise as a result of a branch payee mismatch. For example, if the diagram above is modified so that there is no B Co, but: • Country A treats C Co.’s payment as received by a Country B branch of A Co, and exempts it under a territorial approach to active income; and 47 • Country B does not recognise the payment as received by a permanent establishment in Country B, the result will be that the payment by C Co is deductible in Country C, but not taxed anywhere due to the different allocation rules in Countries A and B, which is once again a D/NI mismatch. Application date Section FH 7 applies to deductions claimed in income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Section FH 7(1) denies a deduction for expenditure relating to a payment: • to a person who exists under the law of another country (the payee country). This requirement assumes that the person is not a natural person, and owes their existence to the laws of a particular country. For example, in the case of a company, the company must be formed or otherwise owe its existence to a particular country’s laws; • where the expenditure would be allowed as a deduction for the payer in the absence of the hybrid rules; • treated in the payee country as either: – received in another country. This will be the case where there is a potential branch mismatch. A branch mismatch requires that the payee treats the payment as attributable to operations outside its residence country; or – income of another person in the same control group as the payer. This will be the case where there is a potential reverse hybrid mismatch. The payee country treats the reverse hybrid as fiscally transparent, so that the payment is treated as the income of its owners. The requirement is only met in the case of an owner who is in the same control group as the New Zealand payer; • where the payee and payer are also in the same control group, or the payment is made under a structured arrangement; • where the payment is not subject to taxation of a person in the same control group as the payee. This will be the case where: – in the case of a potential branch mismatch, the branch country does not tax the payment; – in the case of a reverse hybrid, the owner country does not tax the payment; • the payment would have been taxable if it were made: – in the case of a branch mismatch to the payee directly in the payee country; – in the case of a reverse hybrid, directly to the owner. If these requirements are met, section FH 7(2) denies a deduction for the payment and any related expenditure from foreign currency movements (which would be included as part of ‘interest’ expenditure under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW). 48 Example 25: Diverted branch payment mismatches Pavlova Co (a company resident in New Zealand) makes a deductible payment to a group member, Banana Cake Co (which is incorporated and resident in Country B and has a branch in Country C). The domestic law of Country B (the payee country) exempts foreign branch profits and considers the payment to have been paid to the Country C branch of Banana Cake Co. In Country C, Banana Cake Co is recognised as having a permanent establishment (PE) but the payment is regarded as having been paid to Banana Cake Co in its own right, instead of being allocated to the PE. The payment is therefore not subject to income tax in either Country B or Country C. The payment thus meets the requirements of section FH 7(1)(a), (b), (c), and (d). The counterfactual requirement in section FH 7(1)(e) is also met as the payment would have been subject to income tax in Country B had it been treated as a payment to Banana Cake Co’s head office in Country B. As the requirements in Section FH 7(1) are satisfied, subsection (2) denies Pavlova Co a deduction for its payment to Banana Cake Co. Example 26: Disregarded branch payment mismatches The facts are the same as in example 25, except that Banana Cake Co is not regarded as having a PE in Country C. Country B still considers that there is a PE in Country C. This mismatch therefore satisfies each of the requirements of Section FH 7(1) in the same way as the diverted branch payment example above. Pavlova Co will similarly be denied a deduction under subsection (2) for its payment to its group member Banana Cake Co. 49 DEDUCTIBLE HYBRID AND BRANCH PAYMENTS (DOUBLE DEDUCTIONS) RULE Sections FH 8 and FH 9 Background The deductible hybrid rule is recommendation 6 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and the branch payments rule is recommendation 4 of the OECD branch mismatch report. Figure 6 is an example of a deductible hybrid payments mismatch. Such mismatches always involve a payment from a hybrid entity. Hybrid entities are treated as transparent under the laws of the investor’s tax country and opaque under the laws of the establishment or operating country. This hybrid treatment can result in the same item of expenditure incurred by the hybrid being deductible under the laws of both the parent and payer countries. Figure 6 A Co + Interest Loan Country B Country A B Sub 1 B Co Bank − In the example, B Co is a wholly-owned subsidiary of A Co. B Co is disregarded for Country A tax purposes. B Co borrows from a bank and pays interest on the loan. B Co derives no other income. Because B Co is disregarded, A Co is treated as the borrower under the loan under Country A’s tax laws. The arrangement therefore results in an interest deduction under the laws of both Country B and Country A (unless Country A denies a deduction for some reason, for example under an active foreign income exemption). B Co is consolidated for tax purpose with its operating subsidiary (B Sub 1), which allows it to utilise the tax benefit of the interest deduction to B Sub 1. The ability to utilise the tax benefit through the consolidation regime allows the two deductions for the interest expense to be offset 50 against separate income arising in Country A and Country B. This is a double deductions (DD) mismatch. Branch structures can also achieve the same result, particularly if the country where the entity with the branch is resident in a country that taxes the branch income (as New Zealand does). Summary of legislative response Sections FH 8 and FH 9 implement recommendation 6 of the OECD hybrid report and recommendation 4 of the OECD branch report. They are respectively primary and defensive rules designed to deal with hybrid and branch payment mismatches which produce double deduction (DD) outcomes. The primary rule applies where the hybrid entity or branch is owned by a New Zealand resident and located in a foreign country, whereas the defensive rule applies where the hybrid entity or branch is in New Zealand and owned by a person in another country. The primary rule applies with priority over the defensive rules of foreign countries. Notably, the primary rule’s application is restricted. Only foreign branches or hybrid entities that are capable of offsetting their losses against the income of an existing foreign (non-hybrid) entity are within scope of the rule. This means that simple offshore structures, such as a New Zealand company with only a foreign branch in a country are excluded from the rule. The primary rule also contains a transitional rule that ensures that a person that transitions into the scope of the rule will not benefit from the restricted scope in relation to previous year foreign losses. The effect of these provisions is to identify gross amounts of expenditure relating to a person’s branch or hybrid entity. These identified amounts are non-deductible in New Zealand unless they can be offset against surplus assessable income under section FH 12 (see below). Application date The rules apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Section FH 8 (primary rule) New Zealand residents that are related to a foreign hybrid entity or have a foreign branch may fall within the scope of this rule. The key requirement for the rule to apply is in sections FH 8(1)(a) and FH 8(1)(b) which together mean the section only applies if the relevant foreign country allows losses of the hybrid entity/branch to be offset against income of an existing person whose income is not taxed in New Zealand (other than that which is sourced in New Zealand). This is generally referred to as non-dual inclusion income in the OECD hybrid and branch mismatch reports, and is income which is not surplus assessable income under the new legislation. 51 Example 27: New Zealand company with a simple foreign branch structure Figure 7 Kowhai Co + Interest Lilliput New Zealand Bank − Foreign branch Loan Kōwhai Co, a company resident in New Zealand, sells native wood carvings in New Zealand and in Lilliput (a foreign country). Kōwhai Co conducts its Lilliput business through a branch in that country. Kōwhai Co borrows from a bank to support its activities in Lilliput. This loan is attributed to its Lilliput branch. As New Zealand taxes its residents on their worldwide income, Kōwhai Co will be entitled to a deduction in New Zealand for interest paid on the loan. The interest expenditure will also be deductible in Lilliput for Kōwhai Co’s branch. FH 8(1)(a) is not satisfied as Kōwhai Co has not used the income of another person or entity) to offset against its Lilliput branch interest expenditure (there is no such person or entity). Accordingly, Kōwhai Co’s New Zealand tax position has not been altered by the introduction of hybrid and branch mismatch rules. Even if Lilliput has a rule equivalent to section FH 9 (the defensive rule for double deductions in hybrid entities and branches) in these circumstances that rule should have no practical effect. All it will do is deny Kōwhai Co the ability to use its branch loss against non-branch income in Lilliput, of which there is none. Section FH 8(2) denies a New Zealand person a deduction for the expenditure it incurs through the hybrid entity or branch. This expenditure is treated as a mismatch amount that can be offset (that is, deducted) to the extent there is surplus assessable income under section FH 12. 52 Example 28: Foreign hybrid entity structure Figure 8 Prospero Co Interest expenditure Titania New Zealand Mercutio Co Fals taff Co 7 5% Minority owner + − Lenders Loan in T$ 2 5% The Shakespeare group consists of Prospero Co, Falstaff Co and Mercutio Co. Prospero Co, a company resident in New Zealand, owns seventy five percent of Falstaff Co, a hybrid entity resident in Titania (a foreign country). Falstaff Co is treated as a company in Titania, but is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as a partnership. Its income and expenditure is thus attributed to its owners (Prospero Co and the twenty five percent minority owner). Falstaff Co owns one hundred percent of Mercutio Co, a company resident in Titania, and the two entities are consolidated. The consolidation regime of Titania allows the losses of one entity to be offset against the income of the other. Mercutio Co is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as a company, and undertakes an active business in Titania, such that its income is not attributed to Prospero Co under the CFC regime. Falstaff Co performs a financing function for the Shakespeare Group, and its financing costs are deductible in Titania which means that it regularly makes tax losses in Titania. The financing expenditure is also attributed to Prospero Co under New Zealand law, and Prospero Co claims deductions for its seventy five percent share of that expenditure. Because Falstaff Co borrows in Titanian dollars, fluctuations in the NZ$/T$ exchange rate mean the amount of its deductions attributed to Prospero Co under New Zealand tax rules can be much larger or smaller than the amount calculated for Titanian tax purposes. Prospero Co satisfies section FH 8(1) due to the ability of its related hybrid entity Falstaff Co to offset its losses against the income of Mercutio Co, which is not generally assessable in New Zealand under the CFC regime. Under sections FH 8(2) and (3), Prospero Co has a denied deduction and mismatch amount equal to its expenditure from Falstaff Co. There is no need to compare the amount of this expenditure with the amount of expenditure Falstaff Co calculates for Titanian tax purposes. If Mercutio Co were a partnership, so that its income was subject to New Zealand tax in the hands of Prospero, section FH 8(1) would not apply, and no deduction for the financing costs would be denied to Prospero under section FH 8. If a person is outside the scope of section FH 8(1) because its foreign hybrid or branch is not able to set off expenditure or loss against another person’s non-dual inclusion income and subsequently falls within the scope of the subsection due to a change of group structure, that person is subject to the rule on a prospective basis and also must consider subsections (4) and (5) of section FH 8. These provisions function as a transitional rule for persons in such a 53 situation to reverse their historic foreign hybrid or branch losses if they become usable in the other country in a way that would defeat the integrity of the primary rule. This transitional rule only applies if: • the person was related to a foreign hybrid entity or had a foreign branch prior to subsection (1) applying to the person; and • the laws of the relevant foreign country allow accumulated losses of the hybrid entity or branch to be set off against income that is not assessable in New Zealand under the new structure. To the extent those requirements are met, section FH 8(5) treats the net loss of the hybrid entity or branch occurring since the introduction of the hybrid rules as assessable income and a mismatch amount. Example 29: New Zealand company with foreign branch making acquisition Figure 9 Drake Co New Zealand Foreign branch Pink Moon Country Bryte r Co Acquisition Drake Co, a company resident in New Zealand, has for many years sold guitars in Pink Moon Country (a foreign country) through a branch. In the last two years trading conditions have been poor in Pink Moon Country and the branch has made losses. These losses accumulate in Pink Moon Country and can also be offset against Drake Co.’s assessable income from other activities. Drake Co has had no other activities or interests in Pink Moon Country. Drake Co does not satisfy the section FH 8(1)(a) and section FH 8(1)(b) requirements because the branch losses cannot be offset against the income of an entity that is not taxable in New Zealand. However, Drake Co believes its prospects in Pink Moon Country will improve, and has now decided to expand its operations there by acquiring Bryter Co a company resident in Pink Moon Country that sells pianos and has a profitable track record. Bryter Co is treated as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. The tax laws of Pink Moon Country allow Drake Co to group its Pink Moon branch operation losses with Bryter Co profit such that its future branch losses can be offset against the income of Bryter Co. Drake Co must now apply section FH 8 to any future branch losses; they will become non-deductible mismatch amounts under sections FH 8(2) and (3). The laws of Pink Moon Country have no rules preventing the branch losses of Drake Co accumulated before the Bryter Co acquisition being carried forward and offset against Bryter Co income post-acquisition. Drake Co meets the requirements of FH 8(4) and so must apply section FH 8(5) and include as assessable income the accumulated Pink Moon Country branch losses (as calculated for New Zealand tax purposes) in its New Zealand income in the income year of the Bryter Co acquisition. 54 Section FH 9 (defensive rule) The defensive rule mirrors the primary rule. It applies to a foreign resident operating in New Zealand through a branch or a New Zealand hybrid entity in the same control group as a foreign resident. The defensive rule does not apply where the country of that foreign resident has enacted hybrid mismatch legislation corresponding to the primary rule. The rule applies when expenditure of the hybrid entity/branch is deductible in New Zealand and the country of the foreign resident also allows that expenditure as a deduction for the foreign resident. Section FH 9(2) denies a deduction for the expenditure incurred in New Zealand, and section FH 9(3) treats the denied deduction as a mismatch amount unless and until it is set off against surplus assessable income under section FH 12. Example 30: Foreign-owned hybrid entity resident in New Zealand Jefferson Co, a foreign company resident in Washington Country (a foreign jurisdiction) owns one hundred percent of Hamilton Co, an unlimited liability company resident in New Zealand. Hamilton Co is a hybrid entity. Hamilton Co incurs various expenses in carrying out its business. These expenses are deductible in New Zealand and are also treated as deductible against the income of Jefferson Co under the tax laws of Washington Country. Washington Country has not enacted hybrid rules. Under sections FH 9(2) and FH 9(3), Hamilton Co has a denied deduction and mismatch amount for its incurred expenditure. This expenditure will be non-deductible, except as provided for in section FH 12. This denial is intended to ensure that the expenses incurred by Hamilton Co cannot be used to offset income which is taxable in New Zealand but is not taxable to Jefferson Co in Washington Country. Suppose Washington Country introduces hybrid rules with effect from 1 January 2022. Jefferson Co will not be required to apply section FH 9 for the income year that includes 1 January 2022 (see section FH 9(1)(c). However, it will also lose the right to deduct any expenditure for which a deduction has been denied under section FH 9 before 1 January 2022 (see section FH 9(4)). 55 DUAL RESIDENT PAYER RULE Section FH 10 Background The dual resident payer rule is recommendation 7 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. It is similar to recommendation 6 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report in that it deals with a single payment that is deducible in two countries. However, in this case, there is only one entity (a company) involved, which both countries treat as tax resident and can lead to double deduction (DD) mismatches. Figure 10 illustrates an example of a dual resident payer mismatch. Figure 10 A Co + Interest Country B Country A B Sub 1 B CoBank − In the example, B Co (a company incorporated in Country B but tax resident in both Country A and Country B) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of A Co (a company incorporated and tax resident in Country A). B Co owns the shares in B Sub 1 (also incorporated and tax resident in Country B). B Co is consolidated for tax purposes with A Co (under Country A law) and B Sub 1 (under B Country law). Similar to the deductible hybrid payment example above, B Co borrows from a bank and pays interest on the loan. B Co derives no other income. Because B Co is resident in both Country A and Country B it is subject to tax on its worldwide income in both countries on a net basis and can utilise any net loss under the tax consolidation regimes of both countries to offset income of other resident companies. This creates the potential for the two deductions for the interest expense to be set off against separate income arising in Country A and Country B. 56 Summary of legislative response Section FH 10 implements recommendation 7 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. It deals with companies that are resident in two countries and which produce double deduction (DD) outcomes by denying the deduction in New Zealand (noting that the other country will also deny the deduction if they have an equivalent to recommendation 7). The deduction denied will be treated as a mismatch amount until there is surplus assessable income under section FH 12. New Zealand tax law already prevents a dual resident company from grouping its losses or being a member of a tax consolidated group, which are two ways that dual resident company losses can be offset against income that is not taxed in both countries. This rule will more thoroughly prevent this outcome by removing the ability of a dual resident company to offset its expenditure against income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (potentially) a New Zealand limited partnership. Application date The rule applies to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Section FH 10(1) provides that the rule applies to a company that is a New Zealand resident and is liable to tax in another country due to its domicile, residence or place of incorporation. Section FH 10(2) states that a company meeting the requirements of subsection (1) is denied a deduction for all of its expenditure. The deduction denied is a mismatch amount under section FH 10(3). Such a company must then consider whether there is any surplus assessable income under section FH 12 to determine whether the denial can be reversed. Generally, the two sections will interact by allowing the expenditure to be offset against the income of the company, less any income that is not and will not be included in the other country that the company is resident in. This might include: • income earned through a New Zealand limited partnership, if the other residence country treats the limited partnership as a company for its tax purposes; or • income earned in a foreign branch, if the other country has a foreign branch exemption. Section FH 10 does not apply to expenditure that is not deductible in the other residence country because it relates to income that is not taxable in that country. This would typically occur if the dual resident company had operations in New Zealand, and the other residence country did not tax active foreign branch income. Such expenditure cannot give rise to a double deduction, and therefore is not problematic under the hybrid rules. 57 IMPORTED MISMATCH RULE Section FH 11 Background The imported mismatch rule is recommendation 8 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and recommendation 5 of the OECD branch mismatch report. An imported mismatch occurs when a payment that does not directly result in a hybrid mismatch outcome funds another payment that does result in a hybrid mismatch outcome. Figure 11 is an example of an imported mismatch. Figure 11 Loan A Co + Hybrid financial ins tr um ent Country B Country A Borrower Co B Co Country C + − − The imported mismatch here occurs between B Co and Borrower Co. Borrower Co gets a deduction for its payment and B Co includes that payment as taxable income, meaning there is no direct hybrid mismatch on that payment. However, that payment is used to fund the payment on a hybrid financial instrument from B Co to A Co. Assuming neither Country A nor Country B has hybrid rules, this payment results in a deduction for B Co, but no corresponding income inclusion for A Co. The loan between Borrower Co and B Co then ‘imports’ the hybrid mismatch back to Country C. Summary of legislative response Section FH 11 implements recommendation 8 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report and recommendation 5 of the OECD branch mismatch report. Section FH 11 denies a deduction for a payment (the imported mismatch payment) which does not itself give rise to a hybrid or branch mismatch, but which is treated as funding such a payment (the funded payment). Imported mismatch payments are split into payments where the 58 imported mismatch payment and the funded payment are part of an arrangement (a structured arrangement) and those where they are not. Unstructured arrangements can be further divided into direct and indirect arrangements. This is relevant for determining how much of a deduction is denied under subsection (4). A practical issue New Zealand businesses making payments to foreign control group members or under structured arrangements will need to pay particular attention to is obtaining the necessary information from the foreign group members to determine whether or not a foreign hybrid mismatch exists. Application date Section FH 11(3), which denies a deduction for an imported mismatch payment which is part of a structured arrangement, applies to payments made in income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Deductions for other imported mismatch payments (unstructured imported mismatches) are not denied until income years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. Detailed analysis General The imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 prevents taxpayers from entering into structured arrangements or arrangements with group members that shift the effect of an offshore hybrid mismatch into New Zealand through the use of a non-hybrid instrument such as an ordinary loan. In brief, the imported mismatch rule denies deductions for a broad range of payments, including interest, royalties, rents and payments for services, if the income from such funds is offset, directly or indirectly, against a payment that arises under a hybrid mismatch arrangement in a foreign country. This means that the hybrid or branch mismatch will be between two foreign countries, rather than between New Zealand and a foreign country, but there will be a deductible payment in New Zealand that is helping fund the hybrid or branch mismatch payment. Conditions Subsection (1) provides that the imported mismatch rule applies where there is a person that makes a payment (the funder) to another person in a foreign country that does not have the hybrid and branch mismatch rules corresponding to subpart FH and which: • directly or indirectly funds a hybrid or branch mismatch payment. In order for the funded payment to be a hybrid mismatch payment, it must be between two non-residents who do not have hybrid or branch mismatch rules that counteract the mismatch (paragraphs (a), (d) and (e)); • is otherwise deductible to the funder (paragraph (b)); and • is: – made under a structured arrangement; or – funds a hybrid mismatch between two persons (the payer and the payee) where the payer is in the same control group as the funder (paragraph (c)). 59 Structured and unstructured imported mismatches The amount of the deduction denied to the funder depends on whether the payment is made under a structured arrangement or not. The definition of a structured arrangement is the definition used for the hybrid rules generally (discussed above). A structured arrangement can exist between control group members. For example if funds are provided by a foreign parent to a New Zealand borrower via a series of consecutive intra-group funding transactions, and a transaction in that series gives rise to a hybrid mismatch, it is highly likely that the loan to the New Zealand borrower is part of a structured arrangement. Interest on the loan is subject to denial under section FH 11. In determining whether or not a payment is made under a structured arrangement, it is not relevant when the arrangement was entered into, only when the payment is made. For example, suppose that in 2010, a multinational group set up a structure which gave rise to a hybrid mismatch not involving New Zealand, but where payments from New Zealand funded a part of the hybrid mismatch payment. A payment made as part of such a structure by a New Zealand person in a tax year beginning on or after 1 July 2018 will be subject to section FH 11. If the payment is under a structured arrangement, the amount of the denial is given by subsection (3). It is the amount of the deduction, limited to the amount of the funded payment for which a deduction would be disallowed to the payer of the hybrid mismatch payment if hybrid mismatch legislation applied to that person. If the payment is not under a structured arrangement, the amount denied is the amount that can fairly and reasonably be treated as providing funds for the funded payment giving rise to a hybrid mismatch under subsection (4). Subsection (5) provides that this amount should be determined consistently with the approach used in chapter 8 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. OECD imported mismatch approach One of the complexities with the imported mismatch rule arises because there may be multiple countries (including New Zealand) with deductible payments that are helping fund the hybrid mismatch arising between two other foreign countries. Some co-ordination and order is required so that the double non-taxation is countered appropriately. The OECD hybrid mismatch report outlines three tracing and priority rules to determine the order and extent to which deductions should be denied for imported hybrid mismatches which should be applied in the following order. This ordering is not codified in the legislation, although subsection (5) states that the amount of deduction denied under unstructured hybrid mismatches should be determined consistently with the approach used in chapter 8 of the OECD hybrid mismatch report. Structured imported mismatches The structured imported mismatch rule applies first to deny deductions to the extent there is a payment made under a structured arrangement that results in an overseas hybrid mismatch under subsection (3). This rule applies a tracing approach to determine the extent to which an imported mismatch payment made under a structured arrangement has funded a hybrid payment under the same arrangement. 60 Example 31: Structured imported mismatch rule In the example illustrated in Figure 12, A Co (a company resident in Country A) is the parent company of the ABCDE Group. A Co provides financing to B Co (a wholly-owned subsidiary of A Co resident in Country B) under a hybrid financial instrument. Interest payments on the hybrid financial instrument are deductible under Country B law but not included in ordinary income under Country A law. B Co on-lends the money provided under the hybrid financial instrument to C Co and D Co (companies that are resident in Country C and Country D respectively). C Co on-lends money to E Co (a wholly-owned subsidiary of C Co resident in New Zealand). Figure 12 A Co + Hybrid financial ins tr um ent Loan − + B Co C CoD Co Loan Loan Interest (120) Interest (80) Interest (40) − ++ − − E Co The loans are all part of the same intra-group financing arrangement. The figure illustrates the group financing structure and the total gross amounts of interest payments made in each accounting period under this structure. E Co is the only group entity resident in a country that has implemented the OECD hybrid and branch recommendations. Question 1 Are the interest payments made by E Co to C Co subject to adjustment under the imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under that rule? Answer 1 Yes. E Co’s imported mismatch payment to C Co and B Co’s payment under the hybrid financial instrument to A Co are payments made under the same structured imported mismatch arrangement. New Zealand should, therefore, deny the full amount of the interest deduction (40) under the structured imported mismatch rule under section FH 11. New Zealand will still impose non-resident withholding tax at the applicable rate on the interest paid by E Co to C Co. 61 Question 2 Does the answer change if Country C is a country that has implemented the OECD recommendations? Answer 2 Yes. E Co is no longer making a payment to a person in a foreign country that does not have hybrid mismatch legislation (as C Co is in Country C which has implemented the OECD recommendations), which means that section FH 11 will not apply. This is because the imported mismatch should instead be countered by C Co in Country C. Question 3 Whether the answer changes if Country B is a country that has implemented the OECD recommendations. Answer 3 Yes. If B Co is resident in a country that has implemented the OECD recommendations it should apply its hybrids rules so the payment from B Co to A Co is non-deductible. If this happens, there will be no hybrid mismatch for New Zealand to counteract. Question 4 What if E Co knows nothing about the transactions occurring above the level of C Co? Answer 4 The hybrid rules mean that E Co is required to determine, in relation to any payments to a non-resident control group member in a country with no hybrid rules whether or not the payment is part of a structured hybrid mismatch arrangement. This will usually require inquiries to be made of other members of the group, and answers to be received. The appropriate level of investigation and assurance depends on the size of the payment and any other relevant facts and circumstances. Direct imported mismatches To the extent the overseas hybrid mismatch has not been neutralised by one or more countries applying the structured imported mismatch rule, there is an unstructured imported mismatch, and subsection (4) applies. Subsections (4) and (5) provide that the amount denied should be determined consistent with the approach in chapter 8 of the hybrid mismatch report. Chapter 8 provides for a two rules to allocate unstructured imported hybrid mismatch payments. The first rule is the direct imported mismatch rule. This rule applies to a New Zealand taxpayer making a payment to the non-resident person who is the payer in the overseas hybrid mismatch. The rule applies an apportionment approach to help determine the extent to which a country should counter the overseas hybrid mismatch where more than one country has a direct imported mismatch. The intent of the apportionment approach is to prevent more than one country counteracting the same overseas hybrid mismatch such that there would be double taxation. 62 Example 32: Structured imported mismatch rule and direct imported mismatch rule The facts are the same as in Example 31, except that B Co already has an existing funding arrangement in place with D Co that is unconnected with the group financing structure and that C Co, D Co and E Co (the shaded entities) are all resident in countries that have implemented the OECD hybrid and branch recommendations. Assume in this example that D Co is resident in New Zealand and E Co is not. Figure 13 illustrates the total gross interest payments made in each accounting period under the group’s financing structure. Figure 13 A Co + Hybrid financial ins tr um ent Loan − + B Co C CoD Co Loan Loan Interest (120) Interest (80) Interest (40) − ++ − − Interest (80) E Co Questions Whether the interest payments made by C Co and E Co would be expected to be adjusted under the imported mismatch rule and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under the rule. Whether the interest payments made by D Co are subject to adjustment under the imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under the rule. Answers The structured imported rule should apply in Country C to deny the full amount of C Co’s interest deduction (80). The interest payment by E Co is made to a payee that is subject to the hybrid mismatch rules. The payment should therefore not be an imported mismatch payment. 63 The interest payment made by D Co should not be treated as made under a structured arrangement unless the D Co loan and the other group financing arrangements were entered into as part of the same overall scheme, plan or understanding (in which case a structured arrangement would arise). New Zealand should, however, apply the direct imported mismatch rule to deny half of the interest payment paid by D Co to B Co (40) under subsections FH 11(4) and (5). Indirect imported mismatches If the overseas hybrid mismatch has not been fully neutralised by one or more countries applying the structured imported mismatch rule and direct imported mismatch rule, the second unstructured rule is the indirect imported mismatch rule. This rule applies a tracing methodology to determine the extent to which the hybrid deduction from an overseas hybrid mismatch has been indirectly funded by imported mismatch payments from other group members. So it applies to a payment made by a New Zealand taxpayer t a person who is not a payer under an overseas hybrid mismatch but who is a payer, directly or indirectly, to such a person. Like the direct imported mismatch rule, the indirect imported mismatch rule applies an apportionment approach to help determine the extent to which countries should counter the overseas hybrid mismatch which are direct imported mismatches for other countries. The intent of this approach is again to help prevent more than one country counteracting the same overseas hybrid mismatch such that it would result in double taxation. 64 Example 33: Direct and indirect imported mismatch rule Figure 14 sets out the financing arrangements for companies that are members of the same group. In this case A Co has lent money to C Co. C Co has lent money to B Co and D Co and B Co and D Co have lent money to their subsidiaries. Each company is tax resident in different countries. Figure 14 A Co + Hybrid financial ins tr um ent Loan − + C Co B CoD Co Loan Loan Payment (200) Interest (100) − − − + Interest (200) Interest (200) + Loan − + Interest (100) Loan − + Loan − + G Co H Co F CoE Co As illustrated in Figure 14, the loan between A Co and C Co is a hybrid financial instrument. The hybrid financial instrument is not, however, entered into as part of a structured arrangement. The hybrid deduction arising under the hybrid financial instrument is $200. E Co and F Co each make a deductible intra-group interest payment to B Co of $100 and D Co makes a deductible intra-group interest payment to C Co of $200. D Co, E Co and F Co are the only entities in the group that are resident in a country that has implemented the OECD hybrid and branch recommendations. Assume that E Co is resident in New Zealand. Question 1 Whether the interest payments made by F Co and D Co would be expected to be adjusted under the imported mismatch rule and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under the rule. Whether the interest payments made by E Co are subject to adjustment under the imported mismatch rule in section FH 11 and, if so, the amount of the adjustment required under the rule. Answer 1 The direct imported mismatch rule should apply in Country D to deny D Co a deduction for all of the interest paid to C Co ($200). This fully counteracts the hybrid mismatch between C Co and A Co. Therefore, E Co and F Co do not need to apply the indirect imported mismatch rule (that is, there is no counteraction required in New Zealand). 65 Question 2 Whether the above changes if the hybrid deduction arising under the hybrid financial instrument is $300 instead of $200. Answer 2 The direct imported mismatch rule should still apply in Country D to deny D Co a deduction for all of the interest paid to C Co ($200). This leaves $100 of the hybrid mismatch between C Co and A Co to counteract by E Co and F Co. E Co and F Co apply an apportionment methodology to each deny half of their interest deduction ($50). This leaves the other half of their interest deduction ($50) as deductible. 66 SURPLUS ASSESSABLE INCOME Section FH 12 Background Section FH 12 introduces the key OECD hybrids concept of ‘dual inclusion income’ which is referred to as ‘surplus assessable income’ in the Act. It is important as deductible/not includible (D/NI) payments and double deduction (DD) payments do not result in double non-taxation if they are deducted against dual inclusion income. For instance, consider a deductible hybrid payment under section FH 8 where a New Zealand company is the sole investor in a hybrid entity in a foreign country. The hybrid entity makes payments that result in deductible expenditure in both New Zealand and the foreign country which results in denied deductions and a mismatch amount under subsections FH 8(2) and (3). However, the hybrid entity derives significant income that is taxable in both New Zealand (to the owner of the entity) and the foreign country. This means that there is net taxable profits in both countries, and there is no potential for the double deductions to be utilised against income that is only subject to tax in one country, so there is no tax mischief. The purpose of section FH 12 is to reverse the denial of deductions (or inclusion of income, in the case of section FH 6) that arises under sections FH 5, FH 6 and FH 8 to FH 10 where there is surplus assessable income. Summary of legislative response Section FH 12 allows a deduction for hybrid mismatch amounts to the extent that the person paying or deriving the amounts has income which is taxable in New Zealand and can be expected to also be taxed in the other country giving rise to the hybrid mismatch. This income can arise in a different income year from the year the hybrid mismatch amount is disallowed. Section FH 12 applies separately to each mismatch situation to which a person is party, but it applies to all mismatch amounts with respect to that situation. Both mismatch amount and mismatch situation are discussed separately above in the definitions part of this special report. Section FH 12 defines surplus assessable income through a formula. Generally, it is surplus assessable income from earlier years which has not been offset by deductions for mismatch amounts, plus assessable income arising during the year from the structure which can be expected to be taxed in the other country also. There are adjustments for other items as well, including exempt dividends which can be included as surplus assessable income in some cases. The carry forward of surplus assessable income and hybrid mismatch amounts is subject to the usual forty nine percent ownership continuity test that applies to tax losses. Application date Section FH 12 applies to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. 67 Detailed analysis The importance of surplus assessable income Deductible/not includible (D/NI) payments result in double non-taxation where the deduction is used against income which is taxed only in the payer country. In that case the effect of the D/NI payment is to reduce payer country tax without increasing payee country tax. To the extent that the entity or branch earns income which is taxable in both countries (surplus assessable income), the D/NI payment will still reduce payer country tax, but it will increase payee country tax. That is because the payee country income calculation will not give a deduction for the D/NI payment. So, any tax reduction as a result of that payment in the payer country will simply reduce the amount of payer country tax for which a credit can be claimed in the payee country, and there is no tax mischief. The same result holds for double deduction (DD) payments. If a DD payment by a hybrid payer is used against non-surplus assessable income, that can result in double non-taxation. However, if the hybrid is profitable in both the hybrid and owner countries, all of the double deduction expenditure (DD) will, broadly speaking, be deducted against surplus assessable income, and there is no tax mischief. The purpose of section FH 12 is to reverse the denial of deductions (or inclusion of income, in the case of section FH 6) that arises under sections FH 5, FH 6 and FH 8 to FH 10 where there is surplus assessable income so that taxpayers are not inappropriately affected by the denied deductions (or inclusion of income) under the hybrid mismatch rules. Unlike the OECD’s dual inclusion income, surplus assessable income does not depend on the actual assessable amounts in each country. This is for reasons of pragmatism rather than principle. The approach is to focus on the New Zealand income as a starting point. For instance, if a $100 amount of assessable income derived through a mismatch situation in New Zealand corresponds to a $50 amount of taxable income offshore (because of a foreign exchange fluctuation, or because the income is recorded in a different way to New Zealand), the entire $100 can be applied to the surplus assessable income formula. However, where income which is taxable in New Zealand will not be taxable in the other country because of more fundamental factors, like the structure through which that income is earned (for example, it is earned in a foreign branch, and the other country has an active foreign branch exemption, or its earned through a reverse hybrid entity) the income is not treated as surplus assessable income. Section FH 12 Section FH 12(1) applies when a person has a hybrid mismatch amount for a mismatch situation. A person can have more than one mismatch situation. 68 Example 34: Two mismatch situations Figure 15 Burr Ltd 9 9. 9% New Zealand Theodosia LP Branch Country A Country B Mercer Ltd 100% Burr Ltd, a New Zealand resident company, owns 99.9 percent of Theodosia LP, a limited partnership formed under the laws of, and operating in, Country A (the remaining 0.1 percent is held by another group company). Theodosia LP is a hybrid entity, because it is taxed as a company in Country A and a partnership in New Zealand. It has a branch in Country B. Income and expenditure of the branch is not taxed in Country A because of an exemption for active branch income. Burr Ltd also owns one hundred percent of Mercer Ltd, a company incorporated and tax resident in Country A, which is in a tax consolidated group with Theodosia LP for Country A tax purposes. Payments by Theodosia LP that relate to its Country A activities are deductible in New Zealand (to Burr Ltd) and Country A (to Theodosia LP). Payments by Theodosia LP that relate to its Country B activities are not deductible in Country A but are deductible in New Zealand and Country B. In this case, Burr Ltd is party to two mismatch situations, one with respect to its interest in Theodosia LP and one with respect to its interest in Theodosia LP’s Country B branch. It will have a different mismatch amount for each one. Subsection (2) requires a person’s mismatch amounts (which can arise under different sections in subpart FH) from a mismatch situation to be set off against the person’s surplus assessable inco me from the situation. This effectively reverses the impact of denied deductions (or inclusion of income) under the hybrid rules once the potential tax mischief is no longer present. The formula for surplus assessable income in subsection (3) comprises a series of defined amounts; earlier plus assessable plus exempt less unrecognised less protected less deductions plus status. The explanations for each formula components are: • Earlier: Surplus assessable income not offset by mismatch amounts in previous years (subject to a reduction also for foreign tax credits in the other country, discussed below). 69 • Assessable: Assessable income that the person derives from the mismatch situation during the year. • Exempt: If the person is a New Zealand resident hybrid entity owned by a non-resident, exempt consists of the New Zealand source dividends derived during the year if these are taxable to the foreign owner with no tax credit other than for withholding tax. This item recognises that the hybrid treatment of the New Zealand entity can cause a payment to be taxable in a foreign country with no deduction in New Zealand. • Unrecognised: Assessable income from the mismatch situation which is not subject to tax in the foreign country because of the residence of another person (who is not another owner), the source of the income, or the tax status of the payer. This item recognises that a taxpayer’s mismatch situation may generate assessable income that is not taxable in the relevant other jurisdiction. This income should not count towards surplus assessable income, because it is not taxed in both countries. An example of “unrecognised” is income of a New Zealand resident partner in a partnership formed in Country A from a branch of the partnership in Country B. If Country A has an active foreign branch exemption, the branch income from Country B will not be taxed in Country A, though it is taxed in New Zealand. • Protected: The amount of assessable income earned by the entity through its mismatch situation which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit. For a given year, this amount should be calculated under subpart LJ before a hybrid mismatch rule counteraction is made under subpart FH. • Deductions: Deductions for expenses incurred in earning assessable income which do not give rise to mismatch amounts. • Status: The amount of expenditure on a payment by the person to a payee in New Zealand that is a mismatch amount and not deductible in a foreign country because of the tax status of the person and the payee. For instance, a payment made by a New Zealand hybrid entity that is denied a deduction under section FH 9 may have an amount of Status if that payment was made to another New Zealand hybrid entity if the tax status of those entities results in the payment being disregarded in the relevant foreign country. 70 Example 35: “assessable” and “unrecognised” Take the facts of example 23 (“ Deemed branch payment mismatch”). Suppose the New Zealand branch sells the cricket bats for $300 each, and that no portion of this amount is taxable in Ashes Country, because of the active foreign branch exemption. The $300 will be “assessable income”, but it will also be “unrecognised”, since it is not taxable in Ashes Country due to its source. Surplus assessable income would therefore be zero, and the $100 mark up that would be allowed as a deduction in New Zealand but for section FH 5 will remain non-deductible. If Ashes Country does not exempt active branch income from tax, the $300 would not be “unrecognised”. Assuming Ashes Country has hybrid rules, section FH 9 will not apply to the $150 deduction allowed in New Zealand for the cost of manufacture of each bats. Therefore “deductions” will be $150, and surplus assessable income will be $100 per bat. This means Root Co will be able to deduct the $100 per bat charge. If Ashes Country does not have hybrid rules, the $150 cost deduction will be both a hybrid mismatch amount under section FH 9, and not included in “deductions” in the surplus assessable income formula. Accordingly the outcome will be the same. The overall outcome is that the hybrid rules will not deny any expenditure in New Zealand if Ashes Country is fully taxing the New Zealand income and the New Zealand branch has net taxable income. This is appropriate, as there is no double non-taxation. Example 36: New Zealand hybrid entity deductions and surplus assessable income Figure 16 Jefferson Co W ashin gto n Cou n tr y Hamilton Co Madison Co $100 payment $200 operating inco me $300 interest expense New Zealand Jefferson Co, a foreign company resident in Washington Country (a foreign jurisdiction) owns one hundred percent of Hamilton Co, an unlimited liability company resident in New Zealand. Hamilton Co is a hybrid entity. Jefferson Co also owns one hundred percent of Madison Co which is also a hybrid entity of the same form as Hamilton Co. As hybrid entities, Hamilton Co and Madison Co are disregarded under Washington Country tax law and their income and expenditure is generally attributed to Jefferson Co. Madison Co earns $200 of operating income in New Zealand and incurs interest expense to a third party lender resident in New Zealand for $300. These amounts are both attributed to Jefferson Co under the laws of Washington Country. 71 Hamilton Co makes a $100 deductible payment to Madison Co (that is assessable for Madison Co). Question 1 How do the hybrid rules treat Madison Co? Answer 1 Section FH 9 denies Madison Co a deduction for its $300 interest expense. This $300 amount is a mismatch amount. Under section FH 12, Madison Co has $200 of surplus assessable income. This figure is calculated by taking the entity’s total assessable income of $300 ($200 of operating income and $100 from its payment received from Hamilton Co) and subtracting $100 as an “unrecognised” amount, as explained below. All other components of the surplus assessable income formula are equal to zero under the facts of this example. The $100 payment from Hamilton Co is subtracted from the surplus assessable income calculation as an “unrecognised” amount because the payer and payee of the payment are both disregarded under Washington Country law. This means the $100 income of Madison Co will be disregarded in Washington Country (i.e. it will not be attributed to Jefferson Co) and will not be subject to tax in that jurisdiction due to the tax status of the payer, Hamilton Co. Madison Co can set off its $300 mismatch amount against its $200 surplus assessable income and is entitled to a deduction for $200 under FH 12(5). The remaining $100 will be carried forward as a mismatch amount to the next tax year (provided the continuity requirements in FH 12(8) are met). Question 2 How do the hybrid rules treat Hamilton Co? Answer 2 Section FH 9 denies Hamilton Co a deduction for its $100 payment to Madison Co. Under FH 12 Hamilton Co will have surplus assessable income of $100 because that payment is a “status” amount. As above with Madison Co receiving $100, Hamilton Co’s $100 expenditure is a payment that is disregarded under the laws of Washington Country because it is a payment between two hybrid entities. Jefferson Co will not be entitled to a deduction in Washington Country for the payment. Under Section FH 12, Hamilton Co’s $100 payment will be deductible as its $100 mismatch amount can be set off against its $100 of surplus assessable income. 72 Example 37: Surplus assessable income Taking the facts of Example 34 (“Two mismatch situations”), suppose the following amounts of income and expenditure during the year. The tax rate in all three countries is 25%. Burr Ltd (before applying subpart FH): New Zealand only Country A only Country B only Total Assessable income $300 $200 $100 $600 Expenses $150 $210 $40 $400 New Zealand taxable income $150 ($10) $60 $200 For the Country A mismatch situation, Burr Ltd has a double deduction amount of $210 and surplus assessable income of $200, being: • Assessable: $300 (the amount of assessable income earned through Theodosia LP including through the Country B branch); less • Unrecognised: $100 (the amount not recognised in Country A because it is from an active business in Country B). (There is no Earlier amount as this is a one-year example. There is no Exempt amount on the facts. There is no Protected amount assuming no tax is paid in Country A. There is no Deductions or Status amounts as there are no deductions incurred in deriving assessable income from the mismatch situation other than hybrid deductions.) Accordingly, of the $210 deduction denied to Burr Ltd under section FH 8, $200 is allowed as a deduction under section FH 12, and Burr Ltd has $10 of denied deduction to carry forward to the next year. For the Country B mismatch situation, Burr Ltd has a double deduction amount of $40 and surplus assessable income of $100, being the $100 assessable income earned through the Country B branch. The other amounts in the calculation of surplus assessable income are zero. So all of the $40 deduction denied under section FH 8 for the Country B mismatch situation is allowed under section FH 12. For the Country B situation, Burr Ltd also has $60 surplus assessable income which it can carry forward to the next year under subsection (6). This surplus assessable income cannot be used to claim a deduction for the $10 of denied deduction for Theodosia LP’s Country A double deductions because that deduction arises under a different mismatch situation. 73 Carry forward Mismatch amounts not offset against surplus assessable income in a year can be carried forward to the next tax year under subsection (6) provided that they meet the same forty nine percent continuity of ownership test as applies to tax losses (this is set out in subsection (8)). Surplus assessable income that is not offset against mismatch amounts in a year can also be carried forward to the next tax year in the same way. However, before continuity is considered, subsection (7)(a) reduces the amount of surplus assessable income by the amount that is subject to the foreign tax credit regime of a foreign country equivalent to New Zealand’s subpart LJ. This is to ensure that net New Zealand income from a mismatch situation cannot be offset Example 38: Protected Kaikoura Ltd, a New Zealand resident company, owns 99.9% of Decatur LP, a limited partnership formed under the laws of, and operating in, Country A (the remaining 0.1% is held by another group company). Decatur LP is a hybrid entity, because it is taxed as a company in Country A and a partnership in New Zealand. Kaikoura Ltd also owns 100% of Kalamazoo Ltd, a company formed in Country A. Country A allows Decatur’s losses (or income) to be grouped with Kalmazoo’s income (or losses). Country A imposes tax on Decatur LP income at a rate of 28%. Income and loss over the two years ended 31 March 2021 and 2022 is as follows: Year Decatur LP Kaikoura other Kalamazoo Gross income Gross deduction Net income Net Income 2021 NZ$400 A$1,000 NZ$500 A$1,250 NZ$1,000 NZ$200 A$500 2022 NZ$500 A$1,250 N$400 A$1,000 NZ$1,000 NZ$200 A$500 Question What is the effect of the hybrid rules on Kaikoura’s income tax obligations? Answer Because Decatur LP’s expenditure can be offset against income which New Zealand does not tax, all $500 is denied under section FH 8. In 2021, there is $400 of surplus assessable income (that is, the $400 of “assessable”), so $400 of the amount disallowed under section FH 8 can be deducted. The net amount disallowed under the hybrid rules is $100, and this amount can be carried forward for possible set off in a future year. Kaikoura’s taxable income will be $1,000. This correctly reflects the fact that the $100 Decatur loss has been used against income that New Zealand does not tax. In 2022, Decatur LP has a further NZ$400 denied under section FH 8. For purposes of the formula in section FH 12(3), it has $500 of “assessable”. It then needs to determine the amount of “protected”. It will have Country A tax to pay of $28. This should be fully creditable against its New Zealand income tax. “Protected” will therefore be $28/.28 = $100. Accordingly its surplus assessable income is $400. On a FIFO basis, it can claim a deduction for all of the $100 of the 2021 mismatch amount not deducted in that year, and $300 of the 2022 amount. This leaves $100 of 2021 hybrid mismatch amount unable to be deducted in 2022. Kaikoura’s taxable income in 2022 will therefore be $1,100. It will have a New Zealand tax liability of $308, and a tax credit of $28, giving a net liability of $280. 74 against future mismatch amounts if double tax has been relieved by a foreign country through foreign tax credits in relation to that net New Zealand income. Example 39: Disallowed carry forward of mismatch amount Further to examples 34 and 37, Theodosia LP (excluding its branch in Country B) has $30 of double deductions and $50 of surplus assessable income in year two. The $10 mismatch amount for which a deduction was not allowed in year one can prima facie be deducted against the $20 of surplus assessable income. However, the group that includes Burr Ltd, Theodosia LP and Mercer Ltd is sold to a new owner at the beginning of year two. This sale will terminate the carry forward of the $10 denied deduction with respect to the Country A mismatch situation. So that amount cannot be deducted in year two. Stranded losses Subsection (9) provides for a situation where an amount for which a deduction is denied under section FH 8 (a double deduction amount) ceases to be a mismatch amount because the person treated as having the loss in the other country ceases to exist before the loss is used in the other country. This means the loss is no longer able to be used in that other country. This is referred to in the hybrid mismatch report as a “stranded loss”. The subsection applies where: • a New Zealand person has a mismatch amount arising under section FH 8 available to be carried forward at the end of a year; • the person who incurred the loss under the other country’s rules (which may be the New Zealand person or a hybrid entity) ceases to exist; and • under the law of the other country, in the year in which the mismatch arose or any later year, the person has not offset a loss against income which is not assessable in New Zealand. If these requirements are met, the mismatch amount will be: • in the case of a loss incurred by a foreign branch of a New Zealand person, treated as a tax loss component in the year the entity with the branch ceases to exist, in which case it can be offset against another group company’s income in that year; or • in the case of a loss incurred by a hybrid entity which ceases to exist, treated as an ordinary tax loss of the owner. Grouping Subsection (10) is a grouping provision that allows a company to set off a mismatch amount from a mismatch situation against another company’s surplus assessable income (from a different mismatch situation) if those companies are in the same group. The subsection is available if: • two companies are in the same wholly-owned group when the mismatch amount and surplus assessable income amount arise; 75 • the two companies have each applied FH 12 to offset their mismatch amounts and surplus assessable income mismatch amounts themselves, and the surplus assessable income amount are excess; and • the offset could be made if the offset company and the group company were the same company. There does not need to be a nexus between the income and the expenditure for the two items to be grouped under this grouping rule. A company cannot carry forward a mismatch amount or surplus assessable income amount that it has used for a grouping offset under subsection (10). 76 DIVIDEND/SHARE ELECTION Section FH 13 Background If a deduction is denied for an interest payment on a hybrid financial instrument under section FH 3 and the payment is also subject to NRWT (generally at 10% or 15%), there is an element of double taxation. Taxpayers can generally avoid this result by entering into non-hybrid arrangements. For instance, if a company raised funds by borrowing under a vanilla debt arrangement, the interest would be deductible (and not denied under section FH 3), and NRWT would be deducted at the appropriate rate (generally at 10% or 15%). Conversely, if a company raised funds by using equity, any dividends paid would not be deductible (such that section FH 3 would have no application), and NRWT would not apply where the dividends are either fully imputed, or where the taxpayer is entitled to NRWT at 0% under an applicable tax treaty. The dividend/share election option in section FH 13 allows a New Zealand resident who makes a payment under a hybrid loan to treat the loan as a share for all circumstances in order to avoid any inconsistencies arising as a result of its being treated differently for different tax purposes. This means that any interest paid on the instrument will be treated as dividends for tax purposes. Distributions under the instrument may then be made without deducting NRWT if the payer attaches imputation credits to the deemed dividend, or where the taxpayer is entitled to NRWT at 0% under an applicable tax treaty. Summary of legislative response Section FH 13 allows a person who pays interest that is non-deductible by reason of section FH 3 to elect to treat the hybrid financial instrument on which the interest is paid as a share, and the payment as a dividend, for all tax purposes. Taxpayers that wish to make this election should send their election notices to hybridelections@ird.govt.nz , where they will be monitored by Inland Revenue. Application date The election is available for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Key features Section FH 13 allows a person who pays interest which is non-deductible by reason of section FH 3 to choose to treat the hybrid financial instrument on which the interest is paid as a share, and the payment as a dividend, for all tax purposes. The election must be notified to the Commissioner before it takes effect, specifying the date on which it takes effect. On the effective date, the amount owing under the loan is treated as fully repaid by the person (which may trigger an NRWT obligation) and subscribed for an issue of shares having the same terms as the loan. 77 An election ceases to have effect if the interest payments are no longer subject to deduction denial under section FH 3. At that time the deemed shares are treated as cancelled for an amount equal to the amount payable under the loan, and that amount is treated as re-subscribed for the loan. Detailed analysis Subsection (1) states who can make the election – a borrower who would be denied a deduction of interest under section FH 3 (the primary version of the hybrid financial instrument rule). Subsection (2) states the broad result of the election, which is that while the person is eligible to make it, the financial arrangement giving rise to the payment is treated as a non-participating redeemable share for all purposes of the Act. This means that distributions on the financial arrangement will be treated as dividends for tax purposes. These dividends will be subject to the benchmark dividend rule in section OB 61. Subsection (3) requires the election to be notified to the Commissioner specifying an elective date which must be on or after the date of the notice. Taxpayers that wish to make this election should send their election notices to hybridelections@ird.govt.nz, where they will be monitored by Inland Revenue. There is no prescribed form for the notice; however, it should include the taxpayer’s name and IRD number, the financial arrangement to which the election applies, and the date on which the election is to be effective. Subsections (4) and (5) outline in more detail the effect of an existing financial arrangement being subject to an election (the election can also be made for a financial arrangement yet to be entered into), and also the effect of it ceasing to be subject to the election. On the effective date for the election, the borrower is treated as paying all amounts owing under the financial arrangement. If this includes unpaid interest, this interest will give rise to an NRWT or AIL obligation as appropriate. The amount so repaid, less any NRWT, is then treated as subscribed for a non-participating redeemable share. There is no provision for an election to be revoked. However, once the interest payments on the instrument are no longer subject to section FH 3 (for example, because the payee country implements recommendation 2 of the OECD hybrids report), the election becomes ineffective. The deemed shares are then treated as redeemed for the amount owing (which will include any accrued “dividend”) and that amount, again less any NRWT, is treated as re-advanced by way of the loan. 78 OPAQUE ELECTION Section FH 14 Background The hybrid rules impose a compliance burden on a person who is subject to New Zealand tax and has an interest in a foreign hybrid entity (that is, an entity which is fiscally opaque under the tax law of a foreign country, but transparent for New Zealand tax purposes. The person has to determine whether there are any deductions claimed by the entity in the other country for payments which are deductible in New Zealand as well (that is, DD mismatch under section FH 8). If section FH 8 applies, the person will also have to determine the expenditure attributable to the foreign entity and treat it as ring-fenced expenditure, only able to be deducted against surplus assessable income. Section FH 8 is part of hybrid rules that target double non-taxation due to different rules relating to the tax classification o f ent it ies. Double non-taxation can also be addressed by New Zealand classifying the relevant entity in the same way as the other country. Section FH 14 allows a New Zealand owner of a foreign hybrid entity to take this approach in limited circumstances. Summary of legislative response Section FH 14 allows a New Zealand resident who has a wholly owned foreign hybrid entit y when the Bill is introduced to elect to treat it as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. It is intended to simplify compliance for people who set up foreign hybrid vehicles before the hybrid rules were introduced. Taxpayers that wish to make this election should send their election notices to hybridelections@ird.govt.nz . Application date The election applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. It must be made before the due date for the return of income for the first year in which the hybrid mismatch rules apply to the person. Key features Section FH 14 applies to a New Zealand resident who has, or is a member of a wholly owned group that has, a wholly owned hybrid entity. By making the election such a person can treat the entity as a company for New Zealand tax purposes. This will mean the person does not have to apply many of the hybrid rules in relation to the entity, particularly section FH 8. Of course, it will also mean that the entity’s income is separate from the owner’s income so that, for example, losses from the entity do not reduce the owner’s taxable income. 79 Detailed analysis Subsection (1) outlines who can make the election – a New Zealand resident who owns, or is a member of a wholly-owned group that owns, all the ownership interests in a hybrid entity on the date the Bill was introduced (6 December 2017). This is because the election is intended to simplify compliance for people who set up foreign hybrid vehicles before the hybrid rules were introduced. Subsection (2) states the broad result of the election, which is that the hybrid entity is treated as a company for all purposes of the Act. Subsections (3) to (7) then outline the specifics regarding the election and how it operates. The owner must notify the Commissioner of the election on or before the due date for the person’s tax return for the first income year in which the hybrid rules apply to the person (subsection (3)). Taxpayers that wish to make this elect ion should send their elect ion notices to hybridelections@ird.govt.nz . There is no prescribed form for the notice; however, it should include the taxpayer’s name and IRD number, specific the foreign hybrid entity to which the election applies, and the tax year on which the election is to be effective. The election will be effective from the first income year in which the hybrid rules apply to an owner and later income years (subsection (4)). This election will determine the New Zealand tax treatment of the entity for the remainder of its existence, regardless of who owns it in the future, as the election is irrevocable (subsection (7)). The effect of the election is that the owners of the entity are treated as selling, on the first day of the income year, the hybrid entity’s undertaking to a new company in return for the shares in the company (paragraph (5)(a)). The sale will in most cases trigger some taxable gain or loss, after which point the hybrid entity’s undertaking will no longer directly be in the New Zealand tax base (that is, flow through treatment will not apply to the foreign hybrid entity’s income and expenses immediately after the deemed sale has taken place). The CFC regime will apply in the usual way to the foreign hybrid entity following the election with distributions from the hybrid entity treated as dividends unless they qualify to be treated as a return of capital or capital gain distribution. The available subscribed capital of the deemed new company will equal the net value of the undertaking it is deemed to acquire (subsection (6)). 80 Example 40: Opaque election Kiwi Co has had a wholly-owned foreign hybrid entity in Country F since 1 April 2010. The foreign hybrid entity incurs tax losses each year in New Zealand which would effectively be ring-fenced under section FH 8. Kiwi Co understands that it will no longer benefit from potential double deductions from the foreign hybrid entity and wishes to reduce the compliance costs of the hybrid rules by making the opaque election in section FH 14. Kiwi Co has a standard balance date of 31 March. Question 1 When does Kiwi Co need to make the election in election FH 14 by? Answer 1 Kiwi Co must file the election before the due date for its 2019–20 tax return. If Kiwi Co has an extension of time for filing its tax return, this will be by 31 March 2021. Question 2 What will the effect of the election be? Answer 2 Kiwi Co will be deemed to sell the undertaking (or business) of the foreign hybrid entity to a new company in exchange for the shares in the company on 1 April 2019. If there is any taxable gain or loss from the sale, this will flow through to Kiwi Co. From that point onwards, foreign hybrid entity will be treated as a company for all purposes of the Act. Kiwi Co will file controlled foreign company disclosures for the foreign hybrid entity and treat equity distributions from the foreign hybrid entity prima facie as dividends. Question 3 Kiwi Co sells the foreign hybrid entity on 1 April 2020 to Tuatara Co. Tuatara Co would prefer to treat the foreign hybrid entity as transparent for New Zealand tax purposes. How does Kiwi Co’s section FH 14 election impact this preference of the new owner? Answer 3 Kiwi Co election is irrevocable and so Tuatara Co must continue to treat the foreign hybrid entity as a company for all purposes of the Act. 81 FIF RULE CHANGES RELATING TO HYBRID RULES Sections EX 44(2), EX 46(6)(e), EX 46(10)(db), EX 47B, EX 52(14C) and EX 53(16C) Summary of legislative response The Act contains some amendments to the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime designed to ensure that a person holding a FIF interest must use the comparative value (CV) method to calculate FIF income from the interest if a distribution on the interest might otherwise be subject to counteraction under the hybrid rules. The amendments also turn off the ability for a share supplier of a FIF interest under a returning share transfer to use the fair dividend rate (FDR) method in relation to an arrangement within the scope of the hybrid rules. Application date The changes apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Key features The key features of the FIF rule changes relating to the hybrid rules is that they require a person to use the CV method in relation to a FIF interest if: • the FIF is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief in relation to the distribution (subject to certain addit ional requirements); or • the person holds the shares as a share user under a returning share transfer which is within the scope of the hybrid rules. They also turn off the ability of a share supplier in a returning share transfer to use the FDR method in relation to FIF interests which are within the scope of the hybrid rules. Background Scenario 1 A straightforward situation where the hybrid rules could apply to a New Zealand resident holding a FIF interest is where the arrangement is within the scope of the hybrid rules and the FIF is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for a distribution in its country. If the person is applying the FDR method: • technically, the dividend is exempt income (section CW 9(1)); and • the distribution may be greater than the amount recognized under the FDR method. This may make it difficult to determine for the FIF to determine whether and to what extent the hybrid rules should apply in its country to the deductible dividend. Scenario 2 A more complex scenario arises in relation to a FIF interest held by a New Zealand resident share user pursuant to a returning share transfer. The hybrid rules apply to hybrid transfers 82 giving rise to a deductible/non-includible (D/NI) result. One way this can occur is if a New Zealand person lends money to a foreign related party by way of a returning share transfer which is a share repo arrangement. In a share repo arrangement, the loan takes the form of an initial sale of shares by the borrower to the lender, followed by a sale back of equivalent shares. The lender may make a financing return by: • receiving and retaining the dividend on the shares; • receiving a greater amount for the sale back of the shares than it paid to acquire them. In some countries, the cash borrower in a share repo arrangement is treated for tax purposes as continuing to own the shares, which it has provided as security for a loan. In this case, the tax law applying to the borrower will usually treat any dividend paid on the shares and retained by the lender as if it were both income to the borrower from the share and a deductible payment by the borrower to the lender. If the lender is a New Zealand person and exempt from tax on the dividend, this payment is deductible (to the borrower (share supplier)) and non-includible (to the lender/share user). Application of the FDR regime, which taxes a deemed 5% return, complicates the picture, and would make it difficult to know whether or how to apply the hybrid rules to such a dividend payment. In order to avoid these complications, the legislative changes provide that the New Zealand lender (the share user) in such situations has to use the CV method to determine its income from the share. This ensures that the dividend is taxable to the lender, and the hybrid rules do not need to apply. It is analogous to the taxation of a deductible foreign equity distribut ion. Scenario 3 A third scenario arises when a New Zealand resident supplies FIF interests under a returning share transfer which is a share loan. Under current law the person can continue to apply the FDR method as if they still held the shares. If the person is a share lender and receives a substitute payment which is deductible to the payer, this can give rise to a hybrid mismatch. In order to prevent this possibility, the legislative changes prevent such a person from applying the FDR method if the counterparty is related to the person, or the returning share transfer is a structured arrangement. Detailed analysis Scenario 1 New paragraph EX 46(10)(db) deals with scenario 1 in the background above. It provides that in such a case the share is a non-ordinary share, which means income from it must be determined using the comparative value (CV) method. This method includes dividends in the calculation of the income, so there can be no hybrid mismatch arising from the payment. New paragraph (db) only applies if: • the arrangement is within the scope of the hybrid rules, because the parties are related or it is a structured arrangement; • the non-resident is not a foreign PIE equivalent. In many countries, widely-held investment funds are entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for distributions, designed to ensure that their investors, rather than the fund, are subject to tax on 83 underlying income from the fund’s investments. One example is an Australian unit trust (AUT), where income to which unit holders are presently entitled is taxed to them rather than the trust. This change is not intended to remove the ability for a New Zealand taxpayer to use the FDR method in relation to an AUT undertaking portfolio investment. Scenario 2 New section EX 47B deals with scenario 2 in the background above. In such circumstances, the New Zealand share user is required to use the CV method to calculate their FIF income or loss from a FIF interest subject to a returning share transfer if: • the share supplier is resident in another country; • the share user is related to the share supplier, or the returning share transfer is or is part of a structured arrangement. “Related” and ‘structured arrangement” are defined terms in new section FH 15 (discussed above); and • the share supplier is treated as the owner of the shares for the purposes of the tax rules where it is resident. This is because the share supplier may be deducting the dividends paid on the shares as a financing cost in the foreign country, whereas the share user may be applying the fair dividend rate (FDR) method to tax the FIF interest. The difference between the income returned under the FDR method and the dividend paid results in a potential D/NI mismatch. There are consequential changes to related provisions in the Act: • Section EX 44(2) has been amended so that new section EX 47B has been added to the list of the provisions which limit a person’s choice of FIF income calculation methods. • Section EX 46(6)(d) has been amended so that a person who holds a FIF interest as a share user in a returning share transfer can use the comparative value method to calculate FIF income from that interest if section EX 47B applies to the person. • The definit io n of a “returning share transfer” in section YA 1 has been amended so it does not require that the transfer shares are listed. Scenario 3 Subsections EX 52(14C) and EX 53(16C) have been amended to deal with Scenario 3 in the background above. These subsections previously allowed a person who held a FIF interest and calculated income from that interest under the FDR method (whether it be the annual or periodic method) to continue to apply that method even if the person has disposed of the shares under a returning share transfer. In practice, this seemed to mean that replacement payments paid by the share user could be treated as exempt (as dividends would be), and the share supplier would continue to pay tax only on the “fair dividend”. In order to avoid the potential for a hybrid mismatch counteraction in such a case (where the share user is a non-resident in a country with hybrid rules), subsections EX 52(14C) and EX 53(16C) have been amended to deny the ability take this approach if the share user is related to the share supplier, or the returning share transfer is part of a structured arrangement (“related” and “structured arrangement” are defined terms in new section FH 15 discussed above). In such circumstances, the share supplier now has to apply the financial arrangements rules to the returning share transfer. The financial arrangements rules are comprehensive, and will ensure that replacement payments are taxable. 84 NRWT CHANGES CONSEQUENT ON HYBRID RULES Section RF 2C Background One purpose of the non-resident financial arrangement income (“NRFAI”) definition is to identify situations where there is a sufficient degree of deferral between deductions and payments under a financial arrangement between associated parties that NRWT should be imposed on an accrual basis, rather than the usual payments basis. Applying NRWT on an accrual basis ensures that in such cases, there is a better matching between deductions for the borrower and the imposition of NRWT on the lender. However, the NRFAI definit io n looks at when expenditure is incurred, rather than when it is deductible. This means that where a deduction for expenditure is denied or deferred under the hybrid rules, that denial or deferral is not taken into account, for the purposes of the NRFAI definit ion, because it does not affect the time when the expenditure is incurred. This is not appropriate. For example, suppose interest expense is incurred in a year, but the deduction for the expense is deferred under section FH 5. In that case there can be no deferral between the allowing of a deduction and the payment of NRWT until the deduction is allowed by the hybrid rules. Summary of legislative response The formula for determining whether a financial arrangement gives rise to non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI) in section RF 2C has been amended. It is intended to ensure that expenditure for which a deduction is denied or deferred under the hybrid rules is not taken into account in determining whether a loan gives rise to non-resident financial arrangement income. Application date The amendment applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis Subsection RF 2C(4) has been amended to reduce the amount of the denominator in the formula used to determine whether a loan gives rise to NRFAI. The accumulated accruals in the denominator is now reduced by the amount of deductions which have been denied under the hybrid rules in subpart FH (referred to as “hybrid deductions”). 85 Example 41: NRFAI, NRWT and hybrids counteraction under FH 5 Toucan Co, a foreign company resident in Tropicana (a foreign jurisdiction) owns one hundred percent of Takahē Co, an unlimited liability company resident in New Zealand. The taxation law of Tropicana disregards Takahē Co such that its income and expenditure is attributed to its owner Toucan Co. In order to fund domestic operations in New Zealand, Toucan Co provides Takahē Co with a $1000 loan for five years under which $250 of interest is payable at the end of the term. New Zealand’s financial arrangement rules spread the interest expenditure across the five-year term of the loan for tax purposes. For simplicity, assume that these rules result in Takahē Co being entitled to a deduction of $50 each year. Under section FH 5, Takahē Co is denied deductions for its incurred expenditure on the five-year loan. See example 22 (“Disregarded hybrid payment mismatch”) for an example with a similar structure that specifically deals with this deduction denial treatment. Section RF 2C determines whether Toucan Co has non-residential financial arrangement income (NRFAI). (Note that this example ignores the de minimis in section RF 2C(3).) Takahē Co will have to withhold non-resident withholding tax in respect of any of Toucan Co’s NRFAI. If the percentage calculated using deferral calculation in section RF 2C(4) is less than 90%, Toucan Co will have to apply the NRFAI rules for the remaining years of its loan with Takahē Co. As stated above, this calculation formula has been amended to take into account expenditure that is denied a deduction under subpart FH. Assuming Takahē Co has no surplus assessable income except for $100 in year three and $500 in year six (after the loan matures), the treatment of Takahē Co’s deductions and the NRFAI and NRWT for Toucan Co will be as follows: Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 Cumulative interest expenditure $50 $100 $150 $200 $250 - Cumulative interest paid - - - - $250 - Cumulative surplus assessable income $100 $100 $100 $600 Cumulative amount of deductions denied (mismatch amounts from FH 5) $50 $100 $50 $100 $150 - Cumulative deduction allowed - - $100 $100 $100 $250 Current year NRFAI - - - $200 $50 - Current year NRWT @10% - - - $20 $5 - In year one, the deferral calculation answer is treated as more than 90% because accumulated accruals is equal to zero, since there is no expenditure is incurred before year 1. This position holds for years 1–3 since Takahē Co incurred expenditure in years one and two but is denied deductions for that expenditure under section FH 5. In year three, Takahē Co derives $100 of operating income that qualifies as surplus assessable income for the purposes of section FH 12. This means Takahē Co can offset $100 of its mismatch amounts against the surplus assessable income for a deduction of $100. Toucan Co will have NRFAI in year four because of this deduction. Toucan Co’s NRFAI in year four will be $200 as that is the amount of expenditure that would have accumulated as NRFAI across the four years had Toucan Co had NRFAI each year (see section RF 12F). Toucan Co will be liable for $20 of NRWT as a result (assuming an NRWT rate of 10% on interest). At the end of year five, the loan matures. $250 of interest is paid by Takahē Co to Toucan Co in that year. Toucan Co will have NRFAI for the year five expenditure of $50, even though the hybrid rules have denied Takahē Co a deduction for that amount. Takahē Co will be liable to collect $5 of NRWT in relation to Toucan Co’s NRFAI. In year six, Takahē Co derives $500 of operating income that qualifies as surplus assessable income for the purposes of section FH 12. Takahē Co can offset this amount against its remaining mismatch amounts for a deduction of $150. 86 THIN CAPITALISATION CHANGES CONSEQUENT UPON HYBRID RULES Section FE 6(2), FE 6(3)(a), FE 6(3)(aba), FE 7(3)(b), FE 15(1)(a), FE 21(3), and FE 23 Background The thin capitalisation rules prevent a multinational group taking deductions for interest expense in New Zealand to the extent that it is excessively highly leveraged. Leverage is determined by comparing debt with assets less non-debt liabilities. If a deduction is permanently denied for interest under the hybrid rules, it is not appropriate for that amount to be treated as interest under the thin capitalisation rules. Such treatment could result in that amount being subject (effectively) to an additional denial of deduction. It is also not appropriate for the debt giving rise to that interest to be treated as interest-bearing debt. It should be treated as either equity or a non-debt liability. If a deduction is denied under section FH 5, FH 6 or FH 8 to FH 10, there is a possibility that a deduction will subsequently be allowed, by reason of being offset against surplus assessable income under new section FH 12. Application of the thin capitalisation rules to such interest should depend on the position of the New Zealand borrower and its worldwide group at the time the interest is incurred. Accordingly, no amendment to the current thin capitalisation rules is required in respect of such interest. Separate thin capitalisation rules apply to registered banks controlled by a single non-resident. Changes have been made to these rules for the same reason as for the generic thin capitalisation rules. Summary of legislative response Sections FE 6, FE 7, FE 15, FE 21, and FE 23 have been amended to ensure that interest for which deductions are permanently denied under the hybrid rules do not give rise to addit ional income under the thin capitalisation rules (including the bank thin capitalisation rules), and that the debt associated with such interest is not treated as debt under those rules. Application date The amendment applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis General thin capitalisation rules Section FE 6 provides that an entity subject to the thin capitalisation regime has income equal to, broadly speaking, that portion of its interest deductions that is equal to the extent to which its New Zealand debt/assets percentage exceeds the greater of sixty percent and one hundred and ten percent of its worldwide debt/assets percentage for inbound investment (the respective percentages are seventy five percent and one hundred and ten percent for outbound investment). 87 Section FE 6 has been amended so that the formula in subsection (2) does not include, in the amount of interest which can give rise to such income under the thin capitalisation rules, the amount of interest for which a deduction is permanently denied under the hybrid rules. This is achieved through the following amendments: • The formula in subsection (2) has been amended so that the interest deductions are reduced by a new term “mismatch”; • “Mismatch” is defined in new paragraph (3)(aba) as the total of the amounts denied as deductions under section FH 3, and as interest under sections FH 7 and FH 11. These three sections contain the hybrid rules where the denied deduction is not a mismatch amount that can be reversed to the extent there is surplus assessable income under section FH 12; and • The definition of “total deduction” in paragraph (3)(a) has been amended so that it includes the interest deductions that would be allowed in the absence of the hybrid rules in subpart FH. This is to reflect the intent that interest deductions that are potentially only deferred (rather than permanently denied) under the hybrid rules should remain subject to the thin capitalisation rules. Section FE 15 outlines how total group debt should be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules for a New Zealand group. Subsection (1) has been amended to exclude from the definition of total group debt the amount of financial arrangements that give rise to interest for which a deduction is permanently denied under the hybrid rules (that is, where the deduction is denied under section FH 3, FH 7 or FH 11). Bank thin capitalisation rules Section FE 7 has been amended so that a reporting bank’s interest expenditure does not include interest for which a deduction is denied under sections FH 3 (for character mismatches only), FH 7, or FH 11 (those being the hybrid rules that permanently deny deductions). Section FE 21 has been amended such that interest expenditure denied under sections FH 3 (for character mismatches only), FH 7, or FH 11 gives rise to additional financial value for the purposes of calculating equity value for a banking group. Correspondingly, Section FE 23 has been amended such that a banking group’s funding debt does not include debt under which a deduction has been denied under sections FH 3 (for character mismatches only), FH 7, or FH 11. 88 HYBRID MISMATCH RULE FOR NRWT Sections BH 1(4), RF 11C New section RF 11C inserts a new hybrid mismatch rule allowing New Zealand to charge NRWT on payments under certain cross border hybrid financing instruments if New Zealand treats the payment as interest. This rule overrides our double tax agreements (DTAs). Background The Government has identified a hybrid mismatch issue that arises in the following circumstances. The New Zealand branch of a non-resident company borrows money from another non-resident in the same overseas country as the borrowing company. The borrowing is under a hybrid instrument which New Zealand treats as debt but the other country treats as shares. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is able to charge NRWT on interest payments made by a non- resident’s New Zealand branch to another non-resident. However, New Zealand is not able to charge NRWT on dividends paid by one non-resident company to another (regardless of whether the dividends are connected with a branch in New Zealand). This means that whether New Zealand can charge NRWT on payments under a hybrid financial instrument where the borrower is a New Zealand branch of a non-resident and the lender is a resident of the same country depends on whether the payments are classified as interest or dividends for DTA purposes. If the payments are dividends for DTA purposes, and New Zealand was not able to impose NRWT on them, then the branch would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for the payments but the payments would not be subject to NRWT. This would be contrary to the intent of the relevant DTA provisions. Australia already has a rule effectively providing that outgoing payments are not dividends for DTA purposes (and so are subject to Australian NRWT) if they are treated as interest under Australia’s domestic law. 8 Application date New section RF 11C applies retrospectively from 1 April 2008. Where taxpayers have already adopted the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable in respect of such cross border interest payments made prior to the introduction of the Bill (6 December 2017), a savings provision is available. Detailed analysis The Act inserts a new section RF 11C. Section RF 11C(1) provides that the section applies to a payment of interest (as defined in section YA 1) by a company that is resident outside New Zealand under an applicable DTA to another person who is also resident outside New Zealand 8 Section 3(2A) of Australia’s International Tax Agreements Act 1953. 89 under that DTA, if the payment has a New Zealand source under the Income Tax Act. Section RF 11C(2) then provides that the payment is treated as interest under the NRWT rules and the DTA, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the DTA. The Act also amends sect ion BH 1(4) to make it clear that section RF 11C overrides the applicable DTA. The combined effect of the legislation is that New Zealand may withhold NRWT from a cross border payment that is New Zealand source interest under the Act, regardless of whether it is treated as a dividend under the applicable DTA. Example 42: Hybrid mismatch in DTA/NRWT context A foreign group in the business of bridge building consists of two consolidated foreign companies resident in Greenwich (a foreign country), Simon Co and Garfunkel Co. Simon Co has a New Zealand branch and Garfunkel Co issues a convertible note to Simon Co to assist with its troubled New Zealand operations. (Assume for the purposes of this example that New Zealand and Greenwich have a DTA in force that is consistent with the commentary above.) Simon Co must make annual payments to Garfunkel Co under the note and these payments are treated as interest under New Zealand domestic law, but as dividends in Greenwich. RF 11C(2) will ensure that the payment is subject to NRWT, regardless of its treatment in Greenwich or under the DTA. 90 HYBRIDS COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE As with all other provisio ns of the law, self-assessment requires taxpayers to determine their taxable income considering the potential application of the hybrid provisions. The following table should assist taxpayers to determine whether or not they are likely to need to consider the application of the hybrid provisions. The table also contains a reference to the relevant section, and some comments to assist in determining whether or not the section will in fact give rise to denial of a deduction or additional income. The last column identifies which item in the BEPS disclosure form the taxpayer should tick if the relevant section does in fact apply to them. Like the rest of this commentary, these questions do not replace the law, and cannot be relied on to identify every hybrid mismatch situation. Table 4: Hybrids guidance and disclosure questions Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 1. Are you claiming a deduction under a financial instrument for a payment to a related non-resident, where either: • the payment was not taxable income for the non-resident in another country in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the income year in which you are claiming a deduction; or • you do not know whether (or when) the payment was taxable income in another country. FH 3 – deductions on hybrid financial instrument rules Any time you claim a deduction under a financial instrument (generally this will be a loan, derivative, or other financial arrangement, but for this purpose the definition is slightly broader) where the payee is non- resident and related to you, you should check the foreign tax treatment of the payment. Is the related party including the payment in its taxable income as interest, or as income taxable at the same rate as interest? If it is, is that inclusion expected to occur in an accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the income year in which you are claiming a deduction for the payment? If the answer to either question is no, you need to consider sections FH 3 of the hybrid rules before claiming a deduction. The definitions of “financial instrument” and “related” are in section FH 15. Hybrid payment disclosure 2. Do you hold shares in a foreign company where you have treated the dividend on those shares as exempt income, and either: • the payment was deductible to the payer in another country, or otherwise gave rise to some form of tax relief; or • you do not know how the payment was treated by the payer. CW 9(3) – deductible dividends A dividend from a foreign country is not exempt from tax under section CW 9(1) if the payment is deductible to the payer or otherwise meets the definition of a “deductible foreign equity distribution” in section YA 1. Hybrid receipt disclosure 91 Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 3. Have you received a payment under a financial instrument with a non- resident related person where either: • that person is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for payments under the arrangement in tax periods that end more than two years before the beginning of the income year in which you expect to recognise the income from those payments; or • that person is entitled to a deduction or equivalent tax relief for payments under the arrangement which will not be included in your income • you do not know whether or not that is the case. FH 4 –income on hybrid financial instruments rule If a non-resident is entitled to a deduction (or equivalent tax relief) for a payment to a New Zealand related party in relation to a financial instrument in a tax period ending more than 24 months before the beginning of the income year in you treat the payment is treated as income in New Zealand, or you do not treat the payment as income at all, you must recognise the income at the same time it is deducted by the payer, under section FH 4. Hybrid receipt disclosure 4. Are you claiming a deduction for a payment to a non-resident member of your control group where any of the following applies: A. under a foreign tax law, the payment is not taxed because you and the payee are treated as the same person; B. the payee is treated as transparent by the tax law of the country where it is formed; or C. the payee is not taxable on the income because it is treated by the payee as received in a country where the payee is not resident. D. you do not know the answer to any of questions A to C. FH 5 hybrid entities primary and FH 7 reverse hybrids Any time you make a payment to a non-resident member of your control group, you need to consider whether or not the payee is treating you as a separate entity for purposes of its tax law. For example, it may not be treating you as a separate entity if you and the payee are members of the same consolidated group in that country. If it is not treating you as a separate entity, you need to consider section FH 5 before deducting any expenditure you have incurred. You also need to consider whether the payee is not taxed on the amount because: • it is fiscally transparent in the country where it is formed or operates; or • one country (generally the country where the payee is tax resident) exempts the income because it is treated as referable to activities in a third country, but the third country does not tax the income because it does not treat it as referable to such activities. In these two cases, you need to consider section FH 7 before deducting any expenditure you have incurred. “Control group” is defined in section FH 15. A & D Hybrid entity/Branch/Dual resident disclosure and Hybrid payment disclosure B-D. Hybrid payment disclosure 92 Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 5. Are you a branch of a non-resident, and claiming a deduction in relation to activities occurring outside New Zealand (“head office activities”)? FH 5 branches primary If you are entitled to a deduction in New Zealand for amounts reflecting activities occurring outside New Zealand, and those amounts are more than an allocation of third party costs (eg they reflect a profit margin for the offshore activity), you need to consider section FH 5 of the Act before taking a deduction for those amounts. Generally, section FH 5 denies a deduction if the same profit margin is not income in the other country. Hybrid entity /Branch/Dual resident disclosure and Hybrid Payment disclosure 6. Are you a member of a tax consolidated group who has received a payment from another member of the group that relates to the offshore activities of the payer. FH 6 hybrid entities defensive If yes, has the payer claimed a deduction in the other country for that payment? If yes, you are likely to be required by section FH 6 of the hybrid rules to include the payment in income. If the other country has hybrid rules, it should deny a deduction for the payment, so section FH 6 will not apply. Hybrid receipt disclosure 7. Do you have a foreign branch which is entitled under the tax law where it operates to a deduction for activities carried on by you in New Zealand. FH 6 branches defensive If yes, is the deduction in the other country more than an allocation of your New Zealand costs (ie it reflects a profit margin for New Zealand)? If yes, you need to consider whether section FH 6 requires you to include the additional amount deducted in your New Zealand income (if you are not already doing so). If the other country has hybrid rules that apply to the payment, it should deny a deduction for any mismatch amount, so section FH 6 will not apply. Hybrid receipt disclosure 8. Do you have a foreign branch, or an interest in an entity in another country which is related to you and which you treat as fiscally transparent for New Zealand tax (for example a foreign partnership). FH 8 – double deduction primary rule If the answer is yes, you need to determine whether there is another person in that country who for foreign tax purposes is able to offset your share of any branch or entity loss against its income. If there is, you need to consider whether section FH 8 denies you a deduction for the expenditure incurred through the branch or by the entity. Double deduction disclosure 93 Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 9. Are you a branch of a non-resident, or is there a non-resident entity in your control group: • who is treated under a foreign tax law as paying a pro rata portion of the amounts paid by you? • whose foreign tax law treatment of your expenditure you are not aware of? FH 9 – double deduction defensive rule If you are a non-resident who is entitled to a tax deduction in New Zealand for some of your expenditure, that expenditure may be deductible in two (or more) countries. Similarly if you are a resident who is fiscally transparent under the tax law applying to any of your owners. If the other country does not have a hybrid rule that denies a deduction in the other country (that is, a rule equivalent to section FH 8) you need to consider section FH 9 before deducting any expenditure you have incurred Hybrid entity /Branch/Dual resident disclosure and Double deduction disclosure 10. Are you a dual resident company? FH 10 If yes, as well as not being able to group any loss with the income of another company (section IC 7(2)), you need to consider section FH 10 of the hybrid rules before deducting any expenditure you have incurred. Note that dual residence can arise very easily and can be unintended. For example, a company that is incorporated in New Zealand and managed and controlled in another country may be dual resident. Hybrid entity /Branch/Dual resident disclosure 11. Are you claiming a deduction for a payment to a member of your control group in a country without hybrid rules? FH 11 If yes, is that payment part of an arrangement or flow of funds that involves a hybrid mismatch within your control group. The payment will be part of such an arrangement or flow of funds for these purposes if it funds, directly or indirectly, a hybrid mismatch within your control group. There is no need for any connection between the payment and the hybrid mismatch. You need to take into account all information within your possession in making this determination. Where the deduction is material, you should make enquiry of your group tax function as to whether the payment is part of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. If there is not a clear “no”, given on the basis of reasonable enquiry, then no deduction should be claimed. Imported mismatch disclosure 94 Guidance question Comment Disclosure question 12. Are you claiming a deduction for a payment under an arrangement, other than those identified above, where there are any indications that the arrangement has been undertaken on the basis that it will produce a deduction/no inclusion outcome that would give rise to counteraction under the hybrid rules if the arrangement were entered into with a related party or a control group member. FH 3 – FH 7 and FH 11 Taxpayers are expected to consider all information within their knowledge and control in order to determine whether a payment is made under a structured arrangement as defined in section FH 15. If you are making a payment under a structured arrangement, you need to consider the possible application to payments under that arrangement of all of sections FH 3 to FH 7 and FH 11 of the hybrid rules. As applicable, depending on the nature of the mismatch.
