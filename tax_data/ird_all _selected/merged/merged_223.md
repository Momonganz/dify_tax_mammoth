1 APPENDIX C TO TIB NO. 11, JUNE 1990 DETERMINATIONS RECENTLY ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER UNDER THE ACCRUALS REGIME CONTENTS Determination - G6B: Foreign Currency Rates3 G10A: Present Value Calculation Methods6 2 DETERMINATION G6B: FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES This Determination may be cited as “Determination G6B: Foreign Currency Rates”. 1.Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) This determination rescinds and replaces Determi- nation G6A: Foreign Currency Rates, made on 21 November 1988. Apart from minor amendments, this determination differs from Determination G6A: Foreign Currency Rates only in the replacement of the definition “authorised foreign exchange dealer” by the defini- tion “approved foreign exchange dealer”. The definition of “authorised foreign exchange dealer” set out in clause 5(1) of Determination G6A: Foreign Currency Rates refers to persons desig- nated as such by notice in the Gazette for the purposes of the Exchange Control Regulations 1985. The Exchange Control Regulations 1985 were revoked as from 1 February 1990 by the Reserve Bank Act 1989. This determination applies where, for the purpose of calculating the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a financial arrangement de- nominated in a foreign currency, it is necessary to establish the rate in New Zealand currency of a foreign currency. This will be required in the circumstances outlined in clause 3 of this determi- nation. This determination sets out the approved markets, sources of information and method, to be used for determining the rate for foreign currency conver- sion. 2.Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(a) to (f) and section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. This determination rescinds and replaces Determi- nation G6A: Foreign Currency Rates, made on 21 November 1988. 3.Scope of Determination This determination applies where it is necessary for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976 to ascertain the value in New Zealand currency of: (a)A cashflow paid or received in a foreign currency under a financial arrangement; or (b)A financial arrangement denominated in a foreign currency using a method that has regard to market valuation; and (c)In any other circumstances, an amount expressed in foreign currency. 4.Principle (1)Markets in foreign currencies are approved having regard to the following criteria - (a)The number of participants in the market or having access to the market; (b)Frequency of trading in the market; (c)The nature of trading in the market - how the rate for the foreign currency is determined and how the foreign currency is traded on the market; (d)The potential or demonstrated capacity of a person or group of persons to significantly influence the market; (e)Significant barriers to entry; (f)Discrimination on the basis of the quantity bought and sold unless based on the risks involved or the transaction costs or econo- mies of scale. (2)Sources of information for foreign currency rates are approved having regard to the following criteria (a)Reliance on the sources of information by participants in the market; (b)The accessibility of the sources of information for participants in the market. (3)Methods of obtaining a rate for foreign currency at the end of the income year for the purposes of valuing a financial arrangement are approved if - (a)The rate is obtained at the cut-off time; and 3 (b)The method for determining the cut-off time adopted by a person will be consistently applied in respect of each income year. 5.Interpretation (1)In this determination, unless the context other- wise requires - Expressions used, except the expression “income year”, have the same meanings as in sections 2 and 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976: “Approved foreign exchange dealer” means a foreign exchange dealer that is a registered bank for the purposes of the Reserve Bank Act 1989 and is active in the market: “Contributor page” means a page of information provided by an approved foreign exchange dealer that is displayed on a screen provided by Reuters New Zealand Limited or Telerate New Zealand Limited: “Cut-off time”, in relation to a person and an income year, means the time at the end of the income year when all financial arrangements held or issued by the person are valued in order to determine the assessable income of the person for the income year: “Forward contract” means a contract, other than a contract traded on any futures market or a spot contract, for the sale or purchase of a foreign currency for delivery at a specified future time: “Futures contract” means a contract traded on the New Zealand Futures Exchange: “Income year” means- (a)Where a taxpayer furnishes a return of income under section 15 of the Income Tax Act 1976 for an accounting year ending with an annual balance date other than the 31st day of March, the annual accounting period ending on that balance date: (b)In respect of the income of any other person, the year in which that income has been derived by that person: “New Zealand foreign currency market” means the market in spot contracts and forward con- tracts: “Spot contract” means a contract for the sale or purchase of a foreign currency for delivery in 2 days: “Multicontributor page” means a multicontributor page of information that is displayed on a screen provided by Reuters New Zealand Limited or Telerate New Zealand Limited. (2)Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as referring to any fresh determi- nation made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6.Method (1)APPROVED MARKETS The New Zealand foreign currency market in European Currency Units and in the currencies of the following countries and territories are approved - JapanThe Independent CanadaState of Papua New French RepublicGuinea The Territory of HongRepublic of Ireland KongPortuguese Commonwealth ofRepublic AustraliaRepublic of Austria Republic of SingaporeKingdom of The Swiss ConfederationSweden Federal Republic ofKingdom of GermanyDenmark The United States ofRepublic of AmericaItaly Kingdom of theKingdom of NetherlandsNorway United Kingdom of GreatKingdom of Spain Britain and NorthernRepublic of Turkey IrelandThe Hellenic The Federation ofRepublic MalaysiaFinland (2)SOURCES OF INFORMATION The following sources of information for foreign currency rates are approved (a)In relation to spot contracts, a multicontributor page that quotes rates for spot contracts: (b)In relation to forward contracts, a multicontributor page or a contributor page that quotes rates for forward contracts: (c)Where a person does not have access to a multicontributor page or a contributor page or where the rates for a forward contract are not available from a multicontributor page, advice as to the buy and sell rates for a forward contract or spot contract given to that person by an approved foreign exchange 4 dealer, which rates shall be derived from an approved source and shall be the rates at which the approved foreign exchange dealer would perform the foreign exchange transac- tion. (3)SPOT CONTRACTS (a)Where, for the purposes of determining the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a financial arrangement, it is necessary to determine the rate for a spot contract at the end of an income year, the rate for the spot contract shall be the midpoint between the buy and sell rates for that spot contract. (b)Where, for the purposes of determining the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a financial arrangement, it is necessary to ascertain in New Zealand currency the value of a cashflow paid or received in a foreign currency, the rate of exchange to be applied shall be - (i)Where the cashflow is not converted to New Zealand currency on the day it is paid or received, the midpoint between the buy and sell rates for a spot contract for that currency at any time on that day; or (ii)The rate quoted on a multicontributor page for the United States Dollar against the New Zealand Dollar. (c)Where a buy and sell rate for a spot contract is not quoted on a multicontributor page, the rate for the spot contract shall be the cross rate calculated by reference to: (i)The rate quoted on a multicontributor page for the foreign currency against the United States Dollar; and (ii)The rate quoted on a multicontributor page for the United States Dollar against the New Zealand Dollar. (4)FORWARD CONTRACTS Where, for the purposes of determining the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a financial arrangement, it is necessary to deter- mine the rate for a forward contract at the end of the income year, and (a)Where the buy and sell points for the for- ward contract are quoted on a multicontributor page, the rate for the for- ward contract shall be the midpoint between the buy and sell rates for that forward con- tract obtained by reference to the multicon- tributor page; (b)Where the buy and sell points for the for- ward contract are not quoted on a multicontributor page, but the buy and sell points for similar forward contracts of shorter term (“the shorter contract”) and of longer term (“the longer contract”) are quoted on a multicontributor page, then the rate shall be the rate obtained by reference to the multicontributor page using straight line interpolation of the midpoints between the buy and sell rates for the shorter contract and the longer contract which have terms closest to the term of the forward contract; (c)Where the rate cannot be obtained by refer- ence to points on a multicontributor page and where the rate for that forward contract is available by reference to contributor pages, then the rate shall be the arithmetic mean of the midpoints of not less than 3 buy and sell rates for the forward contract obtained from contributor pages; (d)Where the rate cannot be obtained by refer- ence to paragraphs 6(4)(a) to (c) of this determination, the rate shall be the arithmetic mean of not less than three rates being any of - (i)the midpoints of the buy and sell rates quoted for the forward contract by one or more approved foreign exchange dealers; or (ii)where the points for similar forward contracts of shorter term (“the shorter contact”) and of longer term (“the longer contract”) are quoted on a contributor page, then the rate shall be the rate ob- tained by reference to the contributor page using straight line interpolation of the midpoints between the buy and sell rates for the shorter contract and the longer contract which have terms closest to the forward contract. (5)A person applying paragraphs 6(3)(a) or 6(4) of this Determination may obtain the rate for a spot contract or forward contract using the method prescribed in those paragraphs at any time on the last day of the income year: Provided that - (a)The rate applied is the rate obtained at the cut-off time in relation to the person and the income year; and 5 (b)The method for determining the cut-off time adopted by that person is consistently ap- plied in respect of each income year: Provided further that where there is no market at the cut-off time, the rate shall be - (c)The rate obtained at the later of - (i)The end of trading in forward contracts or spot contracts by that person in the income year: (ii)3.00 pm New Zealand Standard Time on the last day in the income year on which there was a market; or (d)The rate for the earlier of - (i)The commencement of trading in forward contracts or spot contracts by that person in the following income year: (ii)7.30 am New Zealand Time on the first day in the following income year on which there was a market. 7.Example This is an example of the application of the averag- ing process and straight line interpolation required for certain forward foreign exchange contracts under the determination. On its balance date of 30 June 1987 a New Zealand corporate had a forward foreign exchange contract for delivery of 1.2 million New Zealand Dollars for 612,000 United States Dollars on 1 August 1988. The contract therefore is to be fulfilled in approxi- mately 13 months’ time. At the balance date the foreign exchange quotations for the New Zealand Dollar against the United States Dollar were (from the multicontributor page ASAP on the Reuters system): BuySell Spot Rate0.60950.6100 Also at that date the quotations of forward foreign exchange points for the United States Dollar against the New Zealand Dollar by three market partici- pants were (as provided on their Reuters screens): Forward Points FX DEALER 1: Delivery in 1 year585555 Delivery in 2 years1030960 FX DEALER 2: Delivery in 1 year580530 Delivery in 2 years1040970 FX DEALER 3: Delivery in 1 year575540 Delivery in 2 years1035965 Note that to obtain the forward rates the forward points need to be subtracted from the spot rate. The mid-rates for use in the interpolation formula are therefore: BuySellMid-Rate Forward Rate FX DEALER 1: Delivery in 1 year0.55100.55450.55275 Delivery in 2 years0.50650.51400.51025 FX DEALER 2: Delivery in 1 year0.55150.55700.55425 Delivery in 2 years0.50550.51300.50925 FX DEALER 3: Delivery in 1 year0.55200.55600.55400 Delivery in 2 years0.50600.51350.50975 The arithmetic mean of the midpoints of the for- ward rates is calculated to be: Delivery in 1 year0.55366 Delivery in 2 years0.50975 A suitable formula for straight line interpolation to obtain the required rate is: So Px = P1 + (Tx - Tl) x (P2 - P1) (T2 - T1) P1is the mid-rate for the forward contract with the shorter term (= 0.55366). P2is the mid-rate for the forward contract with the longer term (= 0.50975). Pxis the required rate. T1is the term till delivery (expressed in days) of the forward contract with the shorter term (= 365). T2is the term till delivery (expressed in days) of the forward contract with the longer term (= 730). Txis the term until delivery of the contract held (= 398). 6 The required rate is therefore calculated as follows: So Px= P1 + (Tx - Tl) x (P2 - P1) (T2 - T1) = 0.55366 + (398 - 365) x (0.50975 - 0.55366) (730 - 365) = 0.55366 + 33 x (- 0.04391) 365 = 0.54969 The current value of the 612,000 United States Dollars receivable on 1 August 1988 is therefore 1,113,354.80 New Zealand Dollars. This determination is signed by me on the 23rd day of April in the year 1990. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue DETERMINATION G10A: PRESENT VALUE CALCULATION METHODS This determination may be cited as “Determination G10A: Present Value Calculation Methods”. 1.Explanation (which does not form part of the determination). (1)This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G10: Present Value Calcula- tion Methods, made by the Commissioner on 21 November 1988. This determination differs from Determination G10 in the inter- pretation of a 360 day basis for calculating the number of days between two given dates. (2)For the purposes of the accrual tax account- ing regime it may be necessary to calculate present values for a variety of reasons, for example: (a)To calculate the yield to maturity of a financial arrangement. The yield to matu- rity is the interest rate at which the first amount payable under the financial arrangement is equal to the present value of all subsequent amounts payable under the financial arrangement calculated as at the due date of the first payment: (b)To calculate present values at intermedi- ate times during the term of a financial arrangement in order to calculate the amount of the income derived or expendi- ture incurred by a person in respect of the financial arrangement. (3)The present value of a financial arrangement as at a date excludes any amounts payable under the financial arrangement on that date. (4)This determination specifies approved methods of calculating present values for use in other determinations. These methods may be added to or removed from time to time. Method A is a general purpose method suitable for many applications and gives very similar results to Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method. Method A may be used on either a 360 or 365 day basis. 7 Method Bis used to calculate prices of government or local authority stock, and other financial arrangements having similar characteristics, employing the formula approved by the International Associa- tion of Bond Dealers and used in calcula- tors such as the HP12C. (5)Alternative approved methods may not generate exactly identical results. (6)Once a person has elected to use an approved method of calculating the present value of a financial arrangement, that method shall be used by the person over the life of the finan- cial arrangement unless the prior consent of the Commissioner is obtained to adopt another method. (7)This determination is for use in conjunction with other determinations, for example Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method. 2.Reference (1)This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(a) and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. (2)Determination G10: Present Value Calcula- tion Methods is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this Determination G10A is signed. 3.Scope This determination shall be used as required by any other determination which will specify - (a) The date at which the present value shall be calculated; and (b) The interest rate that shall be used in the calculation; and (c) The amounts and due dates for which the present value shall be calculated and which may specify the method to be used. 4.Principle This determination specifies alternative methods for calculating the present value of a financial arrangement, equal to the sum of the values as at the specified date of all amounts payable under the financial arrangement after that date, discounted at the specified rate. 5.Interpretation (1)In this determination unless the context otherwise requires - “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Income year” has the same meaning as in sections 64B to 64M of the Act: “Period” and “period between payments” in relation to a person means a term - (a)Commencing immediately after - (i)A specified date in relation to a finan- cial arrangement; or (ii)A date on which an amount is payable under a financial arrangement as the case may be; and (b)Ending on the next succeeding date on which an amount is payable under a financial arrangement. Provided that if a period or a period between payments exceeds one year it shall be deemed to comprise one or more periods each of one year followed (or preceded, at the option of the person) by a period of not more than one year: “Specified date” in relation to a financial arrangement means the date at which the present value of the financial arrangement is required to be calculated: “Specified rate” in relation to a financial arrangement and a person means the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the financial arrangement is required to be calculated. (2)The number of days in a period calculated on a 365 day basis is the actual number of days in the period including the ending date of the period but excluding the starting date of the period. (3)The number of days in a period calculated on a 360 day basis means the number of days falling within the period including the ending date of the period but excluding the starting date of the period and calculated as if every calendar month of the period had exactly 30 days; Provided that if the ending date is the 31st day of the month and - (a)The starting date of the period is not the 30th or 31st of a month, the ending date 8 shall be included in the number of days in the period; (b)The starting date of the period is the 30th or 31st day of a month, the ending date shall be deemed to be the 30th day of the month. (4)In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used that are not defined in this clause have the same meaning as in sections 2 and 64B to 64M of the Act. (5)Any reference in this determination to an- other determination made by the Commis- sioner shall be construed as referring to any fresh determination made by the Commis- sioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6.Method (1)A person shall elect to use a method allowed under a determination made by the Commis- sioner under section 64E(1)(a) of the Act for the purpose of calculating a present value in relation to a financial arrangement, and shall apply that method consistently in respect of that financial arrangement, until it matures or is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred by the person unless the prior consent of the Commissioner (which may be given conditionally) to adopt another method is obtained. (2)Method A (a)For the purpose of applying clause 6(2)(b) of this determination, in relation to any person N shall be calculated as follows: (i)Where the greatest common divisor of all periods between payments is - (A)A year or 12 months, N shall be taken as 1; (B)A “halfyear” or 6 months, N shall be taken as 2; (C)A quarter or 3 months, N shall be taken as 4; (D)A month, N shall be taken as 12; (E)A fortnight, N shall be taken as 26; (F)A week, N shall be taken as 52; Provided that where 1 or 2 of the periods are shorter or longer than all the other periods this fact shall be disregarded in determining the greatest common divisor, and for the shorter or longer period or periods N shall be, at the option of the person, taken as (G)365 divided by the number of days in the period calculated on a 365 day basis; or (H)360 divided by the number of days in the period calculated on a 360 day basis. (ii)Where N cannot be determined according to the foregoing subparagraph it shall be, at the option of the person, taken as (A)365 divided by the number of days in the period calculated on a 365 day basis - (B)360 divided by the number of days in the period calculated on a 360 day basis - for all of the periods. (b)The amount of the present value of a finan- cial arrangement calculated according to Method A as at a date shall be calculated according to the following formula: A + B - C 1 +F where - Ais the present value (if any) as at the end of the period immediately following the date; and Bis the sum of the amounts receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer at the end of the period immediately following the date; and Cis the sum of the amounts payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer at the end of the period immediately following the given date; and Fis the amount calculated in relation to the financial arrangement and the person and the period immediately following the date according to the following formula: R ; and 100 x N Ris the specified rate. 9 (3)Method B (a)A person shall apply Method B only to financial arrangements which are debt instruments under which all payments after the issue or acquisition date are at regular “halfyear” or quarterly intervals. (b)For purposes of applying clause 6(3)(c) of this determination in relation to any person - (i)If amounts are payable at regular half- yearly intervals, N shall be taken as 2 and the preceding due date shall be taken as the date 6 calendar months prior to the date on which the first amount is payable on or after the date of issue or acquisition; (ii)If amounts are payable at regular quar- terly intervals, N shall be taken as 4 and the preceding due date shall be taken as the date 3 calendar months prior to the date on which the first amount is payable on or after the date of issue or acquisition. (c)The amount of the present value of a finan- cial arrangement calculated according to Method B as at a date shall be calculated according to the following formula: A + B - C D where - Ais the present value (if any) as at the end of the period immediately following the date; and Bis the sum of the amounts receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer at the end of the period immediately following the date; and Cis the sum of the amounts payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer at the end of the period immediately following the date; and Dis(a)Where an amount is payable at the end of the period immediately following the date is the last amount payable under the financial arrangement, an amount calculated according to the following formula: = 1 + F x T1 T2 (b)In any other case, an amount calcu- lated according to the following formula: (Tl) (T2) (1 + F); and Fmeans an amount calculated according to the following formula: R 100xN;and Ris the specified rate; and T1is the number of days in the period imme- diately following the date calculated on a 365 day basis; and T2 is the sum of T1 and - (i)Where an amount is payable on the date, zero; or (ii)In any other case, the number of days between the preceding due date and the date calculated on a 365 day basis. 7.Example (1)Example A (a)This example illustrates Method A, using the same example as in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method and Determina- tion G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method, Example A. The exam- ple shows that the present value at the beginning of a period is the same as the principal outstanding during the period. On 12 March 1987 (the specified date) a holder acquires for $1,012,500 the right to receive the following income - 15 May 1987$ 70,000 15 November 1987$ 70,000 15 May 1988$ 70,000 15 November 1988$1,070,000 The greatest common divisor of all peri- ods except the first is 6 months, so that N = 2; in the first (broken) period ending on 15 May 1987 N = 365 = 5.703125 64 The specified rate R is 16.2308% per annum. 10 Therefore F = 0.028459 in the period ending 15/5/1987 and 0.081154 in all the remaining periods. (b)The following schedule may then be constructed, starting at the bottom and working up: PresentPresent PeriodValue atPaymentsPaymentsValue Ending Beginningby Issuerby Holderat End BCA 15/5/871,012,50070,000-971,315 15/11/87971,31570,000-980,141 15/ 5/88980,14170,000-989,683 15/11/88989,6831,070,000-- The present value at the beginning of the first period is the same as the acquisition price, verifying that the specified rated is equal to the yield to maturity for this transaction. (2)Example B (a)This example illustrates Method B, using the same example as in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method and Determina- tion G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method, Example B. On 12 March 1987 (the specified date) a holder acquires for $1,012,500 the right to receive the following income - 15 May 1987$ 70,000 15 November 1987$ 70,000 15 May 1988$ 70,000 15 November 1988$1,070,000 All amounts are expressed in New Zea- land dollars. Amounts are payable at regular half- yearly intervals, so that N = 2 and the preceding due date is 6 months prior to 15 May 1987, namely 15 November 1986. Also, T1 = T2 except for the first (broken) period ending on 15 May 1987 for which Tl = 15/5/87- 12/3/87 = 64 days, and T2 = 64 days + 12/3/87- 15/11/86 = 181 days. The specified rate R is 16.265% per annum. (See footnote to this Example B for details of calculating using the HP12C calculator.) Therefore F = 0.081325, and D = 1.028032 in the period ending 15/5/ 87 (that being (1+F to the power of 64/ 181) and 1.081325 in all the remaining periods.

1 APPENDIX D TO TIB NO. 11, JUNE 1990 INCOME TAX (WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS) REGULATIONS 1979 CONTENTS Introduction2 Background2 Reason for Amendment2 Amendment2 Examples3 What happens when the other provisions of the Withholding Payments Regulations also apply?5 2 1.0INTRODUCTION 1.1Amendment No 8 to the Income Tax (Withhold- ing Payments) Regulations 1979 inserted a new sub-paragraph (ab) into the definition of “con- tract activity”. 1.2The purpose of this item is to provide a back- ground to the recent amendment, a description of the amendment and an explanation of the effects and extent of the regulations subsequent to the amendment. 1.3Please note that this item is concerned only with Non-Resident Contractors’ Withholding Tax, and not to Non-Resident Withholding Tax. Non-Resident Withholding Tax applies only to payments of interest, dividends and royalties. 2.0BACKGROUND 2.1Non-Resident contractors are liable to income tax in New Zealand on any income they derive in New Zealand from any business or contract wholly or partly performed in New Zealand. This liability arises through the operation of sections 242(b), 243(2)(a), (o) and (pa) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2.2The numbers of Non-Resident Contractors performing services in New Zealand increased substantially during the late seventies-Early eighties with the introduction of the Govern- ment’s “Think Big” projects. 2.3In response to this increase, the Non-Resident Contractors Withholding Tax Regime was introduced with effect from January 1982. The Regulations focused principally on activities associated with large construction related projects, (hence the definition of “contract project” in the regulations) and to a lesser extent, on the provision of equipment and personnel. 3.0REASON FOR AMENDMENT 3.1A Non-Resident contractor’s liability to with- holding tax on contract payments received is determined by reference to the nature and type of contract carried on in New Zealand by the contractor. 3.2The nature and types of contracts subject to the withholding tax regulations are contained in the definition of “contract activity”. “Contract Activity” is defined (prior to amend- ment) in the regulations as: “...in relation to any non-resident contractor means - (a)The performing or rendering of any work or contract service in New Zealand, being work or a contract service in connection with, or in relation to, any contract project: (b)The granting, providing, or supplying of the use, or the right to use, in New Zealand (whether or not in connection with or in relation to any contract project), any per- sonal property or any services of any per- son, being a person other than the non resident contractor:” 3.3The numbers of Non-Resident Contractors coming to New Zealand in connection with “Think Big” type projects have steadily de- clined over recent years. However, the numbers of advisory, consultancy, or technical service contracts now being performed in New Zealand have markedly increased. 3.4Contract payments made in respect of these types of contracts were not covered by the regulations. Government was concerned that a repeat of the problems encountered prior to the introduction of the Non-Resident Contractors regime may occur. 3.5Also of concern was the fact that the regulations only targeted those Non-Resident Contractors performing services in connection with con- struction, installation, assembly or similar projects. 3.6The types and nature of contracts being per- formed in New Zealand by Non-Resident Contractors have changed significantly since the introduction of the Non-Resident Contractors Withholding Tax regime in 1982. It was there- fore considered equitable that the regulations apply to all contracts being performed in New Zealand by Non-Resident Contractors. 3.7To achieve this, the definition of “Contract Activity” was amended to widen the scope of its application, ie the nature and types of contracts covered by the regulations were extended. 4.0AMENDMENT 4.1The definition of “Contract Activity” has been amended to include all contracts for service undertaken in New Zealand by Non-Resident Contractors. The amendment inserts a new sub- paragraph (ab) into the definition of “Contract Activity”. 3 The new sub-paragraph (ab) states: “The performing or rendering of any work or contract service in New Zealand, whether or not that work or contract service is carried on or carried out in connection with, or in relation to, any contract project.” 4.2This amendment ensures that any non-resident person who undertakes any contract for service in New Zealand will now be subject to the withholding payments regulations. 4.3The types of contracts, envisaged by the amend- ment, will generally be distinguishable in that the major component of the contract will be advisory, consultancy or technical services. To date the more common types of contracts of this nature encountered by the Department have been concerned with computers, electronics, engineering, finance, management, marketing and property. 4.4Contracts solely for the supply of goods, con- tracts of service (employment) and contracts for service the payments under which are deemed to be royalties in terms of paragraph (f) of the definition of “Royalty” in section 2 of the Income Tax Act continue to remain outside the scope of the regulations. 4.5Sub-paragraph (ab) took effect from 22 March 1990 and applies to all payments made on or after that date, regardless of the date the con- tract was entered into. The rate of withholding tax applicable to contract payments made to Non-Resident Contractors remains unchanged at 15 percent on the gross contract payments. 5.0EXAMPLES 5.1The examples that follow are intended to demonstrate the scope of the withholding payments regulations as amended only. They are not intended to provide a complete discus- sion of the contractors’ New Zealand income tax liability. 1)A non-resident person, specialising in computer payroll accounting, undertakes a five month contract in New Zealand writing a computer programme for a New Zealand company. The non-resident person is in business in their own right as a computer software consultant. QDo the regulations apply to this con- tract? AYes. The contract undertaken in New Zealand comes within sub-paragraph (ab) of the definition “contract activity”. The non-resident person therefore comes within the definition of a “non- resident contractor”. 2)A non-resident person comes to New Zealand for a working holiday. The person contracts to a company that carries on a cleaning business to clean offices. The person remains non-resident at all times during the visit to New Zealand. QDo the regulations apply to this con tract? AYes, assuming the contract is a contract for service, ie not a contract of employ- ment. However, in this case, whilst the contract with the cleaning company comes within sub-paragraph (ab) of the definition “contract activity” and the contractor meets the definition of a “Non Resident Contractor”, the non- resident provisions clash directly with clause 6 of Part A of the schedule to the regulations. In cases such as this the appropriate rate set down in the specific clause is to be used. In this example, the rate applicable to the class of payments specified in clause 6 of Part A would apply. See paragraph 6 for further commentary. 3)A large New Zealand Corporate engages a firm of non-resident consultants to under- take a restructuring review of its establish- ment. The firm sends a team of four people to New Zealand to undertake the review. The New Zealand team are to report back to their overseas principal on completion of the review. Whilst in New Zealand, the salaries of the team continue to be paid by the overseas firm. It is anticipated the review will take two months to complete. QDo the regulations apply to this con- tract? AYes. The contract to review the structure of the New Zealand company comes within sub-paragraph (ab) of the defini- tion “contract activity”. The consultancy firm therefore comes within the defini- tion of a “non-resident contractor”. The services undertaken by the non- resident contractor are not all per- formed in New Zealand. New Zealand only has the right to tax that part of the income that is attributable to the serv- ices performed in New Zealand. That 4 portion of the fees that relates to the services performed outside New Zea- land will not have a source in New Zealand. NB:The salaries paid to the employees of the firm have a source in New Zealand in terms of section 243(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act and would, but for section 61(19) of the Act or the Dependent Services article of any relevant Double Taxation Agreement, be liable for income tax in New Zealand. 4)A New Zealand company engages the services of a legal firm based in London to research a possible breach of patent. All services undertaken by the legal firm are performed outside New Zealand. QDo the regulations apply to this con- tract? ANo. The services performed in pursu- ance of the contract are all performed outside New Zealand. The contract payments made do not have a source in New Zealand. 5)A New Zealand company pays fees to a non-resident firm of consultants to under- take a marketing study in Australia with a view to selling a product manufactured in New Zealand on the Australian market. QDo the regulations apply to this con tract? ANo. The fees are not subject to the with holding tax as they do not have a source in New Zealand, ie the services are not performed in New Zealand. 6)A large multinational company sends two senior management staff to its subsidiary in New Zealand to assist with the management of the New Zealand operations for a period of three months. The parent company charges the salaries of the staff to the New Zealand subsidiary. The staff continue to receive their remuneration from the parent company. QDo the regulations apply to this con- tract? AYes. The parent company (being a non resident company) has undertaken, by agreement or arrangement, to provide the services of two of its staff to its New Zealand subsidiary. The services pro- vided to the New Zealand subsidiary come within sub-paragraph (b) of the definition contract activity, ie supplying the use of the services of any person. The foreign company therefore comes within the definition of a non-resident contractor. NB:The salaries paid to the employees of the parent company have a source in New Zealand in terms of section 243(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act and would, but for section 61(19) of the Act or the Dependent Services article of any relevant Double Taxation Agreement, be liable for income tax in New Zealand. 7)A non-resident company specialising in the manufacture of aluminium and plastic extrusion machinery sells a machine to a New Zealand company which is in the business of manufacturing aluminium products. The machine is all-computer controlled and one of the first of its kind in New Zealand. Accordingly, it was necessary for the New Zealand purchaser to train staff on the operation of the machine. It was provided in the purchase agreement that the non-resident company was to provide staff to undertake the necessary training. The New Zealand company was to pay an additional fee for the training to- gether with all expenses incurred by the non-resident company in sending staff to New Zealand. QDo the regulations apply to this con- tract? AYes. The training activities undertaken in New Zealand come within sub- paragraph (b) of the definition of “con- tract activity”. The non-resident com- pany therefore comes within the defini- tion of a “Non-Resident Contractor”. The fees payable by the New Zealand company in respect of the services provided by the non-resident company’s staff will be subject to withholding tax. NB:Again, with this contract, the sala- ries derived by the staff of the Non- Resident Contractor have a source in New Zealand in terms of section 243(2)(c) of the Act. However, it is unlikely that the salaries will be liable for income tax in New Zea- land because of section 61(19) of the Act or the Dependent Services article of any relevant Double Taxation Agreement. 5 7a)The New Zealand company is very im- pressed by the machine, so much so in fact that it enters into an agreement with the non-resident company to manufacture and market the machine in New Zealand. The non-resident manufacturer grants the New Zealand company exclusive rights to manufacture, market and distribute the machine in the South Pacific. In pursuance of the agreement, the non-resident company grants the New Zealand company the use of the trademark, technical information, specifications, plans and access to the non- resident company’s technical staff. The New Zealand company pays a royalty to the non-resident company in respect of the trademark and knowhow. However, the New Zealand company must pay the non- resident company on an hourly basis for the use of the non-resident company’s staff. QDo the regulations apply to this con- tract? ANo. The royalties paid in respect of Trademark and Knowhow will be subject to Non-Resident Withholding Tax. The fees paid by the New Zealand company in respect of the assistance provided by the non-resident company’s staff therefore constitute royalties in terms of paragraph (f) of the definition “Royalty” contained in section 2 of the Income Tax Act. The fees would be subject to Non-Resident Withholding Tax. 6.0WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS REGULATIONS ALSO APPLY? 6.1The amendment to the definition of “Contract Activity” was made so as to ensure payments made under those types of contracts, that were otherwise outside the provisions of the regula- tions, are now subject to withholding tax. 6.2As can be seen from example 2 in paragraph 5, the payments made to Non-Resident Contrac- tors may also be subject to withholding tax under other clauses contained in Parts A, B & D of the schedule to the regulations. 6.3The clauses contained in Parts A, B & D of the schedule to the regulations identify classes of payments that are to be subject to withholding tax. The clauses do not attach themselves to any particular classes of taxpayers, ie they do not distinguish between resident and non resident persons. 6.4Therefore, where a specific class of payment is made to a person, the rate of withholding tax applicable to that class of payment will apply.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995).

Rent deemed to be payable - deductibility Public Ruling BR Pub 97/13 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2 and GD 10. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a “lease” of property at less than an “adequate rent” where the property is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income as provided for under section GD 10. This applies when the property is owned by any person, persons, or partnership and is leased: •to a “relative” of any of those persons or of any member of the partnership; or •to a “related company”; or •by a company to a person. For the purposes of this Ruling the terms “lease”, “adequate rent”, and “related company” have the meanings attributed to them by section GD 10(4), and “rela- tive” has the meaning attributed to it by section OB 1. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Rent deemed under section GD 10 to be payable by the lessee to the lessor is expenditure incurred by the lessee under section BD 2(1)(b). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to leases entered into within the period 1 February 1998 to 31 January 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12th day of December 1997. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 2 Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 97/13 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 97/13 (“the Ruling”). Background Section GD 10 notionally increases the amount of rent received for a property by a property owner (lessor) from a relative of the lessor, or from a related company, when the rent is less than the market rate, and to the extent that the property is used by the relative or com- pany for derivation of gross or exempt income. The section permits the Commissioner to determine an “adequate rent”: which amount is deemed by the section to be payable under the lease. The “adequate rent” is deemed to be gross income derived by the lessor. Section GD 10 is directed against tax avoidance. It controls income shifting normally available in a family setting, but is not limited to that setting. Progressive tax scales give advantages to the family group to spread income, resulting in a reduction in the rate of tax. The section limits this opportunity when related parties lease income-producing property. The effect of deeming income to be derived, based on a rent that should have been paid rather than what was paid, unwinds any advantage sought. There has been some doubt as to whether rent deemed to be payable under section GD 10 is an allowable deduc- tion for the lessee under section BD 2. The Ruling concludes that rent deemed to be payable is expenditure incurred by the lessee under section BD 2(1)(b). It is therefore an allowable deduction if the exclusions in section BD 2(2) do not apply (excluded is expenditure to the extent that it is of a private or capital nature, incurred in deriving exempt income, and so on). Legislation Section BD 2(1) states: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer (a)... (b)to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i)incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii)necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, ... . Section GD 10 states: (1)Where any property owned by any person or by 2 or more persons (whether jointly or in common) or by any partner- ship is leased to a relative of any of those persons or of any member of the partnership or to a related company or by a company to any person and the rent is less than an adequate rent for that property or the lease makes no provision for the payment of rent, - (a)There shall be deemed to be payable under the lease a rent that is equal to an adequate rent for the property, and that rent shall be deemed to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days provided in the lease for payment of the rent, or, if no rent is payable under the lease, on such days as the Commissioner determines, and shall be deemed to be gross income derived by the lessor on the days on which the rent is deemed to be payable under this paragraph; and (b)The rent deemed to be payable under paragraph (a) shall be deemed to accrue from day to day during the period in respect of which it is payable, and shall be apportioned accordingly. (2)This section shall apply with respect to any leased property only if and to the extent that it is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. (3)This section shall apply whether the lease was granted before or after the commencement of the income year. (4) In this section- “Adequate rent”, in relation to any property, means the amount of rent that the Commissioner determines to be adequate for that property during the period in respect of which the determination is made: “Lease” means a tenancy of any duration, whether in writing or otherwise; and includes a sublease; and also includes a bailment; and “lessor” and “lessee” have corresponding meanings: “Related company” means a company that is under the control of the lessor or any relative or relatives of the lessor or any one or more of them, or, where there are several lessors or the lessor is a partnership, under the control of any of the lessors or partners or any relative or relatives of any of the lessors or partners: “Rent” includes any premium or other consideration for the lease. Section OB 1 defines “relative” as: “Relative” – (a)...in relation to any person, means any other person connected with the first-mentioned person by blood relationship, marriage, or adoption; and includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit; and for the purposes of this paragraph – (i)Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship: (ii)Persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other: (iii)Persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other.... IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 3 Application of the legislation How section GD 10 operates Section GD 10 operates in defined circumstances following a determination by the Commissioner. In order for section GD 10 to apply, there must be: •The leasing of property; •By a person (the lessor) to a relative or related com- pany (the lessee); •When either the stipulated rent is less than adequate or the lease is silent on the payment of rent; and •The lessee uses the property in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. The section can apply to transactions between a lessor or lessors and family members, related companies, and among partnerships. What leased property is covered? “Property” is not defined for the purposes of section GD 10, but must be intended to include both real property (land and buildings) and personal property (property other than land and buildings). The definition of “lease” supports this interpretation. “Lease” is defined in section GD 10(4) as a tenancy of any duration, or a bailment. “Tenancy” and “bailment” are not defined. The use of the word “bailment” (essen- tially the physical transfer of goods) is significant. Only personal property, not real property, is capable of bailment. Therefore, the word “property” must be intended to include personal property. The word “ten- ancy” can apply to both real and personal property. The words chosen by Parliament in section GD 10 show that the section is intended to cover personal property in addition to real property. Who is a relative? A relative of the lessor is a person connected by “blood relationship”, marriage, or adoption. Blood relationship means a relationship within the fourth degree, which is ascertained by counting the relationship steps between the two people. For example, A and B are first cousins, so they are within the fourth degree of relationship, as follows: A – A’s parent (1) – Grandparent (2) – B’s parent (3) – B (4) Any person who marries another person within the fourth degree of relationship automatically assumes the same relationship. For example, anyone marrying B is within the fourth degree of relationship to A. Children adopted by a person within the third degree of relationship are also relatives. The deeming effect of section GD 10 If the section applies to a transaction, section GD 10(1)(a) deems: •An adequate rent to be payable under the lease; •Rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days provided in the lease for rent payment, or, if no rent is payable under the lease, on such days as the Commissioner determines; and •Rent to be gross income of the lessor derived on the days on which it is deemed to be payable. “Deemed” means adding to the normal meaning of words If the Commissioner determines an adequate rent, effectively the amount of rent payable is artificially increased by the deeming effect of section GD 10 to reflect the Commissioner’s determination. In a Canadian decision, R v Vermette \[1978\] 2 SCR 838 at page 845, the Court gave a useful description of the legal effect of a deeming provision. It said: A deeming provision is a statutory fiction; as a rule it implic- itly admits that a thing is not what it is deemed to be but decrees that for some particular purpose it shall be taken as if it were that thing although it is not or there is doubt as to whether it is. A deeming provision artificially imports into a word or expression an additional meaning which they would not otherwise convey beside the normal meaning which they retain where they are used; it plays a function of enlargement analogous to the word “includes” in certain definitions; however, “includes” would be logically inappropriate and would sound unreal because of the fictional aspect of the provision. The section applies to a lessee Although the section deems the rent determined by the Commissioner to be gross income of the lessor, it does not expressly state that the deemed rent is deductible by the lessee. The absence of a specified mirror treatment for the lessee could arguably support an interpretation of the section based on the proposition that it does not apply to a lessee. The Commissioner does not adopt this interpretation because: 1.An adequate rent is deemed by the section to be payable. Logically this must mean payable by the lessee, and the section says so in the words, “and that rent shall be deemed to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days....” 2.The lessee’s use of the leased property for derivation of income is pivotal to the operation of the section. 3.Subsection (2) is directly concerned with the use of leased property by the lessee. 4.Section GD 10 was originally introduced as section 17 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1951. Introductory Notes supplied to the Minister on introduction of the Bill said: This clause is designed to cover the position where a taxpayer owning an income producing property, enters into a lease under which a relative becomes entitled to the full rent or income from the property, and is required to pay to the lessor only a nominal or peppercorn rental. ...The provisions of the clause will not be applied to bona fide leases of property, even though the lessee is a relative, and will be operated by the Commissioner only where it is evident that the lease has the effect of transferring income from the taxpayer to a relative. continued on page 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 4 payable, there must be an existing obligation to pay either now or later. Rent deemed to be payable falls within the first category, and is clearly “incurred”. The nexus between expenditure and income is not affected by deeming If the leased property is used in the derivation of gross income, any rental paid by the lessee, including a less than adequate rent, is deductible (unless specifically excluded by section BD 2(2)). The required statutory nexus establishing deductibility would be present between the expenditure and the income. A determina- tion by the Commissioner does not alter the quality of that expenditure, but alters merely the amount (quan- tum). Conclusion Rent deemed to be payable under section GD 10 is expenditure incurred by the lessee under section BD 2(1)(b). Examples Example 1 A leases a flat to her daughter B for $10 per week. B then rents it to tenants for $400 per week. A has other income of $50,000 and is on a marginal tax rate of 33c in the dollar. B has no other income and pays 21.5c in the dollar. As B’s tax bracket is lower than A’s, there is a tax saving for the family (about $2,332) compared to the situation if A rented the flat to the tenants directly. The Commissioner may determine that an adequate rent is higher than $10 per week; probably $400. Section GD 10 will apply to deem the determined rent to be the rent payable by B to A. The adequate rent is deemed to be gross income derived by A. The rent deemed payable is expenditure incurred by B, as there is in effect deemed to be a legal obligation to pay. Example 2 Company C leases a property to X, a charitable body, at an inadequate rental. X uses the property in the derivation of exempt income. A “person” includes a company and an unincorporated body of persons (section OB 1). This includes X. Section GD 10(1) applies to a lease of property “by a company to a person” at an inad- equate rent. Under subsection (2), the section applies to the extent that the property is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. An adequate rent determined by the Commissioner is therefore deemed payable. Although a deduction is allowed under section BD 2(1), this is denied by section BD 2(2) as the expenditure is incurred in the derivation of exempt income. In this case, C derives gross income in the amount of the adequate rent, but X is unable to claim a matching deduction. Thus the purpose of the provision was to prevent reduction of tax paid through transfers of income. This purpose is not inconsistent with the mirror treatment of the lessee mentioned above. These provisions support the conclusion that section GD 10 is intended to apply to both parties to a transaction. Deeming not limited to section GD 10 Section GD 10 has no qualification such as, “For the purposes of this section...”, and therefore may have a wider application. Section GD 10 is not an independent charging provision, and must be read in conjunction with other relevant parts of the Act. For example, rent is included in gross income by section CE 1(1)(e). The deemed rent is therefore relevant for other purposes of the Act such as for section BD 2(1). Section BD 2: “incurred” requires a legal obligation to pay An amount is an allowable deduction under section BD 2 only if it is “incurred” by the taxpayer. Opinion has differed on whether rent deemed payable by the lessee under section GD 10, but not actually paid, is expenditure incurred. The meaning of incurred was considered by the Privy Council in CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351, where it was said that expenditure must have either been paid or the taxpayer definitively committed to pay it. The taxpayer is defini- tively committed when a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. Deemed “payable” means there is a deemed legal obligation to pay for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 The question is whether rent deemed by section GD 10 to be “payable” under the lease for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 is to be treated by that Act as if a legal obligation has been created so as to be “incurred” under section BD 2. The Commissioner considers that it does. For example, in Re Howell’s Application \[1972\] Ch. 509, the phrase “Payable by way of rent” was said to mean “rent the tenant is under an enforceable obligation to pay...”. New Zealand courts have taken the same view. In AM Bisley & Co Ltd v C of IR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,082 at page 5,096, Henry J said: ...that the expenditure is not payable until some future date does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation. Under section GD 10(1)(a), the adequate rent is deemed to be payable on the days provided in the lease for payment, or on such days as the Commissioner deter- mines. This means that the Act operates as if there was an obligation to pay the rent. The obligation in Bisley was an existing legal obligation to make expenditure that became payable on a future date. Thus, there are two types of expenditure that qualify as “incurred”: existing legal obligations payable now, and those that will become payable in the future. For expenditure either to be payable or to become from page 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 5 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation state- ments. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Property previously used other than for income/business in NZ Application for special depreciation rate, meaning of “estimated useful life” Summary Section EG 10 allows the Commissioner to issue special depreciation rates. When determining whether or not to allow a special depreciation rate and the rate (if any) at which such a rate is to be set, section EG 10(2) requires the Commissioner to have regard to the formula set out in section EG 4(3) and the rate of depreciation (if any) adopted by the taxpayer in respect of the property for financial reporting purposes. The formula contained in section EG 4(3) refers to the “estimated useful life” (EUL) of the depreciable property. When an asset has been used in New Zealand for deriving income or carrying on business ever since it was new, it does not matter that it may have been owned by more than one taxpayer. The EUL of depreciable property is the total period that the property could be useful for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. This Interpretation Statement deals with the question of how the definition of “estimated useful life” is applied in setting a special depreciation rate when a taxpayer has depreciable property which was previously used for a purpose other than deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. Examples of situations where this will occur are: •The property was previously used outside New Zealand otherwise than for deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand (e.g., second- hand imported assets). •The property was previously used for private purposes in New Zealand and so has not been used in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. For the purposes of determining the EUL of property, the words “in New Zealand” in the definition of “esti- mated useful life” mean the property’s EUL in New Zealand conditions (i.e. physical conditions and legal and regulatory conditions). The test applied is the total period for which the asset could be used in New Zealand and not the period for which it is actually used in this country for business or income earning purposes. The EUL of such an asset is not reduced by the period in which it is not used for deriving gross income or carry- ing on business in New Zealand. Background The purpose of section EG 10 is to enable a taxpayer to apply for a rate of depreciation in respect of a particular asset owned by the taxpayer which is different to the general rate which has been established by the Commis- sioner under section EG 4 for assets of that type, or to apply for a provisional rate if no general rate applies. A taxpayer may choose to apply for a different rate of depreciation to the general rate if special circumstances apply to the particular asset which mean that the asset depreciates at a different rate to the rate at which assets of that type normally depreciate. In these circumstances the general rate may be inappropriate, and so a special rate can be applied. Legislation Section EG 1(1) states: Subject to this Act, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction in an income year for an amount on account of depreciation for any depreciable property owned by that taxpayer at any time during that income year. Section EG 2 sets out the alternative formulae for calculating the depreciation deduction under section EG 1. One of the components of these formulae is the applicable annual depreciation rate. The applicable annual depreciation rate is determined under sections EG 5 – EG 9, depending on the type of depreciable property in question. In determining the applicable annual depreciation rate under sections EG 5 - EG 9, the property’s basic economic depreciation rate is relevant. Under section EG 4(1), the Commissioner must specify the basic economic depreciation rate for any depreciable property, other than fixed life intangible property or excluded depreciable property, by determination made under section EG 4. Under section EG 4(3), in setting a continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 6 should be. In the Commissioner’s view the primary focus of this provision is to reconsider the formula and set a depreciation rate having regard to the use of the particular asset. The rate used for financial reporting purposes is included in the legislation so that the Com- missioner may compare the impact of relevant factors upon the asset’s EUL proposed in the application with the effect assigned to these factors for financial reporting purposes. The formula in section EG 4(3) is the diminishing value formula that is also used for calculating the general depreciation rates. The variables in this formula are: cost, residual value, and EUL. A key variable is the “estimated useful life”, as defined in section OB 1. Essentially, the definition refers to “the period that property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand”. In the context of setting a general depreciation rate under section EG 4, “that property” in the definition of “estimated useful life” is the class of property for which the general rate is being set. In setting a special depreciation rate the focus is on a particular item of property, and “that property” (when the definition of “estimated useful life” is considered in that context) is the particular asset or group of assets for which the special rate is being set. The question to be answered is how long the property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on business in New Zealand. This test focuses on the use of the asset, not the use of the asset by a particular taxpayer. If an asset has been used in New Zealand since new in deriving income or carrying on a business it does not matter that it has been owned by more than one taxpayer. The EUL test is a test of how long the asset could have been expected to be useful in New Zealand. However, the question arises as to the situation when an asset that has not previously been used for deriving gross income or carrying on business in New Zealand is subsequently used by a taxpayer for those purposes. This Interpretation Statement deals with how the definition of “estimated useful life” is applied in setting a special depreciation rate for property in that context. There are two possible approaches as to how the defini- tion of “estimated useful life” applies when a taxpayer applies for a special depreciation rate in respect of property which was previously not used for deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. A. The Total Life approach The first is that the definition of “estimated useful life” focuses on the potential usefulness of the asset to any business in New Zealand and only takes into account the effect of factors that cause the asset to depreciate as set out in the definition of that term (i.e. wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence). When determining the EUL of a particular asset using this approach it is irrelevant that the asset has previously diminishing value economic rate under section EG 4, the Commissioner shall have regard to the following formula: 1 1 – ( ( residual value ) estimated useful life ) cost Section EG 4(3) defines “residual value” as the greater of: (a)Estimated residual market value; and (b)13.5% of cost. Section OB 1 defines “estimated residual market value” as meaning, in respect of any depreciable property: ... its market value at the end of its estimated useful life, estimated reasonably as at the date of acquisition and based upon an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance of that property over its estimated useful life: Section OB 1 defines “estimated useful life” as meaning, in respect of any depreciable property: ... the period over which such property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand, having regard to such factors as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence and based upon an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance: Section EG 10(1) provides for the setting of special depreciation rates. It states: The Commissioner may, upon application in writing from a taxpayer in respect of any depreciable property other than fixed life intangible property or excluded depreciable property, allow that taxpayer to apply in respect of that property, for such income year or years as the Commissioner may specify - (a)A special base economic depreciation rate higher or lower than that specified in a determination under section EG 4; or (b)A provisional basic economic depreciation rate, where no applicable economic rate is specified in a determination under section EG 4. Section EG 10(2) states: When determining whether or not to allow a special economic rate or a provisional economic rate under subsection (1), and the rate (if any) at which such a rate is to be set, the Commis- sioner shall have regard to - (a)The formula set out in section EG 4(3); and (b)The rate of depreciation (if any) adopted by the taxpayer in respect of the depreciable property for financial reporting purposes. Application of the legislation Section EG 10(2) requires the Commissioner to have regard to both the formula set out in section EG 4(3) and the rate of depreciation adopted by the taxpayer in respect of the depreciable property for financial report- ing purposes, when determining whether or not to allow a special depreciation rate and what that rate (if any) from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 7 been used for purposes other than deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. This means that the EUL of a particular asset is not reduced by the time the asset was not used in producing gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. The EUL of the asset applied in setting a special depreciation rate for the asset is the total life of that asset, not the remaining life to that taxpayer. B. The Remaining Life approach The second approach determines the EUL by assessing the period a particular asset will actually be used to produce income or carry on a business in New Zealand. When determining the EUL, this approach takes into account the factors that may cause the asset to depreciate as set out in the definition of that term, and also takes into account the period that the asset is used for purposes other than deriving gross income or carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross income in New Zealand. This means that the EUL of the particular asset is reduced by the time that the asset is not used in producing gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. The wording of the definition of “estimated useful life” is capable of supporting both the first and second approaches. The first approach interprets the words “the period over which such property might reasonably be expected to be useful in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand” broadly, as meaning the period over which there is a possibility that the asset theoretically could be useful for producing income or for a business in New Zealand. Under this interpretation the EUL of an asset will generally begin at the start of the asset’s actual life, and it does not matter whether the asset actually is used for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand for all of the asset’s actual life. This is because the asset could potentially be useful for these purposes in New Zealand for all of its actual life. The second approach interprets the words “might reasonably be expected to be useful” narrowly, as meaning the period an asset is used or is physically available for use for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. Under this interpretation the EUL is taken from the time that the asset is first used for these purposes in New Zealand, and does not include any time that it is used for other purposes (e.g. private use in New Zealand, or for producing income or carry- ing on a business overseas). While it is acknowledged that the legislative wording could be more certain, the Commissioner’s view is that the first approach – the Total Life approach - is correct. When a taxpayer applies for a special depreciation rate, the EUL for the particular asset will only be reduced by “such factors as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion, and obsolescence and based on the assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance”. The fact that the asset was previously used for a purpose other than deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand will not reduce its EUL. Reasons for adopting this interpretation There are a number of reasons for adopting this interpre- tation of “estimated useful life”. •As previously noted, in relation to secondhand assets generally, the definition of “estimated useful life” is specific to assets or classes of assets, rather than being taxpayer specific. It focuses on the EUL of an asset, or asset class, and does not relate to a particular taxpayer. It is the total potential life of the particular asset to the New Zealand economy that is important, and not the life to a particular taxpayer. The Total Life approach is consistent with the EUL being specific to the life of an asset or class of assets. The Remaining Life approach is not, and focuses on the life of an asset to a particular taxpayer. •The definition of “estimated useful life” does not require the EUL to be measured at the time the asset is acquired by the owner. This can be compared to the definition of “estimated residual market value”, which requires the estimated residual market value of property to be measured as at the date of acquisition. The absence of such wording in the definition of “estimated useful life” confirms that that definition refers to the total life of the particular asset, and not to the asset’s remaining useful life. •The Remaining Life approach adopts what is, in effect, a “remaining estimated useful life” test. However, the definition of “estimated useful life” makes no refer- ence to “remaining” life. This can be compared to the definition of “fixed life intangible property” in the depreciation regime which contains the phrase “the property’s remaining estimated useful life”. This strongly suggest that the definition of “estimated useful life” refers to property’s total estimated useful life. If this were not the case, the word “remaining” would not have been necessary before the reference to EUL in the definition of “fixed life intangible prop- erty”. •The purpose behind allowing taxpayers to apply for and be issued with special depreciation rates was to enable taxpayers to apply more accurate rates in respect of certain property. The special rates were to be allowed when specific or unusual conditions affected the property in question. There is no indica- tion in the legislation that the term “estimated useful life” should have one meaning for setting general rates (i.e., total life) and another for setting special rates (i.e., remaining life). If Parliament intended this, it would have expressly provided for it. •Under the Remaining Life approach to the application of the term “estimated useful life”, the term only applies to the period that an asset will actually be used in deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. If the overseas or private use part of a particular asset’s life can be disregarded in determin- ing the asset’s EUL, there will be different estimated useful lives within a class of assets for those assets which have been overseas or in private use and those continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 8 on the Taxation of Income from Capital (“the Valabh Committee”). The final recommendations of the Valabh Committee on depreciation were contained in their letter to Government of 14 November 1991. This letter refers to the definition of “estimated useful life” and states: The definition reflects our view that the useful life on an asset for depreciation purposes is not the life for which an asset could technically be used, but the life for which it is or will be useful in the income earning process. It is necessary to identify relevant objective criteria for determining useful life such as physical deterioration, technical obsolescence, obsolescence due to market factors and the average length of time for which an asset is held for income-earning or business purposes. However it is necessary to note that it is the useful life of the asset which is the important criteria for determining depreciation rates, not necessarily the length of time for which it will be used by any particular taxpayer. This means that where an asset will be disposed of to another taxpayer for use by that taxpayer, the useful life of the asset needs to be calculated having regard to the entire period for which the asset will be used, not just the period for which the asset is first used by the taxpayer. The Valabh Committee stated that the “estimated useful life” of an asset for depreciation purposes is the life for which it is or will be useful. The definition of “estimated useful life” reflects this by saying “might be .... expected to be useful”. The Valabh Committee did not contemplate that the definition would only apply to the period during which the asset was actually being used in New Zealand. Conclusion The EUL of property is the total period that the property theoretically could be used for deriving gross income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. Generally, this period begins when the asset is new (there may be exceptional cases when the estimated useful life of an asset does not begin when the asset is new, e.g. when it would not make commercial sense for any New Zealand business to purchase a particular type of asset new, but the purchase of the same asset secondhand at a later stage when the cost is lower is a sensible investment decision). What is relevant in determining the end of the EUL is whether any New Zealand business would choose to retain the asset for use in deriving gross income or carrying on that business. Examples Example 1 Company A imports a secondhand machine into New Zealand. The machine is 15 years old, and is expected to be useful in New Zealand for a further 4 years. It will then cease to comply with New Zealand safety standards, and so will be scrapped or sold offshore. No unusual factors will cause it to deteriorate faster than normal. which have not. Further, assets which have been overseas or in private use for different lengths of time will also have different estimated lives. This can be demonstrated by the following example. An asset with a total expected useful life of 20 years is held overseas for 10 years by a non-New Zealand resident taxpayer, and is then sold to a New Zealand resident taxpayer. Under the second approach, the EUL of the asset is reduced by the time that the asset spends in non-New Zealand income producing or business use. The New Zealand taxpayer could apply to the Commissioner for a special depreciation rate based on the asset’s remaining useful life of 10 years. Varying the example, if the asset is instead held by the overseas taxpayer for 15 years, the Commissioner could grant the New Zealand taxpayer a special depreciation rate based on the asset’s remaining 5 years of EUL to the New Zealand taxpayer. This would result in assets of the same class ending up with widely varying depreciation rates, depending on the remaining number of useful years to the owner (in the example, the EUL of the asset would be either 20 years, 10 years, or 5 years, depending on when it was purchased by a New Zealand taxpayer). The Commissioner does not consider that the depreciation regime was intended to operate in this way. •The basic economic depreciation rate for any class of depreciable assets is based on a formula in which one of the components is the EUL of assets in that class. If assets which belong to a particular class have different estimated useful lives depending on whether and how long they have spent overseas or in private use, it will be impossible to set a general basic economic depre- ciation rate for that class of assets. This is plainly not what was intended. Instead, assets of a particular type should generally all have the same EUL (regardless of time spent outside New Zealand or in private use) and have the same applicable economic depreciation rate, unless special circumstances apply to a particular asset. •Another implication of the Remaining Life approach is that it would result in more favourable depreciation rates applying to imported secondhand assets than would apply to New Zealand secondhand assets (other than those which had been in private use). This would occur because an imported asset’s total useful life would be reduced by the time that it was not used in deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand, while a New Zealand asset’s EUL would be the total useful life of that asset. This would appear to provide an unintended incentive for taxpayers to import secondhand assets, rather than purchase the equivalent secondhand New Zealand asset. Such an incentive is contrary to the proposition that the tax system should have a neutral effect on business investment decisions unless the legislation is clearly intended to be concessionary or provide an incentive. •The Total Life approach is also consistent with the final recommendation of the Consultative Committee from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 9 Taking the Total Life approach, the EUL of the machine is 19 years – being the total number of years that the machine could potentially be expected to be useful for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. The machine could potentially have been used for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand during its entire life, even though it was actually outside New Zealand for its first 15 years. Taking the Remaining Life approach, the EUL of the machine is 4 years – being the number of years the machine will actually be used for deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand. The first approach is correct. The machine has an EUL of 19 years. Example 2 Company B purchases a secondhand asset in New Zealand. The asset was previously used privately for 5 years, and will be used by Company B for another 3 years before it is scrapped. The asset would normally last for another 5 years, but the way that the company uses it will cause it to deteriorate within 3 years of acquisition. The EUL of the asset is 8 years. This includes the 5 years that the asset was used privately as it might reasonably have been expected to be useful in a business in New Zealand during this period. The 8-year EUL also takes into account the abnormal use by Company B of the asset which causes it to lose value faster than normal (normally that type of asset would have an EUL of 10 years). Example 3 Taxpayer A acquires a new depreciable asset for $500,000. The asset has a 20-year EUL, and is expected to have a nil estimated residual market value. The asset’s basic economic depreciation rate, using the diminishing value method, is 9.5%, calculated as follows: 1 1 – ( ( 13.5% of cost ) estimated useful life ) cost 1 = 1 – ( ( 67,500 ) 20 ) 500,000 = 9.5% If Taxpayer A retains the asset for 10 years, the asset’s adjusted tax value at that time will be $203,163. The depreciation deduction available in that year will be $19,300. The depreciation deduc- tions for the 11th, 12th, and 13th years of ownership are as follows: AdjustedDepreciation tax valuededuction Year 11$183,863$17,467 Year 12$166,396$15,808 Year 13$150,588$14,305 Taxpayer B acquires an asset which belongs to the same class as the asset owned by Taxpayer A. The asset is 10 years old and has not been used for the purposes of deriving income or carrying on a business in New Zealand during that time. Taxpayer B purchases the asset for $200,000. There is no difference between the asset purchased by Taxpayer B and other assets of the same class in terms of the industry or the physical environment in which the asset has operated or will operate, or in terms of the way or amount the asset has been or will be used. The formula for calculating the depreciation deduc- tion in respect of Taxpayer B’s asset is set out in section EG 2 of the Act and is: a × b × c 12 In this formula: ais the annual depreciation rate applicable to the property and the depreciation method bis the adjusted tax value of the property at the end of the income year before the depreciation deduc- tion is taken cis the number of whole or part calendar months in the income year that the property is owned by the taxpayer. The formula will give rise to different results depending on which of the two approaches dis- cussed in this statement is applied. Under the Total Life approach, the annual depreciation rate is the basic economic depreciation rate for that type of asset (in this case 9.5%). Under the Remaining Life approach, Taxpayer B can be issued with a special depreciation rate based on the remaining EUL of the property. A special depreciation rate based on the remaining EUL (10 years) of the property would be: 1 1 – ( ( 13.5% of cost ) remaining estimated useful life ) cost 1 = 1 – ( ( 27,000 ) 10 ) 200,000 = 18% Using the special depreciation rate of 18% (and assuming the asset is owned for the entire income continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.1 (January 1998) 10 for the 10-year old asset in its first year of owner- ship by Taxpayer B will be: annual × adjusted tax value of asset dep’n rate(in this case the cost price) = 9.5% × 200,000 = $19,000. Using the standard 9.5% depreciation rate, the depreciation deductions in the asset’s 11th, 12th, and 13th years (Taxpayer B’s 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of ownership) will be: AdjustedDepreciation tax valuededuction Year 10$200,000$19,000 Year 11$181,000$17,195 Year 12$163,805$15,561 Year 13$148,244$14,083 It is clear that the depreciation deductions which result from using the basic economic depreciation rate are very similar to those which would apply had Taxpayer B owned the asset for its entire life. Given that there are no special circumstances affecting the asset to make it depreciate at a faster rate than other assets of the same class, there does not appear to be any reason for Taxpayer B to apply a higher depre- ciation rate, calculated using the remaining EUL of the asset, than the basic economic depreciation rate pertaining to the asset. year), the depreciation deduction for the 10-year old asset in its first year of ownership by Taxpayer B will be: special × adjusted tax value of asset dep’n rate(in this case the cost price) = 18% × 200,000 = $36,000. Using this special depreciation rate, the depreciation deductions in the asset’s 11th, 12th, and 13th years (Taxpayer B’s 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of ownership) will be: AdjustedDepreciation tax valuededuction Year 10$200,000$36,000 Year 11$164,000$29,520 Year 12$134,480$24,206 Year 13$110,274$19,849 Comparing the depreciation of Taxpayer A and Taxpayer B’s identical assets, it can be seen that if the depreciation rate is based on the remaining EUL of the asset (i.e. where approach 2 is used), the asset depreciates at a much faster rate than it normally would. If, instead, the EUL of the secondhand asset is the total EUL of that asset, so the depreciation rate of the asset is not adjusted, the depreciation deduction from page 9 Student loan scheme – interest rates and repayment threshold for 1998-99 On 4 December 1997 the Ministers of Revenue and Education announced the interest rates and the repayment threshold for the student loan scheme for the year commencing 1 April 1998. The total interest rate will be 8.0 percent. This is made up of the base interest rate of 6.2 percent and the interest adjustment rate of 1.8 percent. The repayment threshold for the 1998/99 income year will be $14,716.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 1 Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) Drilling & Routing Machines – draft general depreciation determination Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. In Tax Information Bulletin Volume Nine, No. 9 (September 1997) we issued General Depreciation Determination DEP28 for CNC Wood-Turning ma- chines. These machines are generally referred to as CNC Tooling Machines or CNC Machine Centres. We have been asked if the same depreciation rate should also apply to CNC Routing and Drilling Machines, as these machines are also referred to as Machine Centres. We have been advised that the drilling and routing machines are very similar to the wood-turning machines in DEP28 and the same depreciation rate should apply. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination that will insert “Drilling & Routing Machine, CNC” into the “Timber & Joinery” industry category at a depreciation rate of 22% D.V. The draft determination is reproduced below and is based on an estimated useful life (EUL) of 8 years and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP\[X\] This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1997/98 and subsequent income years. 2. Determination Pursuant to section EG 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 I hereby amend Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (as previously amended) by: •Inserting into the “Timber & Joinery” industry category the general asset class, estimated useful life, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rate listed below: EstimatedDV bandedSL equivalent useful lifedep’n ratebanded dep’n rate Timber and Joinery(years)(%)(%) Drilling & Routing Machine, CNC82215.5 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. If you wish to make a submission on the proposed new depreciation rate, please write to: Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Adjudication & Rulings National Office Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON We need to receive your submission by 31 March 1998 if we are to take it into account in finalising the determination. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 2 Maori Reserved Land Amendment Act 1997 – tax implications Introduction The recent passage of the Maori Reserved Land Amend- ment Act 1997 provides for compensation to be paid to owners and lessees of Maori reserved land. The Act provides that payments of compensation, solatium payments or payments to owners that may be used for the purchase of leases are exempt from income tax. In addition, such payments will not be treated as considera- tion for the supply of goods and services. The Act takes effect from 1 January 1998. Background The Maori Reserved Land Amendment Bill was intro- duced into Parliament on 21 August 1996 and was passed on 4 December 1997. The Maori Reserved Land Amendment Act 1997 amends the provisions of the Maori Reserved Land Act 1955, which governs the administration of Maori reserved land leases. The Act provides compensation to be paid to lessees and owners as a result of changes to their existing lease conditions under the Act. Compensation to owners of Maori Reserved Land Compensation will cover the delay in the move to market rents with more frequent rent reviews and the right of first refusal provisions. It will also assist owners in meeting any transaction costs, such as legal fees and valuation costs, that they may incur. Furthermore, an additional payment will be made to owners which they may use to purchase leases as they become available. Compensation to lessees of Maori Reserved Land Compensation will cover having to move to market rents with more frequent rent reviews and the right of first refusal provisions and for the extra transaction costs associated with the new lease conditions. Both owners and lessees have the option of either accepting the compensation calculated using the finan- cial model provided for in the Act or having their compensation determined by the Land Valuation Tribunal. The Chief Executive of the Ministry of Maori Develop- ment will write to the owners and lessees by 2 March 1998 setting out the compensation payable to them according to the financial model under the Act. The letter will advise them that they have the option of either accepting the compensation under the Act or having their compensation determined by the Land Valuation Tribunal. The option must be exercised within three months of the notice being given. Those who wish to accept the compensation as calcu- lated using the formula must inform the Ministry within three months of notice being given. Those who elect instead to have their compensation calculated by the Tribunal must file their application to the Tribunal within three months of notice being given. If an owner or lessee fails to take either option in respect of a lease within three months of notice being given, they will be deemed to have accepted the compensation as calculated under the formula in the Act. Compensation will be paid out soon after the amounts payable have been determined in accordance with the Act. Tax related features of the Act The Act contains two provisions relating to income tax and GST. •A new section CB 5(1)(p) has been inserted in the Income Tax Act 1994 to include in exempt income any payments of compensation, solatium payments or payments to owners for the purchase of leases under the Maori Reserved Land Amendment Act 1997. •Section 30 of the Act provides that any payments under this Act will not be treated for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 as consideration for the supply of goods and services. Interest is also payable by the Crown to owners or lessees when there is a delay in making the payment and the delay is attributable to the Crown. However, this interest is not explicitly covered by the new exemption so its tax treatment must be determined under normal tax rules. Application date The amendments apply from 1 January 1998 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 3 Amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 arising from other legislation Minor changes to the Income Tax Act have been made as a result of other recent legislation. Cross-references to Hire Purchase Act 1971 Section FC 10(5), and section OB 1 – “lessee’s out- standing balance” and “lessor’s outstanding balance” Section 50 of the Credit (Repossessions) Act 1997 replaces references to “paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 30(2) of the Hire Purchase Act 1971” with references to “paragraphs (c) and (d) of the Credit (Repossessions) Act 1997”. The Credit (Repossessions) Act 1997 standardises procedures governing the repossession of goods. Rules contained in the Hire Purchase Act 1971 were revamped and transferred to the new Act, hence the need for the consequential amendments. The amendment will come into force on 1 July 1998. Fertiliser definition Section EK 1 Section 85 of the Agricultural Compounds and Veteri- nary Medicines Act 1997 removes a reference to the fertiliser definition in the Fertilisers Act 1960. When the amendment comes into force “fertiliser” will be an undefined term in section EK 1. The Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines Act 1997 reforms the law relating to the management of risks from agricultural compounds such as animal remedies, fertilisers, stock foods and pesticides. As a result the Fertiliser Act 1960 is being repealed. The new Act does not contain a definition of fertiliser. Instead it has a generic definition of agricultural com- pound which is broader than the fertiliser definition in the repealed Act. In due course Inland Revenue will issue a standard practice statement on what should be accepted as fertiliser for the purpose of section EK 1. The amendment will apply from a date to be set by the Governor-General by Order in Council. Statutory Producer Boards Schedule 15 Schedule 4 to the Meat Board Act 1997 provides for the reference to the “New Zealand Meat Producers Board” in Schedule 15 to the Income Tax Act to be changed to the “New Zealand Meat Board”. Section 4 of that Act establishes the New Zealand Meat Board and provides that it is the same body corporate as the former Board (the New Zealand Meat Producers Board). Three new Acts, the Meat Board Act, the Wool Board Act, and the Pork Industry Board Act result from the Producer Board Act Reform Bill, which was part of ongoing reforms of the producer board legislation. The Wool Board Act and the Pork Industry Act establish the Wool Board and the Pork Industry Board respec- tively. Again, each Board is the same body corporate as the former Board. No change is required to Schedule 15 in those cases because the names of the boards have not changed. The amendment applies from 17 December 1997. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 4 Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. “Transitional capital amount” – definition Public Ruling - BR Pub 98/1 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/6 which was published in TIB Volume Seven, No. 12, April 1996, but its period of application is from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001 and some formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 96/6 applies up until 31 March 1998. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies to the definition of factor “j” in the formula within the defini- tion of “transitional capital amount” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to companies that liquidate on or after 1 July 1994 and dis- tribute to shareholders the same class of capital that the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against its losses. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The “aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the formula within the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to liquidations (as defined in section OB 1) during the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001 and to distributions from such liquidations during the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22nd day of January 1998. Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 5 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/1 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR 96/6 (TIB Volume Seven, No. 12, April 1996 at page 4 under the heading “Defini- tion of “transitional capital amount”). This Ruling covers the period from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2001. Background The Companies Act 1993 enacted major reforms in the company law area. One of the most significant was the removal of the concept of “paid-up capital”. Conse- quently the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 was enacted to accommodate the changes to company law. In particular, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 introduced, with application from 1 July 1994, a defini- tion of “available subscribed capital” for tax purposes. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 also repealed section 4A(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 4A(1)(h) allowed the Commissioner to exclude from dividends such amount distributed to a shareholder of the company as the Commissioner considered just and reasonable when: •The company had reduced the amount of the paid-up capital of the shareholder by writing off with High Court approval, losses incurred by the company. •The company was subsequently wound up. •Upon the winding up of the company, an amount (whether in money or money’s worth) was distributed to the shareholder in excess of the amount paid up on the shares of the shareholder. Taxpayers wish to know the effect of the repeal, and in particular whether or not it results in a reduction of a company’s “available subscribed capital” when the company has written off losses against paid-up capital before 1 July 1994. To calculate the available subscribed capital for companies existing before 1 July 1994, the “transitional capital amount” must be determined. The terms “available subscribed capital” and “transi- tional capital amount” are discussed in more detail in TIB Volume Six, No. 6 – Company Law Reform (December 1994). Legislation Section OB 1 states: “ Transitional capital amount”, in relation to a share in a company at any relevant time, means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: j + k x m l where - jis the aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 in respect of shares of the same class (whenever issued and including the share), not being-...\[Emphasis added.\] kis the aggregate of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994... lis the number of shares in the specified class ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and mis the number of shares in the specified class on issue at the close of 30 June 1994. Application of legislation The “aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been written off before 1 July 1994 against losses incurred by the company. This allows a company to restore the written-off capital upon liquidation, without the distribu- tion being treated as a dividend to the shareholders. Example 1990M Ltd issues 1,000 fully paid-up shares at $1 each. 1992Pursuant to High Court approval, M Ltd writes off $500 (50 cents per share) of paid-up capital from its accumulated losses. 1994Paid-up capital at 30 June 1994 is $500. 1995Shareholders decide to liquidate M Ltd. There have been no movements in the capital of M Ltd since the capital reduction in 1992. After the sale of assets the distribution per share will be 75c. Because M Ltd existed before 1 July 1994, its “available subscribed capital” is determined by calculating its “transitional capital amount”. To calculate M’s transitional capital amount, the following formula is used: j + k x m l In this formula – jis paid-up capital at the close of 30 June 1994$ 500 add back capital reduction$ 500 aggregate capital paid up before 1 July 1994 as defined in the Ruling$1,000 kqualifying share premiumassume is 0 lnumber of shares ever issued before 1 July 19941,000 mshares on issue at 1 July 19941,000 $1,000 + 0 x 1,000 = $1,000 transitional capital 1,000amount The available subscribed capital per share cancelled equals $1,000/1,000 = $1 per share. The $0.75 per share distributed is not treated as a dividend as it does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share. Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 98/1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 6 Investment in WEBS Fund Inc. Product Ruling BR Prd 98/1 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CG 3, CG 4, CG 5, CG 15, OE 2 and the definitions of “Foreign company”, “Foreign entity”, and “Foreign investment fund”, contained in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the investing by New Zealand resident investors (“the investor”) in WEBS Fund Inc (“WEBS Fund”) and the status of that investment under the international tax rules during the period of investment in WEBS Fund. WEBS Fund is a United States of America registered company. WEBS is an acronym for “World Equity Benchmark Shares”. WEBS are shares in WEBS Fund. Shares in WEBS Fund are divided into series (“WEBS Series”). The closest concept in New Zealand of division of shares into Series, are classes of shares. All WEBS issued rank pari passu. Each WEBS Series represents a different country. Each WEBS Series invests in a portfolio of shares that mirrors the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index (“MSCI Index”) for that country. At the time of issuing this Ruling there are 17 WEBS Series. WEBS Fund is permitted to create additional WEBS Series. The policy of WEBS Fund is that each WEBS Series remains as fully invested as practicable in a portfolio of equity securities, the performance of which will approximate the performance of the relevant MSCI Index. Within specified parameters WEBS Series may invest a small amount of the assets in securities not comprising the relevant MSCI Index and other derivatives. WEBS are issued and redeemed directly by WEBS Fund , but only in aggregations that constitute a “Creation Unit”. The size of a Creation Unit varies, and is dependent on the size of the equities market in the relevant country. In a like manner the cost of a Creation Unit of a WEBS Series varies. The considera- tion for purchase of a Creation Unit of WEBS is the in-kind deposit of a desig- nated portfolio of equity securities, which replicates the weighting and composi- tion of the relevant MSCI Index, and an amount of cash. The cash is a balancing amount to equalise any difference between the value of the securities deposited and the net asset value of the Creation Unit as determined at the date of creation. This Ruling is in respect of the period during which WEBS are held and does not cover the manner in which WEBS are acquired. WEBS are also tradable on the secondary market. Each WEBS Series is listed on the American Stock Exchange (“the AMEX”). Where such trading occurs there is no requirement to purchase WEBS in aggregations of a Creation Unit, and the AMEX listing rules regulates purchase and sale of WEBS. Dividends from net investment income are declared and paid at least annually by each WEBS Series, although they may be distributed more often. Each WEBS Series intends to distribute the amount representing the full dividend yield on the underlying portfolio securities of each WEBS Series, net of expenses, as if such WEBS Series owned the portfolio securities for the entire dividend period. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 7 Each WEBS Series intends to qualify for and elect treatment as a separate “regu- lated investment company” under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for United States of America income tax purposes. The main feature of the regulated investment company regime is a provision that permits a deduc- tion for dividends paid in calculating its taxable income. WEBS Fund and each WEBS Series is domiciled and resident in the United States of America. WEBS Fund and each WEBS Series is incorporated in and has as its place of management in the United States of America. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: •the United States of America is, in the income year in which the Ruling is sought to be applied, a country specified in Part A of Schedule 3 of the Act; and •the WEBS Fund and the WEBS Series to which the taxpayer seeks to apply this Ruling, is not resident in New Zealand as defined in section OE 2; and •the WEBS Fund and each WEBS Series is eligible and will elect treatment as a “regulated investment company” under Subchapter M of the United States of America Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and that in any income assessment period WEBS Fund and the WEBS Series to which the taxpayer seeks to apply this Ruling would have United States of America income tax to pay, by reason of its domicile, residence, place of incorporation or place of management pursuant to section OE 2(3), if there was in that income assessment period any undistributed income; and •no United States of America revenue provisions, or Double Tax Agreement provisions apply to exempt WEBS Fund and the WEBS Series to which the taxpayer seeks to apply this Ruling, from liability for tax in the United States of America; and •the WEBS Fund and the WEBS Series to which the taxpayer seeks to apply the Ruling is not, in the income year in which the Ruling is sought to be applied, for the purposes of section CG 15(2)(b)(iii) listed in Part B of Schedule 4; and •the redemption of a Creation Unit of WEBS will result in the investor receiv- ing only cash as the proceeds of redemption; any other sale or disposal of WEBS will result in the investor receiving consideration in cash or some other form other than the underlying assets of WEBS Fund; and •in the event of a wind-up or any liquidation of any WEBS Series, the investors will receive only cash as their share of the final distribution; and •the WEBS Series to which the taxpayer seeks to apply this Ruling is not, in the income year in which the Ruling is sought to be applied, a “Controlled foreign company” as defined in section CG 4. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •the WEBS Fund and each WEBS Series is a foreign entity which satisfies all of the requirements of section CG 15(2)(b), and accordingly an investor who holds or beneficially owns WEBS does not hold an interest in a Foreign Invest- ment Fund; and continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 8 •the WEBS Fund and each WEBS Series will be treated for the purposes of section CG 15(2)(b)(ii) and section OE 2(3) as being liable for tax in the United States of America; and •a holder or beneficial owner of WEBS does not have an entitlement to acquire, for the purposes of sections CG 3(b) and CG 5(4), shares in foreign companies which are held by WEBS Fund. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 15 January 1998 to 31 March 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 15th day of January 1998.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 9 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Property sold to tenant – whether sale of going concern Case:Keith Raymond Pine v CIR Decision date:3 December 1997 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – section 11(1)(c) Keywords:Going concern Summary:The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the sale of the property to the purchaser constituted a supply of a taxable activity as a going concern in terms of section 11(1)(c). Facts:The Appellant was the landlord of a commercial property. The property was leased to a partnership, the partners of which were John Tudehope and Christopher Tudehope. The partnership was terminated. Thereafter, John Tudehope held Christopher Tudehope’s interest in the lease in trust for him. The Appellant was not notified of these arrangements and continued to treat the partnership as his tenant. The Appellant sold the property to Christopher Tudehope or his nominee (“the purchaser”). The sale and purchase agreement recorded details of the lease. However, the memorandum of transfer from the Appellant to the purchaser was not expressed to be subject to the lease and the memorial on the title records a clear title. The Commissioner refused the purchaser’s claim for a deduction of input tax in respect of the purchase, taking the view that the supply in question was a “tax- able activity” which changed hands as a going concern as between vendor and purchaser. The Taxation Review Authority upheld the objection. The Commis- sioner then assessed the Appellant for output tax. Decision:Thomas and Williams JJ held that the supply was of a going concern. Their Honours relied on the vendor’s obligations, in terms of the agreement, to transfer a tenanted property to the purchaser. Their Honours accepted the lease merged into the freehold and therefore ceased to be capable of producing rent, but said that this was of no concern to the vendor. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 10 Property developer – land acquisition/development costs – deductibility Case:Thornton Estates Limited v CIR Decision date:17 December 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – sections 104, 104A, 65(2)(a), 67(4)(f), 85(1) Keywords:Development deductions Summary:The Court of Appeal held that a property developer is entitled to deduct ex- penditure on the acquisition and development of land in arriving at its assess- able income for the income year in which the land is acquired, but that he or she must also take into account the partly developed land on hand at balance date. Facts:The Appellant, a property developer, purchased a block of land. Following the purchase the Appellant engaged a contractor to develop the land for sub-divi- sional purposes. The Appellant claimed a deduction for “development expendi- ture” comprising of the cost of purchasing the land, development costs, legal expenses and research and registration fees. The cost of the value of the land was not brought into account as a revenue item. Decision:The Court of Appeal held that the cost of the land and the subsequent develop- ment expenditure incurred was deductible under section 104 of the Act, and that the expenditure was subject to section 104A of the Act. The Court also held that the Appellant was required to bring into account as a revenue item the cost price of the land and development expenditure. Insurance company not assessable on share sale proceeds Case:National Insurance Company of New Zealand Ltd v CIR Decision date:26 November 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 65(2)(a)(e), 99 Keywords:Profit on sale of shares Summary:The High Court held that the Objector’s investment in Southpac had not been acquired for the purpose of resale and consequently the sale proceeds were not profits or gains derived from its business. Facts:The Objector sold its 30% of the issued capital of South Pacific Merchant Finance Ltd (“Southpac”). The Commissioner included the profit from the sale of the shares in the Objector’s assessable income on the basis that the purchase and subsequent sale of the Southpac shares was part of the Objector’s ordinary busi- ness. In the alternative, the Commissioner considered that the sale of the shares contravened section 99 of the Act. Decision:Williams J found that the Objector, when it acquired the Southpac shares, had no thoughts of disposal or resale. Section 65(2)(e) therefore had no application. His Honour also found that the sale of the shares was the sale of a capital asset and was not part of the Objector’s business. Section 65(2)(a) therefore did not apply. In light of the above finding his Honour did not have to consider the Commis- sioner’s section 99 argument. However, his Honour said that had the above finding been different he would have found the Objector’s sale of the shares to be in breach of section 99(2) of the Act. The way the transaction was imple- mented had the avoidance of tax as a purpose which was far from being inciden- tal. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 11 Points of Objection Notice – extension of time for filing Case:TRA 96/96 Decision date:8 December 1997 Act:Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994 – Regulations 4 and 8 Keywords:Exceptional circumstances Summary:The Taxation Review Authority held that there were “exceptional circum- stances” for the Authority to exercise its discretion in granting an extension of time to file a Points of Objection Notice (“PON”). Facts:The Objectors were to file their PON on or before 12 March 1996. The Objector’s agent alleged that a PON was delivered to the local office of the Respondent on 11 March 1996. However, the Respondent did not receive the PON. On 11 April 1996 the agent faxed a copy of the alleged PON to the Respondent. The Respondent considered that the PON was invalid because it was out of time and it was a composite notice for two objections. A letter stating the deficiencies and advising the agent to apply for an extension of time was sent on 22 April 1996. In August 1996 the Respondent contacted the agent, who claimed that he had not received the letter of 22 April 1996. On 16 October 1996 the Objector’s agent sent in the PON and applied for an extension of time to file the PON. Decision:Barber J held that the overall justice of the case amounted to there being “excep- tional circumstances” and he consequently granted an extension of time to the Objector’s agent to file the PON. His Honour also found that the PON should not have been considered invalid for the reason of it being a composite PON for both taxpayers. However, Barber J did state at 14-15 that “professional persons should take the message that I may have stretched a point in this case and that somewhat similar situations will probably lead to a deemed withdrawal of an objection.” Tax credit availability when all income offset within group Case:Charity Finance Limited v CIR Decision date:19 December 1997 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – sections 38, 191(5) and (5A), 293(2) and (3), 304 Keywords:Group losses offset, foreign tax credits Summary:The High Court held that the Taxation Review Authority was correct to deter- mine that in making the 1992 assessment in respect of the Appellant, the Com- missioner acted correctly in disallowing the Appellant’s claim for a tax credit in respect of tax paid overseas on overseas income. Facts:The Appellant is a private company, which derives income by way of interest and consulting fees, and is also a member of a large group of companies with a common parent company. In the 1992 income year the Appellant declared as- sessable income of $444,002. The Appellant offset this income by group losses and consequently had no income tax to pay in that year. However, the Appellant claimed a tax credit for 1992 for tax payable on taxable income derived from overseas. The issue was whether the Appellant was enti- tled to a credit, or a refund, in New Zealand against New Zealand income for the 1992 income year. continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 12 Decision:Smellie J relied on the decision in BNZ Finance Limited v Holland (1997) 18 NZTC 13,156. His Honour concluded that section 36(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 created the underlying liability to pay income tax, and it was that liability which triggered the application of the other provisions in the Act for ascertaining assessable income. His Honour concluded that “by deducting group losses from its assessable income, the Appellant company so arranged its affairs that there was no New Zealand tax payable in respect of the income earned by the Australian invest- ment”, and that the Appellant could not therefore use the tax credit. Study payment from employer – assessability Case:TRA 95/49 Decision date:12 January 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – sections 65(2)(b) and (l), 61(37), 242(b) and 243(2)(o) and (r) Keywords:Assessable income, derivation of income, exempt income in terms of a scholarship or bursary Summary:The Taxation Review Authority held that the income received by the Objector was assessable because it was derived in New Zealand, constituted income under ordinary concepts and was not of a bursary or scholarship nature. Facts:In 1988 the Objector was awarded a Special Assistance Programme from his employer, which enabled him to study at an American University for three years. Under the Special Assistance Programme the Objector received a grant of $4,600 towards airfares, and his full salary, which was paid fortnightly. How- ever, a condition of the Programme was that the Objector had to sign a bond with his employer guaranteeing that he would return to New Zealand after completion of his study and work for his employer. This bond was duly signed. The Commissioner initially considered that the employment monies were ex- empt income. However, in 1993 the Commissioner reviewed the situation and reassessed the Objector’s assessable income to include the employment monies. Decision:Barber J held that the payments were made in respect of or in relation to the Objector’s employment or service and were therefore assessable under section 65(2)(b). The payments were income under ordinary concepts as they were paid regularly and periodically. The income was also derived in New Zealand because the payments flowed from a contract made in New Zealand. The payments were not exempt because the payments were made under a con- tract of employment. Contract for use of farm land – whether taxable activity Case:Bayly Trust v CIR Decision date:2 December 1997 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – section 6(1) and (2) Keywords:Taxable activity from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 13 Summary:The High Court held that the Appellants as owners were not, during the term of the deeds, carrying on a taxable activity. This finding was made because pursu- ant to the deeds in question the Appellants were not involved in any continuous or regular activity. Facts:The case involved five land-owning trusts. Three of the Appellants owned Tangihau Station (“the Tangihau Appellants”) and the remaining two Appel- lants owned Cricklewood and Tahanui Stations (“the Cricklewood Appellants”). Approximately thirty years earlier, the owners of Tangihau Station had entered into a partnership deed. Under the partnership deed (”the deed”) the land was placed at the use and occupation of the partnership for the term of the partner- ship (thirty years). The deed made it clear that the interests in the land were not partnership assets. At no stage was the partnership registered for GST. The contractual relationships concerning the owners of Cricklewood and Tahanui Stations were substantially the same. The Tangihau Appellants sold Tangihau Station to Tangihau Limited, a family company. The Cricklewood Appellants sold Cricklewood and Tahanui Stations to the Bayly Partnership, a related partnership. Both purchasers were registered for GST and claimed input tax credits on the respective sales. The Commissioner assessed the vendors for GST on the sales. The vendors objected. The Taxation Review Authority upheld the Commissioner’s assessments. The Taxation Review Authority deemed the vendors to be registered persons who were engaged in the taxable activity of supplying the use and occupation of farmland to the relevant farming partnership. The Appellants appealed to the High Court. Decision:Tompkins J found that the Appellants were clearly undertaking an activity that involved the supply of services when they entered into the deeds, which granted the contractual license to the partners. His Honour stated, however, that the issue was whether that or any other activity relating to the contractual license was carried on “continuously or regularly”. His Honour held that the contractual licenses could be distinguished from ordinary leases. A lessor has continuing obligations under a lease and there is a continuing relationship between the parties resulting from the receipt by the lessor of rent. However, obligations of that kind do not arise under the deeds in this case. Once the owners had ex- ecuted the deeds they were not involved in any further activity. Although the partners had obligations to each other, as recorded in the deeds, their role as owners was entirely passive. “Activity”, however, involves the concept of a person doing something. That was not the role of the owners under these deeds. Timber compensation payments (for not logging) – assessability Case:TRA 96/40 Decision date:14 January 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 – sections 65(2)(a), (h) and (l) and 2 Keywords:Revenue versus capital payment Summary:The Taxation Review Authority held that payments received from the Ministry of Forestry as adjustment assistance for the cessation of logging indigenous timber constitute assessable income. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 14 Facts:The Objector was a farmer who had an area on his farm covered by indigenous forest. The Objector progressively cleared this area between 1965 and 1989 to convert the land into pasture. In 1989 the Objector contracted to receive a royalty payment per tonne for the timber. However, in 1990 the Government imposed a ban on logging and export- ing indigenous timber and offered adjustment assistance to persons affected. In 1992 a final payment of $292,557 was made to the Objector. The payment was made up of loss of timber royalties, assessed rental for the affected area, costs of claim preparation and GST on the timber royalties. The Commissioner assessed the Objector on the timber royalties and land rental component of the payment. Decision:Barber J held that the payment was compensation for loss of profits, which the Objector would have made if the indigenous timber had been cut and sold. His Honour found that the compensation takes the character of that which it replaces and is therefore assessable under section 65(2)(a) as profits or gains derived from any business. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.2 (February 1998) 15 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

We supply it in two formats: Online TIB (HTML format) This is a new service introduced to meet customer demand. All TIBs from January 1997 (Volume Nine, No.1) are available in HTML, which makes them easier to read on-screen. The articles are in single-column format, and where one refers to other material that’s available on our Website, a link will take you directly to the second article. On the website we’ve included a survey about the online TIB – if you use this format then please let us know if you have any comments. Individual TIB articles will print satisfactorily from the online TIB, but it’s not the best format if you want to print out the whole TIB. Printable TIB (PDF format) All TIBs from July 1989 (the start of the TIB) are available in Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF). Use this version if you want to print out the whole TIB to use as a paper copy. The result you get will look essentially the same as the hard copy TIB that we mail out. However, the double-column layout means this version is not easy to read on-screen. Where to find us Our website is at: www.ird.govt.nz It also includes other Inland Revenue information which you may find useful, including any draft binding rulings and interpretation statements that are available. If you find that you prefer the TIB from our website and no longer need a paper copy, please let us know so we can take you off our mailing list. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 1 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. 1998 national standard costs for specified livestock Under the authority of section EL 4(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 the Governor-General has declared the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 1997/98 income year. These standard costs, released annually, allow farmers to value their livestock under the national standard cost option for the 1997/98 income tax year. Farmers using the scheme apply the national standard costs to stock bred on the farm or to immature animals on hand at the beginning of the year, while stock purchased are valued at their purchase price. The average of these costs is applied to the stock on hand at year’s end to derive the closing value of livestock on hand. In announcing the values, the Rt. Hon. W F Birch, Minister of Revenue, said the average production costs for sheep, beef cattle, and goats have all risen slightly compared with the previous year. Pig costs have changed little. “Costs for rising 1-year dairy cattle have increased more than other livestock classes - the average number of homebred calves raised on farms was lower than in the previous survey year, increasing the per head cost of this class \[of animal\]”. “The national average market values of livestock, which farmers use to value livestock under the herd scheme, will be released in May this year after a national survey of market values taken at 30 April,” Mr Birch said. The national standard costs for the 1997/98 income year are: National Kind ofCategory ofStandard LivestockLivestockCost $ SheepRising 1 year 15.50 Rising 2 year 9.10 Dairy CattlePurchased bobby calves115.00 Rising 1 year464.00 Rising 2 year 73.40 Beef CattleRising 1 year131.00 Rising 2 year 76.40 Rising 3 year male non-breeding cattle (all breeds) 76.40 DeerRising 1 year 50.40 Rising 2 year 24.80 Goats (MeatRising 1 year 11.60 and Fibre)Rising 2 year 7.30 Goats (Dairy)Rising 1 year 73.70 Rising 2 year 13.00 PigsWeaners to 10 weeks of age 72.00 Growing pigs 10 to 17 weeks of age 56.40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 2 Copyright in Sound Recordings Depreciation Determination DEP31 In TIB Volume Nine, No.11 (November 1997) at page 5, we published a draft general depreciation determination for copyright in sound recordings. The determination follows the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1997 which added the copyright in certain sound recordings to schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Schedule 17 lists intangible property that can be depreciated and now includes: The copyright in a sound recording, if the copyright was produced or purchased by the taxpayer on or after 1 July 1997, and copies of the recording have been sold or offered for sale to the public. The Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Act 1997 also amended section EG 17 – Depreciation deduction where depreciated asset acquired by taxpayer from associated person. Section EG 17(7) provides that no depreciation deduction will be allowed where: •the taxpayer acquired the depreciable intangible property from an associated person on or after 1 July 1997 where that property was not listed in schedule 17 before that date; and •the asset was not property the cost of which was allowed as a deduction to the associated person by virtue of amortisation or similar deduction allowed under the Income Tax Act 1994. As a result, this determination will only apply where the copyright in the sound recording was produced, or purchased by the taxpayer from an unrelated party, on or after 1 July 1997 and copies of the sound recording must also have been sold or offered for sale to the public. No submissions were received in relation to the draft so the Commissioner has now issued the determination, which is reproduced below. The determination may be cited as “Determination DEP31: Tax Depreciation Rates Determination General Determination No. 31”. The determination is based on an estimated useful life of 1 year and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP31 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP31: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 31”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” produced or purchased on or after 1 July 1997. 2. Determination Pursuant to section EG 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 I hereby amend Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (as previously amended) by: •Inserting into the “Audio and Video Recording Studios and Professional Photography” industry category the general asset class, estimated useful life, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: EstimatedDV bandedSL equivalent Audio & Video Recording Studiosuseful lifedep’n ratebanded dep’n rate and Professional Photography(years)(%)(%) Copyright in sound recordings, produced or purchased on or after 1 July 19971100100 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. This determination was signed by me on the 18th day of February 1998. Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 3 Library Books and Periodicals Depreciation Determination DEP32 In TIB Volume Nine, No.7 (July 1997) at page 3, we proposed new general depreciation rates for library books and periodicals, and invited TIB readers to make submissions. The determination is reproduced below. The general determination sets two new asset classes for library books, as reproduced below. The determination sets a new depreciation rate of 63.5% DV for books whose editions are published annually or more frequently. This rate is based on a useful life of 2 years and a residual value of 13.5% of cost. The other new asset class covers all other books, for which the rate is 18% DV. This rate is based on a useful life of 10 years and a residual value of 13.5% of cost. Newspapers and periodicals may be written off in the year of purchase. Periodicals cover soft-covered publica- tions such as journals or magazines (as opposed to books) which are published periodically, i.e. weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, or even annually. Periodicals also include publications that provide an updating service. These publications may be paid by annual subscription that covers the updating service and an annual consolidated version of the publication. In other cases the periodic updates may be charged for separately. The annual consolidated version should be treated as coming under the asset class “Books, editions of which are published annually or more frequently” and depreciated accordingly. Payments for the periodic updates can be written off as costs of periodicals. General Depreciation Determination DEP32 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP32: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 32”. 1.

A depreciation rate is set for “Delimbers, Static”, under the “Timber and Joinery Industries” industry category, but that rate is not appropriate for self-propelled, mobile delimbers. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Delimbers, self-propelled, mobile” into the “Timber and Joinery Industries” industry category, with a depre- ciation rate of 22% (D.V.) (15.5% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 8 years. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rate is based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%.

Depreciation – bedding (medical and medical laboratories) Correction to Depreciation Determination DEP30 We have been alerted to an error in the above General Depreciation Determination, which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Nine, No.11 (Novem- ber 1997). The last item in that determination inserts the asset class of “Bedding” into the “Medical and Medical Laboratory Equipment” asset category. There is no such asset category: the determination should have inserted the asset class into the “Medical and Medical Laboratory Equipment” industry category. A new determination is reproduced below which will delete the “Bedding” asset class from the “Medical and Medical Laboratory Equipment” asset category and insert it into the “Medical and Medical Laboratory Equipment” industry category.

The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a number of new asset classes into both the “Transportation” and “Hire Equipment (Where on short-term hire of 1 month or less only)” asset categories, as similar assets are already found in both categories.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 8 Salespersons on commission plus retainer Notice of withdrawal of item in Public Information Bulletin 178 In Public Information Bulletin 178 (February 1989) at pages 6-7, in an item entitled “Commission Agents – Expense Claims”, the Commissioner ruled on the treatment of commission earnings for PAYE purposes. In particular, this item stated that if a taxpayer received a salary or retainer or other fixed remuneration in addition to a commission, an employer/employee relationship existed and the total remuneration was to be taxed as “salary and wages”. Conversely, the item stated that if a taxpayer received commission remuneration only, this generally indicated that an employer/employee relation- ship did not exist. The correctness of this item has now been questioned. Since PIB 178 was published, the Court of Appeal in Challenge Realty Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1990\] 3 NZLR 42 at page 70 has established that the question of whether remuneration is “salary and wages” will depend on the nature of the relationship in the contract of employment. It turns on whether the taxpayer is employed under a “contract of service” or a “contract for services”. The Court of Appeal in cases such as Challenge and TNT Worldwide Express v Cunningham \[1993\] 3 NZLR 681 has developed several tests for determining the nature of a contract of employment, and has stated that it will be a question of fact in each case and not merely a question of the type of remuneration involved. Inland Revenue published an article in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) at pages 2-4 entitled “Employee or Independent Contractor?” sum- marising these tests and identifying various questions that might be relevant in the context of applying them. The article states that “the results of the various tests must be weighed to find the predominant factors which will determine the relationship”. This approach is consistent with that of the courts. The Commissioner advises that the item in PIB 178 is not consistent with current employment law principles, and taxpayers and agents should not rely upon it. Instead they should refer to the above-mentioned TIB item to assist them in answering questions concerning the nature of employment relationships. Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation state- ments. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 9 Standard practice statements These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Shortfall penalties – not taking reasonable care Standard Practice Statement INV-200 Introduction A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer. The law divides these actions into five catego- ries of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below: Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable interpretation20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion or similar offence150% These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed. A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty. This statement deals with defaults that breach the standard of “reasonable care”. Application The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced. Defaults in employers’ obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties. The penalty provision is generic in application. This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations). Purpose The purpose of the not taking reasonable care shortfall penalty is to increase voluntary compliance with the system. The standard is the cornerstone of the penalties regime which requires all taxpayers to act reasonably in the conduct of their tax affairs. It is a fluid concept which recognises the distinct characteristics of particular obligations and the different burdens placed on various taxpayers. The standard recognises taxpayers’ varying abilities and reflects a balance between the need for returns to be correct and the recognition of the difficulties that taxpayers may face in ensuring that they are correct. Legislation Section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994: Not taking reasonable care - (1)A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer does not take reasonable care in taking a taxpay- er’s tax position (referred to as “not taking reasonable care”) and the taking of that tax position by that taxpayer results in a tax shortfall. (2)The penalty payable for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3)A taxpayer who, in taking a taxpayer’s tax position, has used an acceptable interpretation of the tax law is also a taxpayer who has taken reasonable care in taking the taxpayer’s tax position. Test of reasonable care The test of reasonable care is whether a taxpayer of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability or likelihood the prospect that an act (or failure to act) would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all the circumstances. Whether the taxpayer acted intentionally is not a consid- eration. It is not a question of whether the taxpayer actually foresaw the probability that the act or failure to act would cause a tax shortfall, but whether a reasonable person in the circumstances of the taxpayer, would have seen the tax shortfall as a reasonable probability. It equates with the concept of negligence in the civil law of Torts, and the jurisprudence is well established. “Negli- gence is to be measured objectively by ascertaining what in the circumstances would be done or omitted by the reasonable man” (Meulan’s Hair Stylists Ltd v CIR \[1963\] NZLR 797). In the tax context, reasonable care includes exercising reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position. It also includes the keeping of adequate books and records or to substantiate items properly, and generally making a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law. continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 10 Reasonable care requires a taxpayer to come to the same conclusions that a reasonable person would come to in the circumstances of that taxpayer. The standard of reasonable care in interpreting the law applies to all matters, regardless of the amount of tax. Amount of shortfall – materiality Materiality is implicit in the standard of reasonable care. In considering whether a taxpayer has taken reasonable care, consideration will be given not only to the nature of the shortfall, but also to the size of the shortfall in relation to the taxpayer. If the amount is large, relative to the total overall tax liability, then, the taxpayer should have been aware that something was amiss. For example, if a taxpayer with a returned income of $50,000, omitted income of $10,000 (which was clearly “income”) from his or her return, it would be fair to say that the taxpayer should have been aware, regardless of the fact that the agent had com- pleted the return, that not all of the income had been returned. Contrast the above situation, to that of a large corporate taxpayer whose returned income for the year was $50,000,000. An omission of income of $10,000 would more than likely not have been material enough to put the taxpayer on notice. Therefore, depending on any other circumstances, this taxpayer may well have taken reasonable care to ensure that the return was correct. Tax agents and advisers A taxpayer who has relied on the advice of a tax adviser will usually be considered to have exercised reasonable care. However they may still be exposed to a penalty for lack of reasonable care should they: •fail to provide adequate information when seeking advice; •fail to provide reasonable instructions to a tax adviser; or •unreasonably rely on a tax adviser or on advice (when they have reason to believe that the advice is not correct), A taxpayer does not satisfy the obligation to take reasonable care simply by using the services of a tax agent or tax adviser. It remains the taxpayer’s responsi- bility to properly record matters relating to his or her tax affairs during the year, and to draw all the relevant facts to the attention of the agent or adviser, in order to meet the reasonable care test. Previous audits There may be cases where a taxpayer has been previ- ously audited, a particular matter found to be in default but in a subsequent return prepared by an agent, the same matter results in a shortfall. Depending on the exact circumstances, even though the agent prepared the return, the fact that the taxpayer had been alerted by the previous audit may indicate a lack of reasonable care on the part of the taxpayer on the second omission for not Appropriate to category of taxpayer The reasonable care test is not intended to be overly onerous and does not mean perfection. The effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with the reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. Ordinarily what is expected is the achievement of a standard appropriate to the category of taxpayer, rather than that of the individual taxpayer involved. The category of taxpayer will affect what constitutes reasonable care in each particular case. The standard required of a salary and wage earner will differ from that required of a business taxpayer. For most salary and wage earners, an earnest effort to follow the Tax Pack instructions will be sufficient to pass the reasonable care test. Business taxpayers must meet the standard of the “reasonable business taxpayer”. The business taxpayer may be required to do more than the “reasonable wage earner”. For example, the amount of tax involved, and the complexity of the business taxpayer’s affairs may require them to seek professional assistance in meeting their tax obligations. Objective v subjective Reasonable care is an objective test, however, it brings in subjective elements. What is meant by subjective is that when considering whether the taxpayer has taken reasonable care, the circumstances of the particular taxpayer need to be considered “objectively” by looking at what a reasonable person would have done in those circumstances. Factors to consider Circumstances that may be taken into account when determining whether reasonable care has been exercised include: •the complexity of the law and the transaction (the difficulty in interpreting complex legislation); •the materiality of the shortfall (the gravity of the consequence and the size of the risk); •the difficulty and expense of taking the precaution; •the taxpayer’s age, health and background. In addition, for a business, reasonable care may also take into account: •the size and nature of the business; •the internal controls in place; •the business record keeping practices; •system failures (Year 2000 failure would not generally be considered to be an acceptable reason). Interpretations On questions of interpretation, reasonable care will depend on: •what efforts the taxpayer had taken to resolve the issue; •the types of advice received; •the certainty of the law. from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 11 ensuring that the return was correct in that particular regard. Complexity of the law Reliance on an agent must be weighed against the complexity of the law relating to the matters at issue. If a taxpayer seeks advice on a matter on which the tax law is extremely complex, they are more likely to rely on that advice without question. A taxpayer would be required to support the argument that they accepted the agent’s advice as correct. The matter to be considered is whether a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circum- stances would have been put on notice of agent error. Agent fault Agents have a responsibility to obtain relevant informa- tion about their clients. Matters to be considered would include: •Whether or not a questionnaire was completed. •Was the information compiled accurately? •Was the questionnaire discussed with the client? The taxpayer has a responsibility to advise the agent of matters affecting his or her income. For example, advising the agent of all of their investments, bank accounts, second jobs, perk jobs, cash taken for draw- ings, etc. Taxpayers have a responsibility to fully and comprehen- sively advise their tax agents of their tax affairs. Language difficulties There is a responsibility on both the agent and the taxpayer to ensure as far as is practicable, both parties have all the relevant information to ensure that the tax return is compiled as accurately as possible. This means ensuring that any potential language problems are addressed where it is practical to do so. Inland Revenue advice Publications It is unlikely that taxpayers will be considered to have breached the reasonable care standard if Inland Revenue has failed to provide adequate information in its guides on which the taxpayer has relied. Where there is no apparent reason for a taxpayer to question information provided, the taxpayer will gener- ally have taken reasonable care. Advice provided to individual taxpayers Where a tax shortfall arises and the taxpayer states that they were relying on advice from Inland Revenue the following general rule will apply: Where the taxpayer has sought Inland Revenue advice and this can be verified then a penalty for not taking reasonable care will generally not be imposed. Verifica- tion may take the form of a letter from Inland Revenue or the taxpayer being able to provide details of when and from whom the advice was sought. This rule is however subject to the full circumstances and facts of the case. Arithmetical error Arithmetical errors may indicate a failure to take reasonable care but are not conclusive. The decision will depend on the procedures in place to detect such errors, the size, nature and frequency of the error, or the circumstances in which the taxpayer made the error. Defence to lack of reasonable care In large adjustment cases when the matter turns on a matter of interpretation, the acceptable interpretation standard must be satisfied. A taxpayer who can demon- strate that the position taken is an acceptable interpreta- tion is deemed to have satisfied the reasonable care standard. Burden and standard of proof A taxpayer has the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty through the disputes process. If the issue can not be resolved through the disputes process the taxpayer has the normal rights of review through the courts. The burden of proof in civil proceedings relating to the imposition of penalties rests with the taxpayer. They must show that on the “balance of probabilities” they have taken reasonable care. Accordingly, if the taxpayer can show that it is probable that they took reasonable care, they will have satisfied the standard. Standard rate of penalty The standard rate of penalty payable for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the follow- ing circumstances: •voluntary disclosure before or during an audit •voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing •temporary tax shortfalls •obstruction Other reference An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Infor- mation Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996). Summary Section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a taxpayer who does not take reasonable care in taking a tax position is liable to pay a shortfall penalty of 20% of the resulting shortfall. The test of reasonable care is whether a person of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability or likelihood the prospect that an act (or failure to act) would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all the circumstances. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 12 Shortfall penalties - unacceptable interpretation Standard Practice Statement INV-205 Introduction A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer. The law divides these actions into five catego- ries of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below: Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable interpretation20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion or similar offence150% These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed. A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty. This statement deals with defaults that fall within the shortfall penalty category of “unacceptable interpreta- tion”. Application The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced. Defaults in employers’ obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties. The penalty provision is generic in application. This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations). Purpose The purpose of the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty is to ensure that in a self assessment environment taxpayers who take a position which has significant tax consequences take extra care. It ensures that the conclu- sions they reach on their tax liability are sound. Legislation Section 141B of Tax Administration Act 1994: Unacceptable Interpretation - (1)In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unacceptable interpretation - (a)Is an interpretation or an interpretation of an applica- tion of a tax law; and (b)Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. (2)A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if - (a)The taxpayer’s tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law; and (b)The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position exceeds both - (i)$10,000; and (ii)The lesser of $200,000 and one percent of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. (3)For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer’s total tax figure is - (a)The amount of tax paid or payable by the taxpayer in respect of the return period for which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position before, in the case of income tax, any group offset election or subvention payment; or (b)Where the taxpayer has no tax to pay in respect of the return period - (i)Except in the case of GST, an amount equal to the product of - (A)The net loss of a taxpayer in respect of the return period, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994, are to be used in this subsection as if they had a positive value; and (B)The basic rate of income tax for companies in the relevant return; or (ii)In the case of GST, the refund of tax to which the taxpayer is entitled for the return period, - that is shown as tax paid or payable, or as net losses of the taxpayer, or as a refund to which the taxpayer is entitled, in a tax return provided by the taxpayer for the return period. (4)Where subsection (2) applies, the shortfall penalty is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. (5)For the purposes of this section, the question whether any interpretation of a tax law is acceptable or unacceptable shall be determined as at the time at which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position. (6)For tax positions involving an interpretation of a tax law or laws that have been taken into account in a tax return, the time the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position is when the taxpayer provides the return containing the taxpayer’s tax position. If the taxpayer does not provide a tax return for a return period, the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position on the due date for providing the tax return. (7)The matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position taken by a taxpayer involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include - (a)The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 13 (b)Decisions of a court or Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position). (8)For the purpose of determining whether the resulting tax shortfall is in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (2)(b), - (a)A tax return provided by - (i)A partnership; or (ii)Any other group of persons that derive or incur amounts jointly or are assessed together, - is to be treated as if it were a tax return of every taxpayer who is a partner in the partnership or person in such group; and (b)The tax rate in a return period applying to a partnership is deemed to be the same as the basic rate of income tax for companies for the relevant period. (9)The amounts or the percentage specified in subsection (2) may be varied from time to time by the Governor-General by Order in Council. Threshold A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position exceeds both $10,000, and the lesser of $200,000 and 1% of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. Interpretation or application of a tax law The unacceptable interpretation test applies only to tax shortfalls caused by a taxpayer treating a tax law as applying in a particular way. A taxpayer treats the tax law as applying in a particular way where he or she concludes that, on the basis of the facts and the way the law applies to those facts, a particular consequence follows. For example, an amount of expenditure is deductible. In some cases a taxpayer’s tax position may not represent conclusions of the taxpayer, but instead reflect calculation or transposition errors. As a broad rule, where a tax shortfall was caused by an error in calculation or a transposition error, section 141B will not apply, since the taxpayer will not have treated a tax law as applying in relation to a matter in a particular way. However, in such a case consideration would need to be given to the reasonable care standard. Non-application of a tax law There may be instances where a taxpayer argues that he or she did not apply a section of the Act, therefore, did not interpret the particular section as applying. Accord- ingly, the taxpayer contends that the unacceptable interpretation standard does not apply. The non-applica- tion of a tax law will in all cases be considered to be applying the tax law. What is an unacceptable interpretation? Level of standard The taxpayer’s case does not have to be so balanced with the Commissioner’s that no real preference can be given to one over the other. The test is not more likely than not, nor is it as likely as not; such wording would imply a 50 percent or better chance of success. Rather the standard is about as likely as not correct. In addition, the word “likely” implies a degree of latitude. The upper boundary of probability for a position to be an acceptable interpretation is a 50/50 likelihood of suc- cess; but the lower boundary is not quite so clear. However, guidance can be obtained from establishing where the interface with the standard sufficient for the exercise of reasonable care lies. Accordingly, the standard is less stringent than that of “more likely than not”, but is more stringent than the “reasonable care standard”. Significant emphasis should be given to the word “about”. The standard is not intended to remove the right of a taxpayer to take up issues with the Commissioner, rather, it must be a position to which a court would give serious consideration, but not necessarily agree with. This means that the prospect of the taxpayer’s interpreta- tion being upheld by the court must be substantial, although not necessarily 50 percent. The taxpayer’s argument should be sufficient to support a reasonable expectation that the taxpayer could succeed in court. An example would be where a taxpayer’s position was upheld in the TRA, however, later lost in the High Court. In such a situation it would be considered that the taxpayer clearly had an acceptable interpretation. However, in saying this, a taxpayer is not required to take a case to the courts to determine that they had an acceptable interpretation. If a taxpayer adopts one of several equally likely interpretations this will generally satisfy the standard, as each position is about as likely as any other position to be the correct tax position. The level is more easily reached if there is no case law on the area and the statute law is ambiguous or unclear. Taxpayer effort The unacceptable interpretation standard is an objective test involving an analysis of the law to the relevant facts. This means that it is not relevant that a taxpayer believes that the position taken was an acceptable interpretation. The unacceptable interpretation standard does not take into account taxpayers’ efforts in resolving unclear issues. The standard is intended to focus on the merits of an argument in support of a particular position, rather than the taxpayer’s effort in resolving issues. The strength of the argument is weighed by considering the existence and reasoning of relevant authorities. Relevant authorities have not been defined in the legislation, however some matters that must be considered are listed. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 14 Relevance - Authorities that have similar factual circumstances to the case asserted by a taxpayer are more relevant than those authorities which can be materially distinguished on the facts. However, if a taxpayer has no authorities to support a case there may still exist an acceptable interpretation. In such cases, a taxpayer needs a well-reasoned construc- tion of the statutory provision which is about as likely as not to be correct. Opinions expressed by tax professionals Information which supports a reasonable argument may include such items as the contents of tax opinions, legal articles and related material. However, the mere exist- ence of an opinion from an adviser would not on its own indicate that an acceptable interpretation exists. It is the content of the opinion and strength of the alternative views, not the fact of seeking advice, which will be relevant. Other matters Other matters which may be considered in particular circumstances include: •binding public rulings on analogous issues and other published Inland Revenue statements, •legal articles and related material and references made to statutes other than the Revenue Acts. •statute other than tax law •dictionary meaning or a definition in another statute. •generally accepted accounting practice and commer- cial practice. These matters carry more significance in areas where the law is unclear and there is no relevant case law available. Timing To determine whether an acceptable interpretation exists, consideration will be given to the authorities available at the time the taxpayer took the tax position. This will generally be when the taxpayer files the tax return. In addition, subsequent clarification or develop- ment of case law or public rulings in a particular area may confirm that a position taken is acceptable. How- ever, subsequent developments will not be used to argue that a position was an unacceptable interpretation. The legislation does not require the taxpayer to docu- ment an acceptable interpretation at the time of taking the tax position. Taxpayers will be able to substantiate their arguments when a dispute arises, after filing their returns. However, in most cases taxpayers will need to consider the validity of an interpretation relating to a sizeable transaction when they take the position in their returns or earlier. In addition, decisions of a court or the Taxation Review Authority which are issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the tax position will not be used to argue Matters which must be considered Section 141B(7) provides that the matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include - •The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and •Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position – see “Timing”). Relevant tax laws Tax law is defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Administra- tion Act 1994 as: (a)A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces: (b)An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law: (c)A non-disputable decision: (d)In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilita- tion and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act: Section 141B(7)(a) makes specific reference to the anti- avoidance provisions. This ensures that it cannot be argued that a tax position or interpretation is an accept- able interpretation in terms of a particular legislative provision irrespective of the operation of other provi- sions such as general anti-avoidance provisions. In trying to discern the scheme and purpose of the legislation, primary regard must be had to the words of the legislation. It is Parliamentary intent, as expressed in the statute, which is crucial. The increased complexity of tax legislation has resulted in some ambiguity, leading to confusion as to the meaning of particular provisions which makes the ascertainment of the true Parliamentary intent difficult. The Government’s consultative docu- ments, the various consultative committee reports, Parliamentary discussion and debate, and Departmental interpretative guidelines may provide assistance in interpreting the legislation under review. Relevant court decisions Factors that affect the weight of an authority: Publication – The decision must have been published or referred to in a reported commentary. Source – This refers to the court or tribunal which made the decision on which the taxpayer relies. The higher the source of a decision in the judicial hierarchy, the more precedential the decision. Jurisdiction – Decisions by the New Zealand judiciary, will usually be given more weight than extra-territorial decisions of other countries. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 15 that the taxpayer’s position is an unacceptable interpreta- tion. For the purposes of this provision “issued” is considered to mean when the decision is published. Binding rulings and the acceptable interpretation standard The fact that a taxpayer adopts an interpretation that differs from that of a ruling or published Inland Revenue statements will not necessarily mean that the taxpayer has an unacceptable interpretation. However, if there is a binding ruling supporting the taxpayer’s position, there will be no tax shortfall. A shortfall penalty cannot therefore be considered. Relationship to the reasonable care standard The aim of the acceptable interpretation standard is to ensure that taxpayers take care in considering their position. This is required by the reasonable care stand- ard, however, the acceptable interpretation standard takes away some of the so called “subjective elements” i.e. taxpayer effort, when there is a significant amount of tax at stake. A taxpayer who satisfies the acceptable interpretation standard is deemed to have satisfied the reasonable care standard. Standard rate of penalty The standard rate of penalty payable for gross careless- ness is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the follow- ing circumstances: •voluntary disclosure before or during an audit •voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing •temporary tax shortfalls •obstruction Other reference An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Infor- mation Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996). Summary Section 141B of Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a penalty for taking an unacceptable interpretation, at the rate of 20%. A penalty is charged where all of the following condi- tions are met: •The shortfall was caused by a tax position involving an interpretation or application of a tax law. •The tax shortfall exceeded both $10,000, and the lesser of $200,000 and 1% of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. •The tax position taken fails to meet the standard of being, viewed objectively, about as likely as not to be correct. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy Shortfall penalties – gross carelessness Standard Practice Statement INV-210 Introduction A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer. The law divides these actions into five catego- ries of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below: Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable interpretation20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion or similar offence150% These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed. A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty. This statement deals with defaults that fall within the shortfall penalty category of “gross carelessness”. Application The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced. Defaults in employers’ obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties. The penalty provision is generic in application. This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations). continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 16 Boundary between gross careless- ness and other shortfall penalties The definition for gross carelessness is more akin to evasion than not taking reasonable care. The only essential element keeping them apart is that, for evasion it must be shown that the taxpayer had the necessary “mens rea” (intent) to evade tax. This is not a necessary element in determining whether a taxpayer has been grossly careless. Therefore, to determine whether a tax shortfall is the result of gross carelessness consideration should be given to the boundary between evasion and gross carelessness, not failing to take reasonable care. It is at this end of the spectrum that the distinction becomes clearer, due to the fact that there is a change between the two categories, moving from an objective test (for gross carelessness) to a subjective test (for evasion). Further to this there is a change in the onus of proof, moving from the taxpayer to the Commissioner, in the case of evasion. General rules Lack of reasonable care or gross carelessness If it is uncertain whether the tax shortfall is the result of not taking reasonable care or gross carelessness, gener- ally the penalty will default to the not taking reasonable care category. This is because gross carelessness occurs only where a taxpayer’s behaviour displays a high degree of carelessness and disregard for the conse- quences. Gross carelessness or evasion In determining whether to impose a penalty for gross carelessness or evasion the decision will generally rely on the evidence available and whether it is sufficient to discharge the Commissioner’s onus of proof for evasion. If the evidence is insufficient the penalty will default to the gross carelessness category. Burden and standard of proof A taxpayer has the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty through the disputes process. If the issue can not be resolved through the disputes process the taxpayer has the normal rights of review through the courts. The burden of proof, in civil proceedings relating to the imposition of shortfall penalties, rests with the taxpayer. They must show that on the “balance of probabilities” they have not been grossly careless. Standard rate of penalty The standard rate of penalty payable for gross careless- ness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall. Purpose The purpose of the gross carelessness shortfall penalty is to cater for breaches that fall just short of the evasion category but beyond a lack of reasonable care. The old regime of penal and additional tax failed to cater for these situations. Legislation Section 141C of Tax Administration Act 1994: Gross Carelessness – (1)A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer is grossly careless in taking a taxpayer’s tax position (referred to as “gross carelessness”). (2)The penalty payable for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3)For the purposes of this Part, gross carelessness means doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences. (4)A taxpayer who, in taking a taxpayer’s tax position, has used an acceptable interpretation of tax law is also a taxpayer who has not been grossly careless in taking the taxpayer’s tax position. Gross carelessness similar to recklessness Gross carelessness is similar to recklessness. In fact it is identical to the objective test for recklessness as dis- cussed by the House of Lords in R v Caldwell \[1982\] AC 341, \[1981\] 1 All ER 961. In this case the House of Lords found that the test of recklessness was objective and may be found to exist where a person whose behav- iour is in question fails to give any thought to the consequences of his behaviour. However, the New Zealand Courts seem to support that the statutory forms of recklessness ought to be given a subjective meaning. This is supported in Case P29 (1992) 14 NZTC where his Honour stated: “Where recklessness is alleged the Commissioner must prove ... that the facts which were actually known to the taxpayer were such that they must have put him on enquiry that the income returned for tax purposes was understated. Faced with those facts the Commissioner must then show that the taxpayer made the conscious decision to ignore them and to return the understated income without making any further enquiry.” It was considered that as the category was within the civil penalties it was appropriate that the test be objec- tive rather than subjective, with the fixed penalty rate being set to reflect this. It was for this reason that the new term of gross carelessness was used rather than recklessness. This was also consistent with the aim of the penalty, being to cater for breaches that fell just short of the evasion category (because of lack of proof of intent) but well beyond not taking reasonable care. from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 17 This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the follow- ing circumstances: •voluntary disclosure before or during an audit •voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing •temporary tax shortfalls •obstruction Other reference An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Infor- mation Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996). Summary Section 141C of Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a penalty of gross carelessness, at the rate of 40%, where a default falls just short of the evasion category but well beyond not taking reasonable care. The definition for gross carelessness is more akin to evasion than not taking reasonable care. The only essential element keeping them apart is that, for evasion, it must be shown that the taxpayer had the necessary “mens rea” (intent) to evade tax. Typically, a high level of carelessness will be character- ised by conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring where this risk and its consequences would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances. The penalty is non-negotiable and where a default meets the considerations for gross carelessness the penalty must be imposed. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy Shortfall penalties – abusive tax position Standard Practice Statement INV-215 Introduction A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer. The law divides these actions into five catego- ries of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below: Not taking reasonable care20% Unacceptable interpretation20% Gross carelessness40% Abusive tax position100% Evasion or similar offence150% These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed. A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty. This statement deals with defaults that fall within the shortfall penalty category of “abusive tax position”. Application The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced. Defaults in employers’ obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties. The penalty provision is generic in application. This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations). Purpose The purpose of the abusive tax position shortfall penalty is to penalise those taxpayers who apply an unacceptable interpretation to a tax law that either results in, or would result in, reducing or removing tax liabilities, or gives tax benefits. The unacceptable interpretation may be the result of either entering into or acting on an arrangement or simply the interpretation or application of tax laws. The arrangement or interpretation must have a dominant purpose of taking, or of supporting the taking of, the resulting tax position/s. It is intended that the provision will apply not only to situations where an anti-avoidance provision is invoked, but also where other provisions have been applied. This is important to ensure that identical conduct is not penalised differently solely because taxpayers are of different levels of sophistication or because Inland Revenue is not required to resort to an anti-avoidance provision. Legislation Section 141D of the Tax Administration Act 1994: Abusive tax position – (1)The purpose of this section is to penalise those taxpayers who, having applied an unacceptable interpretation to a tax law, have entered into or acted in respect of arrangements or interpreted or applied tax laws with a dominant purpose of taking, or of supporting the taking of, tax positions that reduce or remove tax liabilities or give tax benefits. continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 18 therefore does not apply to the “abusive tax position” penalty. Dominant purpose of avoiding tax Dominant purpose Where there is more than one purpose for entering into the relevant scheme, then section 141D(7)(b) requires that the particular purpose is the dominant purpose. The Australian High Court decision in FC of T v Spot- less Services Ltd (unrep, HC Australia, M32–33, 3 De- cember 1996) examined the expression “dominant purpose” and equated the term with “most influential and prevailing or ruling purpose”. Accordingly, if there are three purposes in entering into the arrangement or transaction and one of those purposes is to obtain a tax benefit, then if that purpose (obtaining a tax benefit) is the “most influential” of the three purposes, the domi- nant purpose test would have arguably been met. The legislation relating to the shortfall penalty refers to a dominant “purpose”. This differs from section BG 1 – core provisions – (formerly section BB 9) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which refers to “Its purpose or effect is tax avoidance”. It is considered that nothing turns on the distinction between “purpose or effect” and “purpose”. In the context of section BG 1 case law certainly supports this view (Tayles v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1982\] 2 NZLR 726,734). It could be considered that the term “purpose” is more of a “subjective” term than that of “effect”, which is an objective term. However, the new provision is explicit that the test of whether an arrangement has the dominant purpose of avoiding tax is an objective one. It is also firmly established in case law that the purpose of an arrangement is to be argued objectively for section BG 1. In short, the word “purpose” means, not motive, but the effect which is sought to achieve – the end in view. The section is not concerned with the motives of taxpay- ers or the desire to avoid tax. It is only concerned with the means employed to avoid tax (i.e., the arrangement). Avoiding tax The concept of “avoiding tax” encompasses the deferral of tax and the claiming of tax credits. It is considered that “avoiding tax” would incorporate “tax avoidance” as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. However, is the term “avoiding tax” wider than the term “tax avoidance”? The term “avoiding tax” is likely to be read in the light of the other provisions of the relevant tax law which refer to tax avoidance, but will not require them to be applied. The penalty will also apply to arrangements which fail under a technical provision rather than a general or specific anti-avoidance provision. (2)A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer takes an abusive tax position (referred to as an “abusive tax position”). (3)The penalty payable for taking an abusive tax position is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall. (4)This section applies to a taxpayer only if – (a)The taxpayer’s tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law; and (b)The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position exceeds $10,000. (5)Section 141B (6) applies for determining the time when a taxpayer takes an abusive tax position. (6)A taxpayer’s tax position may be an abusive tax position if the tax position is an incorrect tax position under, or as a result of, either or both of – (a)A general tax law; or (b)A specific or general anti-avoidance tax law. (7)For the purposes of this Part, an “abusive tax position” means a tax position that, – (a)At the time at which the taxpayer’s tax position is taken, involves the taking of an unacceptable interpre- tation of a tax law; and (b)Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes – (i)In respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; or (ii)Where the tax position does not relate to an arrange- ment described in subparagraph (i), with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. Criteria to be met Before a penalty for an abusive tax position can be imposed, three criteria must be met: •The position taken must be an unacceptable interpreta- tion; and •It must involve over $10,000 tax; and •There must be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Unacceptable interpretation standard The unacceptable interpretation standard will first be applied to determine if a penalty is warranted. This test recognises that there are many uncertainties in law and that more than one valid interpretation of that law is sometimes possible. It is unreasonable and unfair to penalise a person for an interpretation if there is a reasonable argument that the interpretation is correct. Threshold The $10,000 threshold differs from the threshold for an unacceptable interpretation. The provisions in section 141B(2) relate solely to whether or not a shortfall penalty is charged. The 1% materiality threshold which applies to the “unacceptable interpretation” penalty from page 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 19 The penalty does not explicitly require an anti-avoidance provision to have been applied: •The penalty applies only when the taxpayer’s tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation. This test applies when the taxpayer fails to correctly apply or interpret any provision of tax law. It is not restricted to anti-avoidance provisions; •The penalty applies where the dominant “purpose” is tax avoidance; not when the tax has in fact been avoided; •The abusive tax position penalty applies, both to arrangements which are reconstituted under an anti- avoidance provision and to arrangements which are caught by another provision but would otherwise have been subject to an anti-avoidance provision. In addition, the fact that section 141D(7)(b)(ii) specifi- cally provides for situations where there is no arrange- ment clarifies that the penalty is not restricted to situa- tions involving the application of an anti-avoidance provision. Therefore, the abusive tax position penalty can apply when there is not an arrangement, but the tax position taken has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Factors to consider The following are an indication of the some of the factors that must be taken into account when considering whether there is a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Artificiality and contrivance Have the transactions been designed to appear to comply with the legislation? The legal form may not reflect the substance (even though the legal form is effective). Consideration will be given to the commercial reality of the arrangement. Are the arrangements or schemes “self- cancelling” (i.e., neutral commercial consequences, leaving only tax effects)? The importance of the commercial purpose of the transaction as compared to the tax benefit that the relevant taxpayer obtained must be examined. Circularity of funding Funding going around in a circle, usually through a tax haven, resulting in income being tax exempt and the related expenditure tax deductible may be considered as an indicator of a tax avoiding arrangement. Concealment of information and non-availability of evidence This may occur through the use of a tax haven. By going through a tax haven disclosure protection may result due to the particular tax haven’s secrecy laws. These laws usually do not allow information to be released to tax authorities, thereby providing an obstacle to the gather- ing of information to establish whether the transaction or arrangement is artificial or contrived. Spurious interpretations Spurious interpretation covers situations where a tax position taken has no or very little basis at law or the interpretation made or position taken is frivolous. If there is a reasonable basis then it will not be considered spurious (even though this would not be sufficient for the acceptable interpretation standard). What happens when a Revenue Act has no anti-avoidance provision As mentioned previously section 141D(6) states that an incorrect tax position may result from either a general tax law or a specific or general anti-avoidance tax law. The fact that a particular Revenue Act does not have an anti-avoidance provision does not mean that the penalty cannot be imposed. What is required is that the tax position taken is incorrect under a general tax law and has as its dominant purpose the avoidance of tax. There must however be a tax shortfall. If the position involves an arrangement which has the effect of ensuring that the treatment is within the inter- pretation of the law then there would not be a tax shortfall. The reason being, that the anti-avoidance provisions work by deeming the arrangement to be null and void, thereby allowing the substantive provisions to be applied as intended. The anti-avoidance provisions are not an assessing provision in themselves; they are a reconstruction provision. It is the substantive provisions which result in the reassessment. Publication of name Section 146(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the name of anyone liable to pay a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position will be published in the Gazette. This will not occur however in the case of a voluntary disclosure prior to an investigation commencing. Burden and standard of proof A taxpayer has the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty through the disputes process. If the issue can not be resolved through the disputes process the taxpayer has the normal rights of review through the courts. The burden of proof, in civil proceedings relating to the imposition of shortfall penalties, rests with the taxpayer. They must show that on the “balance of probabilities” they have not taken an abusive tax position. Standard rate of penalty The standard rate of penalty payable for taking an abusive tax position is 100% of the resulting tax short- fall. continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 20 The objective of an avoidance penalty is to deter taxpay- ers from entering into arrangements which have as their dominant purpose the avoiding of tax. Before a penalty for an abusive tax position can be imposed, three criteria must be met: •the position taken must be an unacceptable interpreta- tion; and •it must involve over $10,000 tax; and •there must be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy Shortfall penalties – evasion or similar act Standard Practice Statement INV-220 Introduction A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer.

A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty. This statement deals with defaults that fall within the shortfall penalty category of “evasion or similar act”. Application The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced. Defaults in employers’ obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties. The penalty provision is generic in application. This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations). Purpose The purpose of the evasion or similar offence shortfall penalty is to provide a penalty for taxpayers who evade the assessment or payment of tax for themselves or others, or who knowingly misapply a deduction or withholding tax, or who knowingly do not make tax deductions, or who obtain a refund or assist others to obtain a refund to which they know they are not entitled. Legislation Section 141E of the Tax Administration Act 1994: Evasion or similar act – (1)A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if, in taking a tax position the taxpayer – (a)evades the assessment or payment of tax on their own behalf or on behalf of any another person; or (b)knowingly applies or permits someone else to apply a deduction or withholding of tax which they were required to make to the Commissioner; or (c)knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax which they are required to make; or (d)obtains a refund or payment of tax knowing that they are not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment; or (e)enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not entitled to the refund or payment. (2)No person shall be chargeable with a shortfall penalty under subsection (1)(b) if that person satisfies the Commis- sioner that the amount of the deduction has been accounted for, and that the person’s failure to account for it within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident, or some other cause beyond the person’s control. (3)If a taxpayer enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the follow- ing circumstances: •voluntary disclosure before or during an audit •voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing •temporary tax shortfalls •obstruction Other reference An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Infor- mation Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996). Summary Section 141D of Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a penalty for taking an abusive tax position, at the rate of 100%. from page 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 21 lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law, the taxpayer is liable to pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the shortfall penalty that would have been imposed if the other person’s tax position had been the taxpayer’s tax position. (4)The penalty payable for evasion or a similar act described in subsection (1) is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. Discussion At the top end of the scale of non-compliance is a wilful or knowing breach of an obligation. The civil penalty for tax evasion applies to all tax types. Tax evasion involves a deliberate attempt to cheat the revenue. This may include a taxpayer obtaining refunds (tax credits, rebates) knowing that he or she is not lawfully entitled to them or knowingly not accounting for tax deductions to the Commissioner. Generally speaking there are two categories of behaviour that are subject to the shortfall penalty under the provi- sions of section 141E. Subsections (1)(b) to (e) require only knowledge of the breach, whereas breaches within subsection (1)(a) require the knowledge and intent to evade. Taxpayer enables another to obtain a refund Section 141E(1)(e) provides that a shortfall penalty is payable if the taxpayer “enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not entitled to the refund or payment”. However, because the shortfall penalty is a fixed per- centage of the taxpayer’s tax shortfall, no penalty would normally be able to be imposed, as it is the recipient of the refund or payment who has incurred a tax shortfall, not the taxpayer. Subsection (3) overcomes this problem by deeming that “the taxpayer is liable to pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the shortfall penalty that would have been imposed if the other person’s tax position had been the taxpayer’s tax position.” Prosecution Section 149(5) states that if a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a taxpayer for taking an incorrect tax position, the Commissioner may not subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position. Prosecution does not preclude the Commissioner from imposing the civil penalty for evasion. It is not necessary for a taxpayer to be prosecuted before a shortfall penalty is imposed as the standards of proof are different. Consideration of shortfall penalty after unsuccessful prosecution Section 149(4) states that a shortfall penalty may be imposed after a prosecution, whether or not the prosecu- tion is successful. If prosecution action for evasion is unsuccessful, a shortfall penalty can still be imposed for evasion or similar act, because the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities, even though the onus of proof is still on the Commissioner. However, the reason why the prosecution was not successful will be considered. If it was dismissed on technical grounds (for example some procedural matters in the prosecution not complied with), clearly a shortfall penalty can be imposed. If the evidence available to the court was clearly inadequate, then a shortfall penalty will not be able to be imposed. If it is intended to prosecute a taxpayer and later impose a shortfall penalty, the taxpayer will be advised that after the prosecution, whether or not the prosecution is successful, the imposition of a shortfall penalty will be considered. Tax deduction offences Under section 141E, a shortfall penalty for evasion includes tax deduction offences (including Child Sup- port and Student Loan deductions). This is both know- ingly not deducting tax and knowingly not accounting for tax deducted. Taxpayers can also be prosecuted for a knowledge offence under section 143A for either of the above (knowingly not deducting tax and knowingly not accounting for tax deductions) or under section 143B for evasion for not deducting tax. Statutory defence Section 141E(2) provides that a shortfall penalty is not chargeable for failure to account for deductions to the Commissioner if the taxpayer is able to prove that: •the amount of the tax deduction has been accounted for, and •the taxpayer’s failure to account for the tax within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident or other cause beyond the person’s control These points have to be met for the taxpayer to be excused from any liability. Beyond the person’s control Beyond control does not include such circumstances as financial reasons, or the actions of staff. It may however include such circumstances as hospitalisation, accidents, illness, and other such causes. Circumstances beyond one’s control cannot be a con- tinuing defence, i.e., it cannot be used as a defence month after month. Factors to consider Some of the factors that may be considered are: •Length of time deducting and awareness of obligation to make payments by the due date •Who is responsible for drawing up deduction details and forwarding payment by the due date continued on page 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 22 This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the follow- ing circumstances: •voluntary disclosure before or during an audit •voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing •temporary tax shortfalls •obstruction Other reference An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Infor- mation Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996). Summary Section 141E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a taxpayer who evades or enables another person to evade the payment of tax is liable to pay a shortfall penalty of 150% of the resulting shortfall. Situations where a refund or payment of tax is unlaw- fully received are also covered. A shortfall penalty is not chargeable if the taxpayer is able to prove to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that: •the amount of the tax deduction has been accounted for, and •the taxpayer’s failure to account for the tax within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident or other cause beyond the person’s control. Where the taxpayer enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not entitled to the refund or payment, the taxpayer is liable to pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the shortfall penalty that would have been imposed if the other person’s tax position had been the taxpayer’s tax position. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy Criminal offence – evasion or similar offences Standard Practice Statement INV-225 Introduction Criminal penalties fall within three categories: •Absolute liability offences •Knowledge offences •Evasion or similar offences There are also penalties for obstruction and aiding and abetting. This statement deals with prosecutions by the Commis- sioner for defaults that fall within the criminal offence category of “evasion or similar offences”. Application The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced. Defaults in employers’ obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties. The penalty provision is generic in application. This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations). •Reason/s why the deductions were not paid by the due date •Was the taxpayer aware that payment had not been made by the due date and that an offence was being committed? •When did they become aware that payment had not been made and what steps were taken to rectify the situation? •For what purpose(s) were the deductions used when not paid by the due date? Publication of name Section 146(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the name of anyone liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion will be published in the Gazette. This will not occur however in the case of a voluntary disclosure prior to an investigation commencing. Burden and standard of proof A taxpayer has the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty through the disputes process. If the issue can not be resolved through the disputes process the taxpayer has the normal rights of review through the courts. The burden of proof, in civil proceedings relating to the imposition of the evasion or similar act shortfall penalty, rests with the Commissioner. The standard of proof for imposition of a shortfall penalty for evasion is the “balance of probabilities”. Standard rate of penalty The standard rate of penalty payable for evasion or a similar act is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall. from page 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 23 Purpose The purpose is to provide a penalty for taxpayers who evade or enable another person to evade the payment of tax. It also covers situations where a refund or payment of tax is unlawfully received. The penalty provision is generic in application. This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts except Child Support and Student Loans. Legislation Section 143B of the Tax Administration Act 1994: Evasion or similar offence – (1)A person commits an offence against this Act if the person – (a)Knowingly does not keep the books and documents required to be kept by a tax law; or (b)Knowingly does not provide information (including tax returns and forms) to the Commissioner or any other person when required to do so by a tax law; or (c)Knowingly provides altered, false, incomplete, or misleading information (including tax returns and forms) to the Commissioner or any other person in respect of a tax law or a matter or thing relating to a tax law; or (d)Knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax required to be made by a tax law; or (e)Pretends to be another person for any purpose or reason relating to a tax law, – and does so – (f)Intending to evade the assessment or payment of tax by the person or any other person under a tax law; or (g)To obtain a refund or payment of tax in the knowledge that the person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law; or (h)To enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax in the knowledge that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law. (2)A person who evades or attempts to evade the assessment or payment of tax by the person or another person under a tax law commits an offence against this Act. (3)A company does not commit an offence under subsection (1)(d) for knowingly not making a deduction of dividend withholding payment in respect of a dividend derived, if – (a)The company deducted an estimate of the amount of dividend withholding payment payable; and (b)The Commissioner is satisfied that – (i)The company’s failure was because it was not practicable for the company to calculate with accuracy, at the time of derivation, under section LF 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994, the amount of underlying foreign tax credit arising with respect to the dividend; and (ii)The estimate is a reasonable one. (4)A person who is convicted of an offence against subsec- tion (1) or subsection (2) is liable to – (a)Imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years; or (b)A fine not exceeding $50,000; or (c)Both. What is meant by “Evasion or similar” offences? All offences in this category require the person to have both the knowledge and the necessary “intent” to commit the offence. Intent is critical to the offence. There must be sufficient evidence to prove “beyond reasonable doubt” that the person not only committed the offence but committed it: •intending to evade the assessment or payment of the tax by the person or any other person; or •to obtain a refund or payment of tax in the knowledge that the person was not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment; or •to enable another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax in the knowledge that the other person was not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment. Before a person can be prosecuted for an offence under section 143B(1) they must meet two criteria. Firstly, the person must have committed an act which comes within subparagraphs (a) to (e) and secondly, the person must have committed the act with necessary intent, as re- quired in subparagraphs (f) to (h). Offence Section 143B(2) provides that a person who evades or attempts to evade the assessment or payment of tax for themselves or another person under a tax law commits an offence against this Act. Essentially, if a person evades or attempts to evade the assessment or payment of tax and the act or failure to act does not come within the offences listed in subparagraphs (a) to (e) of section 143B(1) then pros- ecution action can be taken under subsection 143B(2). Prosecution Section 149(5), states that if a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a taxpayer for taking an incorrect tax position, the Commissioner may not subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position. Prosecution does not preclude the Commissioner from imposing the civil penalty for evasion. It is not necessary for a taxpayer to be prosecuted before a shortfall penalty is imposed. As the standards of proof are different. Taxpayer to be advised of intention If a prosecution is to be considered, the taxpayer will be advised by letter at the time the Notice of Proposed continued on page 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 24 Voluntary disclosures Where a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure prior to an investigation commencing no prosecution action will be taken and there will be no publication of name in the Gazette. Burden and standard of proof The burden of proof rests with the Commissioner. The standard of proof for prosecution is the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. If there is insufficient proof is held to support a prosecu- tion, consideration will still be given to the imposition of shortfall penalties in its place. The reason being that the standard of proof for shortfall penalties is the civil standard of balance of probabilities. Penalty Persons convicted of an offence are liable to:- •imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years; or •a fine not exceeding $50,000; or •both. Other reference An explanation and examples of criminal penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Infor- mation Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996). Summary Section 143B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a criminal offence of evasion or similar offence. Evasion involves a deliberate actions to cheat the revenue. This may include a taxpayer obtaining refunds (tax credits, rebates) knowing that he or she is not lawfully entitled to them and knowingly not account- ing for tax deductions to the Commissioner. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy Payment of shortfall penalty using losses Standard Practice Statement INV-245 Introduction This statement deals with the situation where a taxpayer in a loss situation can elect to use losses to pay shortfall penalties. The losses may be either: •current year losses •losses carried forward from previous periods. Application The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years. There is however no requirement that the losses utilised are incurred in these years. Adjustment is issued for the tax shortfall that prosecu- tion action is being recommended. If it is intended to prosecute and later impose a shortfall penalty, the taxpayer will be advised that after the prosecution, whether or not the prosecution is success- ful, the imposition of a shortfall penalty will be consid- ered. Consideration of shortfall penalty after unsuccessful prosecution Section 149(4) states that a shortfall penalty may be imposed after a prosecution, whether or not the prosecu- tion is successful. If prosecution action for evasion is unsuccessful, a shortfall penalty can still be imposed for evasion or similar act, because the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities, even though the onus of proof is still the Commissioner. However, the reason why the prosecution was not successful will be considered. If it was dismissed on technical grounds (for example some procedural matters in the prosecution were not complied with), clearly a shortfall penalty can be imposed. If the evidence avail- able to the court was clearly inadequate, then a shortfall penalty will not be able to be imposed. Statutory defence – companies and dividend withholding payments A company can not be convicted of an offence for knowingly not making a deduction of a dividend withholding payment in respect of a dividend derived if it satisfies the criteria set out in section 143E(3). Whether a company satisfies this criteria will be a matter of fact. Publication of name Pursuant to section 146(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the name of anyone convicted of evasion will be published in the Gazette. from page 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 25 Legislation Section IG 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994: Losses may be used to pay penalties – (1)A taxpayer may elect to use a net loss of the taxpayer to pay a shortfall penalty assessed in respect of an income tax liability, if – (a)The net loss available to be offset against net income of the taxpayer in the income year of the shortfall penalty; and (b)The taxpayer notifies the Commissioner of the election within the due date period for the payment of the shortfall penalty. (1A)A wholly-owned group of companies may elect, in the manner provided in subsection (1), to apply a loss incurred by a company in the wholly-owned group in payment of a shortfall penalty imposed on any company in that group. (2)If a taxpayer makes an election under subsection (1) in relation to current year losses and the Commissioner subsequently issues a determination of net loss confirm- ing that the net losses are available to be offset in the current year, the time that the net losses are offset will be the time of the election. (3)Each dollar of net loss that is used to pay a shortfall penalty – (a)Counts as an amount equal to one dollar multiplied by the tax rate; and (b)Will, from the date the loss is used, no longer be available for use by a person. (4)For the purposes of subsection (3), the term ‘tax rate’ means the rate of tax or lowest marginal rate of tax that would apply to the taxpayer during the return period to which the relevant tax shortfall relates, if the taxpayer had tax to pay. (5)In this section, ‘income year’ includes any part of a year that, by virtue of section IF 1 or section IG 2, may be taken into account for loss continuity or group purposes. Current year losses A taxpayer who has no losses carried forward from prior years, or has insufficient losses to eliminate both tax and penalty, but who expects to have losses in the current year, can elect to use those losses, even though the final loss for that current year has not been established. Section IG 9A(2) provides that if the taxpayer does incur sufficient losses for that current income tax year, then the shortfall penalties will be deemed to have been paid by the due date. However, if at the end of the income year the taxpayer does not incur sufficient losses, late payment penalties and interest will be imposed on the tax shortfall penalty that should have been absorbed by the losses. Notification to the Commissioner If a taxpayer wishes to use losses to offset income tax shortfall penalties they must notify the Commissioner of this intention prior to the due date of the shortfall penalty. Notification may be in either written or verbal form. Only available for income tax shortfall penalties Losses can be used only to offset against shortfall penalties on income tax shortfalls. They are not available to be offset for example, against shortfall penalties on PAYE as this is not income tax to the employer. Losses can only be used to offset income tax penalties as losses are, as defined in the Income Tax Act 1994, “available to be offset against assessable income”. Therefore, as penalties which relate to anything other than income tax are not assessable income items, the losses cannot be offset against them. Wholly-owned companies Section IG 10(1A) provides that a company in a wholly- owned group of companies may apply a loss in payment of a shortfall penalty imposed on any company in that group. Loss must be available in year penalty imposed It should be noted that losses must be available in the year in which the shortfall penalty is imposed. For example, if adjustments are made to the 1998 return and penalties imposed in 2000, losses must be available in 2000. Loss conversion Individuals When dealing with an individual the lowest marginal tax rate applying to the taxpayer in the year in which the shortfall penalty exists is the rate used to calculate the offset value of the losses. Other entities When dealing with a company or other taxable entity the tax rate applying to the taxpayer in the year in which the shortfall penalty exists is the rate used to calculate the offset value of the losses. Loss not available for future offset Section IG 10(3)(b) provides that if losses are used in this way, they are not available to be offset against future income. Summary Under Section IG 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 a taxpayer in a loss situation can elect to use losses to pay shortfall penalties. Losses can be used only to offset against shortfall penalties on income tax shortfalls. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 26 Voluntary disclosures Standard Practice Statement INV-250 Introduction The voluntary disclosure system reflects the savings to the Revenue from voluntary admissions of irregularities, and other benefits of taxpayer co-operation with Inland Revenue There are two general types of voluntary disclosure: •voluntary disclosure prior to notification of an audit •voluntary disclosure after notification of an audit A taxpayer can also make a disclosure of the tax position taken in their tax return at the time of filing. Legislation Section 141G of the Tax Administration Act 1994: Reduction in penalty for voluntary disclosure – (1)A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141E may be reduced if, in the Commis- sioner’s opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either – (a)Before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “pre-notification disclosure”); or (b)After the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “post-notification disclosure”). (2)The Commissioner may from time to time – (a)Specify the information required for a full voluntary disclosure; and (b)The form in which it must be provided. (3)The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced – (a)For pre-notification disclosure is 75% (b)For post-notification disclosure is 40%. (4)The taxpayer is deemed to have been notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investiga- tion has started, if – (a)The taxpayer; or (b)An officer of the taxpayer; or (c)A shareholder of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is a close company; or (d)A tax advisor acting for the taxpayer; or (e)A partner in partnership with the taxpayer; or (f)A person acting for or on behalf of or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer, – is notified of the pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started. (5)An audit or investigation starts at the earlier of – (a)The end of the first interview an officer of the Depart- ment has with the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s repre- sentative after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and (b)The time when – (i)An officer of the Department inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and (ii)The taxpayer is notified of the inspection. Voluntary disclosure methods Taxpayers can make a voluntary disclosure in any one of the following ways: •by a visit •by telephone call •by letter to the Inland Revenue •during an interview Visits and telephone calls If a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure by visiting or telephoning Inland Revenue, as much information as possible will need to be provided by the taxpayer. Any officer is able to record a voluntary disclosure when a taxpayer comes into or contacts Inland Revenue. All verbal disclosures must be followed up in writing and, if possible, signed by the taxpayer. Written disclosure If a voluntary disclosure is received in writing between the time of notification and the first interview then it will be referred to the appropriate office for the auditor who is conducting the audit or investigation. The auditor must incorporate this as correspondence relating to the audit or investigation. Acknowledgement should be made to the taxpayer that the disclosure has been received. During the first interview Disclosures made during the first interview will be accepted by the investigator. The investigator must consider whether the disclosure is complete and reveals all the relevant information necessary to ascertain the correct tax position. The disclosure will then be submit- ted along with the audit report, to the team leader for approval. Notification Subsection 141G(4) provides that a taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation, if any of the following persons have received notification: •the taxpayer; •an officer of the taxpayer; •a shareholder of the taxpayer (for close companies); •a tax adviser acting for the taxpayer; •a partner in a partnership; •a person acting for, or on behalf of, or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 27 An officer includes a director, secretary, receiver or liquidator. It does not include an employee. Time of notification Notification will be the earlier of the date of receipt by the taxpayer or agent of the written advice or the time of a telephone call advising the commencement of the audit or investigation. If the exact time of receipt of the written notice becomes crucial, it will be ascertained from the expected time for the mail to reach its destination as prescribed by sec- tion 14(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Any telephone call advising of an audit or investigation will be followed up by written advice as soon as possible, preferably the same day. Unannounced visits In the case of Registration Checks and other unan- nounced visits, the date of first contact with the taxpayer will be the date of notification. Date an audit or investigation starts Subsection (5) states that a tax audit or investigation starts at the earlier of: •the end of the first interview an Inland Revenue officer has with either the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s repre- sentative, after the taxpayer receives the notice; or •the time when: –an officer of Inland Revenue inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives notice, and –the time the taxpayer is notified of the inspection. Taxpayer’s representative present at interview If the taxpayer’s representative is present at the first interview, but not the taxpayer, the taxpayer is not later able to claim the benefit of a post-notification disclosure, even if the agent was not given any information by the taxpayer from which to make a disclosure. Disclosure by a subsidiary of a company An audit of a parent company, or a subsidiary of that company, may necessitate the audit of other subsidiaries within the group. In such cases, disclosure would depend upon which entity had been notified. If the parent company had received notification that the audit was restricted to that entity, then any disclosure made by the subsidiary is voluntary disclosure prior to notification of an audit. However, if another company in the group has been notified that the audit is being extended, any disclosure made by that other company would be considered a disclosure after notification of an audit. When a company has a branch or branches, they are considered to have been notified at the same time as the company, as they are part of the company and not separate entities. Full disclosure The disclosure must be full and complete. This does not necessarily mean disclosing the discrepancies to the last dollar but does require the providing of enough informa- tion to enable the investigator to make an assessment. Each case will have to be considered on its own merits. If a taxpayer is not able to make a full disclosure at the first point of contact with Inland Revenue, they may still make the disclosure and advise the Commissioner when the remaining information will be provided. It is consid- ered that where taxpayers require further time to obtain more information, then adequate time should be given. Minimum details required To satisfy full and complete disclosure, the following minimum details must be provided: •taxpayer’s details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth, contact telephone and contact times); •the nature of the errors or omissions •an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred; •enough information to enable an assessment to be made; •a declaration and signature by taxpayer, if possible. Several tax shortfalls All tax shortfalls must be considered separately. If there are two tax shortfalls, one being the subject of voluntary disclosure and the other being detected by an audit, then the one detected by the audit will not come within the voluntary disclosure regime. However, the other tax shortfall will still come within the voluntary disclosure regime, assuming full and complete disclosure of that tax shortfall. If the items are identical or similar they must be treated as one tax shortfall. Therefore, this would result in the taxpayer not satisfying the requirements of a full and complete voluntary disclosure. Disclosure of another tax type If an audit is being carried out on one tax type and the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure regarding another tax type, and they have not been notified that the other tax type is being audited, then the taxpayer will qualify for voluntary disclosure prior to notification of an audit. Disclosure of another period It is common for a notice of intention to carry out an audit to state that a particular year/period is to be audited but previous years/periods may be looked at if neces- sary. The year/period referred to only is examined in the first instance. If some matter arising from the audit continued on page 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 28 Section 108A contains a similar provision relating to GST. Disclosure at time of filing A taxpayer can make a disclosure of the tax position taken, in relation to an unacceptable interpretation or abusive tax position, in their tax return at the time of filing. Provided the disclosure is adequate and the position taken is not frivolous, taxpayers will be eligible for a reduced penalty if they are found to have an unacceptable interpretation. For the disclosure to be effective, the taxpayer must provide full and relevant arguments for the tax position taken. Disclosure form Disclosure will be required to be made on a specified form, IR 282B. Information required The following information will be required in order to satisfy the requirement of adequate disclosure: •taxpayer’s details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth, contact telephone and contact times); •overview of the position taken; •interpretation of case law on the subject, contents of any tax opinions, legal articles and related material; •any relevant Inland Revenue public ruling; •a calculation, where necessary, to show the position and how it was arrived at; •a declaration and signature by taxpayer. Filing of disclosure forms The disclosure form will be required to be filed in conjunction with the return in which the particular tax position has been taken. For E-Filed returns the disclo- sure form will need to be forwarded separately to Inland Revenue. Reduction rates The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced is: •for pre-notification disclosure – 75% •for post-notification disclosure – 40% The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for adequate disclosure at the time of filing is 75 percent. No prosecution or publication of name If a voluntary disclosure is full and complete: •there will not be a prosecution, and •there will be no publication of name for any shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act or for taking an abusive tax position. means that earlier years/periods are to be examined, the taxpayer is advised by the investigator that this will be done. If the investigator had not advised the taxpayer that an earlier year/period is being examined, then the taxpayer is able to make a pre-notification disclosure for that year/period. Disclosure forms The voluntary disclosure form is IR 282A and covers both pre-notification and post-notification disclosures. Signing of disclosure form Where possible the taxpayer should sign the disclosure form. However, an unsigned disclosure will still be accepted. Although it is desirable for the protection of both the taxpayer and the department that disclosures be in writing and signed by the taxpayer, if the taxpayer will not do this an unsigned or even a verbal disclosure may be accepted. Letter sufficient A letter sent to Inland Revenue will suffice as a declara- tion without the need for the taxpayer to also complete the form, assuming it covers the required information sufficiently. Amendments to returns Section 113 provides the Commissioner with the broad power to amend assessments to “ensure the correctness thereof”. An amendment under this provision is appropriate to assess previously undisclosed income which is advised by a taxpayer. The provision may also be used to reduce an assessment where an error in the assessment is apparent on the face of the claim. For example, arith- metical errors or unclaimed rebates; claims which, had they been made at the appropriate time, would have been accepted without further consideration. If the disclosed income is non-contentious, an adjust- ment may be made under section 113 and the disputes resolution process will not apply. Time bar and reopening assessments Before assessments are issued following a voluntary disclosure, the effect of section 108 is to be considered. Section 108 (as amended) provides that where a tax- payer has furnished a tax return and has been assessed for tax, the amount of the assessment may not be increased more than four years from the end of the income year in which the return was furnished. However, the Commissioner may form an opinion to reopen the assessment outside the time bar if the return either: •is fraudulent or wilfully misleading; or •omits all mention of income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source. from page 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 29 Summary A taxpayer may make a disclosure either before he or she receives the first notice that an audit or investigation is to be undertaken (“pre-notification disclosure”), after the first notification but before the audit or investigation starts (“post-notification disclosure”) or at the time of filing a tax return. The disclosure will result in a specific reduction in the applicable rate of shortfall penalty. The Commissioner may at any time specify the informa- tion required for a full voluntary disclosure and advise the form in which it must be provided.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995).

New Zealand Automobile Association’s customer loyalty programme Product Ruling - BR Prd 98/7 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, CH 3 and CI 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The New Zealand Automobile Association (“NZAA”) intends to establish a customer loyalty programme (“the Programme”) to benefit its Members and wishes to involve BP Oil NZ Ltd (“BP”) in the establishment, operation and management of the Programme which will be known as “AA Rewards”. The Programme will reward individual Members. Members making qualifying purchases from the NZAA, BP, BP-branded sites, AA participants and selected retailers will receive points entitling them to discounts in respect of future pur- chases. Once a certain level of points has been accumulated, a coupon will be issued enabling that Member to a discount on future purchases. Coupons issued will be non-transferable and unable to be exchanged for cash. If a Member does not accumulate the required level of points prior to the Mem- ber’s next AA subscription renewal, that Member may choose to utilise the benefit of those points towards reducing that Member’s subscription fee. The points will expire if not utilised after a given period of time. Other facts of the Arrangement are as set out in the application and accompany- ing information dated 6 August 1997. This Ruling applies to the entitlements received by Members under the Pro- gramme. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the following assumptions: •That all Members receiving benefits under the Programme are New Zealand resident individuals, and that the Arrangement will be implemented in the manner set out in the application. •The entitlements to Members under the Programme are non-transferable and non-assignable. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 31 •There is no assignment of entitlements by a corporate member to employees. •For the purposes of FBT: •Members are individual AA cardholders. Entitlements received by Mem- bers are not through corporate or manufacturing Membership. •There is no arrangement between the Member’s employer and AA Rewards Operations Ltd (“AAROL”) for any benefit to be provided for or granted to that Member. •In respect of an AAROL employee, AAROL does not: 1.impose an obligation on the employee to be an AA Member; and 2.provide the means to the employee to accumulate points under the Programme (for example by refunding or paying for purchases from which that employee accumulates points) and require the employee to take advantage of this. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •No gross income arises under section CD 5 or section CH 3 for Members when they accumulate points or redeem points or coupons for rewards under the Programme. •Employers of Members are not liable for FBT on any benefits which employ- ees may obtain through the Programme under section CI 1. This extends to benefits obtained by a Member as a result of that Member accumulating points through business expenditure. •Where a Member’s employer pays a Member’s membership fee, FBT will apply to the payment of the membership fee but not to any entitlements received by that Member under the Programme. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 2 March 1998 to 28 February 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on this 2nd day of March 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Payments under the Human Rights Act 1993 for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings - assessability Public Ruling BR Pub 98/2 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, CH 3, and the definition of “mon- etary remuneration” in section OB 1. continued on page 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 32 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/2 (“the Ruling”). Background Public Ruling BR Pub 97/3 on compensation payments made under the Employment Contracts Act 1991 for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings was published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Nine, No.3 (March 1997). BR Pub 97/3 concluded that such payments did not form part of the gross income of the taxpayer. The Commissioner has been asked to make a ruling on similar payments made under the Human Rights Act 1993. Under the Human Rights Act 1993 people can make a complaint to the Human Rights Commission (“the Commission”) regarding breaches of that Act. If the Commission is unable to settle the complaint, the matter may proceed to the Complaints Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”). The Human Rights Act provides protection for people in areas of public life against discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, religious or ethical belief, race, colour, ethnic or national origins, age, disability, politi- cal opinion, employment status, family status, and sexual orientation. The Tribunal is an independent body that hears and determines complaints that have been made to the Human Rights Commission, the Race Relations Office, the Privacy Commissioner, and the Health and Disability Commissioner which have been unable to be resolved. The Tribunal has the power of a court similar to the District Court, and its decisions can be enforced in the District Court if parties fail to comply with its orders or directions. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: •The payment of an award of damages to a complainant or aggrieved person for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 for breaches of Part II of that Act by the Com- plaints Review Tribunal where the complaint involves an employer/em- ployee relationship; or •The making of a payment to a complainant or aggrieved person for humilia- tion, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings pursuant to an out of court settle- ment genuinely based on the complainant’s rights to damages under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 for breaches of Part II of that Act where the complaint involves an employer/employee relationship. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Payments for damages awarded for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are not “mon- etary remuneration” in terms of the definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Consequently, such payments do not form part of the gross income of the employee under section CH 3. •Such payments for damages are not gross income under ordinary concepts under section CD 5. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10th day of March 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 98/2 from page 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 33 Legislation Section 86(1) and (2) of the Human Rights Act provides a number of remedies for the Tribunal when the Tribunal determines that a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of the Human Rights Act has been committed: (1)In any proceedings before the Complaints Review Tribunal brought by the Proceedings Commissioner or the com- plainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person, the plaintiff may seek such of the remedies described in subsection (2) of this section, as he or she thinks fit. (2)If in any such proceedings the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has committed a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act, it may grant one or more of the following remedies: (a)A declaration that the defendant has committed a breach of this Act: (b)An order restraining the defendant from continuing or repeating the breach, or from engaging in, or causing or permitting others to engage in, conduct of the same kind as that constituting the breach, or conduct of any similar kind specified in the order: (c)Damages in accordance with section 88 of this Act: (d)An order that the defendant perform any acts specified in the order with a view to redressing any loss or damage suffered by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person as a result of the breach: (e)A declaration that any contract entered into or per- formed in contravention of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act is an illegal contract: (f)Relief in accordance with the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 in respect of any such contract to which the defendant and the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person are parties: (g)Such other relief as the Tribunal thinks fit. Section 88(1) of the Human Rights Act provides the circumstances in which damages may be awarded under the Act, including damages’ payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings: In any proceedings under sections 83(1) or section 83(4) of this Act, the Tribunal may award damages against the defend- ant for a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act in respect of any one or more of the following: (a)Pecuniary loss suffered as a result of, and expenses reasonably incurred by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person for the purpose of, the transaction of activity out of which the breach arose: (b)Loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, which the complainant or, as the case may be, the ag- grieved person might reasonably have been expected to obtain but for the breach: (c)Humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person. Part II of the Human Rights Act sets out what constitutes “unlawful discrimination” under that Act. Section 21 sets out the general prohibited grounds of discrimina- tion, and sections 22 to 74 go on to deal with discrimina- tion in specific situations. The Ruling considers whether such payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee are “monetary remuneration”. Paragraph (a) of the definition of “monetary remunera- tion” in section OB 1 states: “Monetary remuneration” ...means any salary, wage, allow- ance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;... Section CH 3 states that “all monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income”. Section CD 5 also states that “the gross income of a person includes any amount that is included in gross income under ordinary concepts”. Application of the legislation If payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings, under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 were “monetary remuneration”, they would be included under section CH 3 as gross income. They would be included in the calculation of “net income” under section BC 6, and would consequently form part of “taxable income” as calculated under section BC 7. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” to include any “other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the tax- payer...”. Payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are a benefit in money. The issue is, therefore, whether these payments are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of” the recipient. While many of the categories of discrimination in Part II may relate, directly or indirectly, to an employer/ employee relationship, it is clear that many of them are intended to apply to much wider situations. Conse- quently, in many instances of complaints under the Human Rights Act, payments awarded will be com- pletely outside any employment relationship and will clearly not be “in respect of or in relation to employ- ment”. In such cases payments under section 88(1)(c) will not fall within the definition of “monetary remu- neration” and will not be included in the gross income of the taxpayer under section CH 3. The Ruling does not consider such situations. However, it is likely that complaints heard by the Tribunal under the Human Rights Act often will involve an employee/employer relationship. The question to be answered in the Ruling, therefore, is whether payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 where the complaint involves an employee/employer relationship are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. continued on page 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 34 paid to workers employed by the uninsured company were not amounts due “in respect of” workers’ compen- sation under the Companies Act. At page 561 Mason J observed that: ... as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to “in respect of” depends very much on the context in which it is found. Stephen J also discussed the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”, noting at pages 553-554 that it was capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity, and went on to say: Were the phrase devoid of significant context, it could, I think, be taken to be descriptive of the relationship between the present indebtedness owed to the State Government Insurance Office and the subject matter of workers’ compensation. However a context does exist which is in my view sufficient to confine the operation of s 292(1)(c) to bounds too narrow to be of service to the appellant. In TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190, certain payments were made to a New Zealand distributor by its overseas parent in relation to repairs which had to be made to cars sold to the New Zealand subsidiary and then sold to dealers. The issue was whether the payments were zero-rated. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was relevant. Part of the definition of “consideration” states: ...any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services ... The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: A sub-issue is whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer (MC) was made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the repair work in the sense required by the definition of “consideration” in s 2 of the Act. ... Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, commonsense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, i.e, whether the link is strong enough. Not all payments to employees that have a connection with their work are within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. In Fraser v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,356, at page 12,363, Doogue J in the High Court said: There is no dispute that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” are words of the widest possible scope: see Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 at page 11,306, and Smith v FC of T 87 ATC 4883; (1987) 164 CLR 513; (1987) 19 ATR 274. Mr Harley does, however, submit, correctly, that it does not follow that all payments made are necessarily income and refers, for example, to reimbursement payments. In FC of T v Rowe (1995) ATC 4,691 the taxpayer was employed as an engineer for the Livingston Shire Council. As a result of a number of complaints against him he was suspended. An inquiry was commenced, and he incurred legal costs as a result of engaging counsel to The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” The Court of Appeal has endorsed a very wide meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. In Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, where lump sum payments had been made by Shell to employees who transferred at the request of Shell, the Court discussed the relevant part of the definition of “monetary remuneration”. McKay J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 11,306: The words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. Although McKay J acknowledged that the payments in Shell were not made under the contract of employment in that case, this did not mean that the employees received the payment outside the employee relationship. The learned Judge had earlier referred to the fact that the payments were not expressly provided under the em- ployees’ written employment contracts, but were made pursuant to Shell’s employment policy as a matter of discretion. They were still made “because he or she is an employee”. Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject-matters to which the words refer. Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. Context may affect the meaning However, many cases have demonstrated that the meaning to be given to the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” may vary according to the context in which it appears. In State Government Insurance Office v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in determining whether the debt due to the Government Insurance Office fell within section 292(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1961-1975 (Q.) as “amounts ... due in respect of workers’ compensation under any law relating to workers’ compensation accrued before the relevant date”. The Court held that amounts which could be recovered by the Government Insurance Office from an uninsured company pursuant to section 8(5) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1916-1974 (Q.) for money from page 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 35 defend himself against dismissal during the course of the inquiry. The taxpayer was cleared of any charges of misconduct but was dismissed a year later. The taxpayer claimed his legal costs as a deduction. Although the Council refused to reimburse the taxpayer for his legal costs, the Queensland government subsequently made an ex gratia payment. The Full Federal Court considered, amongst other things, whether the ex gratia payment constituted assessable income. By majority, the Court concluded that the payment was not assessable under section 25(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as income in accordance with ordinary concepts, nor was it assessable under section 26(e) of that Act as being compensation “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to” any employment. Accordingly, Burchett and Drummond JJ (with Beaumont J dissenting) held that the payment was not assessable. Burchett J held that the payment was not a reward for the taxpayer’s services but was a recognition for the wrong done to him. The payments were not remuneration but a repara- tion, and they were not sufficiently related to the per- formance of income-earning activities. On the same reasoning, it was too remote from the employment to be caught by section 26(e). Further, the payment was not assessable under section 26(e) because the employer/ employee relationship between the Council and the taxpayer was merely part of the background facts against which the ex gratia payment was made. In the Australian case of FCT v Dixon (1954) 5 AITR 443, the taxpayer received payments from his prior employer topping up his military pay. It would appear from the judgment that the Australian Commis- sioner argued that even a slight relationship to employ- ment was sufficient to satisfy the test in section 26(e) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \[which made assessable certain sums granted to the taxpayer “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment...”.\]. This argument was rejected by Dixon CJ and Williams J, who stated at page 446 that: We are not prepared to give effect to this view of the operation of s.26(e) ...There can, of course, be no doubt that the sum of £104 represented an allowance, gratuity or benefit allowed or given to the taxpayer by Macdonald, Hamilton and Company. Our difficulty is in agreeing with the view that it was allowed or given to him in respect of, or in relation directly or indi- rectly to, any employment of, or services rendered by him ...We are not prepared to give s.26(e) a construction which makes it unnecessary that the allowance, gratuity, compensa- tion, benefit, bonus or premium shall in any sense be a recompense or consequence of the continued or contemporane- ous existence of the relation of employer and employee or a reward for services rendered given either during the employ- ment or at or in consequence of its termination. In the same case, at page 450, McTiernan J stated that: The words of paragraph (e) are wide, but, I think, not wide enough to prevent an employer from giving money or money’s worth to an employee continuing in his service or leaving it, without incurring liability to tax in respect of the gift. The relationship of employer and employee is a matter of contract. The contractual relations are not so total and all embracing that there cannot be personal or social relations between employer and employee. A payment arising from those relations may have no connexion with the donee’s employment. These principles have also been applied by the courts in cases involving contracts for services. In Scott v FCT (1969) 10 AITR 367, Windeyer J in the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the words “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him” in section 26(e) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1961. The case concerned a solicitor who received a gift of £10,000 from a grateful client. Windeyer J stated at page 374 that the meaning of the words of the legislation “must be sought in the nature of the topic concerning which they are used”. Windeyer J at page 376 referred to a passage from the judgment of Kitto J in Squatting Investment Co Ltd v FCT (1953) 5 AITR 496, at 524, where Kitto J (speaking of certain English cases) said: The distinction these decisions have drawn between taxable and non-taxable gifts is the distinction between, on the one hand, gifts made in relation to some activity or occupation of the donee of an income-producing character ... and, on the other hand, gifts referable to the attitude of the donor person- ally to the donee personally. Adopting this as a general principle, his Honour held that the £10,000 was not given or received as remunera- tion for services rendered and it did not form part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. The nature and context of the payments Under section 88 of the Human Rights Act, damages may be awarded by the Tribunal for a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of that Act. As discussed above, breaches of Part II will not necessarily be in an em- ployee/employer situation. If a claim is brought in the Tribunal which does not involve an employee and employer relationship it is clear that payment under section 88(1)(c) cannot be described as monetary remuneration. Where the complaint brought before the Tribunal does occur in the context of an employee/employer relation- ship, the connection of the employment relationship with payments under the Human Rights Act is tenuous. The Human Rights Act is not “employment legislation”, although it may often operate in the employment context. Payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the em- ployment relationship. Rather the payments would be in the nature of reparation for a wrong done to the com- plainant and so would not be in respect of employment. Payments of damages awards under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 differ markedly from the situation in Shell v CIR. In that case at page 11,306, McKay J said: continued on page 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 36 Out of court settlements The Commission endeavours to settle disputes between parties and sometimes, the parties negotiate a settlement before the dispute is referred to the Tribunal. The settlement agreement may state that the payment is for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. In return for the complainant or aggrieved person surren- dering his or her rights under the Human Rights Act, the other party will agree to pay a sum of money. There should be no difference in the tax treatment of the payments dependent on whether or not the parties use the Tribunal. A payment can be for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the complainant or aggrieved person whether the Tribunal is involved or not. Shams The Ruling will not apply to payments which are akin to sham payments. A sham is a transaction set up to conceal the true intention of the parties and is inherently ineffective. The nature of a sham was discussed by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Invest- ment Ltd \[1967\] 1 All ER 518 at 528 where he stated: I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the “sham”, which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. Richardson J, in the New Zealand case of Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, stated that the “essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged” in a sham situation. It is noteworthy that, in the recent Taxation Review Authority decision, Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603, Judge Barber stated at page 7,606: Of course, seemingly excessive allocations to compensation for feelings injury should be reopened by the IRD. If the parties to an agreement agree to characterise or describe payments as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings when they are in reality for lost wages, this transaction would be a sham which would be open to challenge by the Commissioner. Further, as provided by section 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and section 136(16) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the onus of proof in a hearing regarding the assessability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer. It is true ...that the payment is not made under the contract of employment....It is nevertheless paid to an employee only because he or she is an employee, and is paid to compensate for the loss incurred in having to change the employee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the company. (Emphasis added) Thus, in the Shell case, the employees received the payments as employees, and in order to compensate for the loss sustained as a result of the employment-related relocation. The Commissioner considers payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act to be too remote from the employment relationship to be within the definition of monetary remuneration. If a complaint is brought in the Tribunal which involves an employee and an employer, the employment relationship in such instances is merely part of the background facts against which the damages payments are made. The payments are not made “in respect of or in relation to the employ- ment or service of the taxpayer”. Income under ordinary concepts Payments for damages made under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act are not “gross income under ordinary concepts” under section CD 5. Although the legislation does not define “gross income under ordinary concepts”, a great number of cases have identified the concept by reference to such characteris- tics as periodicity, recurrence, and regularity, or by its resulting from business activities, the deliberate seeking of profit, or the performance of services. It is clear that payments under section 88(1)(c) will not generally be made periodically or regularly, or generally recur. Nor as we have seen above, are they compensation for services. Capital receipts do not form part of “gross income” unless there is a specific legislative provision to the contrary. And by analogy with common law damages, damages payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act are of a capital nature as Barber DJ acknowl- edged in Case L92, where he stated at page 1,536 that: I appreciate only too well that it is possible to interpret the evidence as showing that the $7,179.30 was formulated as a payment in the nature of common law damages for human hurt and breach and unfairness ... I appreciate that the latter concepts are akin more to payments of capital than to wage revenue. from page 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 37 Prudential Assurance Company NZ Ltd’s Income Protection Plan Product Ruling BR Prd 98/5 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as product ruling BR Prd 98/4, except that 98/4 has an application period from 11 January 1997 to 30 September 1997. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, BD 2(1)(b), BD 2(2)(b), and CB 5(1)(h). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the purchase by an individual of an insurance product known as the Premier Income Protection Plan Policy (“the policy”) issued by the Prudential Assurance Company. The policy is taken out by an individual and it provides disability cover in re- spect of that individual policy owner only (except for the partner care benefit which also provides cover in respect of the policy owner’s partner). The policy contains the following benefits: Total disability benefit This benefit is paid monthly if a person is totally disabled as defined in the policy. The total disability benefit is the lesser of: •the maximum percentage (defined in the policy) of the pre-disablement income (highest average monthly earned income that the policy owner earned in any consecutive 12-month period over the three years prior to the sickness or accident which caused the disablement); or •the monthly benefit stipulated in the policy schedule (determined according to the policy holder’s income at the time that the policy is taken out). This benefit is reduced by continuing earned income (defined in the policy) from certain sources. Partial disability benefit This benefit is paid monthly to a person who has been totally disabled for an initial period and partially disabled for the remainder of the relevant period. A partially disabled person is generally a person who can work in a reduced capac- ity or a reduced number of hours. This benefit is calculated as follows: (pre-disablement income – current income) xmonthly total disability benefit pre-disablement income In this calculation the total disability benefit is not reduced by continuing earned income. Permanent disability benefit This is an additional benefit that is paid monthly to a person who is permanently disabled (as defined in the policy). It is one-third of the monthly total disability benefit. continued on page 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 38 Extra cash benefit This is a benefit paid in addition to the first three months total disability benefit, other than in cases of permanent disablement. It is one-third of the monthly total disability benefit. Home care benefit This is paid monthly for up to six months, in addition to the total disability benefit, where the policy owner requires full-time care at home or in a hospital. If the care is provided by a person whose profession it is to provide such care, the amount paid is the lesser of $2,500 or the cost of the care. If the care is provided by a family member who has given up work, the amount paid is the lesser of $2,500 or 75 percent of the pre-tax income of that family member. No part of any premium paid for the policy is referable to this benefit. Partner care benefit This benefit is optional under the policy, and where applicable is paid monthly to a policy owner whose non-working partner (as defined in the policy) becomes totally disabled and requires full-time care at home. If the care is provided by a person whose profession it is to provide such care the amount paid is the lesser of $2,500 or the cost of the care. If the care is provided by a family member who has given up work, the amount paid is the lesser of $2,500 or 75 percent of the pre-tax income of that family member. If a policy holder chooses to have this benefit, an additional premium is payable in respect of the benefit. Rehabilitation benefit This benefit is paid to a person who is either partially or totally disabled and who incurs expenses (as defined in the policy) in attempting to regain the ability to work again. The benefit is the lesser of the cost of the expenses incurred or 6 times the monthly benefit (reduced by any amounts that are otherwise reimbursable). No part of any premium paid for the policy is referable to this benefit. Vocational retraining benefit This is an extension of the rehabilitation benefit and is paid so that the policy owner can undertake a vocational retraining programme. The benefit is the lesser of the cost of the vocational retraining programme and 6 times the monthly benefit (reduced by any amounts that are otherwise reimbursable). No part of any premium paid for the policy is referable to this benefit. Assumptions made by the Commissioner There are no assumptions made by the Commissioner. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The total disability benefit, partial disability benefit, extra cash benefit, and permanent disability benefit are gross income under section CD 5 and are not exempt income under section CB 5(1)(h). from page 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 39 •The home care benefit, optional partner care benefit, rehabilitation benefit, and vocational retraining benefit are not gross income under section CD 5. •Where the optional partner care benefit has not been effected by the policy owner, then the total premium payable under the policy is deductible under section BD 2(1)(b). •Where the optional partner care benefit has been effected by the policy owner, then the portion of premium payable in respect of that benefit is not deduct- ible under section BD 2(1)(b), but the remaining portion of the premium is deductible under section BD 2(1)(b). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 11 January 1997 to 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of February 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 40 Policy statement Introduction This article restates Inland Revenue’s policy (previously set out in TIB Volume Five, No.3 of September 1993) on filing the IR 10 Accounts Information form instead of financial statements with a tax return and the inter- related arrangements covering disclosure obligations. Background The IR 10 is an integral part of Inland Revenue’s E-File system. We use it for providing information to the Statistics Department and to build up data for audit case selection. Accountants and taxpayers who file returns manually (i.e., who don’t use E-File) may either send in an IR 10 or a set of financial statements with tax returns. How- ever, we are encouraging accountants to use both the E-File system and the IR 10. There have been some concerns with the IR 10. Specifi- cally, there is a lack of information disclosure when using an IR 10 compared with the information disclosed in the financial statements. This could affect how section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies to reassessments after the four year time limit has passed. Problem Income shown in statements, but not in IR 10 A taxpayer who filed an IR 10 instead of financial statements may be disadvantaged if an audit/investiga- tion of back year returns reveals a discrepancy. If such a discrepancy is in an item that is recorded in the financial statements (obtained during the audit/investigation), but which did not need to be recorded on the IR 10, sec- tion 108 could be used to reopen the statute-barred assessment with the argument that full disclosure was not given in the return for that particular item. This problem does not exist when financial statements are filed with the tax return. If a reassessment is not issued for the item before the four year time limit has passed, then Inland Revenue is statute-barred from re- opening that assessment because full disclosure was made to Inland Revenue with the return. All mention of income omitted The details of income to be recorded on the IR 10 do not cover all income sources. Two situations can occur where there will be omission of income when filing a return (either manually or through the E-File system) with an IR 10. •If an item of assessable income did not have to be recorded on the IR 10, but has been recorded in the financial statements. •The income is omitted completely from the financial statements, and is not included when calculating taxable income. Policy Inland Revenue will be applying the following policy when auditing/investigating back year returns which were filed with an IR 10: If an audit/investigation reveals an item incorrectly recorded in the financial statements which is deemed to be either assessable income or non-deductible expendi- ture, but which did not have to be so recorded on the IR 10, then – •If no conclusive evidence is held to prove a fraudulent or wilful misleading by the taxpayer, no statute-barred back year assessment will be re-opened under sec- tion 108. •If there is conclusive evidence that a taxpayer intended to fraudulently or wilfully mislead, then section 108 will be applied to re-open statute-barred assessments. •If an audit/investigation reveals an omission of income then - –If the omission is because disclosure was not required on an IR 10, (but the income was recorded in the financial statements which were not filed with Inland Revenue), then this will not be a reason for re-opening a statute-barred assessment. –If the income was omitted from the financial statements then section 108 may be applied to re- open a statute-barred assessment. In some cases there is no provision on the IR 10 to show an item, but it must still be disclosed in a Disclosure Return (IR 4A) covering “inter-related arrangements” or in a Property Disclosure Return (IR 4T). If the profit on an item has been disclosed in either of these returns, there is not an omission of all mention of the item. This means there will not be reason to reopen an assessment. This is the case whether or not the profit in the disclo- sure return is recorded in the IR 10. If a Disclosure Return (IR 4A) or a Property Disclosure Return (IR 4T) has not been furnished, the above policy on income which is not mentioned will apply. Note: If someone is a party to a financial arrangement which must be disclosed to Inland Revenue under section 60 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, s/he must file a Disclosure Return (IR 4A) or a Property Disclosure Return (IR 4T) as appropriate. However, this return won’t have to be filed if there is a reporting exemption for the arrangement.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Application for charitable status by Christian counsellors Section CB 4 - Non-profit bodies’ and charities’ exempt income: An organisa- tion is considering applying to Inland Revenue for charitable status. Under its deed, the organisation’s central activity is the provision of Christian counselling to its members, their families and friends. Its focus is on giving practical counsel- ling and advice in a Christian manner, rather than on promoting religion as such. A representative of the organisation has asked for Inland Revenue’s comments on the likelihood of a request for charitable status being approved. The approval of an organisation as a charitable organisation confers considerable tax benefits on the organisation and people who donate money to it. Under section CB 4, all income derived by an organisation carried on for charita- ble purposes is exempt from tax. When the income of the charitable institution is derived from any business, the exemption applies only to that portion of the income applied for charitable purposes within New Zealand. To qualify for the exemption, the real or fundamental purpose of the business and any independent purpose must be of a charitable nature. The expression “charitable purpose” includes every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community. The activities of all approved charities must fall within one or more of these classes. In addition, there are three requirements that must be met before charita- ble status will be granted. The organisation must be: •For public purposes: its aims must be public rather than private. •For the public benefit: it must benefit the public or a large part of the commu- nity and not just particular individuals. •Able to be controlled by the court if necessary. To represent “part of the community” the people who benefit from the charitable purpose cannot be small in number, and the relationship which enables them to benefit from the charity must not be their relationship with a particular person. In this case, the activities of the organisation do not meet the prescribed criteria. Religion is not being promoted nor does the provision of Christian counselling benefit the community as a whole, or an appreciable portion of it. The organisa- tion would fail in its formal request for charitable status approval. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 42 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on beneficiaries’ expenses Section 20(3) - Deductions from output tax: The trustee in a family trust has written to Inland Revenue requesting an adjustment of the trust’s GST returns. The trust’s taxable activity is farming. The trustee has heard that the trust is able to claim GST input tax deductions in respect of the trust’s objects, which include the purchasing of educational services and supplies towards the maintenance and education of the beneficiaries. Section 20(3) allows a deduction from output tax (GST payable) of amounts paid or invoiced during a taxable period in relation to the supply of goods and serv- ices. In all cases the legislation requires that the goods and services must have been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The phrase “principal purpose” has been considered in a number of cases. The following definitions have been found to best describe the meaning of these words: “Principal” means the main or fundamental purpose. “Purpose” means the object or the end which the person has in mind or view. When considering whether goods or services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, reference is made to the taxpayer’s stated purpose, the actions of the taxpayer, and any other relevant facts. In Case P62 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,427 at p 4,446, Willy DJ observed: “\[T\]here will conventionally be a mix of evidence relating to the question of principal purpose. Some of that evidence will consist of what the \[taxpayer\] says was the intention at the relevant time. Some will consist of facts which may be called objective which illustrate how that stated intention was carried into ef- fect”. The trustee of the family trust was told that the evidence produced indicated that the principal purpose of purchasing the educational services and supplies was not for the purpose of making taxable supplies, but a private expense. As such, the trust was unable to claim an input tax deduction in respect of these pay- ments. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 43 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Motel assets resold – assessability of profits Case:TRA 96/11, 96/16, 96/22, 96/23, 96/50, 96/62 and 97/7 Decision date:15 January 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Profit from sale of motel chattels, bad debts Summary:Barber J found that it was not the Objector’s dominant purpose to resell the chattels at the time of purchasing the motel and therefore the profits from the resale of the chattels were not assessable. Facts:The Objectors, a husband and wife, purchased a motel business. Settlement was scheduled for 1 August 1993 and a manager was brought in to run the motel business until then. In July 1993 a real estate firm, which had a potential lessee, approached the Objectors. A 10 year lease was signed by the Objectors and lessee, with the chattels to be sold for $95,000. The Objectors claimed that the reason for the purchase was the motel’s excellent site, and that they had had no intention to sell the chattels or lease the motel business. The Commissioner assessed the profits from the sale of the chattels in the 1987 income year, on the basis that they were purchased with the intention of resale as part of the leasing of the motels. The Commissioner also disallowed a claim for bad debts. The Objector wife owned another motel business, which was leased to Mr and Mrs F. The Objector husband had advanced the lessees $144,500 when they purchased the motel business. An instrument by way of security secured this over the motel chattels. A further $22,000 was also advanced secured by a mortgage. In June 1990 the lessees vacated the motel premises and had removed some chattels. Because the Objector husband knew the financial circumstances of the lessees, he decided not to sue for the outstanding debt with the advice of his solicitor. Decision:Barber J followed CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346 in finding that the Objectors did not have sufficient intention of reselling the chattels when they purchased the motel. Accordingly the profits from the resale of the chattels was not assessable. Turning to the bad debts matter Barber J acknowledged that there was inconsist- ency in the evidence but found on the balance of probabilities that the bad debts were allowable as deductions as the words “written off” on a ledger card was sufficient to indicate that a debt had been written off as a bad debt. Accordingly the deductions were allowed. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 44 Assignment of joint venture rights – assessability of payment Case:Renouf Corporation Ltd, Kirkcaldie and Stains Ltd and Renouf Industries Ltd v CIR Decision date:24 February 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Assigning over rights to profits Summary:Justice Doogue found that a $2.75 million payment made by Renouf Property Developments Ltd to Renouf Corporation Ltd was not assessable income. Facts:Renouf Corporation Ltd (“RCL”) had a number of subsidiary companies which included Renouf Industries Ltd (‘RIL”) and Renouf Property Developments Ltd (“RPDL”). RCL was approached by Mainzeal Group Ltd, which was interested in developing a site owned by RCL. The site was transferred to a shelf company, Wellington Tower Ltd (“WTL”) with RCL and Mainzeal each taking half of the $1 shares in WTL. Pursuant to an agreement RCL assigned to RPDL “its rights under the Joint Venture Agreement to fifty percent of the future development profits arising from the development of that site” for the consideration of $2.75 million. The Commissioner included the payment of $2.75 million from RPDL to RCL pursu- ant to the agreement as assessable income in the hands of RCL. The Commis- sioner relied alternatively upon the provisions of section 65(2)(a), the third limb of section 65(2)(e), section 65(2)(1) and section 191(4)(A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 to support his view that the $2.75 million payment was assessable income. Decision:Justice Doogue took the view that RCL could only benefit from the enterprise by way of its shares, as it had no other right of recompense. Accordingly section 65(2)(a) had no application. He also cited McCelland v Federal Commis- sioner of Taxation \[1971\] 1 WLR 191 and Duff v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1982\] 2 NZLR 710 in relation to section 65(2)(e) third limb. His Honour held that he was satisfied by the Objectors that RCL was not a party to any scheme to develop the Jervois Quay site which could be said to come within the third limb of section 65(2)(e). Turning to section 65(2)(1) his Honour held that the Commissioner’s argument must fail in the same way as they had under section 65(2)(a) and (e). Justice Doogue held that section 191(4)(A) could have no application to the present case. Assets of former tax-exempt body sold at loss – apportioning deductibility of loss Case:New Zealand Apple & Pear Marketing Board v CIR Decision date:16 February 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Depreciation allowance for assets of former exempt body Summary:The High Court found that the Commissioner could not make an apportionment under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Facts:On 1 April 1998 the taxpayer changed from a tax-exempt statutory producer board to a taxpaying body. As part of this statutory change of status, section 197E(3) gave a method of fixing the opening book value of assets previ- ously used to earn exempt income. Rather than requiring a valuation of the IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) 45 assets, section 197E(3) directed the Commissioner in applying section 108, to have regard to the cost of the asset and all amounts that he would have allowed as a deduction if the asset had been used to earn assessable income. When the taxpayer sold assets at a loss, the Commissioner applied an apportionment formula to apportion the loss between the period of time it was used to earn exempt income and the period it was used to earn assessable income Decision:Justice Doogue rejected the application of the formula used by the Commis- sioner. His Honour found that the statutory calculation of the opening book value was used in substitution to a market valuation of the assets. As this was a statutory calculation to fix value, his Honour concluded it was not open to the Commissioner to go behind it. Justice Doogue did not accept s.197E(3) was spent once the opening book values were fixed but accepted the taxpayer’s substitution that the section continued to have effect on the application of s.108. Justice Doogue considered the decision in King Country Electric Power Board v CIR (1985) 17 NZTC 12,122 where such an apportionment was accepted under s.197C(3). The decision in King Country was distinguished on the basis of eviden- tial difference.

We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

The new rules result in the controlled foreign companies (CFC) and foreign investment funds (FIF) rules generally no longer applying to income derived by New Zealand resident companies on behalf of their non-resident shareholders. The amendments aim to improve the coherence of New Zealand’s international tax rules. Background In May last year, the Government issued a discussion document on conduit tax reform, which outlined the principles behind the reform and proposed a general reform mechanism. The reform package that has been enacted has remained broadly consistent with the mechanism outlined in the discussion document. Conduit investment is investment by a non-resident into a foreign company that is made through an intermediary company resident in a third country. A foreign investor who wishes to invest into a country other than New Zealand has two options. The first is to invest directly into that third country (or indirectly into that country through a country other than New Zealand). Because the income from the third country is then neither sourced in New Zealand nor derived by a New Zealand resident, it is generally accepted that New Zealand neither could nor should impose tax on the income. The alternative option is to invest into a New Zealand subsidiary that in turn invests into the third country. This is illustrated in the following diagram. Offshore New Zealand New Zealand subsidiary (the ‘conduit’) Foreign investor Foreign subsidiary Effective investment Investment flow Investment flow Income of foreign subsidiary taxed under CFC/FIF rules In this case, New Zealand imposes tax on the worldwide income of the New Zealand subsidiary. This will include the income of the foreign subsidiary, even though the foreign subsidiary (and hence its income) is ultimately owned by the foreign investor. The term “conduit taxation” is used to refer to this taxation by New Zealand of the foreign income derived by a New Zealand com- pany on behalf of its non-resident shareholders. New Zealand’s international tax rules aim to comprehen- sively tax New Zealand residents on their worldwide income as it accrues, whether that income is earned directly or indirectly through foreign entities. At the same time, the rules seek to tax non-residents on their New Zealand-sourced income. Two key components in the rules for taxing New Zealand residents are the CFC and FIF rules, which attribute the income earned by foreign entities back to their New Zealand owners as if those owners had earned the income directly. One problem with this approach, however, is that if these New Zealand owners were companies, there was, before the enactment of conduit reform, no distinction between companies that were owned by residents and those owned by non-residents. To the extent that the companies were owned by non- residents, therefore, the international tax rules had the effect of taxing non-residents on their non-New Zealand- sourced income, a result that was outside the intended effect of the rules. The taxation of conduit income – the foreign-sourced income earned by New Zealand companies on behalf of non-resident shareholders – was an unintended effect brought about by the interaction of a number of other policies. In addressing this effect, conduit tax reform has made New Zealand’s international tax rules more coherent. Conduit tax reform preserves the taxation of resident investors on their worldwide income (the policy underpinning the international tax rules), while relieving tax on non-residents’ foreign-sourced income. Key features •New subpart KH relieves the taxation of a New Zealand company on attributed foreign income derived from CFCs and FIF income calculated under the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods, to the extent the company is directly owned by non- resident shareholders. •New subpart MI introduces the new “conduit tax relief” (CTR) account, a memorandum account that will record the amount of relief given to a company. This account is to ensure that the relief is passed to non-resident shareholders on whose behalf it is given. •New subpart FH contains interest allocation rules to measure accurately the amount of conduit income derived by a New Zealand company. The rules apply only for the purposes of determining conduit tax relief. To minimise compliance costs, safe harbours ensure the rules apply only if a group has highly geared its New Zealand operations and a significant amount of conduit relief is involved. •Sections OE 7 and OE 8 introduce special rules that enable: –holding companies wholly owned by a single non-resident to elect to be treated as non-resident for the purposes of determining the conduit relief of other companies in which they hold interests of 10% or greater; and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 3 –conduit tax relief to be given to and passed on from a lower-tier company in a 100% chain of companies, to the extent the top-tier company is owned by non-residents. •The existing 15% rate of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on distributed income is retained. Application date The rules for determining relief from income tax on income derived from CFCs and FIF interests will apply from the start of the 1998/99 income year. The rules for determining relief from dividend withhold- ing payment (DWP) liabilities on foreign-sourced dividends will apply to dividends paid on or after 1 April 1998. Amendments to the rules for maintaining memorandum accounts will apply generally from the start of the 1998/99 imputation year. Overview of conduit tax reform Introduction In broad terms, conduit reform will reduce the tax payable by a New Zealand resident company in propor- tion to its non-resident shareholders when and to the extent that income is derived as: •attributed foreign income from CFCs: •FIF income calculated under the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods; and •DWP liabilities on foreign-sourced dividends. The first two sources of income referred to here are defined collectively in section OB 1 to be “foreign attributed income” (not to be confused with “attributed foreign income” derived under the CFC rules). The statutory term “foreign attributed income” will be used subsequently in this Tax Information Bulletin to refer to income of these types. Because relief is given on behalf of non-resident share- holders, a mechanism is necessary to ensure this relief is passed on to those shareholders on whose behalf it is given. A new memorandum account (the conduit tax relief (CTR) account) has been introduced to track conduit relief. The conduit relief mechanism operates at two different points in time. First, relief is given to a New Zealand resident company when it derives foreign attributed income or a foreign- sourced dividend (conduit income). Second, there are implications once the company distributes conduit income by way of dividend. Ultimately, the amount of conduit relief is determined when a company distributes conduit income to its shareholders. In determining the amount of relief to be given when conduit income is derived, the percentage of non-resident shareholders of a company at that time is best seen as a proxy for the percentage of shareholders that will exist on distribution. If the percentage of shareholding changes, the credit allocation mechanism washes out the effect of the shareholding changes. This is discussed further in the separate article on the general conduit relief mechanism, later in this Tax Information Bulletin. Elections To be entitled to relief on conduit income as it is de- rived, companies must elect to maintain a CTR account, thereby becoming conduit tax relief companies. Conduit relief is still available to companies not electing to be conduit tax relief companies. However, this relief will only be available when conduit income is distrib- uted to non-resident shareholders, by way of a refund of DWP credits in excess of the non-residents’ NRWT liabilities (repatriation-based relief). Further, the interest allocation rules will still apply to these companies in determining the amount of income subject to repatria- tion-based relief. Basic mechanism The basic conduit relief mechanism was illustrated by the example in paragraphs 4.2 to 4.7 of the discussion document, The Taxation of Conduit Investment, released in May 1997. The example was basic in the sense that it illustrated the key concepts of: •Determining conduit relief when income is derived; •Crediting the memorandum accounts; and •Distributing conduit income. However, it did not dwell on those aspects of the rules that make conduit reform complex, such as the effect of interest allocation rules, changes in shareholding be- tween the time income is derived and distributed, foreign tax credits and branch equivalent tax account (BETA) offsets. The example is reproduced here because it provides a good illustration of the essential relief mechanism. Subsequent discussion in this Tax Information Bulletin will deal with how more complex aspects of the rules’ interface with the basic mechanism. continued on page 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 4 (giving rise to the DWP credits), whereas the relief has been provided for the non-resident shareholders (giving rise to the CTR credits). NZ Co DWPA CTRA $33 $33 $0 $0 Cash dividend Additional div NRWT Net dividend $ 67 $ 33 $( 15) $ 85 Cash dividend DWP credit NZ tax Net dividend $ 67 $ 33 $( 33) $ 67 New Zealand Offshore 50% 50% The second point is that the CTR credits attached to the dividends paid to the non-resident shareholders give rise to a requirement for the company to pay an additional dividend to those shareholders of the amount of the credits. This is to ensure that the benefits of the conduit relief are passed on to non- resident shareholders. The effect is that a cash dividend of $67 is paid to the resident shareholders, while $100 is paid to the non-resident shareholders. However, both resident and non-resident sharehold- ers are liable for tax on $100 of dividend. (The DWP credit forms part of the taxable dividend of the resident shareholders.) Following the imposition of tax on the dividends, the net effect is that the $100 of foreign income attributable to the resident shareholders has been taxed at 33%, while the $100 attributable to the non- resident shareholders has been taxed at 15% (the rate of NRWT). Components of reform package There are three main components to the reform package: •The basic relief mechanism; •Special holding company and 100% group rules; and •Interest allocation rules. A broad outline of these component parts follows. For a detailed explanation, however, reference should be made to the separate articles appearing later in this Tax Information Bulletin. General relief mechanism A general mechanism has been created to determine the amount of relief to which a New Zealand company will be entitled, and to track that relief until it is passed on to non-resident shareholders on whose behalf conduit relief is given. This basic mechanism was illustrated in the previous example. Conduit relief will be available on a current basis only if the company elects to maintain a conduit tax relief account. Further, the amount of any relief will be reduced to the extent the interest allocation rules apply. Example The following example illustrates the operation of what can be referred to as a “current-based” relief mechanism. The mechanism is current-based in the sense that it provides relief as conduit income is derived by a New Zealand company (current), as contrasted to relief that is provided only when conduit income is distributed to non-resident shareholders (“repatriation-based” relief). The example concerns a New Zealand company in which resident and non-resident shareholders each own 50% of the shares. The company earns $200 of attributed income from a CFC or FIF on which no foreign tax is paid. NZ Co New Zealand Offshore 50% 50% NZ Govt Tax $33 DWPA CTRA $33 $33 CFC/FIF Income $200 Under pre-conduit rules, the amount of New Zea- land tax payable on the $200 of foreign income in the example would have been $66 (33% of $200). The payment of this tax would have given rise to a credit in NZ Co’s imputation account of $66. Following conduit reform, however, relief is given for 50% of the tax on the CFC or FIF income, based on the New Zealand company being 50% owned by non-resident shareholders. This gives a net New Zealand tax liability of $33. This amount will now be credited to the DWP account (instead of to the ICA, as previously), while the $33 of tax relieved will be credited to the CTR account. The following diagram illustrates what happens under the proposed reform when the New Zealand company distributes its income to its shareholders. The first point to note in the example is that the DWP credits are allocated to the resident sharehold- ers, while the CTR credits are allocated to the non- resident shareholders. This is appropriate, as the tax has been paid on behalf of the resident shareholders from page 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 5 General conduit relief mechanism Introduction As noted in the previous article, the conduit relief mechanism operates at two different points in time. First, relief is given to a New Zealand resident company when it derives foreign attributed income or a foreign- sourced dividend (conduit income). Second, there are implications once the company distributes conduit income by way of dividend. Ultimately, the amount of conduit relief is determined when a company distributes conduit income to its shareholders. The percentage of non-resident sharehold- ers when a New Zealand company derives conduit income could, therefore, be perceived as a proxy for the percentage of non-resident shareholders it will have when that income is distributed, and the amount of conduit relief ultimately determined. This article focuses first on the rules that apply to determine the amount of relief to which a New Zealand Holding companies and 100% groups There are special rules for determining whether certain shareholders are non-resident for the purposes of determining the amount of conduit relief. The exceptions to the normal rules are: •Companies wholly owned by a single non-resident (conduit tax relief holding companies) will be treated as if they were themselves non-residents in relation to certain companies in which they hold interests. There are further rules to determine which companies may elect to be conduit tax relief holding companies. •New Zealand resident members of 100% chains of companies will be treated as non-resident to the extent that a non-resident has a direct interest in the top company in the chain, and the company at the bottom of the chain has an interest in a CFC or FIF. •A non-resident will not be treated as a non-resident for conduit relief purposes if it is a CFC or the trustee of a non-qualifying trust. Interest allocation rules Interest allocation rules have been introduced to ensure that companies cannot allocate an excessive amount of debt to their New Zealand operations relative to CFCs and FIFs in which they hold interests, thereby generating an excessive amount of conduit relief. If application of the interest allocation rules determine that the group of a New Zealand company has exces- sively debt geared their New Zealand operations relative to their non-grey list CFC and FIF interests, the amount of conduit relief to which members of the group are entitled will be reduced. The formula in section KH 1 for determining the amount of conduit relief reduces a company’s foreign attributed income by the amount of any excess interest allocation, and determines conduit relief only on the net amount. Thus, if a company has foreign attributed income of $1,000 but has an excess interest allocation of $400, relief will be provided only in relation to the net foreign attributed income of $600 ($1,000 – $400). The fundamental test under the interest allocation rules is whether the New Zealand assets of a group are excessively debt funded relative to the assets of its CFC and FIF interests. If an excess interest allocation is identified in New Zealand, the excess is allocated against the conduit income of the group, thereby reducing the conduit relief to which members of the group are entitled. To reduce compliance costs, two safe harbours have been introduced so that the rules apply only to groups that have high levels of debt in New Zealand and when a substantial amount of conduit relief is involved. To this end, the rules do not apply when: •The debt percentage of a taxpayer’s New Zealand group, as defined under the interest allocation rules, is less than 66%; or •A taxpayer and all companies associated with the taxpayer are entitled to conduit relief for an income year of less than $50,000. Because companies not electing to receive current-based relief can still obtain distribution-based relief, through the refundable nature of DWP credits, the interest allocation rules apply equally to such companies. In applying the $50,000 relief test when such companies are involved, the test is applied to the amount of conduit relief to which such companies would have been entitled had they elected to receive current-based relief. It is expected that these safe harbours will make the interest allocation rules of no real consequence for all but a very small group of taxpayers with high levels of debt in their New Zealand operations, which are entitled to large amounts of conduit relief. Non-conduit relief companies Conduit tax reform also requires that some changes be made to existing rules, even for companies that do not elect to receive conduit tax relief. If a company does not elect to maintain a CTR account, its shareholders will still be entitled to receive conduit relief on foreign attributed income once it is distributed. This can occur if the company still elects to maintain a DWP account. As for companies electing to receive current-based conduit relief, tax on foreign attributed income will be creditable to the DWP account (section ME 5(7)). However, the interest allocation rules will still apply in determining the amount able to be credited to the account. continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 6 Applying these amounts into the formula in section KH 1(2) determines the amount of conduit relief as follows: 40% x ((33% x (100,000 – 0 – 0)) – 8,000 – 0) = $10,000 The tax payable by NZ Co on the attributed foreign income from Thai Co can be calculated as: Attributed foreign income100,000 Tax payable @33%33,000 Less: CFC tax credit( 8,000) Less: Conduit rebate (section KH 1(2))(10,000) Net New Zealand tax payable15,000 Caveats to section KH 1(2) result Section KH 2(3) contains two caveats on the result from applying the formula. Application of the formula cannot result in relief of less than nil (section KH 2(3)(a)) or for more than the company’s net tax liability (before taking conduit relief into consideration) for the year (section KH 2(3)(b)). This will have no application for NZ Co in the example above. Application of section KH 1(2) results in a rebate of more than nil, and NZ Co is known to have tax payable on other income, meaning the company’s income tax liability for the year must be more than the conduit rebate. Loss offsets The formula for determining conduit relief calculates the rebate to which a company will be entitled after “foreign attributed loss offsets” (FALO in the formula). The term “foreign attributed loss offsets” is defined in section OB 1 to include only attributed foreign losses (from CFCs) and FIF losses calculated under the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Thus, if a FIF loss calculated under the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method is to be applied against FIF income calculated under the accounting profits method, that offset will not affect the calculation of amount of conduit relief to which the New Zealand company is entitled. On a related issue, an amendment has been made to section DP 2 at Select Committee, dealing with the ability of companies with a FIF loss to offset that loss against other income to the extent that FIF income (other than that calculated under the branch equivalent method) has been returned in previous years. For the purposes of determining the extent to which a taxpayer may make such a loss offset, the amendment reduces the amount of FIF income calculated under the accounting profits method in previous years to the extent that conduit relief has eliminated the New Zealand income tax impost on that income. Foreign tax credits The calculation of the amount of conduit relief to which a company is entitled is determined with reference to the credits allowable to the company for taxes paid by a company will be entitled when it derives foreign attrib- uted income. It then proceeds to discuss the rules for determining relief on foreign-sourced dividends. Finally, it considers the implications when the company distrib- utes conduit income (foreign attributed income and foreign-sourced dividends) by way of dividends. Calculating relief when conduit income derived (section KH 1(2)) The amount of conduit relief on foreign attributed income is determined under the formula in section KH 1(2). The amount is calculated as: NRS x ((TR x (FAI – FALO – EIA)) – FAC – BC) This formula can be broken down into components, representing the process that is effectively followed for determining conduit relief: •Tax is first determined on the company’s foreign attributed income less any foreign attributed losses offset against that income and the amount of any interest expense allocated (TR x (FAI – FALO – EIA)) in the formula). •The amount of tax is then reduced by any credit for tax paid by a CFC or FIF calculated under the branch equivalent method, and by any offset of BETA debits under section MF 5(4) (– FAC – BC in the formula). •Finally, the net amount of tax is then reduced in proportion to the non-resident shareholders in the company. Example NZ Co is a New Zealand resident company, owned 40% by non-resident shareholders. It derives attributed foreign income of $100,000 from a CFC resident in Thailand (Thai Co). Foreign tax of $8,000 has been paid in respect of that income for which a CFC tax credit will arise. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that the interest allocation rules do not apply. NZ Co also has a nil balance in its BETA. Finally, NZ Co has income tax payable in respect of other income derived for the year. For NZ Co, the relevant values for the variables are: NRS40%Percentage of non-resident shareholders TR33%Company tax rate FAI$100,000Attributed foreign income from Thai Co FALONilForeign attributed loss offsets EIANilInterest allocation – assumed to be nil FAC$8,000CFC tax credit BCNilNo debit balance in BETA from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 7 CFC. Thus, if a CFC tax credit of say $500 were avail- able in respect of attributed foreign income of $5,000, relief would only be available on the New Zealand tax liability net of the CFC tax credit, that is, on income tax payable of $1,150 ($5,000 x 33% – $500). An amendment was made to section LC 4 at Select Committee. This amendment was a recognition that under the new Core Provisions approach in the Act, rebates (including conduit relief) are applied before a company’s income tax liability is determined. Because conduit relief is determined based on tax credits that will be applied, an amendment was made to section LC 4 to ensure that CFC tax credits are still applied to the extent they are taken into consideration in determining conduit tax relief. BETA offsets The last variable in the formula is BETA debit offsets. If a company pays DWP on a foreign-sourced dividend it derives, a debit arises to its branch equivalent tax account (BETA). This debit can then be applied against the income tax liability arising on subsequent foreign attributed income. As with foreign tax credits, BETA offsets are taken into account in determining the amount of conduit relief to which a taxpayer will be entitled. Thus, if a taxpayer has a BETA debit of say $300 and has foreign attributed income of $3,000 (with no foreign tax credit available), relief would only be available on the New Zealand tax liability net of the BETA offset, that is, on income tax payable of $690 ($3,000 x 33% – $300). Determining percentage of non- resident shareholders (section KH 2) Section KH 2 contains rules for determining what percentage of a company’s shareholders are non-resident for the purposes of determining conduit relief on income derived under the CFC and FIF regimes. The purpose of the measurement dates adopted is to: •permit companies to measure their non-resident shareholders on a date they are already required to determine their non-resident shareholders for dividend purposes; and •prevent the manipulation of different share classes to defeat the intent of the rules. With this aim in mind, section KH 2(1)(a) establishes generally that the last day in the year on which the company pays a dividend to all shareholders as the date on which a measurement of non-resident shareholders is made for conduit relief purposes. This is because companies already have to determine the extent of their non-resident shareholders to apply the NRWT rules. An amendment was made at Select Committee to further refine this rule. Publicly listed companies are able to use the Record Date for calculation of entitlement to divi- dends to determine the extent of their non-resident shareholding, rather than the date on which the dividend is actually paid (section KH 2(2)). This reflects that in practice, it is the Record date that determines who receives the dividends, not the payment date. If the company has not paid a dividend to all sharehold- ers in the income year, the measurement date defaults to the last day of the income year (section KH 2(1)(b)). The requirement to pay dividends to “all shareholders” of a company to avoid having to apply the default end of income year measurement date (section KH 2(1)(b)) created potential problems for companies with multiple classes of shares. For example, dividends being paid on fixed rate shares at a different time to those paid on ordinary shares would cause a company to fail the test, even though fixed rate shares do not affect voting interests on which current-based relief is generally determined. Also Treasury stock would be included within the shareholding, but no dividend would be paid. Consequently, further refinement was introduced into rules at Select Committee. Treasury stock is explicitly excluded from shares by section KH 2(6). Special deeming rules have also been introduced for multiple classes of shares. If a company pays dividends in an income year to all shareholders of each class of share, section KH 2(4) treats the company as having paid a dividend to all shareholders on the last date on which dividends were paid. Further, the shareholding at the time the last dividend was paid to all shareholders of other classes is deemed to have remained constant for the rest of the year in calculating voting and market value interests. The effect of this rule is best illustrated by way of an example. Example Multiclass Co has two classes of shares, with all shares having identical voting rights, regardless of class. Multiclass Co has 1,000 ‘A’ shares on issue and 1,500 ‘B’ shares on issue. Multiclass Co pays dividends in the income year on the following dates: 28 July‘A’ shares40% non-resident 27 November‘B’ shares30% non-resident 3 February‘A’ shares50% non-resident Because dividends have been paid to all sharehold- ers of each class in the income year, section KH 2(4) deems Multiclass Co to have paid a dividend to all shareholders on 3 February. Further, the share- holding of class ‘B’ shares is deemed to be the same at 3 February as it was when a dividend was paid to shareholders of the class on 27 November (section KH 2(5)). The percentage of non-resident shareholders in Multiclass Co, based on voting interests, is calcu- lated as 40%, that is: (50% x 1,000) + (30% x 1,500) 1,000 + 1,500 continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 8 Example High Gearing Ltd derives foreign attributed income of $5,000. No foreign attributed losses, CFC tax credits or BETA offsets arise in respect of that income. An excess interest allocation is determined of $2,000. High Gearing Ltd is 40% owned by non-residents. The gross foreign attributed income is reduced by the amount of excess interest allocation before determining the amount of conduit relief. Thus, High Gearing Ltd’s net foreign attributed income will be $3,000 ($5,000 – $2,000). Tax payable on this net amount will be $990 ($3,000 x 33%) less 40% conduit relief. This results in relief of $396 (credited to the CTR account), with the $594 balance of the tax payable ($990 – $396) credited to the DWP account. However, the actual tax payable on foreign attrib- uted income will be $1,254 ($5,000 x 33% – $396). To the extent that this exceeds the amount credited to the DWP account ($594), a credit will arise to the company’s imputation credit account ($1,254 – $594 = $660). Thus the final result will be: Tax payable on foreign attributed income$1,254 Conduit relief$ 396 Credit to CTR account$ 396 Credit to DWP account$ 594 Credit to ICA$ 660 Time for crediting tax on foreign attributed income to DWP account Because conduit relief on foreign attributed income is not determined until after the end of an income year, it is not possible to be certain at the time of paying provi- sional tax whether it is being paid in respect of foreign attributed income or other income. To resolve this, tax paid in relation to foreign attributed income will be credited to memorandum accounts as follows. First, provisional tax payments will be credited to the ICA as they are made. This preserves the existing treatment of such payments. Subsequently, when an income tax return is filed, identifying the amount of any conduit relief, a transfer is made from the ICA to the DWP account: •On the last day of the imputation year corresponding with the income year, to the extent provisional tax payments have been made for the year on or before that date; and •On the return filing date, to the extent that the amount of tax payable on net foreign attributed income (note that the amount of transfer depends on the application of section KH 1, requiring an adjustment for any interest expense allocated) exceeds provisional tax for the year. Special classes of shareholders For the purposes of determining the extent of non- resident shareholders for conduit relief purposes, conduit tax relief holding companies and higher-tier companies in a 100% chain of companies are treated as also being non-resident (see the article on holding companies later in this Tax Information Bulletin). However, a non-resident shareholder that is associated with the New Zealand resident company that is either a CFC or the trustee of a non-qualifying trust is not treated as being a non-resident shareholder (section OE 8(2)). Crediting CTR account Because conduit relief is given on behalf of non-resident shareholders, it is necessary to track that relief to ensure it is on-paid to them. To this end, a new memorandum account has been established, (the conduit tax relief (CTR) account) to record how relief is treated. A credit arises to the CTR account for the amount of any conduit relief given (in the case of NZ Co, $10,000). A debit will arise to the account when that conduit relief is distributed. New subpart MI contains rules relating to the mainte- nance of the new CTR memorandum account. It is necessary for a company to elect to maintain such an account under section MI 2 if it is to be entitled to conduit relief on foreign attributed income as it is derived. The legislation for CTR accounts is modelled on the legislation in subpart MF relating to branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs). BETAs prevent the double taxation of foreign attributed income and foreign- sourced dividends. Crediting DWP account As will be discussed in the second part of the example, the amount of conduit relief is ultimately determined once conduit income is distributed to shareholders. To ensure that this relief is correctly provided, it is neces- sary to be able to identify conduit income separately from other income. To achieve this, the application of the DWP account has been extended so that it now also records the amount of income tax payable on foreign attributed income. Before conduit tax reform, NZ Co would have credited the $15,000 tax payable on its attributed foreign income from Thai Co to its imputation credit account. Following the reform, section ME 5(1)(o) now permits this tax to be credited to the DWP account. It should be noted, however, that if there was an interest allocation against conduit income, the amount credited to the DWP account would not be the full amount of tax payable on the attributed foreign income. from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 9 For the purposes of the wash-up mechanism, section MI 6 provides that the retrospective crediting of the DWP and CTR accounts occurs before the wash-up mechanism is applied for the year. Example Slow Filing Ltd is a conduit tax relief company with a 31 March balance date. For its 1998/99 income year, it makes the following provisional tax pay- ments: 7 July 1998$15,000 7 November 1998$15,000 7 March 1999$20,000 Slow Filing Ltd also makes a voluntary tax payment of $20,000 on 31 May 1999. On 31 August 2000, Slow Filing Ltd files its 1998/99 income tax return. On the shareholder measurement date for the year, the company is 40% owned by non-resident shareholders. Its return shows the company to be entitled to conduit relief of $40,000, and to have tax payable on net (post-interest alloca- tion) foreign attributed income of $60,000. Under section ME 5(1)(o), Slow Filing Limited is entitled to a transfer from its ICA to its DWP account of $60,000. This transfer is made as follows. First, on 31 March 1999, a transfer is made for $50,000. This amount is the lesser of provisional tax for the year paid on or before that date or the income tax payable on net foreign attributed income for the income year (sections ME 5(2)(l)(i) and MG 4(2)(ba)). Note that this transfer is made at the end of the imputation year corresponding with the income year (1998/99), not the imputation year ending most recently before the income tax return is filed (1999/2000). Second, on 31 August 2000 (the return filing date), a transfer is made for the $10,000 balance of the tax payable on net foreign attributed income. The return filing date is used, notwithstanding that Slow Filing Co has made a payment between the time the imputation year ended and the income tax return was filed. (Note, however, that if Slow Filing Co had not yet paid the remaining $10,000, a transfer to the DWP account would still occur on the return filing date.) The crediting of the CTR account for conduit relief is similarly divided between the last day of the relevant imputation year and the return filing date. Section MI 4(2)(a) credits the CTR account on each date in the same proportion that credits arise to Slow Filing Ltd’s DWP account. Thus on 31 March 1999, a credit will arise to the CTR account for $33,333 ($40,000 x 50,000/ 60,000), and a further credit will arise on 31 August 2000 for $6,667 ($40,000 – $33,333). Transfers from DWP account to ICA For companies that elect to be conduit tax relief account companies, it will no longer to be possible to make a transfer from the DWP account to the ICA (sections MG 7(1) and MG 11(1). This is because making such a transfer would, in principle, require part of the transfer to be made from the associated CTR account, with a corresponding repayment of conduit relief to the extent a transfer is made. There is, however, no straightforward way to create an appropriate credit allocation mechanism to determine the extent the transfer to the ICA should be sourced from the DWP and CTR accounts respectively. To reduce com- plexity, therefore, transfers from the DWP account to the ICA can no longer be made by conduit tax relief compa- nies. This rule does not affect dividend withholding payment account companies that do not elect to receive current- based conduit relief. Relief on DWP (section NH 7) Section NH 7 introduces current-based conduit relief on foreign-sourced dividends subject to DWP. In a similar manner to relief on foreign attributed income, companies that have elected under section MI 2 to maintain a CTR account and be a conduit tax relief company are entitled to have their DWP liabilities reduced to the extent of their non-resident shareholders. The amount of DWP on which relief will be determined is the DWP liability after allowing for underlying foreign tax credits, foreign withholding taxes, BETA offsets and loss offsets. Unlike relief on foreign attributed income, it is unrealis- tic to expect an adjustment for any interest expense allocated to be determined at the time any DWP is due for payment. Section NH 7 therefore does not require an interest allocation to be taken into consideration in determining the amount of relief when the DWP is paid. However, the position is reviewed once interest alloca- tion calculations are performed for the relevant income year. If an excess interest allocation is determined under section FH 5, and that excess is greater than the taxpay- er’s foreign attributed income group’s net foreign attributed income for the year (foreign attributed income less loss offsets), then to the extent the excess allocation exceeds the group’s net foreign attributed income, it will be allocated against DWP relief under section FH 8. Details on the application of section FH 8 can be found in the article on interest allocation rules, later in this Tax Information Bulletin. Summary of memorandum accounts The amount of any tax reduction (whether income tax or DWP) will be credited to the CTR account. This is because the relief has been provided on behalf of the non-resident shareholders and needs to be identified for passing on to them at some time. continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 10 Attaching ICA credits to dividends with CTR or DWP credits There is no rule that prevents companies attaching imputation credits to a dividend at the same time as it attaches DWP or CTR credits. The total credits attached will, however, be subject to the credit allocation and benchmark dividend rules in sections MG 8 and MG 10. For the purposes of applying these rules, section MI 8 requires any CTR credit to be treated as if it were a DWP credit. NRWT on distributed conduit income Distributions of conduit income to non-resident share- holders are subject to NRWT of 15%. Section NG 2 has been amended to apply a 15% rate of NRWT to divi- dends paid to non-residents to the extent they have full CTR credits attached. The 15% NRWT rate will also apply to additional dividends paid in respect of the CTR credits. The CTR credit does not form part of the dividend subject to NRWT. Example of distribution mechanism Returning to the example earlier in this article, NZ Co had 40% non-resident shareholding at the time it derived conduit income. It received conduit relief of $10,000, giving rise to a credit in its CTR account. A credit of $15,000 also arose to its DWP account for tax payable on foreign attributed income. NZ Co has now decided that it wants to distribute some of its conduit income to its shareholders. However, at the time of distribution, non-residents own 60% of the company. NZ Co wants to pay fully credited cash dividends of $13,400. Because 40% of the shareholders are resident, 40% of the cash dividends ($5,360) will be paid to them. Full DWP credits of $2,640 (5,360 x 33/67) will be attached to these dividends. In relation to the non-resident shareholders, cash dividends of $8,040 will be paid. Full CTR credits of $3,960 (8,040 x 33/67) will need to be attached (if the company does not attach full CTR credits, an allocation deficit debit will arise under section MG 8, as modified by section MI 8). Additional dividends will also have to be paid to the sharehold- ers of $3,960, equal to the amount of CTR credits attached to the dividends (section LG 1(2)). The dividends paid to the non-resident shareholders will be subject to NRWT as follows: Cash dividends$ 8,040 Additional dividends$ 3,960 Dividends subject to NRWT$12,000 NRWT @ 15%$ 1,800 The non-resident shareholders will then receive post-NRWT dividends of $10,200 (12,000 – 1,800). Tax paid on foreign attributed income will be credited to the DWP account (instead of to the imputation credit account (ICA)). DWP paid on foreign-sourced dividends will still be credited to the DWP account. The effect will be to identify distributions as being from either foreign- sourced or New Zealand-sourced earnings of the com- pany, depending on the type of credits attached. Conduit relief mechanism on distribution As noted previously, the amount of conduit relief is determined ultimately by the percentage of non-resident shareholders when conduit relief is distributed. Conduit reform has introduced, therefore, a new memorandum account to track conduit relief until it is distributed. Distributions of conduit income will be identified through the attachment of DWP or CTR credits. DWP credits indicate that tax has been paid on conduit income, while CTR credits indicate the tax that has been relieved. When a company receives conduit relief, a credit arises in its memorandum account. If the company then wants to distribute conduit income, it attaches a CTR credit to a dividend paid to a non-resident. Each dollar of CTR credits attached reflects a dollar of conduit tax relief given to the company. To pass the benefit of this relief to its non-resident shareholders, the company is required to pay an additional dividend equal to the amount of CTR credits attached (section LG 1). Thus, if a company pays a $67 cash dividend with $33 CTR credits attached, it is required to pay an additional dividends to the share- holder of $33, making a total cash dividend of $100. To minimise compliance costs associated with an allocation mechanism, conduit tax relief companies will be able to attach CTR credits only to dividends paid to non-residents (section MI 7(1)). Dividends paid to resident shareholders will be required to have DWP credits attached (section MG 6(2)), in the same propor- tion as CTR credits are attached to dividends paid to non-resident shareholders. Effect of CTR credits on credit allocation rules In a similar manner to the foreign investor tax credit rules, section LG 1 introduces special rules to ensure that the additional dividend mechanism used in conduit reform does not contravene company law and trust deed requirements and credit allocation rules. Specifically: •Section LG 1(3) ensures that the uncredited additional dividend does not affect the credit allocation rules; •Section LG 1(4) ensures that the additional dividend paid only to non-resident shareholders does not breach company law or the company’s articles of association or constitution; and •Section LG 1(5) ensures that a trustee deriving an additional dividend on behalf of a non-resident beneficiary can pass on that additional dividend without contravening the terms of the trust. from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 11 Statement to shareholders When a company attaches a CTR credit to a dividend to a non-resident shareholder, it is required to include the amount of the conduit tax relief credit and the amount of the additional dividend in the dividend statement provided to the shareholder (sections 29(1), 30A, Tax Administration Act 1994). Wash-up mechanism As indicated in the example, it is possible that a compa- ny’s level of non-resident shareholding may change between the time conduit relief is given to the company and the time at which it is distributed. In this case, the company will still attach only DWP credits to dividends paid to residents and CTR credits to dividends paid to non-residents. If the requirement to attach certain types of credits to certain types of shareholder results in either the CTR account or the DWP account having a debit balance at the end of the imputation year, section MI 6 allows for a wash-up adjustment to be made. If the CTR account is in debit and the DWP account is in credit (indicating generally that the percentage of non- resident shareholders of the company has increased between the time conduit relief is provided and the time it is distributed), a transfer will be made from the DWP account to the CTR account for the lesser of the amount of the debit or the credit (section MI 6(1)). A payment will be made by Inland Revenue to the company for the amount of the transfer made (section MI 11). If the DWP account is in debit and the CTR account is in credit (indicating generally that the percentage of non- resident shareholders of the company has decreased between the time conduit relief is provided and the time it is distributed), a transfer will be made from the CTR account to the DWP account for the lesser of the amount of the debit or the credit (section MI 6(2)). The company will be required to make a payment to Inland Revenue for the amount of the transfer made (section MI 10(4)). Example Changing Times Ltd had 40% non-resident share- holders at the time it derived conduit income of $10,000. As a result of determining the tax payable on its foreign attributed income, credits of $1,320 and $1,980 arose to its CTR and DWP accounts respectively. At the time of paying a dividend, no other entries had arisen to those memorandum accounts. Changing Times Ltd has decided to pay fully credited dividends from conduit income to its shareholders. However, it now finds that its non- resident shareholders own 75% of the company. Based on having an aggregate of $3,300 of CTR and DWP credits in its account, Changing Times Ltd is able to fully credit $6,700 of cash dividends ($3,300 x 67/33). Fully credited dividends are, therefore, paid as follows: To resident shareholders: Cash dividend$6,700 x 25%$1,675 Full DWP credits$1,675 x 33/67$ 825 To non-resident shareholders: Cash dividend$6,700 x 75%$5,025 Full DWP credits$5,025 x 33/67$2,475 The cash flow of Changing Times Ltd will be as follows: Cash dividend to residents1,675 Cash dividend to non-residents5,025 Additional dividend to non-residents:2,475 Total dividends paid9,175 After paying New Zealand tax of $1,980 (from which DWP credits arose) on foreign attributed income of $10,000, Changing Times Ltd’s post-tax income was only $8,020. However, because of the requirement that the company attach only CTR credits (and not DWP credits) to dividends to non- resident shareholders, the company has had to pay out $9,175 to fully distribute its conduit income. Further, as a consequence of paying the dividends, the balances in its memorandum accounts will become the following: CTR account:1,320 CR – 2,475 DR = $1,155 DR DWP account:1,980 CR – 825 DR = $1,155 CR Had the company been able to attach DWP credits to dividends paid to non-residents, it could have left both memorandum accounts with a nil balance and not been required to fund the additional dividend. If the balances in the memorandum accounts of Changing Times Ltd remain the same at the end of the income year, a wash-up adjustment will result. A transfer will be made from the DWP account to the CTR account for $1,155, leaving both accounts with a nil balance. Changing Times Ltd will also receive a refund from Inland Revenue for the amount of credit transferred. Transitional rule allowing DWP credits to pass to non-residents A transitional rule will allow companies with existing DWP credits at the effective date of the reform to still allocate to non-resident shareholders their proportionate share of those credits until 31 March 2001. This is to reduce the cash flow consequences for companies that would otherwise be unable to make a timely distribution of existing DWP credits relating to tax paid on behalf of their non-resident shareholders. The rule overrides the normal requirement that DWP credits be attached only to dividends paid to resident shareholders. The amount of DWP credits to which this rule can apply is defined in section MZ 4(4). Essentially, it is the aggregate of non-resident shareholders’ share of: •DWP credits existing at 31 March 1998; and •DWP credits arising on foreign-sourced dividends derived by the company in the March 1998 quarter. continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 12 Implications of breach of continuity If a breach of continuity occurs, a debit arises to the company’s CTR account to the extent of any credit balance in the account at that time. The company will also be required to repay to Inland Revenue the amount of that debit by the 20th day of the month following the quarter in which the breach of continuity occurs (section MI 10(1)(a)). The payment is treated as a payment of DWP, but does not give rise to a credit in the company’s DWP account (section MI 10(2)). This is broadly consistent with the result that would have been achieved if the company had not been a conduit tax relief company, paid DWP (which correspondingly is now paid in relation to the 34 per- centage point breach), and subsequently had a breach of shareholder continuity giving rise to a debit in its DWP account. Other debits to CTR account A debit to the CTR account under section MI 5(1) will also occur if: •there is an allocation debit resulting from excessive CTR credits being attached to a dividend (section MI 5(1)(c)); or •section GC 22 applies if CTR credits are applied to gain a tax advantage (section MI 5(1)(d)). As with a breach of shareholder continuity, the company will be required to pay to Inland Revenue by the 20th day of the month following the quarter in which the debit occurs an amount of DWP equal to the amount of that debit. Again, the payment will not give rise to a credit in the company’s DWP account (section MI 10(2)). Not crediting the DWP account for the payment made places the taxpayer in the same position it would have been in had it not received conduit tax relief, and a similar credit allocation with DWP credits instead of CTR credits occurred. Finally, a debit will also arise to the CTR account if: •a lower-tier company in a 100% chain ceases to be a member of that chain while having a credit balance in its CTR account (section MI 5(1)(f),(g)); or •a company ceases to be a conduit tax relief company (section MI 5(1)(h)). The company will again be required to pay to Inland Revenue by the 20th day of the month following the quarter in which the debit occurs an amount of DWP equal to the amount of that debit. However, the payment will now give rise to a credit in the company’s DWP account. This is because had the company not elected to be a conduit tax relief company or a conduit tax relief group member, the payment of DWP on foreign attrib- uted income would have given rise to a credit in its DWP account, and that credit would have been unaffected by the action giving rise to the debit to the CTR account. This later rule recognises that while the DWP liability for this quarter is not payable until after 31 March 1998, no conduit relief can arise in respect of these dividends because they have been paid before the application date of the new relief rules. Example In an earlier example, NZ Co paid fully CTR credited dividends to non-resident shareholders of $8,040. It was also required to pay additional dividends of $3,960 in relation to those CTR credits. NZ Co determines under section MZ 4(4) that it has transitional DWP credits of $4,000 available. It could, therefore, attach DWP credits to the divi- dends paid to non-resident shareholders, instead of CTR credits. NZ Co would then not be required to fund an additional dividend. The dividends paid to the non-resident shareholders would then be subject to NRWT as follows: Cash dividends8,040 DWP credits 3,960 Dividends subject to NRWT12,000 DWP credit3,960 NRWT @ 15% 1,800 Refund of excess DWP credits 2,160 Cash dividends received by non-resident shareholders8,040 Refund of excess DWP credits 2,160 Total receipt of non-resident shareholders10,200 The non-resident shareholders obtain the same return as they did when CTR credits were attached to the dividends. However, NZ Co has not been required to fund additional dividends to achieve this result. Breach of shareholder continuity between derivation of conduit income and its distribution Special rules have been introduced to deal with breaches of shareholder continuity, which differ from the continu- ity rules applying to the existing imputation, DWP and BETA rules. Section MI 5(1)(d) defines a breach of continuity to have occurred if, at any time between the time conduit relief is given to the company and the time that relief is distributed, the percentage of resident shareholders of the company increases by 34 or more percentage points. For example, if a company has 30% of its shareholders resident in New Zealand when conduit relief is received, and this increases to 70% at any time before distribution is to occur, the 40 percentage point increase in resident shareholders will represent a continuity breach. from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 13 Crediting the DWP account for the payment made creates a result consistent with what would have oc- curred had the company not utilised the conduit relief rules. CTR and amalgamating companies Section MI 13 introduces rules for amalgamating companies that maintain a CTR account. If the amalgamated company also maintains a CTR account, the balances in the amalgamating companies’ CTR accounts are transferred to the amalgamated company. The 34 percentage point continuity rule applies from the time any credit arose in the CTR account of the amalgamating company until distributed by the amalgamating company, as if the amalgamation had not occurred. If the amalgamated company does not maintain a CTR account, the balance in the amalgamating companies’ CTR at the date of amalgamation is transferred to the amalgamated company’s ICA. The amalgamated company will then be required to pay to Inland Revenue an amount of DWP equal to the amount of the transfer. This payment will not give rise to a credit in either the ICA or DWP account of the amalgamated company. BETA mechanism The BETA mechanism remains largely unchanged from the way it operated before conduit reform. Tax payable on foreign attributed income gives rise to a credit in the BETA, which can be applied to meet the DWP liability on subsequent foreign-sourced dividends. Similarly, DWP deducted in respect of foreign-sourced dividends gives rise to a debit in the BETA, which can be applied to meet the income tax liability on subsequent foreign attributed income. To operate correctly, the BETA mechanism works on the basis of tax payable (including any tax implicitly paid by way of loss offset) before determining conduit relief. This ensures that changes in shareholding, for example, do not affect the BETA mechanism’s ability to ensure double taxation does not occur on the same ultimate source of income. To achieve this effect in relation to conduit income, the BETA rules have been modified to ensure that: •BETA credits and debits on foreign attributed income and foreign-sourced dividends respectively are determined before conduit relief is calculated (section MF 4(1)(a), (3)(a)); and •BETA offsets are applied before calculating conduit relief (section MF 5(2)(a), (6)(c)). Implications of reform for non-CTR companies One of the anomalies identified in the development of conduit tax reform was that the net return to non-resident shareholders of New Zealand companies could be influenced by the order in which the company derived foreign attributed income and foreign-sourced dividends. The BETA mechanism had the general effect of ensuring that New Zealand tax was imposed only on the form of income that was derived first. If a company derived a foreign-sourced dividend before foreign attributed income, the payment of the DWP impost would give rise to a credit in the company’s DWP account, instead of to its ICA if the foreign attributed income were derived first. Because of their refundable nature, DWP provided a greater benefit to non-resident shareholders. A key aspect of conduit reform for resolving this anomaly is the ability created for companies to credit the tax paid on net foreign attributed income (foreign attributed income less any excess interest allocation) to their DWP account. This option also exists for non-conduit tax relief compa- nies. If a company maintains a DWP account, the tax payable by the company on foreign attributed income is creditable to the DWP account under section ME 5(7). The interest allocation rules in Subpart FH still apply in determining the amount to be credited to the DWP account. However, given the $50,000 relief threshold for the interest allocation rules, it is not anticipated that compa- nies not electing to be conduit tax relief companies will be affected by the rules. If companies do have enough potential conduit relief to be affected by the interest allocation rules, it is reasonable to expect them to elect into the full mechanism, so they can derive the benefits of current-based conduit relief. Alternatively, such companies may elect to cease to be a DWP account company under section MG 2(4). Conduit reform: holding companies and 100% chains of companies Background to holding company rules Non-resident investors commonly use holding compa- nies as vehicles through which to hold their New Zealand investments. A common structure is illustrated in the following diagram. Non-resident owns 100% of NZ Holding Co, which in turn has an investment in NZ Operating Co. Legally, NZ Holding Co holds the interest in NZ Operating Co, but economically, the real owner is Non- resident. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 14 •eliminate the tax impost on the dividend flow to the holding company (section CB 10(4) and (5)). In determining whether a company is wholly owned by a single non-resident, a small shareholder that is effec- tively a nominee and exists to meet company law requirements will not be treated as a separate share- holder (section OE 7(1)(b)). NRWT of 15% will still be imposed when conduit income is passed on to the actual non-resident investor. If special rules were introduced for all 100% owned holding companies, irrespective of the size of their investment into other New Zealand companies, an inappropriate incentive would be created for every non- resident to incur costs to hold their investments into New Zealand through special holding companies to qualify for conduit tax relief holding company treatment. To reduce this incentive, the special treatment of holding companies will apply only to the extent that they hold interests of 10% or greater in other New Zealand companies (section OE 7(1)(c)). Example The shareholding of NZ Holding Co and its interests in other New Zealand resident companies is as follows: 8% 100% Holding Co NZ Holding Co NZ Co 1NZ Co 2 15% Non-resident Because of the 10% ownership threshold, NZ Holding Co will be treated as a non-resident for conduit relief purposes only in relation to NZ Co 1. In relation to NZ Co 2, NZ Holding Co will be treated the same way as any other New Zealand resident shareholder – its interest in the company will not give rise to any current-based conduit relief. Restrictions on ownership of conduit tax relief holding companies Several special rules targeting the ownership of conduit tax relief holding companies have been introduced to preserve the integrity of the rules. First, consistent with the rules applying to direct interests in New Zealand companies held by non-residents, a CFC or a non-qualifying trust will not be treated as a non- resident shareholder. If a holding company has such a shareholder, it cannot be a conduit tax relief holding company (section OE 7(2)). Second, because of the 10% ownership threshold required before a company can be a conduit tax relief holding company in relation to a conduit tax relief company, rules have been introduced to deal with the NZ Holding Co Non-resident NZ Operating Co CFC/FIF 100% X% Y% Resident investors Z% Because conduit tax relief generally arises only to the extent that non-residents hold direct interests in New Zealand companies with foreign investment, no relief would arise to NZ Operating Co for the above structure in the absence of special holding company rules. One alternative is to require Non-resident to restructure its investment to hold its interest in Operating Co directly to obtain relief. The resulting structure, which is the economic equivalent of the ownership structure illustrated above, is illustrated in the following diagram. Non-resident NZ Operating Co CFC/FIF X% Y% Resident investors Z% There are several reasons, however, why this would have represented a poor policy approach: •It could be expensive for Non-resident, and may disrupt a structure established for non-tax reasons. •Non-resident may be unable to manage the timing of distributions from conduit income, and consequently its NRWT and home country tax liabilities. These liabilities could potentially claw back the benefit of any conduit relief given to Operating Co. •If Operating Co did not pass on the benefits of conduit relief to Non-resident, but instead reinvested it, the benefits from that reinvestment would accrue to both Resident Investors and Non-resident. For Non-resident to fully capture the benefits of conduit relief (includ- ing any income accruing to the reinvested relief), it is necessary that the relief be on-paid and held on its account. However, NRWT acts as a deterrent to this distribution. To resolve these concerns, special rules have been introduced that: •allow New Zealand resident holding companies wholly owned by a single non-resident investor to be treated as if they were themselves non-resident (sections OE 7(1), (2) and OE 8(3)); and from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 15 situation when ownership falls below this threshold. If this occurs, the election to be treated as a non-resident in relation to that conduit tax relief company will be revoked, and subsequent conduit income of the conduit tax relief company and dividends paid to the holding company will no longer qualify for preferred treatment. There will, however, be no consequence for any credits in the holding company’s CTR account at the time it ceases to hold the requisite 10% interest (section MI 5(1)(e),(f) or (g) do not apply). Dividend exemption Dividends paid to a conduit tax relief holding company are exempt income “to the extent fully conduit tax relief credited” (section CB 10(4)). The term “fully conduit tax relief credited” is defined in section OB 1. It is that portion of a cash dividend equal to the CTR tax credits attached, multiplied by 67/33. Thus if a $120 cash dividend is paid with $33 CTR credits attached, the dividend is fully conduit tax relief credited to the extent of $67 of the cash dividend ($33 x 67/33). The remaining $53 of the dividend is not conduit tax relief credited. The additional dividend paid to a conduit tax relief holding company in respect of CTR credits attached is also exempt income (section CB 10(5)). The CTR credit does not form part of the dividend, so is also not subject to tax. Amendments to thin capitalisation rules One of the most difficult policy problems under the thin capitalisation rules is the double counting of equity (and, therefore, assets) that would result if companies under common control were not required to consolidate. To some extent, the ability for companies not to group down a chain for interests of less than 66% leaves this double counting problem unaddressed. Because the holding company rules are concessionary, new rules have been introduced that require generally that a holding company consolidate with any conduit tax relief companies in which it holds a direct interest of more than 50%, notwithstanding that it may have elected to group on the basis of a 66% election. This precludes the holding company from benefiting from both a double counting of assets through not consolidating with lower- tier interests and the special holding company rules. Specifically, section FG 4(14E) modifies the thin capitalisation rules so that the 66% option no longer applies in relation to the direct interest held by a conduit tax relief holding company in any company to which it has forwarded an election (if the 66% option is elected under thin capitalisation, the lower “greater than 50%” option would apply to the direct interest held by the holding company, with the 66% option applying to all other links in the chain). The effect of this rule is illustrated in the following diagram. If NZ Holding Co, as the New Zealand parent of Tax- payer Co under the thin capitalisation rules, elected to apply the 66% grouping threshold, then NZ Holding Co would represent one New Zealand group for thin capitalisation purposes, NZ Operating Co and Taxpayer Co would represent a second group, while NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 would represent third and fourth groups respectively. 100% Non-resident 60% NZ Holding Co NZ Operating Co 100% CFC 80% Taxpayer Co 60% NZ Co 1 60% NZ Co 2 If NZ Holding Co is a conduit tax relief holding com- pany in respect of NZ Operating Co, section FG 4(14E) will prevent the 66% grouping option applying to NZ Holding Co’s interest in NZ Operating Co, because NZ Operating Co is a conduit tax relief company. NZ Holding Co, NZ Operating Co and Taxpayer Co would then become a single New Zealand group for thin capitalisation purposes. However, the 66% grouping election continues to apply other than to direct interests NZ Holding Co has in conduit tax relief companies, and NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 will continue to represent separate New Zealand groups for thin capitalisation purposes. Section FG 4(14E) will not be applicable in every case. If dividends received by a conduit tax relief holding company are on-paid to its non-resident shareholder in the year of receipt (section FG 4(14F)), section FG 4(14E) will not apply. In applying this rule, however, any dividend not on-paid in earlier years will need to be on-paid before a subsequent dividend can be treated as being on-paid in the year of receipt. The specific test for determining whether dividends have been on-paid refers to dividends to the extent fully CTR credited (as defined in section OB 1). Thus the focus is on relief passed through (as evidenced by credits attached to dividends), rather than the amount of divi- dends with any extent of conduit tax relief credits attached. Special rules for 100% owned chains of companies (sections MI 5(1)(f), (g), OE 7(3) to (5) and OE 8) Special rules have also been introduced for 100% chains of companies. These rules allow a lower-tier company in a chain of companies to qualify for conduit tax relief on account of the extent of non-resident shareholding in the top-tier company in the chain. Dividends being passed up the 100% chain will be exempt from tax under existing section CB 10(2). continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 16 Under the 100% group rules, NZ Parent Co will be treated as a non-resident in relation to NZ 100% Co, to the extent of the 60% interest held in NZ Parent Co by non-residents. As a consequence, NZ 100% Co will be entitled to 60% relief on conduit income derived from CFC Co. Effective nominees As with the rules for conduit tax relief holding compa- nies, a small shareholder that is effectively a nominee and exists to meet company law requirements will be disregarded in determining whether 100% ownership exists (section OE 7(4)). Conduit reform: interest allocation rules Introduction The interest allocation rules in new subpart FH aim to ensure that companies do not allocate an excessive amount of interest expense to their New Zealand opera- tions, relative to their foreign interests for which conduit relief is to be provided. If an excessive interest allocation exists, the excess will be reallocated against conduit income, thereby reducing the amount of conduit relief to which the New Zealand company will be entitled. The fundamental test for determining whether an excessive allocation exists will be a comparison of the debt level of a taxpayer’s New Zealand group with that of CFC and FIF interests in which it holds an interest. An excessive allocation in New Zealand exists if the debt level of the New Zealand group exceeds that of its CFC and FIF interests. The required calculations introduce potentially high compliance costs. To minimise these costs, two impor- tant safe harbours have been introduced. Their aim is to ensure that taxpayers are required to perform full calculations only if their New Zealand group has highly geared its New Zealand operations, and a significant amount of conduit relief is involved. To this end, the interest allocation rules will not apply if: •the conduit relief to which the taxpayer, and compa- nies associated with the taxpayer, are entitled for an income year does not exceed $50,000 (section FH 1(2)(a)); or (Note: If any company identified, including the taxpayer, is not a conduit tax relief company, the test applies to that company based on the relief to which it would have been entitled if it had elected to be a conduit tax relief company.) •the “debt percentage” of the taxpayer’s New Zealand group does not exceed 66% (section FH 1(2)(b)). The New Zealand group is labelled as the “foreign attributed income group” in Subpart FH. This is to distinguish it from the “New Zealand group” under the thin capitalisation rules, since the two groups do not necessarily need to be identical. This commentary will, therefore, use the term “foreign attributed income group” to refer subsequently to the New Zealand group under the interest allocation rules. Process for applying interest allocation rules The flow chart on the right sets out an outline of the process to be followed in applying the interest allocation rules. The steps identified are annotated only in greatly summarised form. For a detailed explanation of each step in the process, reference should be made to the explanation that follows. Non-applicability of interest allocation rules if total relief is less than $50,000 The interest allocation rules will not apply to a taxpayer if the aggregate amount of conduit relief to which the taxpayer and all companies associated with the taxpayer for an income year is less than $50,000. Two points should be noted in applying this safe har- bour. First, the purpose of the test is to reduce compliance costs by allowing taxpayers to meet a safe harbour test without performing any interest allocation calculations. Consequently, the test is applied based on the amount of conduit tax relief to which a company would be entitled if there is no interest allocation. Second, there is a special rule for companies that are not conduit tax relief companies but still maintain a DWP account. For each of those companies, the test applies based on the amount of conduit relief the company Example The shareholding chain for a 100% New Zealand group is as follows: 60% Holding Co NZ Parent Co Non-residents 100% Holding Co NZ 100% Co 100% CFC Co from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 17 would have received if it were a conduit tax relief company (section FH 1(2)(a)(i) and (iii)). Identify companies associated with taxpayer Does their aggregate relief exceed $50,000 for income year? Is taxpayer subject to thin capitalisation rules? Taxpayer’s “foreign attributed income group” is same as New Zealand group under thin capitalisation rules Taxpayer’s “foreign attributed income group” includes all companies in same tax group as taxpayer No No Yes Yes Interest allocation rules do not apply Does debt percentage of group exceed 66%? No Does debt percentage exceed consolidated group’s? No Yes Calculate excess interest allocation Yes Calculate debt percentage of group consolidated with CFC/FIF interests? Yes No Applying interest allocation rules Example Taxpayer Co is entitled to conduit relief for an income year of $30,000. Non-conduit Co is a company associated with Taxpayer Co that main- tains a DWP account, but has not elected to be a conduit tax relief company. Consequently, Non-conduit Co does not qualify for conduit relief. However, the company is 75% owned by non-resident shareholders and has received a foreign-sourced dividend in the income year of $100,000. No foreign withholding tax has been deducted and the company does not qualify for an underlying foreign tax credit. Taxpayer Co would not qualify for exemption from the interest allocation rules under the $50,000 relief threshold. This is because Taxpayer Co’s $30,000 relief, when aggregated with the $24,750 relief Non-conduit Co would have been entitled if it were a conduit tax relief company ($100,000 x 33% x 75%), exceeds the $50,000 threshold. Scheme of rules if $50,000 relief safe harbour threshold breached The central test around which the interest allocation rules are based is a comparison with the level of debt funding of a group against its New Zealand assets against the level of debt funding of CFCs and FIFs for which conduit relief is to be given. The discussion immediately following explains the general framework that the rules follow. Understanding the framework should help to place some of the more detailed rules discussed subsequently in their proper context. To achieve a meaningful comparison, the rules in sections FH 3 to FH 5 for determining the excess interest allocation, in principle, apply the following process: 1.The level of debt is calculated for a consolidated group, which includes members of the taxpayer’s group in New Zealand, and CFCs and FIF calculated under the accounting profits or branch equivalent methods from which gross income is derived (re- ferred to subsequently as “non-grey list” CFCs and FIFs) in which those members hold an interest. 2.The amount of consolidated assets for that group are also calculated. 3.The calculations from steps one and two are used to calculate the consolidated group’s debt percentage. This represents the extent to which each dollar of assets is funded by debt. 4.The consolidated group’s debt percentage is applied back to the assets of the New Zealand part of the group to determine the acceptable level of debt relative to those assets. continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 18 66% safe harbour debt percentage To reduce compliance costs, section FH 1(2)(b) intro- duces a second safe harbour, which is the 66% debt percentage. If the debt level of the New Zealand assets of the group is less than 66%, the interest allocation rules do not apply. (This safe harbour is replicated in paragraph (a) of variable CGDP in the formula in section FH 5) In effect, what this rule does, in relation to the general scheme of the interest allocation rules, is to allow steps one to three of the process to default to 66%. Thus, in practice, taxpayers will first complete step four of the process to determine whether this 66% threshold is breached. If it is, taxpayers can then proceed, if they wish, to perform the calculations under steps one to three of the process, to see if this permits a higher level of debt funding of the New Zealand assets. The remainder of this commentary examines the interest allocation rules in the order in which they will be applied to taxpayers. Determination of foreign attributed income group (New Zealand group) If a taxpayer company does not qualify for the $50,000 relief safe harbour, the next step will be to identify its foreign attributed income group. In determining whether an excess interest allocation exists, the level of debt funding for that group will need to be determined. The rules for determining a taxpayer’s foreign attributed income group are contained in section FH 2. The basis for determining the group depends on whether the taxpayer is subject to the thin capitalisation rules or not (that is, whether it is controlled by a single non- resident person). If the taxpayer is subject to the thin capitalisation rules, its foreign attributed income group under the interest allocation rules will be the same as the one determined under the existing thin capitalisation rules (Note: this will exclude the special grouping rules for holding companies in section FG 4(14E) and (14F)). If the taxpayer is not subject to the thin capitalisation rules, its foreign attributed income group will consist of itself and any other company with which it has 66% common ownership. The key principle underlying the adoption of this threshold is the ability of group compa- nies to transfer losses. Rationale for using groups As noted in the discussion document, it is necessary for interest allocation rules to apply in relation to a New Zealand group, rather than only to the taxpayer holding a direct interest in a CFC, to prevent a group of New Zealand companies being structured in a way that circumvents the interest allocation rules. This problem is illustrated in the following two dia- grams. (Note: Section FH 3(3) excludes from the assets of the foreign attributed income group any interest held by a member of that group in a CFC or FIF calcu- lated under the accounting profits or branch equiva- lent methods from which gross income is derived (“non-grey list” CFCs and FIFs). This exclusion occurs to the extent non-residents hold interests in that group member. These interests are consolidated out in the full calculations under section FH 4. The exclusion of assets under section FH 3(3) is necessary to get a meaningful comparison of debt levels between the non-conduit assets of the foreign attributed income group and the total assets of the consolidated group.) A brief example illustrates this mechanism further. Example Taxpayer Co is the only member of a foreign attributed income group. It is owned 100% by non- resident shareholders. Its balance sheet is as follows: Taxpayer Co Equity..............6,000Shares in CFC........3,000 Debt...............15,000Other assets..........18,000 21,00021,000 Taxpayer Co holds 100% of the shares in CFC. The balance sheet of CFC is as follows: CFC Equity..............3,000Assets.................12,000 Debt............... 9,000 12,00012,000 Performing a consolidation will result in the follow- ing consolidated balance sheet: Consolidated group Equity..............6,000Assets.................30,000 Debt...............24,000 30,00030,000 Under step one of the process, the level of debt of the consolidated group is $24,000. Under step two, the assets of the consolidated group are $30,000. This gives a debt percentage under step 3 of 80% (24,000/30,000). Applying this percentage in step four of the process, Taxpayer Co’s assets of $18,000 (the equity invest- ment in CFC is not treated as an asset) will be able to be funded to 80% debt before the interest alloca- tion rules apply. This leaves an acceptable debt level of $14,400 (18,000 x 80%) in Taxpayer Co. The excess interest allocation to Taxpayer Co would, therefore, be $600 (15,000 – 14,400). from page 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 19 100% 100% NZ Parent NZ Sub CFC Debt No debt In the diagram above, rules that considered only the interest expense incurred by the company holding a direct interest in the CFC (NZ Sub) would not take into account interest expense incurred by other companies in the group (NZ Parent). Such rules would not be effective in determining the interest expense properly attributable to the income from the CFC because the loss grouping rules effectively allow the interest expense to be de- ducted anywhere in the group. 100% 100% NZ Parent Debt CFC NZ Sub The situation illustrated in this second diagram, in which a CFC is interposed between the two New Zealand group companies, is similar. If reference were made only to the company holding a direct interest in the CFC, the interest incurred by NZ Sub would not be considered in determining the amount of NZ Parent’s interest expense allocable to the income from the CFC. However, the loss grouping rules still enable NZ Parent to take advantage of the interest expense incurred by NZ Sub in determin- ing its taxable income. Consequently, if interest allocation rules are to be effective, they need to be defined in relation to the group of companies of which a taxpayer is a member. Measurement of “debt level” of foreign attributed income group (“NZ foreign attributed income group debt percentage”) The rules for calculating the group debt percentage are similar to those used for calculating the value of a group’s assets and debt under the thin capitalisation rules. Generally accepted accounting practices for consolidation are applied to the foreign attributed income group determined under section FH 2, eliminat- ing intra-group transactions within that group (section FH 3(1)). Section FH 3(3) contains the exception to the general rule of following a similar calculation approach to the one used under the thin capitalisation rules. Any interests held by a member of the foreign attributed income group in a CFC or FIF calculated under the accounting profits or branch equivalent methods from which gross income is derived (“non-grey list” CFCs and FIFs) are excluded from the assets of the group, to the extent non-residents hold interests in that group member. Excluding interests in non-grey list CFCs and FIF interests effectively permits the assets of the group other than these excluded assets to be debt-funded at least to the extent of the 66% safe harbour threshold. To the extent that the debt percentage of the consolidated group (including non-grey list CFC and FIF interests) is higher than 66%, a higher level of debt funding is permitted in the foreign attributed income group. Any debt in excess of 66% (or a higher amount calcu- lated for the consolidated group) is then treated by the rules as relating to the non-resident’s share of investment in non-grey list CFCs and FIFs, on which conduit relief is being provided. This represents interest expense for which an adjustment should, in principle, be made in determining the amount of conduit relief to which the company is entitled. How the interest expense allocation is performed is outlined below. Comparison of New Zealand debt level with that of CFC and FIF interests If taxpayers breach the 66% safe harbour, section FH 4 gives them the option of performing a consolidation calculation with their non-grey list CFC and FIF inter- ests. This determines whether, based on their consoli- dated group, a threshold of higher than 66% is justified for determining the extent to which there is an excessive interest expense allocation to the foreign attributed income group (the “worldwide fungibility approach” is applied to determine whether the allocation of the “worldwide group” to its New Zealand operations exceeds the debt levels borne by the group as a whole). If the taxpayer decides to calculate its “consolidated foreign attributed income group debt percentage” (including non-grey list CFC and FIF interests), section FH 4 requires the consolidation calculation to be made as follows: •The assets and debt of the New Zealand members of the group will be determined as under section FH 3, except that all interests held in non-grey list CFCs and FIFs calculated under the accounting profits or branch equivalent methods are now excluded from the assets of the group (effect of section FH 4(8)). •Full consolidation of assets and debt should be done for non-grey list CFC and FIF interests of 40% or greater (section FH 4(3)). •For interests of between 5% and 40%, taxpayers will include the portion of the underlying interest’s assets and debts owned by the taxpayer (section FH 4(4)). For example, if a New Zealand company held 10% of an underlying CFC or FIF, it would consolidate 10% of that interest’s debt and assets into its group calcula- tions. continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 20 conduit income, are contained in section FH 5. The formula in that section confirms that an interest alloca- tion can occur only to the extent that the debt percentage of the foreign attributed income group exceeds 66%. If the debt percentage of the consolidated group (including relevant CFCs and FIFs) is higher than 66%, an interest allocation can only occur if, and to the extent that, the debt percentage of the foreign attributed income group exceeds that of the consolidated group. Shorthand consolidation Section FH 5 permits a further debt percentage to be applied in determining the extent to which an excess interest allocation exists. This alternative represents a shorthand debt percentage calculation for the consoli- dated group. The example in the following diagram illustrates its effect. In the diagram, NZ Co (the only member in the foreign attributed income group) is 80% funded by debt. The interest expense on the $800 debt in NZ Co is $80. Half of its shares are owned by non-residents. NZ Co applies 50% of its capital to an investment in CFC, with the balance funding other (non-conduit) assets. NZ Co CFC Resident shareholders Non-resident shareholders Equity 100Equity 100 Equity 400 Debt 800 Debt 0 Other assets 600 Assets 400 The New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage for NZ Co is calculated as: 800 =100% 1,000 – (400 x 50%) Prima facie, because this debt percentage exceeds 66%, NZ Co will be subject to an excess interest allocation for the amount of New Zealand debt in excess of this amount. However, if Taxpayer Co were to perform a consolida- tion with CFC, the following consolidated balance sheet would result: Consolidated group Equity....................200Assets......................1,000 Debt.................... 800 1,0001,000 •Assets and debts for CFC and FIF interests should be consolidated using values from their existing financial statements (section FH 4(5)). Non-grey list CFC and FIF interests of less than 5% are excluded from the calculations, and are not included as an asset of the consolidated group. Example NZ Group Co is the only company in its foreign attributed income group. Its balance sheet is as follows: NZ Group Co Equity.................6,600CFC Co....................4,000 Debt..................18,000FIF Co 1...................4,000 FIF Co 2......................600 Other assets.............16,000 24,60024,600 NZ Group Co owns 80% of CFC Co, 25% of FIF Co 1, and 3% of FIF Co 2. The balance sheets of CFC Co, FIF Co 1 and FIF Co 2 are as follows: CFC Co Equity.................5,000Assets.....................13,000 Debt.................. 8,000 13,00013,000 FIF Co 1 Equity...............16,000Assets.....................24,000 Debt.................. 8,000 24,00024,000 FIF Co 2 Equity...............20,000Assets.....................60,000 Debt..................40,000 60,00060,000 The consolidated group debt percentage will be calcu- lated as follows: Consolidated debt: NZ Group Co:18,000 CFC Co:8,000 x 100% =8,000 FIF Co 1:8,000 x 25% =2,000 FIF Co 2: 0 28,000 Consolidated assets: NZ Group Co:16,000 CFC Co:13,000 x 100% =13,000 FIF Co 1:24,000 x 25% =6,000 FIF Co 2: 0 35,000 The consolidated group debt percentage will, therefore, be 80% (28,000/35,000). Determination of group excess interest allocation The rules for calculating whether a “group excess interest allocation amount” exists, and consequently whether interest expense must be allocated against from page 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 21 This would give a consolidated debt percentage of 80% (800/1000). Because this debt percentage exceeds 66%, using this percentage would reduce the amount of excess interest expense determined for NZ Co. One concern expressed in submissions on the bill is that taxpayers may be reluctant to incur the compliance costs associated with a full consolidation with non-grey list interests. This is despite the fact that such a consolida- tion may result in a lower amount of excess interest expense being determined. In response to this, the third limb added to variable CGDP in the formula in section FH 5 recognises that the scenario outlined above represents the worst-case mischief that the interest allocation rules were intended to address – a non-grey list entity owned 100% by a foreign attributed income group and fully equity funded. In practice, CFCs and FIF interests are likely to have debt levels that are greater than nil. Section FH 5 allows, therefore, a shorthand consolida- tion with non-grey list entities based on the assumption that the entities in which they invest are owned 100% by a foreign attributed income group and fully equity funded. This ignores debt in the underlying CFCs and FIFs. Mechanically, all this requires to measure is to undo the adjustment in section FH 3(3) for non-grey list CFC and FIF interests. In the example illustrated, the effect would be to com- pare the debt percentage of the foreign attributed income group (100%) with that of the consolidated group (80%). Applying these amounts in the formula in section FH 5 gives a $20 excess interest. The implications of the rule are best illustrated by considering the original scenario, but with CFC now funding additional assets by acquiring debt funding of its own. This is illustrated in the following diagram. NZ Co CFC Resident shareholders Non-resident shareholders Equity 100Equity 100 Equity 400 Debt 800 Debt 300 Other assets 600 Assets 700 In applying the shorthand test, the debt funding of the CFC is disregarded. As with the previous calculations, the consolidated assets will be $1,000 (the assets of NZ Co) and the consolidated debt will be $800 (the debt of NZ Co), giving a consolidated debt percentage of 80%. From this, it is clear that the shorthand consolida- tion internalises all data to the New Zealand group. It is illustrative however, to consider what happens if a full consolidation is performed with CFC. In that case, the consolidated assets will be $1,300 ($600 + $700), the consolidated debt will be $1,100 ($800 + $300), giving a consolidated debt percentage of 84.6% ($1,100/$1,300). This is higher than the percentage calculated under the shorthand consolidation, and would lead to a lower excess interest allocation determination. In summary, therefore, the shorthand consolidation is a low-compliance cost option of performing the full consolidation calculation which, although being in all but very obscure scenarios less beneficial to the taxpayer than a full consolidation, is nevertheless more favourable than the position if no consolidation is performed at all. Application of excess interest allocation against foreign attributed income If the application of the formula in section FH 5 deter- mines that there is an excess interest allocation, the next question is how that should be applied. The general rule is the excess is to be allocated against the net foreign attributed income (foreign attributed income less foreign attributed losses offset) derived by members of the group under sections FH 6 and FH 7. If the excess is greater than the net foreign attributed income, any surplus is then allocated under section FH 8 against dividends subject to DWP. Determination of net foreign attributed income The effect of the formula in section FH 6 is to determine what percentage the excess interest expense represents of the group’s net foreign attributed income. Section FH 7 then determines that percentage of a group mem- ber’s net foreign attributed income to be its share of the excess interest allocation. This amount is then substi- tuted in the variable “EIA” in the formula in section KH 1(2) to determine the amount of conduit relief (if any) to which the member is entitled. An amendment was made at Select Committee to clarify that the income base against which the excess interest expense is to be allocated is reduced by the income equivalent value of any BETA debit able to be offset against the income tax liability. This is because income tax is only really payable to the extent a BETA offset does not occur. It is not appropriate that interest expense is allocated against income on which no tax is payable because it has been paid in an alternative form. continued on page 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 22 When this amount is applied back into section KH 1(2), conduit relief is determined to be exactly nil: 60% x ((33% x (15,000 – 0 – 5,000)) – 0 – 3,300) The excess interest allocation of $7,000 ($12,000 – $5,000) will be applied against Vice Versa Ltd’s DWP liability under section FH 8. The application of the rules in section FH 8 are discussed in the section that follows. Application of excess interest allocation against DWP If the amount of interest expense allocated to all mem- bers of the foreign attributed income group under section FH 7 is less than the amount calculated in applying section FH 5 in respect of the group, the difference is applied against foreign-sourced dividends derived by members of the group from which a DWP is required to be deducted using the formulae in section FH 7. The first step is to convert the excess amount into its tax cash value, by multiplying the excess by the company tax rate. This tax cash value is then allocated against the DWP liabilities of the companies calculated before the provision of conduit tax relief. To the extent that an allocation is made, the following results: •An amount of gross income equal to the allocated tax cash value divided by the company tax rate is derived by the company under section FH 8(3). •A debit will arise in the company’s CTR account equal to the foreign dividend adjustment amount calculated under section FH 8(5) (section MI 5(1)(b)). This amount is determined by multiplying the amount of gross income by the company tax rate. The reason for an additional amount of gross income under section FH 8(3) requires explanation. It traces back to the position that would have resulted had the company derived foreign attributed income subject to the interest allocation rules, and then used the BETA credit arising from that liability to meet the subsequent DWP liability. In that case, tax on the foreign attributed income would have been credited to the DWP account of the company under section ME 5(6) only to the extent of tax on the income net of the interest allocation. This gives a lower credit to the DWP account than if an equivalent gross dividend had been received. The additional amount of gross income under section FH 8(3) addresses this inconsistency. It ensures that deriving dividends before foreign attributed income does not result in more favourable balances in the memoran- dum account of the company than if foreign attributed income were derived first (DWP credits in preference to ICA credits). Example Vice Versa Ltd derived a foreign-sourced dividend of $10,000 on 1 July 1998. No foreign withholding tax was deducted and the company had no entitle- ment for an underlying foreign tax credit. Vice Versa Ltd is the only company in its foreign attrib- uted income group. Because it had 60% non-resident shareholders, the DWP liability on the dividend was reduced by $1,980 ($3,300 x 60%) from $3,300 ($10,000 x 33%) to $1,320. A debit arose to the BETA for $3,300. Vice Versa Ltd subsequently derived foreign attributed income of $15,000. Again, no foreign tax credit was available. Vice Versa Ltd continued to have 60% non-resident shareholders. In applying the relief formula in section KH 1, variable BC, for BETA offsets, will be $3,300. Because there are no foreign tax credits, relief will, in the absence of an excess interest allocation, be determined as: 60% x ((33% x (15,000 – 0 – 0)) – 0 – 3,300) = $990 Tax will be payable of $660 ($15,000 x 33%, less $3,300 BETA debit, less $990 conduit relief). Overall, therefore, Vice Versa Co will pay tax of $1,980 ($1,320 DWP plus $660 income tax), and receive conduit relief of $2,970 ($1,980 on DWP and $990 on foreign attributed income). Thus the pre-conduit relief tax base is $4,950 ($1,980 tax plus $2,970 relief). As it turns out. Vice Versa Ltd has an excess interest allocation under section FH 5 of $12,000. This has a tax equivalent value of $3,960 ($12,000 x 33%). What the rules in sections FH 6 and FH 7 aim to achieve is to apply this tax equivalent value against the tax payable on conduit income. Thus in princi- ple, the excess interest allocation is to be offset first against the pre-conduit relief income tax liability of $1,650 ($660 tax plus $990 relief), with the excess applied against the DWP liability. Applying the formula in section FH 6 to Vice Versa Ltd, the company’s excess interest allocation percentage would be determined as: $12,000 x 33% = 240% 33% x ($15,000 – 0) – $3,300 Because this percentage exceeds 100%, the variable EIAP in section FH 7 will be 100%. This results in an excess interest allocation for Vice Versa Ltd under section FH 7 to be included in section KH 1(2) of: (15,000 – 0 – $3,300 ) x 100% = $5,000 33% from page 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 23 Example The application of the rules in section NH 7 is illustrated by revisiting Vice Versa Ltd. Recall that Vice Versa Ltd had an excess interest allocation unable to be applied under section FH 7 of $7,000. This is the surplus group excess interest allocation amount calculated under section FH 8(1). The formula in section FH 8(2) then calculates the company’s surplus group excess interest allocation percentage as: $7,000 x 33% =70% $3,300 Applying this percentage into the variable SGEIP in section FH 8(4) then enables the company’s foreign dividend adjustment to be calculated as: $3,300 x 70% =$7,000 33% Under section FH 8(3), the company is deemed to have derived an amount of gross income equal to this amount on the last day of its income year. A debit will also arise to its CTR account under section MI 5(1)(b) of $2,310 ($7,000 x 33%). Detailed example of effect of excess interest allocation against DWP A taxpayer’s foreign attributed income group consists of three members, A Co, B Co and C Co. Following the application of section FH 7 (allocation of excess interest expense against foreign attributed income), a surplus group excess interest amount of $700 is determined under section FH 8(1). The companies have 31 March balance dates, and have respective DWP liabilities for the year to 31 March 1999 as follows: A CoB CoC Co Gross dividends derived10,0008,00016,000 UFTC5,00004,000 Foreign withholding tax 1,000 2,400 DWP payable02,640200 BETA offsets( 640)0 Loss offsets ( 500) 0 01,500200 Conduit relief(600)(20) Net DWP paid 0900180 Balance in CTR account0600 CR20 CR Balance in DWP account0900 CR180 CR B Co’s average percentage of non-resident shareholders was 40%, while C Co’s was 10%. The first step is to convert the excess interest allocation to its tax cash value of $231 ($700 x 33%). This tax cash value is then allocated against the net DWP liabilities of members of the group, determined before the provision of conduit relief. The relevant amounts are ‘nil’ for A Co, $1,500 for B Co and $200 for C Co. Application of the formula in section FH 8(1) determines a surplus group excess interest allocation percentage of 13.59% ( 231 / (1,500 + 200) ). This percentage is then applied as follows: A Co:$0 x 13.59%=$ 0 B Co:$1,500 x 13.59%=$204 C Co:$200 x 13.59%=$ 27 In relation to B Co, the following would then result: •Under section FH 8(3), an amount of gross income of $618 ( 204 / 0.33 ) would be derived on the last day of the 1998/99 income year. •A debit will arise in the company’s CTR account for $82 (equal to $618 x 33% x 40% average non-resident shareholding) under section MI 5(1)(b)). As a consequence, B Co would have paid tax and have credits in its memorandum accounts as follows: Total DWP paid$900= $ 900 Income tax paid$618 x 33%= $ 204 Balance in ICA$618 x 33%= $ 204 Balance in DWP account$900= $ 900 Balance in CTR Account$600 – $82= $ 518 Detailed interest allocation rules example Introduction The Commentary to the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) Bill (No.2) 1997 contained a detailed example of the application of the interest allocation rules. The purpose of that example was to illustrate the overall effect of the rules in their entirety, rather than only aspects of the rules which have been discussed elsewhere in this Tax Information Bulletin. This section reproduces the example in the Commentary to the bill, but has been modified to take into account changes made to the bill at Select Committee. continued on page 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 24 NZ Co 2 Share capital......20,000Shares in AP FIF 2.60,000 Other shareholders’Loan to funds................180,000NZ Co 1..............800,000 Loan from CFC200,000Other assets.........340,000 Other “tax” debt.........700,000 Other “non-tax” debt 100,000 1,200,0001,200,000 For the year to 31 March 1999, NZ Co 2 had the follow- ing relevant income and expenses: FIF income from AP FIF 2..................................6,231 Interest expense under section DD 1(b).............150,000 CFC CFC’s accounting period ended on 31 December 1998. Relevant amounts from its balance sheet at that date are as follows: CFC Share capital....500,000Loan to NZ Co 2..............200,000 Other shareholders’ funds............... 356,200Other assets......1,281,200 Liabilities....... 625,000 1,481,2001,481,200 AP FIF 1 Because the total interests of members of the foreign attributed income group in AP FIF 1 is less than 5%, it is not included in the consolidated foreign attributed income group debt percentage calculations under section FH 4. AP FIF 2 AP FIF 2 prepares its financial statements to 28 February 1999. Relevant amounts from its balance sheet at that date are as follows: AP FIF 2 Share capital....200,000Assets.................500,000 Other shareholders’ funds................150,000 Liabilities.........150,000 500,000500,000 Step 1: Identify the foreign attributed income group (section FH 2) Because NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 are both subject to the thin capitalisation rules, by virtue of a single non- resident person (Non-resident) holding in them an ownership interest of 50% or greater (section FG 2), the thin capitalisation rules apply to determine the foreign attributed income group. The group will consist, there- fore, of NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2. Example The following example is designed to illustrate the effect of the interest allocation rules, and their interface with the formula for determining conduit relief in section KH 1. The structure is deliberately convoluted to illustrate the various interfaces in the rules. Calculations are to be performed for the income year ending 31 March 1999. Non-resident NZ Co 1 NZ Co 2CFC 75% 60% 80% 25% NZ residents 40% AP FIF 2 30% AP FIF 1 3% Non-residents 20% Relevant information and balance sheets for the various companies is as follows: NZ Co 1 NZ Co 1’s income year ended on 31 March 1999.

Relevant amounts from its balance sheet at that date are as follows: from page 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 25 Step 2: Calculate New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage (section FH 3) The New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage is determined by applying the thin capitalisa- tion rules in section FG 4(1) to (14D) to the foreign attributed income group (NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2). The most significant factors to bear in mind here are that: •Section FG 4(2) defines debt on the basis on financial arrangements that provide funds to the recipient and give rise to a deduction for “interest” expense. This differs from the concept of debt used in preparing financial statements. •Assets are measured based on generally accepted accounting principles of New Zealand (section FG 4(3) to (4)). Assets held by group members in non-grey list CFCs and FIFs calculated under the accounting profits and branch equivalent methods are also excluded from the asset base to the extent that non-residents hold a direct interest in the New Zealand company holding those CFC and FIF interests. The asset and debt values for the foreign attributed income group comprising NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 are, therefore, calculated as follows. Assets:NZ Co 1’s total assets.......................2,246,800 NZ Co 2’s total assets.......................1,200,000 Less:NZ Co 1’s equity in NZ Co 2...............(15,000) 60% of NZ Co 1’s equity in CFC.......(240,000) 60% of NZ Co 1’s equity in AP FIF 1....(1,800) 25% of NZ Co 2’s equity in AP FIF 2..(15,000) Loan from NZ Co 2 to NZ Co 1......( 800,000 ) Total assets.......................................2,375,000 Debt:Other “tax” debt of NZ Co 1.............1,000,000 Other “tax” debt of NZ Co 2............. 700,000 Loan from CFC to NZ Co 2........... 200,000 Total debt.........................................1,900,000 This results in a New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage of 80% ( 1,900,000 / 2,375,000 ). (Note: The thin capitalisation rules will not have any effect here, because the New Zealand group debt percentage for thin capitalisation purposes is only 72.2% ( 1,900,000 / 2,631,800 ).) Step 3: Test whether the New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage exceeds 66% As the New Zealand foreign attributed income group debt percentage does exceed 66%, there is, prima facie, an adjustment to be made for an excess interest alloca- tion under section FH 5. The group must now decide whether to pursue a consolidation including its CFC and FIF interests under section FH 4. Shorthand consolidation If NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 do not want to pursue a full consolidation with CFC, AP FIF 1 and AP FIF 2 under section FH 4, they could consider how the shorthand consolidation would determine their excess interest allocation. In performing this calculation, the assets of the foreign attributed income group would not be adjusted to remove the non-resident shareholders’ share of equity in non-grey list entities. The group’s assets would be calculated as: NZ Co 1’s total assets...................................2,246,800 NZ Co 2’s total assets...................................1,200,000 NZ Co 1’s equity in NZ Co 2...........................(15,000) Loan from NZ Co 2 to NZ Co 1..................( 800,000) Group’s total assets......................................2,631,800 The group’s debt remains as 1,900,000, giving a consoli- dated group debt percentage of 72.2% ( 1,900,000 / 2,631,800 ). As this percentage is higher than the 66% safe harbour percentage, the shorthand consolidation can make the group better off. If the company does not perform the calculation under section FH 4, section FH 5 can be applied to determine the group excess interest allocation amount using 72.2% as the threshold percentage, rather than the 66% safe harbour percentage (step 5 of the process). Step 4: Calculate consolidated foreign attributed income group debt percentage (section FH 4) If the taxpayer proceeds with a full consolidation with its group’s offshore interests, the asset and debt values calculated at step 2 form the starting point for the further calculations. Adjustments are then made as required by section FH 4. First, the assets of the foreign attributed income group are further reduced to the extent of resident sharehold- ers’ share of its CFC and FIF interests (section FH 3(3)): Adjustment for NZ Co 1’s equity in CFC: 40% x 400,000 =160,000 Adjustment for NZ Co 1’s equity in AP FIF 1: 40% x 3,000 =1,200 Adjustment for NZ Co 2’s equity in AP FIF 2: 75% x 60,000 = 45,000 Total adjustment:206,200 Second, consolidation with the CFC and FIF interests is performed following the rules in section FH 4(3) to (5). In doing this: •100% of the assets and debt of CFC are consolidated into the calculation; •30% of the assets and debt of AP FIF 2 are consoli- dated into the calculation; •AP FIF 1’s assets and debt are disregarded because the foreign attributed income group’s interest is less than 5%. continued on page 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 26 (Note: Because the debt percentage calculated using the shorthand consolidation at step 3 exceeds the 66% safe harbour percentage and the consolidated group debt percentage (65.8%), this is the percentage applied in the section FH 5 formula.) Step 6: Determine allocation of excess interest expense between group members The next step in the process is to apply the excess interest allocation rules in section FH 6. As a starting point, this requires the amount of foreign attributed income to be identified to which relief may potentially apply. In the example, this will be the following income: NZ Co 1’s attributed foreign income from CFC..60,000 NZ Co 1’s FIF income from AP FIF 1................10,000 NZ Co 2’s FIF income from AP FIF 2.................6,231 Total foreign attributed income...........................76,231 Applying this amount to the formula in section FH 6, an excess interest allocation percentage of 34.56% is determined ( 26,345 / 76,231 ). The formula in section FH 7 then allocates 34.56c interest against each dollar of net foreign attributed income (in the formula, foreign attributed income less foreign attributed income losses offset). The excess interest allocated to NZ Co 1 will, therefore, be $24,192 (70,000 x 34.56%). The excess interest allocated to NZ Co 2 will be $2,153 (6,231 x 34.56%). Step 7: Determine amount of conduit relief Because all of the interest expense has been allocated against foreign attributed income, it is not necessary to consider whether the rules in section FH 8 relating to the allocation of excess interest expense against DWP apply. This means that all that remains to be determined is the amount of conduit relief arising under section KH 1(2). Application of the formula in section KH 1(2) will determine relief for NZ Co 1 as: 60% x ((33% x (70,000 – 0 – 24,192)) – 12,500 – 0) = $1,570. Application of the formula in section KH 1(2) will determine relief for NZ Co 2 as: 25% x ((33% x (6,321 – 2,153)) – 0 – 0) = $344. The asset and debt of the consolidated foreign attributed income group are, therefore, determined as follows: Assets:Foreign attributed income group’s total assets........................................2,375,000 Less:Adjustment for residents’ share of CFC and FIF interests........................(206,200) Add:100% of CFC's assets.......................1,481,200 Less:Loan from CFC to NZ Co 2...............(200,000) Add:30% of AP FIF 2’s assets.................. 150,000 Total assets.......................................3,600,000 Debt:Foreign attributed income group’s total debt..............................1,900,000 Less:Loan from CFC to NZ Co 2...............(200,000) Add:100% of CFC’s debt............................625,000 30% of AP FIF 2’s debt.................... 45,000 Total debt.........................................2,370,000 This results in a consolidated foreign attributed income group debt percentage of 65.8% ( 2,370,000 / 3,600,000 ). Because this percentage is less than 66%, the interest allocation rules continue to apply on the basis of the 66% safe harbour threshold (subject to any higher percentage calculated using the shorthand consolida- tion). The group is not forced to now apply the interest allocation rules on the basis of the lower 65.8% consoli- dated foreign attributed income group debt percentage (section FH 5). Step 5: Determine excess interest allocation amount (section FH 5) The first step in determining the excess interest alloca- tion amount under section FH 5 is to identify the amount of interest for the foreign attributed income group that is deductible under section DD 1(b), less any interest paid on loans between members of the group. In the example, this is calculated as follows: Interest expense allowable to NZ Co 1 under section DD 1(b).....................................200,000 Interest expense allowable to NZ Co 2 under section DD 1(b).....................................150,000 Less: interest paid on intra-group loan from NZ Co 2 to NZ Co 1.............................( 80,000 ) Total relevant interest expense.........................270,000 This amount is then inserted into the formula in section FH 5 to determine a group excess interest allocation amount of: 270,000 x (80% – 72.2%) = $26,345\* 80% \* 72.2% is a rounded number. The calculation has been made using the actual percentage, which is calculated as $1,900,000 ÷ $2,631,800. from page 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 27 Local authority trading enterprises Sections CB 4, OB 1 Introduction The amendment has removed the charitable and district improvement income tax exemptions for local authority trading enterprises (LATEs) and local authority income derived from LATEs. Background The Act provides that income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes, or derived from a business carried on by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, trustees in trust for charitable purposes within New Zealand is exempt from tax. Charitable purpose is defined to include “the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community”. The commercial activities carried by most, if not all, LATEs could probably be considered beneficial to the community, so qualifying them for an income tax exemption. It is also likely that the commercial activities of LATEs would also qualify for the district improve- ment income tax exemption. This exemption is provided for societies or associations established substantially or primarily for the purpose of developing any city, borough or district, so as to attract trade, tourists or population, or to develop amenities for the general public. These exemptions may also extend to certain income derived by local authorities. Income derived by local authorities is, generally speaking, exempt from income tax. However, this exemption does not include income derived from LATEs. In 1989 the Government enacted legislation to ensure that LATEs and income derived by local authorities from LATEs were taxable. This was to ensure as much competitive neutrality with the private sector as possible. The ability of local authorities and LATEs to obtain a charitable or district improvement income tax exemption is clearly inconsistent with the policy intent of the 1989 legislation. Key features Section CB 4 has been amended to ensure that charitable income tax exemptions under subsections CB 4(1)(c) and (e) and the district improvement income tax exemp- tion under subsection CB 4(1)(j) do not apply to LATEs and local authority income derived from LATEs. Application date The amendment applies from the 1999/00 income year. Terminal tax date Sections MC 1, MC 2, NC 17, OB 1 Income Tax Act 1994 Sections 3, 37(4A) Tax Administration Act 1994 Charitable organisations - addition Section KC 5(1) The New Zealand Viet Nam Health Trust has been granted charitable donee status. From the 1998/99 income year, donations made to the Trust will entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated. The maximum rebate for all donations is $500 per annum. A company (other than a closely held company) will be entitled to a deduction from net income up to the amount prescribed by section DJ 4. Introduction The terminal tax date for taxpayers with a tax agent has been extended by two months. The new terminal tax date for taxpayers with a March to September balance date moves from 7 February to 7 April if they have an agent. The change is intended to reduce exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest and reduce compliance costs. The terminal tax date for taxpayers without an agent is not changed. For a standard or late balance date tax- payer, the terminal tax payment date remains 7 February. The change in the terminal tax date will also apply to ACC premiums paid by self-employed taxpayers. Background At present, about 270,000 taxpayers have to consider making a terminal tax payment on 7 February, although their return of income and the calculation of the tax payable is not due until 31 March. Taxpayers and their agents incur substantial compliance costs in preparing an income estimate to determine the amount of terminal tax that should be paid on 7 Febru- ary. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New continued on page 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 28 made in accordance with section NC 17(1) is due as follows: •on 7 February; •on 7 April, if the taxpayer’s return of income to which the assessment relates was linked to a tax agent; or •on an earlier date specified in the notice of assessment. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended by adding the definition of the term “tax agent”. A tax agent is a person who prepares the annual returns for ten or more taxpayers and who: •carries on a professional public practice; or •carries on a business in which annual returns are prepared; or •is the Maori Trustee. Section OB 1 has also been amended to include the term “linked to a tax agent”. This term which is used in sections MC 1, MC 2 and NC 17 is required to ensure that the proposed deferral of the terminal tax date applies to returns filed by agents or prepared by agents. Section 37(4) of the Tax Administration Act has been redrafted to reflect the definition of the term “tax agent”. An amendment is also made to clarify that the return being to referred to in the section is not the tax agent’s return. A new section 37(4A) has been inserted to provide that the Commissioner may refuse to extend a tax agent’s time for filing a particular return or cancel an existing extension if the taxpayer has furnished a required return of income for a prior income year. Application date The amendment applies to the 1997/98 income and subsequent years except in the case of the provisions specified. Provisional tax uplift factors Section MB 2 Introduction The amendment adjusts the provisional tax uplift factors to take into account the tax rate reductions for natural persons. With the tax rate reductions applying from 1 July 1998, the use of last year’s tax liability to deter- mine the amount of provisional tax payable this year would lead to natural persons overpaying their provi- sional tax if no adjustment were made. Background The provisional tax regime provides that taxpayers with significant income not subject to sufficient withholding tax must pay their tax in three instalments during the year on the basis of a prior year’s tax liability plus an uplift factor or on the basis of an estimate of their tax liability. With the tax rate reductions from 1 July 1998, using last year’s tax liability to determine the amount of provi- sional tax payable this year would lead to natural persons overpaying their provisional tax. If no adjust- ment were made to the last year’s payment basis, taxpayers would either overpay their tax or estimate their tax liability. To limit the number of cases in which this occurs an adjustment has been made to the provisional tax uplift factors to take into account the tax rate reduc- tions for natural persons. Zealand has estimated the compliance cost associated with the current practice at $22 million. The amendments deal with these compliance cost concerns by extending the terminal tax payment date for taxpayers whose tax return is prepared by a tax agent. Key features Section MC 1(2) has been amended to provide that the terminal tax of a provisional taxpayer is due and payable on the month specified in column E of Schedule 13 if the taxpayer has a tax agent, and on the month specified in column D of that schedule in any other case. This amendment applies solely to the 1997/98 income year. Section MC 1(2) applies from the 1998/99 income year. A new subsection MC 1(4) is inserted to ensure that provision provides the required extension for returns prepared by agents. This subsection applies from the 1998/99 income year. Schedule 13 has been amended by inserting a new column E which sets out the month for payment of terminal tax when a taxpayer has an agent. Section MC 2(1) has been amended to provide that the terminal tax date of a non-resident company which does not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand is 7 April if the company has a tax agent. Section MC 2(2) has been amended to provide that the terminal tax of any person is due on the month specified in column E of Schedule 13 if the person has a tax agent, and on the month specified in column D of that schedule in any other case. This amendment applies to the 1997/98 income year with the section inserted applying for 1998/99 and subsequent income years. Section MC 2(3) is inserted to ensure that provision applies correctly. Section NC 17(2) has been amended to provide that the income tax payable by an employee under an assessment from page 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 29 Taxing extra employment income and secondary income Sections NC 2, NC 8(1A) Key features Section MB 2 has been amended so that: •When a natural person’s taxable income for the immediately preceding income year does not exceed $75,000, and the previous year’s tax return has been filed, the person’s provisional tax liability for the current year is 100% of last year’s residual income tax. •When a natural person’s taxable income for the income year before the immediately preceding income year does not exceed $75,000, and the previous year’s tax return has not been filed, the person’s provisional tax liability for the current year is 105% of the residual income tax for the income year before the immediately preceding income year. These adjustments do not apply to taxpayers who estimate their provisional tax liability or for whom the Commissioner determines liability. Application date The amendment applies to provisional tax instalments for the 1998/99 income year due on or after 7 July 1998. Introduction Before these amendments were made, the PAYE regime systematically under-deducted tax from the earnings of those taxpayers paying income tax at the top marginal tax rate of 33%. A number of amendments have being made to increase the PAYE scheme’s flexibility and to reduce the likelihood of under-deduction. These measures are consistent with the Government’s overall objective of simplifying the tax system and they support further reductions in filing tax returns. Background The PAYE system provided that both extra employment income and secondary employment earnings were subject to a withholding tax rate of 24% (which reduces to 21% from 1 July 1998) unless an employee applied for a special tax code. Depending on an employee’s annual income, he or she may have faced an annual tax debit because too little tax has been withheld from that extra employment income or secondary employment income. These measures have been introduced to avoid such debits arising, thereby improving the accuracy of the PAYE system. The changes also prevent employees with significant extra emoluments or secondary employ- ment income being forced into the provisional tax system if their residual income tax exceeds $2,500. Key features Section NC 2(4) provides that employers will be re- quired to apply a 33% withholding rate to extra employ- ment income if the combined total of the extra income and the annualised value of the source deduction pay- ments paid to the employee by the employer in the last four weeks exceed $38,000. The provision applies only to the annualised value of the last four weeks paid to that employee by that employer. No payments by other employers or from other income sources are required to be included in the calculation. Examples Example 1: Employee paid weekly An employee receives the following salary and extra emolument payments: Pay dayWageExtra emolument 30 September 1998$1,000 $0 7 October 1998$1,000 $0 14 October 1998$1,000 $0 21 October 1998$1,000$4,000 The total value of the source deduction payments paid to the employee in the last four weeks is $4,000. These payments represent an annual salary of $52,000 ($4,000 x 52 weeks ÷ 4 weeks). Adding the extra emolument of $4,000 provides an esti- mated annual salary of $56,000. As this expected salary exceeds $38,000 the employer is required to withhold at 33% from the $4,000 extra emolument payment. Example 2: Employee paid monthly An employee receives monthly payments compris- ing the following salary and extra emolument payments: Pay daySalaryExtra emolument 30 September 1998$4,000$1,000 The total value of the source deduction payments paid to the employee in the four weeks includes the payment of salary for September. This payment represents an annual salary of $48,000 ($4,000 x 12 months ÷ 1 month). Adding the extra emolument of $1,000 provides an estimated annual salary of $49,000. As this expected salary exceeds $38,000 the employer is required to withhold at 33% from the $4,000 extra emolument payment. A new paragraph NC 8(1A) has been inserted. This allows employees, via a tax code declaration, to elect continued on page 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 30 NC 8(1A) applies. Similarly the schedule has been amended by inserting a new clause 5A which provides that 33% is the withholding tax rate for secondary employment earnings if an employee has elected the “SH” tax code. Application date The amendments apply to tax deductions from payments of salary or wages or extra employment income for pay periods ending on or after 1 July 1998. Creating forestry right for oneself Section OB 1 Introduction The Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to ensure that land owners do not incur a tax liability when they create forestry rights for themselves. Background A new section 2A has been inserted in the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 to allow land owners to create a forestry right for themselves. This amendment is contained the Statutes Amendment Bill (No.2), which at the time this TIB went to print was still before Parlia- ment. A supporting amendment to the Income Tax Act was required to ensure that land owners do not incur a tax liability when they create a forestry right for them- selves. The amendment solves a problem faced by many small forestry owners who want to sell their land but retain ownership of their trees. Key features Subparagraph (c)(i) of the section OB 1 definition of “sale or other disposition” has been amended to exclude a forestry right created for oneself. This amendment means that creating a forestry right does not result in a tax liability under section CJ 1. Application date The amendment applies from the 1997/98 and subse- quent income years but will not take effect until the Statutes Amendment Bill (No.2) has been passed. Overpayments arising under the student loan scheme Section 56, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Introduction An amendment has been made to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 to allow the Commissioner to offset an annual student loan overpayment against a borrower’s student loan balance, if the borrower has not indicated to Inland Revenue that he or she wishes the overpayment to be refunded. Borrowers are given six months from the date of the notice of assessment to apply for the whole, or part, of the overpayment to be refunded. Background Previously, if borrowers had paid more than their minimum repayment obligation for an income year, and they did not indicate to Inland Revenue that they wished the overpayment to be credited against their loan balance, the overpayment was refunded. A significant number of borrowers in this situation received refunds of payments that were intended to reduce their loan bal- ance. Key features Section 56 has been amended to provide that if a bor- rower has not indicated how an overpayment is to be applied, it will be offset against his or her loan balance. Borrowers are given six months from the date of their notice of assessment to apply for the whole, or part, of the overpayment to be refunded. Application date The amendment applies to overpayments arising on or after 1 April 1998. that a 33% deduction rate applies to any extra emolu- ment payments. Employees with more than one employer are able to request that a 33% withholding rate apply to secondary employment. This is done by way of electing a “SH” code which has been inserted as a paragraph (da) in subsection NC 8(1). Clause 8 of Schedule 19 has been amended to provide that 33% is the withholding tax rate for extra employ- ment income when either new sections NC 2(5) or from page 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 31 National standard cost values and national average market values for specified livestock Sections EL 3A, El 4, EL 8 Introduction This amendment provides that the national standard cost values and the national average market values for specified livestock should be set by the Commissioner rather than by Order in Council The current release dates for these values cause undue pressure on both taxpayers and their agents in calculating tax payments. The new process will allow the values to be released approxi- mately two weeks earlier than is currently the case. Background Section EL 4 provides for the Governor-General to declare, by Order in Council, the national standard costs for each category of specified livestock. Section EL 8 provides that the Governor-General may also, by Order in Council, declare a national average market value in relation to a class of specified livestock. When the regime was introduced, the process of setting the values was seen as a potentially significant issue. However, the process has become routine, and is, in principle, no different from the way the Commissioner determines depreciation rates. Given this and the fact that the delays involved in the current process are imposing a significant compliance Return filing requirements Section 33A Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction An amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 removes the requirement for student loan borrowers to file a tax return for an income year if their loan has been fully repaid during that income year. Background Student loan borrowers are required to file an annual tax return to establish their repayment obligation and any entitlement to a base interest write-off. If a borrower repays his or her loan during an income year, the only reason for requiring a return is to calculate any entitle- ment to a base interest write-off. The vast majority of borrowers do not receive a base interest write-off in the final year of repayment. Requiring a return in the final year of repayment imposes unnecessary compliance costs on borrowers who are not otherwise required to file a tax return. Key features An amendment to section 33A removes the requirement for student loan borrowers, who are not otherwise required to file a tax return, to file a tax return for an income year if their loan is fully repaid during that income year. Borrowers entitled to a base interest write-off will still receive it, but only if they file a tax return. The IR 5 and IR 3 tax guides will contain a statement on the possibil- ity of a base interest write-off and Inland Revenue will advise borrowers of this by letter when the loan is repaid. Application date The amendment applies from the 1998/99 income year. Cancellation of interest on student loan repayments Section 60A, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Introduction The amendment has added a new section 60A to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. The amendment provides for interest that has accrued subsequent to a borrower being notified of the amount of the student loan balance outstanding to be cancelled when the loan, and any interest that has accrued to the date of the notification, is paid in full within 15 days of the notifica- tion. Background Borrowers who fully repay their student loan during an income year may accrue small amounts of interest between the date they are notified by Inland Revenue of the total amount outstanding and the date on which they pay that amount. This often necessitates a further small payment. Key features If Inland Revenue notifies a borrower of the amount of his or her student loan, including any accrued interest, and the borrower pays this in full within 15 days, any interest accruing after the date of notification will be cancelled. Application date The amendment applies to notifications issued on or after 1 June 1998. continued on page 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 32 Commissioner may determine (as is currently the case) the methods by which livestock are to be valued under the national standard cost scheme. Section EL 8 has been amended to provide that Commis- sioner may declare those values. A requirement that the Commissioner gazette those values has also been introduced. Application date The application date of these measures is date of enact- ment. The effect of this is that the national average market values for the 1997/98 income year will be set by Commissioner’s determination. Minor remedial issues Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: remedial amendments resulting from the Customs and Excise Act 1996 Reference amendments Sections 1(2) and 2(1) The reference to section 13 in subsection 1(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been removed. Section 13 was repealed by the Customs and Excise Act 1996. The reference in section 2(1), definition of “input tax” to the Customs Act 1966 is replaced with a reference to the Customs and Excise Act 1996. These amendments bring the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in line with the changes resulting from the Customs and Excise Act 1996. The amendments are deemed to apply from 1 October 1996, the application date of the Customs and Excise Act 1996. “Directly in connection with” Section 11(2)(ca) The amendment restores the phrase “directly in connec- tion with” in section 11(2)(ca) after the Customs and Excise Act 1996 replaced it with the phrase “in relation to”. The amendment will apply from 1 October 1996 (the application date of the Customs and Excise Act 1996). However, if registered persons have furnished returns before 18 November 1997, which pertain to taxable periods ending between 30 September 1996 and 18 No- vember 1997, and have relied on the phrase “in relation to”, the amendment applies from 18 November 1997. Introduction A number of minor drafting amendments have been made to the newly enacted provisional tax regime and the compliance and penalty regime. Background These measures are minor drafting corrections or clarifications. Key features The definition of “instalment date” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 refers to all instalments being due on the 7th of the month, when instalments in January are due on the 15th of the month. The definition has been amended to include a reference to the 15th of the month, if the month is January. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “first business day” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act has been amended by replacing the words “ceased to derive” with “derived”. Section 183H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that taxpayers may request remission of liabilities in writing. The section has been amended to make clear that the provision applies to sections 183A and 183D of the Tax Administration Act. Application date The application date for the first two minor amendments is 1 October 1997 while the application date for the amendment to section 183H is the date of enactment. costs on some taxpayers and their advisors, the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to allow the Commis- sioner to determine the values. No change in consultation will occur with this proposal. In practice, more time may actually be made available for consultation, given the simpler process for promul- gating the values themselves. Key features The existing section EL 4 has been split into a new section EL 3A (the Commissioner may issue a determi- nation as to the national standard costs of livestock) and an amended section EL 4 which provides that the from page 31 Credit card transaction duty repealed A supplementary Order paper to the bill amended the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, to repeal credit card transaction duty from 1 April 1998. It confirms that EFT-POS transactions and certain ATM withdrawals are not subject to the duty, and never have been. These amendments will bwe described in more detail in the May Tax Information Bulletin. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 33 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Foreign currency amounts – conversion to NZ currency The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 1998. In the past we’ve published these rates in an annual IR 270G form. However, we now publish them six-monthly in the Tax Information Bulletin instead. The final IR 270G form was to 31 March 1997. The conversion rates for the first six months of each income year are published following the end of the September quarter, and the rates for the full 12 months rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign cur- rency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equiva- lent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key x y xis the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. yis the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 1997. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.1426 = NZ$38,890.83 A similar calculation would be needed for a FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is a FIF) for 350,000 pesos on 7 December 1997. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ÷ 20.6183 = NZ$16,975.21 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x” which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 1997 and has a balance date of 30 Novem- ber 1997. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i)Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-November 1997: (0.9963 + 0.9824 + 0.9586 + 0.9717 + 0.9563 + 0.9927 + 0.9834) ÷ 7 = 0.9773 (ii)Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9773 = NZ$511,613.63 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 12 month period ending 31 March 1998. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •items “a” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and “c” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula •foreign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 31 December 1997 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 31 December 1997 (item “a” of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB 500,000 ÷ 26.7376 = NZ$18,700.26 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible. continued on page 34-35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 34 Table A: Mid-month and 12 month

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 42 Woven reflective mulch Draft general depreciation determination We have been advised that there is currently no general depreciation rate for woven reflective mulch used in the agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture industries. The mulch is a fabric which is placed under trees or vines to reflect solar radiation that would otherwise be absorbed into the ground. This increases the amount of light and heat available to those trees or vines, increasing crop production. Two types of the fabric are available: white woven film and aluminised woven plastic film. There is no need to differentiate between them for depreciation purposes. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination, applicable from the 1997/98 income year, which will insert a new asset class into the “Agri- culture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry cat- egory. The determination, reproduced below in draft form, will set a depreciation rate of 50% DV for this asset and is based on an estimated useful life of 3 years and a residual value of 13.5%.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 43 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation state- ments. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. “Forestry”: whether or not it is included in the section CD 1(7) definition of “farming or agricultural business” Summary This item states the Commissioner’s view on whether “forestry” falls within the definition of “farming or agricultural business” in section CD 1(7) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under this interpretation, the Commis- sioner accepts that “forestry” does fall within the above definition. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background The Commissioner’s previous policy, dated January 1993, sets out the activities Inland Revenue considers are carried on for agricultural or farming purposes. It specifically did not include the growing of trees for the production of timber in the definition of agriculture and farming. The following specified activities were considered to be carried on for farming and agricultural purposes: beekeeping, animal husbandry, dairy farming, grain and seed growing, market gardening, fruit growing, poultry farming, sharemilking, tobacco growing, and vegetable growing. The following activities specifically did not qualify: dealing in livestock, leasing or bailing livestock by the bailor, aerial topdressing, growing trees for the produc- tion of timber, and providing services to persons carry- ing on a farming or agricultural business, e.g. services provided by agricultural contractors and seed cleaners. Legislation Section CD 1(2) includes in a taxpayer’s gross income, any amounts derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in some seven categorised circumstances. Section CD 1(7) excludes from the gross income of a taxpayer any amount derived from the sale or disposition of land resulting from the division into two or more lots of a larger area of land occupied or used by the taxpayer, or spouse, “or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business”. The following requirements must all be satisfied before the exemption applies: •The land sold must have resulted from the division into two or more lots of a larger area of land which, immediately before the division was occupied or used by the taxpayer, or spouse, or both, primarily or principally for the purpose of a farming or agricultural business that the relevant persons carried on. •The Commissioner must be satisfied that the land sold is of such an area and nature that it is presently capable of being worked as an economic unit in a farming or agricultural business. •The Commissioner must be satisfied, having regard to the circumstances in which the land was disposed of, that the land was disposed of primarily and principally for the purpose of it being utilised in a farming or agricultural business. Application The question of whether forestry is included in the expression “farming or agricultural business” has been considered by the courts in relation to other sections of the Act that use similar wording, but not directly in relation to section CD 1(7). Earlier cases tended towards the view that forestry was not included in the definition of “farming and agricul- ture”. In Gilchrist v Lanarkshire Assessors (1895) 35 Sc LR 663, the Court had to consider whether a greenhouse used for growing tomatoes was an erection or a structural improvement made or required for agricultural purposes. Lord Stormouth Darling said at page 665: Now that question must be solved by considering the meaning of the phrase in its ordinary acceptation. The appellant considers that a market garden is an agricultural subject because it effects the culture of the ground. No doubt it does but there are three main methods of utilising the soil, which are expressed by the terms agriculture, horticulture and forestry. These three things are distinguishable, and any one of them is not to be held as including any other without special provision to that effect. continued on page 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 44 Richardson J concluded that: Sufficient has been said to show that in New Zealand usage agricultural and farming may include forestry. But in determin- ing the intended scope of the expression “farming or agricul- tural business on land in New Zealand” and so in deciding the intended reach of ss 126 and 127 it is necessary to consider the context ... In our view it is a necessary implication from ss 126 and 127 considered in their statutory setting that they did not apply to taxpayers engaged in the business of forestry. Richardson J considered by way of necessary implica- tion that sections 126 and 127 when they were consid- ered in their statutory setting did not apply to taxpayers engaged in the business of forestry, because Parliament subsequently legislated specifically (in section 127A) to provide a similar deductibility regime for any taxpayer who carried on any forestry business. In doing so it allowed for the same range of expenses and followed the model of sections 126 and 127, which would, of course, have been unnecessary had those two provisions already applied to forestry. This did not, however, detract from his initial conclusion that the phrase “farming or agricul- ture” might include forestry on an ordinary meaning of the words. Whilst not all dictionaries give a consistent indication, several other dictionary meanings also indicate that farming and agriculture include forestry: Webster’s International Dictionary, Second Edition, gives a wide meaning to the word “agriculture”: The art or science of cultivating the ground, and raising and harvesting crops, often including also feeding, breeding, and management of livestock; tillage, husbandry; farming; in a broader sense, the science and art of the production of plants and animals useful to man, including to a variable extent the preparation of these products for man’s use and their disposal by marketing or otherwise. In this broad use it includes farming, horticulture, forestry, dairying, sugar making, etc. Funk and Wagnall’s New Standard Dictionary gives this definition of “agriculture”: 1. The cultivation of the soil for food-products or any other useful or valuable growths of the field or garden; tillage; husbandry; also by extension, farming, including any industry practised by a cultivator of the soil in connection with such cultivation, as forestry, fruit-raising, breeding and rearing of stock, dairying, market-gardening, etc. There is also overseas authority to support the approach that the phrase “farming or agriculture” includes for- estry. In Canada, forestry is considered to be a farming activity. “Farming” is defined in section 248 of the Canadian Income Tax Act 1994 to include the various activities of a person who is engaged in the business of earning income from the tillage of soil, the raising or exhibiting of livestock, the maintenance of horses for racing or exhibiting, the raising of poultry, the keeping of bees, fur farming, dairy farming, and fruit growing. The definition is not exhaustive and it has been decided by the courts that farming also includes tree farming: Her Majesty the Queen v Douglas C Matthews 74 DTC 6193, \[1974\] CTC 230 (FCTD). In Horniblow v Napier \[1985\] NZLR 105, the question was whether an orcharidist was a farmer for the purposes of the Transport Act 1949. Barrowclough CJ referred to the Gilchrist case and said at page 105: It might be very unsafe to accept as applicable to this country’s special type of husbandry (I deliberately use a new and comprehensive word), a classification that was applicable in Scotland over fifty years ago. But it appears to me that that classification is adaptable to New Zealand conditions, and is a classification which is commonly accepted here. Agriculture is essentially the business of the farmer. That is recognised in the interpretation clause of the Transport Act 1949, where the phrase ‘agriculture purpose’ is defined ‘as a purpose concerned directly with the management of a farm’. I would conclude that a farmer is one engaged in the first of the three methods of utilizing the soil referred to by Lord Stormonth Darling, and consequently that a person engaged in either of the two other methods is not a farmer. The viticulturist is in the second group comprising those who utilize the soil of a garden; and so also, is the fruitgrower or an orchardist. They are not properly referred to as farmers. The silviculturist is in the third group; and he too, is not properly referred to as a farmer. In 1994, in the Court of Appeal decision of Hill v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,037, Richardson J concluded that agriculture and farming might include forestry. The Court of Appeal considered whether forestry was included within the expression “farming or agricultural business” in terms of section 126 and 127 of the Income Tax Act 1976. In this case, Richardson J who delivered the judgment of the Court stated at page 11,046: “Farming” and “agricultural” are broad flexible words and the use of both expressions in the phrase on its face suggests that a broad approach casting a wide net was intended. But the particular meaning to be accorded to the words depends on the context in which they are used. In order to determine the intended application of the phrase in ss 126 and 127 it is also necessary to set the sections in context in the Income Tax Act as a whole. After briefly considering the earlier cases, Richardson J stated at page 11,047: Horniblow v Napier and Hill v Rothwell were decided 40 years ago and Gilchrist is even more remote in time. But the classification in Gilchrist and the approach in Re Walker and Township of Uxbridge perhaps indicate that variable meanings and shades of meaning may attach to such expressions. At the same time it is apparent from any reference to standard dictionaries that in their ordinary sense the words have wide meanings. Thus the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definitions are indicative of the potential breadth of the expression. Agriculture is defined as “the science and art of cultivating the soil; including the gathering in of the crops and the rearing of livestock; farming (in the widest sense)”. Farming is “the business of cultivating land, raising stock etc” and a farm is “a tract of land held ... for the purpose of cultivation; sometimes specialised as dairy-, grass-, poultry- farm. Also a tract of water used as a preserve, e.g., fish, oyster, etc.” Interestingly forestry is defined as “the science and art of forming and cultivating forests, management of growing timber”. Closer to home the two Australian dictionaries , The Macquarie Dictionary and Tasman Dictionary, both define agriculture as “the cultivation of land, including crop-raising, forestry, stock raising, etc; farming. from page 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 45 Revenue Canada’s Interpretation Bulletin IT–373R March 14 1985 relating to farm woodlots and tree farms states that proceeds from the sale of logs, lumber, poles or Christmas trees are income from farming. It also states that a taxpayer who is not otherwise engaged in a lumbering or logging business and who undertakes the reforestation of an area of land with the objective of producing mature trees at a date that may be 40 or 50 years in the future, or even longer, is considered to be farming. Possible alternative interpretations Certain provisions in the Income Tax Act indicate that (for those provisions at least) Parliament had clearly intended “farming and agriculture” to not include forestry by having explicit separate treatments. The decision in Hill illustrates one such example, and others include the Income Equalisation provisions in sub-part EI of the Act, and sections DZ 2 and DZ 3. It could certainly be argued that this indicates it was Parliament’s intention or understanding that forestry was not included in the phrase “farming and agriculture”. Whilst such an argument does have some merit, it is considered that the better approach is that expressed by Richardson J in Hill, that forestry does generally come within the phrase, unless the context of a particular provision indicates otherwise. Accordingly, each provision needs to be examined separately, and whilst some (such as those discussed above) will result in a conclusion that forestry is not included, section CD 1 has no such contextual reasons to overturn the general proposition that forestry is included. It might also be suggested that the use of the word “worked” in section CD 1(7) can be seen as suggesting a greater level of day to day activity than might be in- volved in small to medium scale forestry operations. However, the word “worked” is capable of a wide meaning ranging from the application of mental or physical effort for a purpose to cultivating land. The ordinary meaning of the word “worked” tends to suggest that there must be some form of physical activity, but does not necessarily require any particular activity level. Many activities that are clearly regarded as a “farming or agricultural business” do not demand day to day physi- cal work on the part of the proprietor. The existing case law in New Zealand simply analyses as a whole the meaning of the phrase “worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business” in section CD 1(7). It does not look at the meaning of each word in the phrase in isolation. Conclusion The words “farming or agriculture” in their ordinary usage may include forestry. The wording and context of section CD 1(7) do not prevent this interpretation. The New Zealand Court of Appeal case of Hill supports the interpretation that agriculture and farming may include forestry. Several dictionary meanings of these words indicate that farming and agriculture can include forestry. Case law and a revenue interpretation bulletin in Canada also indicate that farming and agriculture can include forestry The phrase “farming and agriculture” has a wider meaning now than it did many years ago as technology has advanced, and agricultural practices have changed over time. In New Zealand and in the previously men- tioned overseas jurisdictions, the ordinary meaning of “farming and agriculture” may include forestry. In determining whether forestry is included in any phrase of the Income Tax Act, the context of the section must be examined. For the purposes of section CD 1(7), forestry is included in the phrase “agriculture and farming”. There is nothing in the context of section CD 1(7) to indicate that forestry is not included. Note that any claim for exemption under section CD 1(7) in respect of a forestry activity must not only satisfy paragraphs (a) and (c) (“farming or agricultural business”), but the land under consideration must also be “capable of being worked as an economic unit” as required by paragraph (b) of section CD 1(7). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 46 Standard practice statements These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Tax payments – when received in time Standard Practice Statement PRC-100 Recently there has been considerable comment about the received in time rules for tax payments. This statement sets out the administrative rules which the Commissioner applies to tax payments when those various revenues are due. We prefer customers to pay their tax by posting their cheque – it will be accepted as being received in time if it is mailed and postmarked on the due date. Alternatively, payment may be made by cheque, EFT- POS or cash at any Inland Revenue Office – and will be accepted as being received in time if it is physically handed in to an Inland Revenue Office by the close of business hours on the due date – in most cases this is 4.30 pm. These administrative rules apply to all tax types, includ- ing GST. If a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, the payment will be accepted as being in time if posted or handed in on the next business day. Note that this does not apply to GST payments because GST is due on the last working day of the relevant month. There is one exception to that GST rule, and that is when the GST payment, which would normally be due on the last working day of December, is actually due on 15 January. If 15 January falls on a weekend then the payment will be accepted as being in time if posted or handed in to an Inland Revenue Office on the next business day. Applications to keep records in Maori Standard Practice Statement INV-470 Introduction This standard practice statement advises that the Com- missioner will generally approve applications to keep records in Maori, provided that: •The taxpayer complies with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“GST Act”); and •Numbers are recorded using Arabic numerals. In order to accommodate the needs of third parties, Arabic numerals (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) are to be used to record numbers. This policy applies from 1 May 1998. Background Sections 75 of the GST Act, and 22, 26, and 32 of the Tax Administration Act (“TAA”), require taxpayers to keep and retain sufficient records in the English lan- guage to enable ready ascertainment by the Commis- sioner or his delegates, of their liability to tax. However, each of these sections provides discretion to the Com- missioner who may, following a written application, allow records to be kept in an alternative language. The legislative policy reason for the requirement to keep records in English is administrative convenience. It allows the Commissioner to readily ascertain a taxpay- er’s liability. However, a claim lodged with the Waitangi Tribunal under the Treaty of Waitangi Act prompted Inland Revenue to review its policy for exercising the discretion related to keeping records in a language other than English. When considering a request from a taxpayer to keep records in Maori, Inland Revenue recognises that Maori is an official language of New Zealand. We also recog- nise that the choice of language for business dealings is not a matter for the Commissioner to determine. It is reasonable for persons whose business dealings are conducted in Maori to expect that Inland Revenue will be able to accommodate their language preference. However, the revenue law obligations of third parties must also be considered. When base records such as invoices and receipts are maintained in Maori there may be some inconvenience to other persons. GST tax invoices and debit and credit notes raise a special problem. They are necessary for ascertaining the tax liability of the issuer and of a third party. They are, therefore, records covered by section 75(3) of the GST IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 47 Act (i.e., they must be maintained in English unless the Commissioner gives permission to use another lan- guage). There are also explicit requirements for specific English phrases to be used in these documents. These phrases are: •“tax invoice” (s.24 & 25, GST Act) •“copy only” – on copy of lost tax invoice, credit or debit note (s.25, GST Act) •“buyer created tax invoice – IRD approved” (s.24, GST Act) •“modified tax invoice – IRD approved” (s.24, GST Act) •“credit note” or “debit note” – on credit or debit notes (s.25, GST Act) There is no discretion to allow the use of expressions in Maori (or any other language) to satisfy the require- ments imposed in sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act (which state that specific words must be used). The decision by the Commissioner and his delegates to allow the keeping of records in Maori, is the exercise of an administrative discretion provided by the Revenue Acts having regard to the form of tax invoices and taxpayer obligations as prescribed by legislation. Policy Applications When any person applies in writing to keep records (e.g., invoices, receipts, cash books, and journals) for tax purposes in Maori, permission will usually be granted, provided all numbers are recorded using Arabic numer- als. The application need not be in English, but must specify which records the taxpayer wishes to keep in Maori. An application form in both English and Maori is available from Inland Revenue offices for use by persons wishing to take advantage of this policy. The use of these forms will simplify applications and assist IRD to readily identify requests and provide a more timely response. A person may seek approval to keep only some records in Maori. In addition, where approval to keep certain records in Maori has been obtained, there is nothing to stop a person continuing to keep all or some of those records in English. This would extend to having an individual document completed partly in Maori and partly in English. Approval process The Commissioner has delegated his authority to approve applications to officer level. Authority to decline applications is confined to Team Leaders, Senior Investigators or Managers. Refusals will only be on the basis that those legislative requirements under the GST Act and TAA and the use of Arabic numerals are not satisfied. The letter giving consent will advise: •That the taxpayer must comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act in respect of the provision or creation of tax invoices and the issuing of debit and credit notes. •That numbers must be recorded using Arabic numer- als. •The date from which those records can be kept in Maori (generally the date of the letter of approval). •The approval is not a relaxation in the standard of record keeping \[the requirements of sections 22 and 26 of the TAA and section 75 of the GST Act are not relaxed for this purpose\]. •The approval does not mean IRD will communicate with taxpayers in Maori. Further conditions If permission is given to keep records in Maori, there is no relaxation in the standard of record keeping. The requirements of sections 22 and 26 of the TAA and section 75 of the GST Act are not relaxed for this purpose. The law is silent on the question of the language to be used in completing any returns that a person may be required to provide to the Commissioner. The Commis- sioner will accept returns in the prescribed format, completed in the Maori language with numbers entered using Arabic numerals. Impact on third parties When base records such as invoices and receipts which have been completed in Maori are used by third parties to ascertain their tax liability, that third party need not also apply for permission to use records kept in Maori. The balance of commercial convenience between buyers and sellers will determine what language is used in any particular case. Over time, the usual Maori expressions will become known within the community. Interpreta- tion will, therefore, become less difficult. Policy application date This policy applies from 1 May 1998. It will apply to records coming into existence following approval of an application lodged with the Commissioner on or after that date. Contact Should you have questions about this policy, please contact the Maori Community Officer at your nearest Inland Revenue Service Centre or Branch Office. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy see next page for examples IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 48 Examples The following examples do not form part of the policy but are provided to indicate its general effect. Example 1 A New Zealand resident GST registered person, who is fluent in English, operates a shop in Whangarei. The person is also fluent in Maori and has asked for approval to keep certain GST business records in Maori. Approval would be granted, subject to the require- ments that the registered person uses Arabic numer- als and complies with the requirements of sec- tions 24 and 25 of the GST Act. Example 2 A New Zealand resident taxpayer, who regards English as their second language and has limited bookkeeping skills, operates a farm on the East Coast. The taxpayer is fluent in Maori and has asked for approval to keep all their business records in Maori. Approval would be granted, subject to the require- ments that they use Arabic numerals and comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and sections 22 and 26 of the TAA. As in any other case, the taxpayer’s records must be sufficient to allow the Commissioner to readily ascertain the taxpayer’s tax liabilities. Example 3 A large Maori incorporation is staffed by persons whose fluency in Maori and in English differs. For cultural and policy reasons the incorporation wishes to maintain its records in Maori to the greatest extent possible within the law. The taxpayer has asked for approval to keep all of its business records in Maori. Approval would be granted, subject to the require- ments that the taxpayer uses Arabic numerals and comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and sections 22 and 26 (where applicable) of the TAA. Example 4 A New Zealand resident private company runs a business teaching Te Reo Maori. The company seeks approval to issue GST tax invoices printed and completed entirely in Maori. Approval would be granted, subject to the require- ments that the taxpayer uses Arabic numerals and complies with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and section 22 of the TAA. Example 5 A New Zealand resident GST registered person receives a tax invoice completed in Maori. The person, who does not speak or understand Maori, contacts her local Inland Revenue office and asks the office to intervene and require the issuer of the invoice to replace it with one completed in English. Provided the invoice has been completed in accord- ance with the requirement of section 24 of the GST Act and numbers are entered using Arabic numerals, the person would be advised that the document complies with our record keeping requirements in its present form. Any dispute over the language used in completing the invoice is a matter to be settled between the recipient of the invoice and the issuer. Example 6 A New Zealand resident taxpayer makes a claim in their annual income tax return for the housekeeper rebate. This is in respect of payments made to a caregiver that cared for the taxpayer’s child to enable the taxpayer to work. Upon being requested to supply a receipt to substantiate the housekeeper rebate claimed, the taxpayer supplies a receipt completed entirely in Maori, including the numbers for the amount paid written using Maori words. The receipt would not be accepted as a satisfactory record to support the rebate claim because numbers for the amounts paid have not been entered using Arabic numerals. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 49 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Investment portfolio fees – deductibility Section BD 2 – Allowable deductions: A taxpayer has asked if Case T42 (1988) 18 NZTC 8,285 is inconsistent with the Commissioner’s treatment of financial planning fee expenditure as set out in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10A (TIB Vol- ume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) at page 18). In summary, that Public Ruling states that: •Regard must be had to the difference between fees paid for planning an investment, implementing the purchase of that investment, and subsequently monitoring it. •“Passive” investors cannot deduct fees paid to financial advisors for planning or implementation services, as they are considered to be capital in nature (although the qualified accruals rules may include some implementation fees in the base price adjustment calculation on the maturity of any financial arrangements purchased). •“Passive” investors can deduct fees paid for the monitoring of existing invest- ments, although section EF 1 may require the unexpired portion of such expenditure to be added to the taxpayer’s gross income in any year. •Speculative investors, and persons in the business of investing, can deduct all planning, implementation and monitoring fees when incurred, subject to the applicability of the qualified accruals rules and section EF 1 as mentioned above, and the trading stock provisions of section EE 1. In Case T42, the taxpayers were a husband and wife who had a portfolio of investments that the husband had managed since 1986. In 1992, on receipt of a superannuation scheme lump sum, the taxpayers engaged a firm of investment advisors to manage their overall investments. The investment advisors charged a fee described as “portfolio establishment costs”, and the question was whether or not this fee was a deductible expense. Willy DJ observed that the parties were in agreement as to how the law applied. At page 8,286 he stated: There is no argument about the law. The Commissioner accepts that if the fees were properly incurred in the course of the maintenance and monitoring of an established portfolio of invest- ments then they are properly deductible. The objector accepts that if the fees are for the work involved in the establishment of a portfolio then they are non-deductible. His Honour went on to find on the facts that the taxpayers had an existing in- vestment portfolio, and the financial planning fees related to the monitoring of that investment portfolio, rather than any planning or implementation of a new one. Therefore, the expenditure was deductible under section BD 2. He stated at page 8,287: ...it is clear beyond any doubt that the payments in these cases were expended as part of a process by which the objectors earned their income from their investment portfolios. They would therefore be treated on the ordinary principles of commercial accounting as a debit to revenue not capital. continued on page 50 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 50 ...the objectors decided to recast their investments .... The plain fact is this objector had an estab- lished investment portfolio going back to 1986. The Commissioner has lodged an appeal, but for the purposes of this discussion it is important to note that the decision in Case T42 was a finding on the facts of that case. The application of the law is entirely consistent with Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10A, and the Commissioner does not intend to review or withdraw the Public Ruling as a result of this recent case. Write-off of business assets Section EG 12 (section 108K, Income Tax Act 1976) - Depreciation of deprec- iable property that can no longer be used: A taxpayer who wishes to write off some business assets that are no longer used in his business has asked: •what details of the assets is he required to supply to Inland Revenue •what factors Inland Revenue takes into account when considering a write-off application. Under section EG 12(5), a taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner for a deter- mination to deduct the remaining adjusted tax value of any depreciable property that can no longer be used. Adjusted tax value in relation to any depreciable property is defined as: bv (base value) – ad (aggregate deductions) We advised the taxpayer that he must complete the form “Application for a deduction for an asset you no longer use” (IR 260D) when making such a re- quest. All the following details must be provided: •asset details such as description, industry/asset category, asset class, depre- ciation rate, date of purchase, purchase price, remaining adjusted tax value •use of the asset by the business – the date when the asset stopped being used in the business, the reason why it is no longer used •disposal of the asset – the estimated cost of selling or disposing of it including the basis of the estimate, estimated gross proceeds from sale or disposal of the asset including the basis for this estimate •use of asset by any business – whether it is likely that the asset could be used in another business and if so, in what type of business and industry is it most likely to be used. In considering such an application, the Commissioner must be satisfied: •that the property is no longer used by the taxpayer, and neither the taxpayer nor a person associated with the taxpayer intends to use the asset in deriving gross income or in a business; and •that the costs of disposing of the property would exceed any consideration that could be derived from the disposition of the property. Only if the Commissioner is satisfied on these two points may the asset be writ- ten off. from page 49 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 51 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Property transfer: differentiation between fixtures and chattels – stamp duty Section 10 – Stamp duty payable: A taxpayer intends selling a commercial property and has asked for details of the stamp duty implications. She is aware that stamp duty is payable on the sale of the land and buildings, but is unsure of the position concerning items within the building: carpets, air-conditioning systems, a suspended ceiling, furniture (including built-in furniture), electric light fittings, partitions, a card access system, and refrigerators. Under section 10, duty is payable on: (a)Conveyances and leases of land; and... “Land” is defined in section 2 as: land within New Zealand, and includes – (a) Buildings, appurtenances, and improvements; and... An “appurtenance” to land includes a right of way or a similar right over some- one’s land. Examples of “improvements” to land are drainage, fencing, and the construction of buildings, while improvements to a building are additions to the building (other than mere repairs). Included in a building may be such items as lifts, sprinkler systems, ceilings, plumbing systems, carpets and vinyl flooring. Case law has established that when such items are an integral part of a building and are permanently affixed to the land or building, they lose their nature as chattels and become fixtures. As fixtures to the building they are part of the land and, therefore, are subject to inclusion in the value of land for assessing stamp duty. This is assuming that the owner of the building also owns the fixtures. Stamp duty is not levied upon chattels (i.e. moveable possessions) as such. Items generally termed “chattels”, including stoves, tables, chairs, electric heaters, and curtains, are not subject to stamp duty as they would not be fixed to the building. At times it can be difficult to differentiate between chattels and fixtures. How- ever, the courts have found that it is the degree and the object of annexation to the land that is important in making this decision. Case law has provided the following factors to be taken into account in deciding whether an object is a chattel or a fixture: •Whether the asset is a permanent improvement. If the asset is for the perma- nent and substantial improvement of the land or building as evidenced by the degree of annexation to the property, this fact would lean heavily towards the asset being a fixture. On the other hand, if the asset is merely resting by its own weight on the property, thereby indicating a temporary use or for its more complete enjoyment and use as a chattel, this could be a determining factor in finding it to be a chattel. In Feickert v Perpetual Trustees Estate and Agency Company of New Zealand Ltd (1989) 1 NZ Conv C 190, 244, the High Court, in finding that such items as partitions, carpets, and light fittings were fixtures, looked at whether they formed part of the fabric of the building. For example, the Court noted that whereas carpet at one time was considered as more of a luxury item in commercial buildings, it has now become common- place and is what a prospective tenant would expect to find. In Case S68 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,422, the Taxation Review Authority reached a similar conclusion in respect of items such as vinyl floor coverings, suspended ceilings, light fittings, a roller door, and handrails. continued on page 52 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 52 •The intention, as evidenced by the circumstances of each case, in bringing the asset on to the land. In approaching this issue, the courts have established it is the purpose for which the asset is used, as seen by the degree and object of annexation, which should be taken into account and not the subjective purpose of the person who placed it there. This factor is borne out in the Court of Appeal case Lockwood Buildings Ltd v Trustbank Canterbury Ltd \[1995\] 1 NZLR 22 where it was found that a show-home was a fixture and not a chattel. The Court followed rules set down in earlier cases in looking at the extent to which the show-home was fixed to the land. It looked like any ordinary house. This finding was not swayed by the possibility that an out- side observer, realising it was a show-home, might question its permanency on the site. Its status, to anyone viewing it, was evident from its outward appearance. In other words, these matters should be examined objectively and not subjectively. This point was emphasised in a recent House of Lords case, Elitestone Ltd v Morris \[1997\] 2 All ER 513 at 524; 1 WLR 687. •Whether the asset can be removed without causing damage to it, the build- ing, or the land. In the Feickert v Perpetual Trustees case, the High Court found that partitions and a bench unit were fixtures – one of the factors being that they would have been damaged if removed. No single factor should be considered alone in determining the issue of whether an item is a fixture or a chattel. Rather, all the factors are important in providing a picture of the degree and object of annexation of a particular item to the land, i.e. whether it is a chattel brought on to the land to continue as a chattel or whether it becomes a fixture. In applying these criteria to the taxpayer, the furniture (excluding built-in furni- ture) and refrigerators are chattels. They are therefore not subject to stamp duty. These assets were not fixed to the building in any way and could easily be re- moved. They could not be regarded as permanent improvements to the building. The remaining assets, i.e., carpets, air-conditioning system, suspended ceiling, built-in furniture, electric light fittings, partitions, and card access system are considered to be fixtures and are therefore part of the building. They exhibit a sufficient degree of permanence to be considered as fixtures because of their integration within, and annexation to, the building, and the fact they could only be removed with some difficulty. It is considered that an outside person coming in and viewing these assets would see that they were of sufficient permanence as to rightly be fixtures. The taxpayer was therefore advised that the items would attract a liability for stamp duty when the property was sold, as they were part of the land. from page 51 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.4 (April 1998) 53 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Joint bank accounts – whether Commissioner can attach under section 157 Case:ANZ Banking Group v CIR Decision date:4 March 1998 Act:Tax Administration Act 1994 - section 157 Keywords:Attaching joint bank accounts Summary:Justice Ellis determined that the Commissioner could not attach a joint bank account as an asset belonging solely to the taxpayer using section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Facts:The Commissioner assessed a taxpayer for income tax. The taxpayer and his wife have a joint account with the ANZ Bank. The Commissioner served notice on the Bank under section 157 of the Tax Ad- ministration Act 1994 (“the Act”) demanding payment of all monies in the joint account to service the tax payable. The Bank refused payment and requested the matter be resolved under the Declaratory Judgments Act 1908. Decision:Justice Ellis found that to override the wife’s rights as joint account holder there needed to be explicit statutory provision, but no such provisions are contained in the Act. There is a presumption that half the money in the joint account belongs to the wife. His Honour relied upon Hirschorn v Evans \[1938\] 2 KB 801 where the Court of Appeal found that in the absence of proof that an account belonged solely to the husband, a joint account could not be attached to answer a judgment against the husband.

Appendix to TIB Volume Ten, No.5May 1998 Accrual Determinations Determination G9B: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach................................................................................2 Determination G14A: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach.................................................12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 2 Determination G9B: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach This determination may be cited as “Determination G9B: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency other than New Zealand Dollars: An Expected Value Approach”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) When do you use this determination? You may use this determination if you have financial arrangements where the rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed or otherwise determined in a currency other than NZD, including variable rate financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than NZD. However, this determination only applies to financial arrangements where the payment dates are known not later than your first balance date after you become a party to the financial arrangement; and forward rates for the currency in which the financial arrangements are denominated can be determined. What methods can be used to calculate income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement that comes within the scope of this determination? Expected Value Approach This determination sets out an expected value approach to calculate gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement where any rights and obligations of the parties are expressed in a base currency other than New Zealand dollars. This base currency might be a foreign currency or a commodity. This expected value approach can only be used for financial arrangements within the scope of this determination, which is narrower than Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. If you elect to use this determina- tion, you must not use Determination G9A for any such financial arrangement, and you must not use Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities for any forward contract within the scope of Determination G14A: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities: An Expected Value Approach. Mark to Spot Approach You can use Determination G9A: Financial Arrange- ments that are Denominated in A Currency or Commod- ity other than New Zealand Dollars to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement within the scope of this determination if you have not used this determination or Determination G14A: For- ward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodi- ties: An Expected Value Approach. Alternatively, you may use the mark to market method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 1(6) of the Act. You may also use a method allowed by the proviso to section EH 1(5)(a) of the Act. How do I use the method set out in this determination? Under this method, the gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement where the rights and obligations of the parties are expressed in a base cur- rency other than New Zealand dollars is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component. To apply this method: •determine the expected component by taking into account all the base currency payments and payment dates in relation to the financial arrangement when you become a party to the financial arrangement. •use the initial interest rate to calculate the base cur- rency payments under a variable rate financial ar- rangement denominated in a base currency other than NZD, and assume that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement. •translate the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of the forward rates available at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement. •spread the expected NZD net amount under the yield to maturity method and allocate it to each income year over the term of the financial arrangement on a daily basis. •measure the unexpected component at the end of each balance date as the difference between actual and expected NZD payments. •calculate the gross income or expenditure of a finan- cial arrangement entered into before the income year you elect to use this determination as set out above, except that you must: (a)use actual NZD payments up to the income year you elect to use this determination and expected NZD payments for the remaining term of the financial arrangement in determining the ex- pected component of the gross income or ex- penditure; and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 3 (b)use the relevant forward rates at the end of the income year you elect to use this determination for the purpose of calculating the expected NZD payments. How do I elect to use the method outlined in this determination? You may elect to use this determination by returning your gross income or expenditure on the basis of this determination for the 1998-1999 income year, or the 1999-2000 income year, or in the first income year in which you become a party to the financial arrangement that is within the scope of this determination. In the income year you elect to use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement entered into before the income year, you must perform a transitional adjustment calculation. This determination provides for a transitional adjustment calculation that is comparable to Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement. How do I calculate the transitional adjustment? The transitional adjustment must be made in the income year you elect to use this determination. The transitional adjustment calculation must be made for each financial arrangement entered into before the income year you elect to use this determination. It requires that you treat the difference between the total amount that would have been gross income or expenditure calculated as de- scribed in this determination and the total amount actually recognised over the previous income years, as gross income or expenditure in the income year of the adjustment. How is income or expenditure calculated in the year the financial arrangement matures or is disposed of? Regardless of which method you choose to use, you must calculate income or expenditure under the base price adjustment in section EH 4 of the Act. Miscellaneous Issues This determination requires that where a financial arrangement involves or is expressed in more than one currency or commodity, each separate currency or commodity tranche is to be treated as a separate finan- cial arrangement. Where a facility provides for the rollover of a financial arrangement, the financial arrangement matures when the rollover occurs. Section EH 4 of the Act applies in the income year the rollover occurs. Any payment arising from the rollover of a financial arrangement will be taken into account under section EH 4 of the Act unless the payment is related to a separate financial arrangement. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 90(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope (1)This determination applies to the calculation of gross income or expenditure from a financial arrange- ment, to the extent that any right or obligation under the financial arrangement is fixed or otherwise determined in a currency other than NZD and is not fixed in NZD. The payment dates under the financial arrangement must be known not later than the first balance date of the issuer or holder after issue or acquisition. (2)This Determination does not apply to – (a)A futures contract; (b)A security arrangement; (c)A financial arrangement denominated in a currency where the forward rates of the currency cannot be determined; or (d)Any financial arrangements covered by the following determinations- Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities; Determination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts; Determination G20: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21A: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable; Determination G27: Swaps; Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisi- tion Price and Method for Spreading Income and Expenditure; except as specifically allowed by those deter- minations. (3)You may use this determination if (a)an election to use this determination is made by returning your income or expenditure on the basis of this determination in the 1998-1999 income year or the 1999-2000 income year or the first income year in which you become a party to the financial arrange- ments within sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above; and continued on page 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 4 (7)This adjustment ensures that the gross income or expenditure up to the end of the income year in which you elect to use this determination is equal to that that would have been returned if the actual NZD payments and the forward rates, as described in sub-paragraph (5), and this determination had been used since you become a party to the financial arrangement. 5. Interpretation In this determination: (1)A reference to the “Act” is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. (2)“Base currency” in relation to a financial arrange- ment means the currency or commodity in which rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed. “Covered interest parity” means the proposition that the differential between forward and spot exchange rates is equal to the interest differentials. That is, the forward rate for a foreign currency exchange at time t for 1 pe- riod ahead is equivalent to the spot rate at time t, S t , multiplied by one plus the foreign interest rate, i f , divided by one plus the domestic interest rate, i d . For- ward rates at time t for n periods, Fwd t,n , can thus be derived based on the principle of covered interest parity as Fwd t,n = S t (1 + i f ) n (1 + i d ) n “Currency” includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement. “Exchange rate” means the price of one currency expressed in another currency. “Forward rate” means the exchange rate for a forward contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or the forward exchange rate calculated using the principle of covered interest parity or other methods that are commercially acceptable. In the case where the base currency is a commodity, the forward rate is the future value of the commodity (in NZD). “Financial arrangement” has the same meaning as in the Act: Provided that, where a financial arrangement creates obligations in two or more currencies or com- modities and the consideration to be given and received in respect of the obligations in each of the currencies is separately identifiable, the consideration to be given and received in respect of the obligations in each currency will be treated as relating to separate financial arrange- ments. “Floating rate arrangement” means a financial arrange- ment where the interest rate is reset periodically accord- ing to a predetermined formula, linking the interest rate to an indicator rate such as the bank bill or interbank rate. (b)Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars is not used to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial ar- rangement that is within sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above; and (c)Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities is not used to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract that is within the scope of Determination G14A: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities: An Expected Value Approach. (Note: A determination to which Determination G9B refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determina- tion made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is extended to the new determination.) 4. Principle (1)If you are a party to a financial arrangement to which this determination applies, the gross income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement is calculated by taking into account all amounts arising from the fluctuations of exchange rates or commodity prices. (2)The gross income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is the total of an expected compo- nent and an unexpected component. You must measure the expected component at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement. You must also recognise the unexpected component when it is realised. (3)To measure the expected component you must convert the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement, and spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the financial arrangement. (4)You must measure the unexpected component as the difference between the actual NZD payments and the expected NZD payments. (5)You may use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure of financial arrangements entered into before the income year in which you made the election and in respect of which section EH 4 of the Act does not apply. You must then use this determination for all such financial arrangements. In this case, you must follow the principle set out above except that you must calculate the expected NZD net amount using actual NZD payments up to the end of the income year in which you elect to use this determination and the forward rates at the end of that income year. Transitional Adjustment (6)You must perform the transitional adjustment calculation in the income year in which you elect to use this determination to calculate gross income or expendi- ture of any financial arrangement entered into before that income year. from page 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 5 “Future value” in relation to a commodity and a future date means the value of the commodity at the future date, on a given date, derived from any commercially acceptable, market-based method of valuation. “GBP” means the currency of the United Kingdom. “Initial interest rate” in relation to a financial arrange- ment means the interest rate that applies to the first period after the date of issue or acquisition of the financial arrangement. “Interest” means any periodic payment in relation to the financial arrangement, to the extent intended to provide a return to the lender on the sums provided to the borrower. It does not include fees, discounts, or premi- ums, or payments effecting a reduction of principal. “NZD” means the currency of New Zealand. “Period” means a term commencing immediately after a payment is payable or receivable, and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable. “Reviewable rate arrangement” means a financial arrangement where the interest rate is set periodically in line with market rates. “Spot rate” means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or in the case of a commodity, the spot value (in NZD) of the commodity. “Spot value” in relation to a commodity and a day means the value of the commodity on that day derived from any commercially acceptable method of valuation. “USD” means the currency of the United States of America. “Variable rate financial arrangement” means a floating rate arrangement or a reviewable rate arrangement. (3)All other terms used have the same meaning given to them for the purpose of the qualified accruals rules in the Act. 6. Method (1)Your gross income or expenditure in an income year from a financial arrangement under this determina- tion is the total of: (A)the expected component, calculated in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5); and (B)the unexpected component, calculated in accord- ance with sub-paragraph (6) of this section. (2)You must calculate the expected component for each income year of the remaining term of the financial arrangement at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement. The expected component is calculated by first taking into account all base currency payments in relation to the financial arrangement. (3)You must calculate the base currency payments of a variable rate financial arrangement denominated in a currency other than NZD using the initial interest rate and assuming that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement. (4)You must convert the base currency payments into NZD using forward rates at the time you became a party to the financial arrangement. (5)You must spread the expected NZD net amount using the yield to maturity method consistent with Determination G3 and, where necessary, allocate it to the income year on the basis of Determination G1A. This will give the expected component for each income year. (6)The unexpected component is the difference between the actual NZD value of the payments during the year and the expected NZD value of those payments as calculated under sub-paragraph (4). Transitional Adjustment for Existing Financial Arrangements (7)If you elect to use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrange- ment entered into before the income year you made the election, you must follow the method set out in sub- paragraphs (1) to (6) to calculate gross income or expenditure of these financial arrangements, except that (a)the NZD net amount to be spread under sub-para- graph (5) consists of actual NZD payments that have occurred since you become a party to the financial arrangement until the end of the income year you elect to use this determination, and expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the financial arrangement; and (b)the expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the financial arrangement must be calculated on the basis of the forward rates available at the end of the income year you elect to use this determination. (8)You must perform a transitional adjustment calculation in the income year in which you elect to use this determination to calculate gross income or expendi- ture of any financial arrangement entered into before the income year you made the election. You must perform the transitional adjustment calculation for each of those financial arrangements in accordance with the following formula: a – b – c + d where ais the sum of all amounts that would have been income in respect of the financial arrangement from the time it was entered into until the end of the income year, if this determination was applied from the time you become a party to the financial arrange- ment; bis the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement from the time it was entered into until the end of the income year, if this determination was applied from the time you become a party to the financial arrange- ment; continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 6 DateSpotFwd (0,t)US,INZ,I 1-Sep-990.63100.63100.050.04 1-Mar-000.64550.63710.050.04 1-Sep-000.65000.64320.050.04 1-Mar-010.65500.64940.050.04 1-Sep-01 0.65700.65560.050.04 1-Mar-020.65800.66190.050.04 1-Sep-020.64000.66830.050.04 1-Mar-030.63800.67470.050.04 1-Sep-030.61500.68120.050.04 1-Mar-040.61500.68780.050.04 1-Sep-040.61500.69440.050.04 At the time of contract – 1 September 1999 Given the above assumptions, the payments in USD expected at the time of contract (See column (a)), could be converted to NZD based on the forward rates at each relevant date (See column (b)). The expected NZD net amount represents a yield of approximately 12% per annum over the five-year period and the yield is spread in a way consistent with Determination G3. The value of NZD $848,432, for instance, is the expected component of the gross income for the NZ investor for the six- month period ending 1-Mar-2000.

Where the NZD values of these subsequent payments deviate from the expected NZD values, they give rise to unex- pected component of the gross income or expenditure. For example, on 1-Mar-2000 the actual payment was NZD $774,593 while the expected payment was NZD $784,846. The discrepancy of NZD $10,253 is the unexpected component for the period ending 30-Jun-2000. cis the sum of all income in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year; dis the sum of all expenditure in respect of the finan- cial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year. A positive net amount is gross income while a negative net amount is gross expenditure in the income year you elect to use this determination. 7. Examples (1)A New Zealand investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 2000. The bond has a term of five years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10 million. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2004. (2)The New Zealand investor has to calculate the expected NZD net amount on the basis of forward rates available at the time it becomes a party to the financial arrangement. It then has to spread and allocate the expected NZD net amount to the income years over the term of the financial arrangement in accordance with Determination G3 and Determination G1A. In each of those income years, the investor also has to determine the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure. The unexpected component is measured as the difference between the actual NZD payments and the expected NZD payments. Signed on the 27th day of April 1998. Robin Oliver General Manager, Policy Example A: Discounted bond A NZ investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 2000. The bond has a term of five years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10 million. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2004. The following table presents the spot rates at the relevant dates and the forward rates at the time of contract out to the relevant dates. The forward rates were estimated based on the principle of covered interest parity using the interest rates in the US (US,I), the domestic interest rates (NZ,I) and the spot rate at the time of contract. In this simple example the (US,I) and the (NZ,I) were assumed to be 10% per annum and 8% per annum, respectively, and they remain constant throughout the entire period (assuming a horizontal yield curve so that a 6 month bond and a 5 year bond have the same rate). from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 7 ExpectedActualUnexpected CashCashIncome/ (NZD)(NZD)Expenditure 1-Sep-99-13153724-13153724 1-Mar-00784846774593-10253 1-Sep-00777372769231-8141 1-Mar-01769968763359-6609 1-Sep-01762635761035-1600 1-Mar-027553727598784506 1-Sep-0274817878125033072 1-Mar-0374105278369942647 1-Sep-0373399581300879013 1-Mar-0472700481300886004 1-Sep-0415121690170731711951480 87683892170119 At the first balance date – 30 June 2000 There are two components to the income or expenditure for the financial arrangement in this income year: the gains expected at the contract date and the unexpected losses. The expected gains as summarised above are allocated to the income year in a way consistent with Determination G1A. Therefore, the gross income or expenditure for the year ended 30 June 2000 is ($848,432) + (121/184 x $852,533) – $10,253 = $1,398,812 where NZD $1,398,812 is gross income of the NZ investor. At the second balance date – 30 June 2001 The gross income or expenditure at 30 June 2001 is calculated as (63/184 x $852,533) + ($857,381) + (121/184 x $863,020) – $8,141 – $6,609 = $1,702,060 where NZD $1,702,060 is gross income of the NZ investor. At the third balance date – 30 June 2002 The gross income or expenditure at 30 June 2002 is calculated as (63/184 x $863,020) + ($869,494) + (121/184 x $876,855) – $1,600 + $4,506 = $1,744,518 where NZD $1,744,518 is gross income of the NZ investor. On 30 September 2002 the bond is sold for USD $10 million (i.e. an approximate yield of 16% p.a.). At this date the USD/NZD spot rate was 0.6320. At this date the investor is subject to the base price adjustment of section EH 4: a – (b + c) where: ais all consideration that has been paid to the investor: 500,000/.6455 + 500,000/.6500 + 500,000/.6550 + 500,000/.6570 + 500,000/.6580 + 500,000/.6400 + 10,000,000/.6320 = $20,432,131 NZD bis the acquisition price of the bond: 8,300,000/.6310 = $13,153,724 NZD cis all the amounts of income derived under section EH 1: 1398812 + 1702060 + 1744518 (as calculated above) = $4,845,390 NZD So the Base Price Adjustment is a – (b + c) = 20,432,131 – (13,153,724 + 4,845,390) = $2,433,017 NZD. Since this is a positive amount it is gross income of the NZ investor in this income year. Example B: Discounted bond entered into before the 1998-1999 income year A NZ investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 1999. The bond has a term of five years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10 million. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2002. This is effectively the same as Example A except that the discounted bond was acquired on 1 September 1997. The following table presents the spot rates at the relevant dates and the forward rates at the time of contract out to the relevant dates as in Example A.

The corporate has already recognised gross income of $1,398,812 and $1,702,060 in the 30 June 1997 and 30 June 1998 income year, respectively. However, the corporate has decided to adopt this determination from the 1998-1999 income year. The expected NZD net amount to be spread under this determination must, therefore, be determined at the end of the 1998-1999 income year. The following table summarises the actual payments from 1 September 1997 to the end of the 1998-1999 income year and the ex- pected NZD payments for the remaining term of the financial arrangement. These expected NZD payments continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 8 The net amount of NZD$15,953 is gross income in the 1998-1999 income year. The income or expenditure in relation to the discounted bond in subsequent income years will be calculated as in Example A. The expected component of the gross income or expenditure is determined as summarised in the table above while the unexpected component is calculated as in Example A. Example C: Multicurrency loan facility with early repayment A corporate borrower has a multi-currency loan facility that allows funds to be drawn down in any of three currencies – US Dollars (USD), Sterling (GBP) and Deutschemarks (DM). The total initial amount of the loan is $100 million USD and may be taken in any combination of the three currencies. The term of the loan facility is 10 years and any tranche may be repaid at any time by payment of the principal outstanding. The mixture of currencies can be changed at each six monthly interest payment date. Interest is payable in the currency of the principal amount at rates depending on the currency as shown below. The loan is initially drawn down on 1 October 1998 in the configuration below. Interest is payable six monthly in arrears on 1 February and 1 August. The corporate borrower has a 31 March balance date. Its base currency is New Zealand dollars (NZD).

The forward rates were estimated based on the principle of covered interest parity using the interest rates in the UK (UK,I), the domestic interest rates (NZ,I) and the spot rate at the initial drawn down date. In this simple example the (UK,I) and the (NZ,I) were assumed to be 10% per annum and 8% per annum, respectively, and they remain constant throughout the entire period (assuming a horizontal yield curve so that a 6 month bond and a 10 year bond have the same rate). were calculated on the basis of the forward rates at 30 June 1999 out to the relevant dates. For the sake of simplicity, these forward rates are assumed to be the same, in this example, as those measured at the time of contract. In practice, however, the forward rates meas- ured at the time of contract are rarely the same as the forward rates measured at a later date.

On 1 February 1999, the interest payment in arrears for the four months from the initial drawn down date amounts to GBP $1,320,000, which is equivalent to NZD $3,961,905 (valued at the relevant forward rate of 0.3332 at the initial drawn down date). The subsequent interest payments were also converted to NZD in the same way. Overall NZD net amount of $88,488,316 represent an expected yield of approxi- mately 8% per annum. The expected yield is spread according to Determination G3 (See column (c)). The actual NZD payments will deviate from the ex- pected NZD payments due to fluctuations in the ex- change rates. For instance, the actual NZD payment on 1 February 1999 was NZD $3,946,188 instead of NZD $3,961,905 anticipated at the initial drawn down date. This created an unexpected component of NZD $15,716 for the gross income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement.

For the purpose of calculating the corporate’s gross income or expenditure, the GBP tranche is deemed to be repaid and is subject to the Base Price Adjustment in this income year. The spot rate GBP to NZD was 0.3200 on the date of repayment. The Base Price Adjustment is given in section EH 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. It calculates an amount by application of the formula: a – (b + c); where ais all consideration that has been paid by the corpo- rate borrower. This is the interest payments made plus the deemed principal repayment amount. This amount is equal to: 1.32m/.3345 + 1.98 m/.3340 + 1.98m/.3310 + 36m/.3200 = NZD $128,356,205 bis the acquisition price of the facility. This is equal to the amount of GBP drawn down i.e. 36 m/.3300 = NZD $109,090,909 cis the amounts of gross expenditure less the amounts of gross income as calculated under section EH 1. The gross expenditure for the previous two years of the loan facility were For the year ended 31 March 1989$ 6,154,231 For the year ended 31 March 1990$ 9,458,697 The total gross expenditure is NZD$15,612,928 The Base Price Adjustment is therefore: 128,356,205 – (109,090,909 + 15,612,928) = NZD $3,652,368 This amount is gross expenditure of the corporate borrower in this income year in accordance with section EH 4 of the Act. Example D: Variable rate financial arrangement This is a similar example as Example D in Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrange- ments. This example illustrates how this determination could be applied to a variable rate financial arrangement. A New Zealand company purchased a USD note with a face value of $10,000 for a term of 3 years at a discount of 10% ($1,000). The Interest rate is equal to market interest plus 1% p.a., and Interest is payable half yearly in arrears. There are no fees. The Interest rate is 10% in the first period after issue. from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 11 At the first balance date There are two components to the gross income or expenditure in relation to the floating rate financial arrangement for the New Zealand company. These include: Expected component = $ 868 + $873 = $1741; and Unexpected component = -$10 + $69 = $59. The gross income for the first balance date is therefore $1,800. At the second balance date The gross income consists of: Expected component = $879 + $885 = $1764; and Unexpected component = -$83 - $78 = -$161. The gross income for the second balance date is there- fore $1,603. At the final balance date The New Zealand company has to perform a base price adjustment under section EH 4 of the Act: a – (b + c) where: ais all consideration that has been paid to the com- pany: = 775 + 846 + 687 + 685 + 608 + 16250 = $19,851 NZD bis the acquisition price of the note: = $14,263 NZD cis all the amounts of gross income under section EH 1: 1800 + 1603 = $3,403 NZD So the base price adjustment is a – (b + c) 19851 – (14263 + 3403) = $2185 NZD Since this is a positive amount, it is gross income of the New Zealand company in this income year. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 12 Determination G14A: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach This determination may be cited as “Determination G14A: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodi- ties: An Expected Value Approach”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) What is a Forward Contract for Foreign Exchange and Commodities? A forward contract for foreign exchange or commodities is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of foreign currency or commodities at some future date at a specified contract rate. For example, a forward contract for foreign currency is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of a currency at a future date at a price fixed (in terms of another currency) at the time the contract is entered into. Each party contracts simultaneously to sell one currency and purchase another currency. The same forward contract can always be viewed as either the sale of one currency or the purchase of the other currency. For example, a person who sells NZD forward against purchase of USD can view the contract as either – •The forward sale of NZD, or •The forward purchase of USD. A forward contract has characteristics that are very similar to a swap contract. In fact, swaps are often structured as a series of forward contracts. If you are a party to a swap, however, you may not apply this Determination as swaps are subject to Determination G27. The only exception is a swap contract for fixed amounts, to be exchanged at a single fixed date. This type of swap is, in substance, a forward contract. Therefore, if you are a party to this type of financial arrangement, you have to apply this determination instead of Determination G27. What methods can be used to calculate income or expenditure under a Forward Contract for Foreign Exchange and Commodities? Expected Value Approach This determination sets out an expected value approach to calculate gross income or expenditure from a forward contract. This expected value approach can only be used for forward contracts within the scope of this determina- tion, which is narrower than Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Com- modities. If you elect to use this determination, you must not use Determination G14 for any such forward contract, and you must not use Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars for any financial arrangement within the scope of Determination G9B: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency other than New Zealand Dollars: An Expected Value Approach. Mark to Spot Approach You can use Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract within the scope of this determination if you have not used this determination or Determination G9B: Financial Ar- rangements that are Denominated in a Currency Other than New Zealand Dollars: An Expected Value Ap- proach. Alternatively, you may use the mark to market method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 1(6) of the Act. You may also use a method allowed by the proviso to section EH 1(5)(a) of the Act. How do I use the method set out in this determination? Under this method, the gross income or expenditure from a forward contract is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component. A typical forward contract drawn at the forward rate for no consideration, however, has no expected component. To apply this method: •ignore any offsetting of payments between the parties, so that every amount that would be payable under the forward contract is taken into account under this determination. •choose one of the currencies under the forward contract as a base currency. •determine the expected component by taking into account all the base currency payments and payment dates in relation to the forward contract when you become a party to the contract. •the base currency payments in relation to the forward contract consist of: (a)the base currency value of the payment or receipt, if any, made in consideration of entering into the contract; (b)the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate; and (c)the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate. •convert the expected base currency payments, where the base currency is not NZD, into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates available at the time you become a party to the forward contract. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 13 •spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the forward contract. •calculate the gross income or expenditure of a forward contract entered into before the income year you elect to use this determination as set out above, except that you must: (a)use actual NZD payments up to the income year you elect to use this determination and expected NZD payments for the remaining term of the financial arrangement in determining the ex- pected component of the gross income or ex- penditure; and (b)use the relevant forward rates at the end of the income year you elect to use this determination for the purpose of calculating the expected NZD payments. •perform the base price adjustment under section EH 4 of the Act when the forward contract you are a party to matures or is disposed of. This adjustment contains the unexpected component of the gross income or ex- penditure of the forward contract. How do I elect to use the method outlined in this determination? You may elect to use this determination by returning your gross income or expenditure on the basis of this determination for the 1998-1999 income year, or the 1999-2000 income year, or in the first income year in which you become a party to any forward contract that is within the scope of this determination. In the income year you elect to use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure from a forward contract entered into before the income year, you must perform a transitional adjustment calculation. This determination provides for a transitional adjustment calculation that is comparable to Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement. How do I calculate the transitional adjustment? The transitional adjustment must be made in the income year you elect to use this determination. The transitional adjustment calculation must be made for each forward contract entered into before the income year you elect to use this determination. It requires that you treat the difference between the total amount that would have been gross income or expenditure calculated as de- scribed in this determination and the total amount actually recognised over the previous income years, as gross income or expenditure in the income year of the adjustment. How is income or expenditure calculated in the year the forward contract matures or is disposed of? Regardless of which method you choose to use, you must calculate income or expenditure under the base price adjustment in section EH 4 of the Act. If you are a party to a forward contract, you are both a vendor and a purchaser. As such, you are a holder under the definition of “holder” in section OB 1 of the Act. This categorisation is important for the purpose of calculating income or expenditure in accordance with section EH 4 of the Act. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 90(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope (1)This determination applies to the calculation of gross income or expenditure from a forward contract for foreign exchange and commodities. (2)This Determination will not apply to – (a)A futures contract; (b)A security arrangement; (c)A forward contract for foreign exchange and com- modities where the forward rates of the currency cannot be determined; or (d)Any financial arrangements covered by the following determinations- Determination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts; Determination G20: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21A: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable; Determination G27: Swaps; Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisi- tion Price and Method for Spreading Income and Expenditure; except as specifically allowed by those deter- minations. (3)You may use this determination if (a)an election to use this determination is made by returning your income or expenditure on the basis of this determination in the 1998-1999 income year or the 1999-2000 income year or the first income year in which you become a party to a forward contract within sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above; and (b)Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities is not used to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract that is within sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above; and continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 14 5. Interpretation In this determination: (1)A reference to the “Act” is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. (2) “Base currency” in relation to a person and a forward contract, means the currency under the forward contract which is adopted by the person as a reference currency for the purposes of this determination. “Commencement date” of a forward contract means the date on which the contract was entered into, or the date on which it was acquired, if later. “Contract rate”, in relation to a forward contract means the price of one currency expressed in terms of the other currency under the forward contract. “Covered interest parity” means the theoretical proposi- tion that the differential between forward and spot exchange rates is equal to the interest differentials. That is, the forward rate for a foreign currency exchange at time t for 1 period ahead is equivalent to the spot rate at time t, S t , multiplied by one plus the foreign interest rate, i f , divided by one plus the domestic interest rate, i d . Forward rates at time t for n periods, Fwd t,n , can thus be derived based on the principle of covered interest parity as: Fwd t,n = S t (1 + i f ) n (1 + i d ) n “Currency” includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement. “Exchange rate” means the price of one currency expressed in another currency. “Forward rate” means the exchange rate for a forward contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or the forward exchange rate calculated using the principle of covered interest parity or other methods that are commercially acceptable. In the case of a forward contract for commodities, the forward rate is the future value of the commodities (in NZD). “Future value” in relation to a commodity and a future date means the value of the commodity at the future date, on a given date, derived from any commercially acceptable, market-based method of valuation. “NZD” means the currency of New Zealand. “Non-base currency” means the currency under a forward contract that is not the base currency. “Spot contract” means a contract for the sale or purchase of a currency for delivery in 2 business days. “Spot rate” means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or in the case of a commodity, the spot value (in NZD) of the commodity. (c)Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars is not used to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial ar- rangement that is within the scope of Determination G9B: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars: An Expected Value Approach. (NOTE: A determination to which Determination G14A refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determina- tion made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is extended to the new determination.) 4. Principle (1)If you are a party to a forward contract to which this determination applies, the gross income or expendi- ture in respect of the forward contract is calculated by taking into account all amounts arising from the fluctua- tions of exchange rates or commodity prices. (2)The gross income or expenditure from the forward contract is the total of an expected component and the unexpected component. You must measure the expected component at the time you become a party to the forward contract. You must also recognise the unexpected component by performing the base price adjustment required under section EH 4 of the Act. (3)To measure the expected component you must convert the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates at the time you become a party to the forward contract, and spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the contract. (4)You may use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure of forward contracts entered into before the income year in which you made the election and in respect of which section EH 4 of the Act does not apply. You must then use this determination for all such forward contracts. In this case, you must follow the principle set out above except that you must calculate the expected NZD net amount using actual NZD pay- ments up to the end of the income year in which you elect to use this determination and the forward rates at the end of that income year. Transitional adjustment (5)You must perform the transitional adjustment calculation in the income year in which you elect to use this determination to calculate gross income or expendi- ture of any forward contract entered into before that income year. (6)This adjustment ensures that the gross income or expenditure up to the end of the income year in which you elect to use this determination is equal to that that would have been returned if the actual NZD payments and the forward rates, as described in sub-paragraph (4), were known and this determination had been used since you become a party to the forward contract. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 15 “Spot value” in relation to a commodity and a day means the value of the commodity on that day derived from any commercially acceptable method of valuation. “USD” means the currency of the United States of America. (3)All other terms used have the same meaning given to them for the purpose of the qualified accruals rules in the Act. 6. Method (1)Your gross income or expenditure in an income year from a forward contract under this determination is the total of: (A)the expected component, calculated in accordance with sub-paragraphs (4) to (7); and (B)the unexpected component, calculated in accord- ance with sub-paragraph (8). (2)To calculate the income or expenditure in relation to a forward contract, you must first nominate a base currency. (3)If the terms of the forward contract provide for the netting off or offsetting of any amounts payable to or by one party to the forward contract with any amounts payable to or by the other party to the forward contract, you must ignore such netting off or offsetting for the purpose of this determination. (4)You must calculate the expected component for each income year of the remaining term of the forward contract at the time you become a party to the contract. The expected component is calculated by first taking into account all base currency payments in relation to the forward contract. The base currency payments of a forward contract consist of: (a)the base currency value of the payment or receipt, if any, made in consideration of entering into the forward contract; (b)the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate; and (c)the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate. (5)You must convert the base currency payments into NZD using forward rates at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement, if the base currency is not NZD. (6)The expected NZD net amount is the difference between items (b) and (c) in sub-paragraph (4), adjusted for any amount as described in item (a). You must spread the expected NZD net amount using the yield to maturity method consistent with Determination G3 and, where necessary, allocate it to the income year on the basis of Determination G1A. This will give the expected component for each income year. (7)You must spread the expected NZD net amount of a forward contract that has been written for no consideration at a rate other than the forward rate using the straight-line method. (8)The unexpected component is the difference between the actual NZD value of the payments during the year and the expected NZD value of those payments as calculated under sub-paragraph (5). You need not calculate the unexpected component separately as it is part of the base price adjustment required under section EH 4 of the Act. Transitional Adjustment for Existing Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities (9)If you elect to use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract entered into before the income year you made the election, you must follow the method set out in sub- paragraphs (1) to (8) to calculate gross income or expenditure of these contracts, except that (a)the NZD net amount to be spread under sub-para- graph (6) consists of actual NZD payments that have occurred since you become a party to the forward contract until the end of the income year you elect to use this determination, and expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the forward contract; and (b)the expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the forward contract must be calculated on the basis of the forward rates available at the end of the income year you elect to use this determination. (10)You must perform a transitional adjustment calculation in the income year in which you elect to use this determination to calculate gross income or expendi- ture of any forward contract entered into before the income year you made the election. You must perform the transitional adjustment calculation for each of those forward contracts in accordance with the following formula: a – b – c + d where ais the sum of all amounts that would have been income in respect of the forward contract from the time it was entered into until the end of the income year, if this determination was applied from the time you become a party to the forward contract; bis the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure in respect of the forward contract from the time it was entered into until the end of the income year, if this determination was applied from the time you become a party to the forward contract; cis the sum of all income in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year; dis the sum of all expenditure in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year. continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 16 the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,689,475. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 1999 The expected base currency payments in relation to the forward contract consist of : •the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = 0; •the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,689,475; and •the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,689,475. Since the forward contract was entered into at the forward rate for no consideration, the expected NZD net amount is 0. So, there is no expected component to be spread under the accrual rules. At the final balance date – 30 June 2001 In the 30 June 2001 income year, the base price adjust- ment given in section EH 4 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula: a – (b + c) where - a= Consideration paid or payable to the holder = 1,000,000/0.557 = NZD $1,795,332 b= Acquisition price = consideration provided by the holder = NZD $1,689,475 c= Income already derived – expenditure already incurred = 0 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $1,795,332 – ($1,689,475 + 0) = $105,857 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $105,857 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2001 income year. Example B: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is equal to the market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long term forward foreign exchange contract to buy 1 million US dollars (USD) against delivery of New Zealand dollars (NZD) in three years time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 1998 for no consideration and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,667,416. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. A positive net amount is gross income while a negative net amount is gross expenditure in the income year you elect to use this determination. 7. Examples (1)A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long term forward foreign exchange contract to buy 1 million US dollars (USD) against delivery of New Zealand dollars (NZD) in two years time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 1999 for no consideration and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,689,475. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. (2)At the time the New Zealand corporate becomes a party to the forward contract, the expected NZD net amount is zero and so the expected component of the gross income or expenditure from the forward contract is zero. The New Zealand corporate will recognise the unexpected component of the gross income or expendi- ture from the forward contract when performing the base price adjustment under section EH 4 of the Act. Signed on the 27th day of April 1998. Robin Oliver General Manager, Policy For the purpose of examples A to C assume that the spot rates and the forward rates for USD/NZD on the relevant dates are as follows: CIP:CIP:CIP: ActualFwdFwdFwdExpectedExpected Spot(0,t)(1,t)(2,t)US,INZ,I 30-Apr-980.635 0.63500.040.06 30-Apr-990.61490.62300.61490.040.06 30-Apr-000.575 0.61130.60330.57500.040.06 30-Apr-010.557 0.59970.59190.56420.040.06 The forward exchange rates are derived on the principle of covered interest parity (CIP) using the expected interest rates in the United States of America (US, I) and the expected domestic interest rates (NZ, I). Fwd(0,t) represents the forward rates at 30 April 1998 out to period, t, while Fwd(1,t) and Fwd(2,t) represent the forward rates at 30 April 1999 and 30 April 2000, respectively, out to period, t. For convenience in these examples when calculating the base price adjustment, the same buy/sell spot rates have been used at date of delivery. In practice this would not normally be the case. Example A: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is equal to market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long term forward foreign exchange contract to buy 1 million US dollars (USD) against delivery of New Zealand dollars (NZD) in two years time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 1999 for no consideration and from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 17 Assume that the New Zealand corporate has been using an alternative method to calculate the income or ex- penditure of the forward contract in the 1997-1998 income year. In fact, the corporate has recognised NZD$32,982 as gross income in respect of the forward contract for the year ending 30 June 1998. However, the corporate has decided to use this determination for the 1998-1999 and subsequent income years. Further, assume that the forward rate on 30 June 1999 out to 30 April 2001, the delivery date of the forward contract, is 0.5919. Therefore, the market rate for the delivery of USD$1 million on 30 April 2001 is NZD$1,689,475. Given the contract rate of 0.5997 for the delivery of USD$1 million, there is an expected NZD net amount of NZD$22,059. Using this determina- tion, the expected NZD net amount should be spread on a straight line basis over the term of the forward con- tract. The transitional adjustment in the 1998-1999 income year – 30 June 1999 Using a straight line method to spread the expected NZD net amount of NZD$22,059, the gross income in relation to the forward contract for the year ending 1998 and 1999 should have been NZD$1,226 and NZD$7,353, respectively. Therefore the transitional adjustment is: a – b – c + d where athe sum of all amounts that would have been income from the time the corporate become a party to the forward contract until the end of the income year = 1226 + 7353 = 8579 bthe sum of all amounts that would have been expendi- ture from the time the corporate become a party to the forward contract until the end of the income year = 0 cthe sum of all income in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year = 32982 dthe sum of all expenditure in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year =0 The net amount of –NZD$24,403 is gross expenditure in the 1998-1999 income year. At the final balance date – 30 June 2001 In the 30 June 2001 income year, the base price adjust- ment given in section EH 4 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula: a – (b + c) where - a= Consideration paid or payable to the holder = 1,000,000/0.557 = NZD $1,795,332 b= Acquisition price = consideration provided by the holder = NZD $1,667,416 c= Income already derived – Expenditure already incurred = 32,982 + 7353 – 24,403 = NZD $15,932 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $1,795,332 – ($1,667,416 + $15,932) = $111,984 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,984 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2001 income year. Example C: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is not equal to the market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long term forward foreign exchange contract to buy 1 million US dollars (USD) against delivery of New Zealand dollars (NZD) in two years time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 1999 and the corporate bor- rower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,667,416. For the purpose of this example assume that the corporate borrower paid NZD $10,000 to enter into this forward contract. (This could be the same forward contract as in the previous example where the forward contract was sold on 30 April 1999.) The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 1999 The forward rate in this case is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, which is different from the contract rate of 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD. The expected settlement on the commitment to purchase USD 1 million at 30 April 1991 is, therefore, NZD $1,689,475. The payment made in acquiring the forward contract was NZD $10,000. Thus, the expected base currency payments in this example consist of: •the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = NZD $10,000; •the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,689,475; and •the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,667,416. So, the expected NZD net amount from the forward contract is NZD $12,059 (i.e. the difference between the commitments under the forward contract measured at the continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 18 Example D: purchaser of base currency (USD); contract rate is not equal to the market rate Assuming that in the previous example, the corporate chooses USD as the base currency for the forward contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 1999 Since the base currency is USD, the base currency payments expected at the commencement date is: •the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = NZD $10,000 x 0.6149 = USD $6,149; •the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,667,416 x 0.5919 = USD $986,944; and •the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,667,416 x 0.5997= USD $1,000,000. The expected base currency payments (summarised in column four of the table below) are converted into NZD using the relevant forward rates. The expected NZD net amount of NZD $12,057 is then spread over the term of the forward contract using the yield to maturity method recommended in Determination G3 and allocated to the income year on a daily basis consistent with Determina- tion G1A.

At the second balance date – 30 June 2000 Expected component = (61/365 x $7206) + (304/365 x $4852) = $1204 + $4041 = $5245 Unexpected component = 0 The amount of $5245 is gross income at the second balance date. At the final balance date – 30 June 2001 In the 30 June 2001 income year, the base price adjust- ment given in section EH 4 is calculated by applying the formula: a – (b + c) contract rate (NZD $1,667,416) and the commitments under the forward contract measured at the forward rate (NZD $1,689,475) less the payment made to acquire the forward contract). The payments in relation to the forward contract are summarised in the table below.

At the final balance date – 30 June 2001 In the 30 June 2001 income year, the base price adjust- ment given in section EH 4 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula: a – (b + c) where - a= Consideration paid or payable to the holder = 1,000,000/0.557 = NZD $1,795,332 b= Acquisition price = consideration provided by the holder = NZD $1,667,416 + NZD $10,000 = NZD $1,677,416 c= Income already derived – expenditure already incurred = $811 + $5245 = NZD $6056 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $1,795,332 – ($1,677,416 + 6056) = $111,860 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,860 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2001 income year. from page 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 19 where - a= Consideration paid or payable to the holder = 1,000,000/0.557 = NZD $1,795,332 b= Acquisition price = consideration provided by the holder = NZD $1,667,416 + NZD $10,000 = NZD $1,677,416 c= Income already derived – expenditure already incurred = $811 + $5245 = NZD $6056 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $1,795,332 – ($1,677,416 + 6056) = $111,860 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,860 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2001 income year. Example E: Forward contract to purchase commodity for USD at non-market rate with a corresponding forward contract in foreign exchange in market rate For the purpose of this example assumes that the for- ward rates for USD/NZD are as summarised in the following table. These forward exchange rates are derived on the principle of covered interest parity (CIP). Fwd(0,t) represents the forward rates at 30 June 1998 out to period t while Fwd(1,t) and Fwd(2,t) represent the forward rates at 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000, respec- tively, out to period t.

For example, the market price for a barrel of crude oil was USD$19.2 per barrel on 30 June 1998 while the forward price out to 30 June 2001 was USD$21 per barrel.

The first forward contract secures the supply of 10000 barrels of crude oil. This forward contract is to be cash settled on 30 June 2001, at USD $20 per barrel. The second forward contract was entered into for the purchase of USD $200,000 in exchange for the delivery of NZD at a contract rate of 0.5997. The second forward contract is to be settled on 30 June 2001. For the purpose of this example assume that the corporate chooses USD as the base currency for both contracts. At the time the forward contracts were entered into – 30 June 1998 The forward contract for the supply of crude oil was entered into at a price below the market rate. (This may be because the supplier is expecting excess supplies that have not been factored into the market prices yet). The contract rate of $20 is lower than the forward rate of $21. As a result, gains are expected from the forward contract. The expected base currency payments include: •the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = 0; •the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = 10000 x $21 = USD $210,000; and •the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = 10000 x $20 = USD $200,000. The expected base currency payments are converted at the forward rate of 0.5997 USD/NZD and the expected NZD net amount is spread under the accrual rules over the term of the forward contract. As the company did not pay anything to enter into the forward contract, the gains can not be spread using the yield to maturity method. Therefore, the straight-line method will be adopted to spread the expected gains. The forward contract for the foreign exchange was entered into at the forward rate. As such, there is no expected gains or losses to be spread under the accrual rules (see Example A). At the first and second balance date – 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000 For the forward contract for crude oil: Expected component = 1/3 ($10000/0.5997) = $5,558. Unexpected component = 0 The amount of $5,558 is gross income at the first and second balance date. At the final balance date – 30 June 2001 On the 30 June 2001 balance date, the forward contract for the supply of crude oil would have been cash settled at the contract price of USD $20 per barrel. The market price per barrel of crude oil on the delivery date is USD $22. The spot exchange rate on the delivery date is 0.557 USD/NZD. The base price adjustment given in section EH 4 of the Act in relation to the forward contract for the supply of crude oil is calculated by applying the formula a – (b + c) continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 – Appendix (May 1998) 20 year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 4 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula: a – (b + c) where - a= Consideration paid or payable to the holder = $200,000/0.557 = NZD$359,066 b= Acquisition price = consideration provided by the holder = $200,000/0.5997 = NZD$333,500 c= Income already derived – expenditure already incurred = 0 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $359,066 – ($333,500 + $0) = $25,566 and since this is positive, the amount is gross income of the New Zealand company for the 30 June 2001 income year. where - a= Consideration paid or payable to the holder = $220,000/0.557 = NZD$394,973 b= Acquisition price = consideration provided by the holder = $200,000/0.557 = NZD$359,066 c= Income already derived – expenditure already incurred = $5558 + $5558 = NZD $11,116 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $394,973 – ($359,066 + $11,116) = $24,791 and since this is positive, the amount is gross income of the New Zealand company for the 30 June 2001 income year.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 1 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Accrual determinations G9B and G14A The new determinations Determination G9B and Determination G14A provide an alternative method of spreading gross income or expenditure from some financial arrangements that are otherwise within the scope of Determination G9A and Determination G14. Under this method, you are required to spread the expected component of the gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement. The unexpected compo- nent of the gross income or expenditure is recognised only when it is realised. You may elect to use the new determinations by return- ing your income or expenditure on the basis of these determinations, provided that if you choose to use either of the new determinations, you must not use Determination G9A or Determination G14 for any financial arrangement that is within the scope of the new determinations. By the same token, you can continue to use Determination G9A or Determination G14 to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement that is within the scope of the new deter- minations only if you do not use the new determinations. See the appendix to this TIB for the full text of the determinations. 1998 international tax disclosure exemption ITR9 Introduction Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires people to disclose interests they hold in foreign entities. Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 1998. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemp- tion ITR9”, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 1998 disclosure exemption has been expanded from the 1997 exemption to include interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs. Interests held by residents Disclosure is required by residents for these interests: •an interest held in a FIF •an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determin- ing exemption from disclosure it includes these interests: 1.an income interest held directly in a foreign company 2.an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3.an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8(3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater” which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR 4H series form (see “Overlap of interests” below). Foreign company interests A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless continued on page 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 2 due date for filing the person’s 1998 tax return. See Inland Revenue’s booklet Overseas Private Pensions (IR 258A) for more information. •interests in foreign entities held by a natural person, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquiring the interests remains under $20,000 at all times during the income year •an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. There is more information on exemptions from the FIF rules in Inland Revenue’s booklet Foreign Investment Funds (IR 275B). A resident who holds an interest in a FIF at any time during the 1998 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form “Interest in Foreign Investment Fund Disclosure Schedule and Worksheet” (IR 4H). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed five forms under the IR 4H series to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of the methods. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in a FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either form IR 4G or the appropriate IR 4H series form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclo- sure return to file: 1.Use the appropriate IR 4H series form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: •an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) •an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the of the company’s country of residence. The 1998 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on form IR 4G “Interest in a Foreign Company Disclosure Schedule”. The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: •attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. •to identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign com- pany which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United King- dom and the United States of America). •the requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specified within section CG 15(1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: •rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (e.g., a unit trust) •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannua- tion scheme •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy •an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in a FIF under section CG 15(2) does not have to be dis- closed. The following are listed in section CG 15(2) as exemptions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: •an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC •an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Nor- way, United Kingdom and the United States of America) •an interest in an employment-related foreign superan- nuation scheme •a qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the from page 1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 3 country or territory in which the entity was resident. 2.Use the IR 4G or IR 4GS form to disclose an “in- come interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign com- pany (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the appropriate IR 4H series form. Disclosure is not required on either forms IR 4G or IR 4H for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest which is excluded under the Schedule 3, Part A exemption of the FIF rules. Interests held by non-residents The 1998 disclosure exemption excludes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed. This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs. The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules non-residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC regime (section CG 6(1) of the ITA 1994). In addition, under section CG 16(4) of the ITA 1994 a non-resident is not to be treated as deriving or incurring any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules. Summary The 1998 international tax disclosure exemption re- moves the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (i.e., it is less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. The 1998 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs. Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR9” 1. Reference This exemption is made pursuant to section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 1998. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign invest- ment funds, except where that interest is held by a non- resident of New Zealand. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3. Exemption i.Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 1998, shall not be required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, except where: •the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. ii.Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year ending 31 March 1998, shall not be required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, where: •no attributed foreign income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of section CG 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and/or •no foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign invest- ment fund by virtue of section CG 16(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 9th day of April 1998. Max Carr National Manager, Corporates IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 4 Credit card transaction duty repealed Part VIA of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, which imposed credit card transaction duty, has been repealed with effect from 1 April this year. The repeal was the subject of a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Remedial Provisions) No.2 Bill, which was passed in March. The legislation also con- firms that EFTPOS and certain ATM transactions were never subject to the duty. Background to the repeal In a statement announcing the introduction of legislation repealing the duty, Treasurer Winston Peters and Revenue Minister Bill Birch said the 5 percent levy on credit card transactions was “an inefficient means of raising revenue that penalises business relying on large numbers of credit card transactions.” “The sixteen years since credit card transaction duty was introduced have seen rapid changes in the types of services offered by financial institutions,” they said. “As a result, the precise scope of the duty is becoming increasingly difficult to define, leading to uncertainty for taxpayers and Government alike. This can make it complicated to administer and can result in expensive litigation.” “Revenue can be raised more efficiently, and with fewer distortionary effects, through broadly based taxes such as income tax and GST.” “The repeal of credit card transaction duty is part of the trend to phase out stamp duties, which distort financial and property market decisions to a degree that cannot be justified by the amount of revenue raised.” Credit card transaction duty contributed about $3 million to the total tax take of $32 billion a year, the Ministers said. New trading stock rules may affect provisional tax estimates Press release from Inland Revenue Manufacturers, retailers and others with trading stock should be aware that pending reforms will affect tax payments in the present (1998-99) income year. Inland Revenue is alerting business people making estimates of the value of their trading stock for provi- sional tax purposes to take account of the new trading stock rules. If a taxpayer’s income from trading stock will be higher under the new rules, taxpayers will have to pay more provisional tax to reduce their exposure to use of money interest. The new rules were introduced into Parliament in the Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock and Other Reme- dial Matters) Bill. The proposed application date for the reforms is the 1998-99 income year. The Bill is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. Copies of the Bill and Commentary to the Bill are available at Bennetts Government Book- shops nationwide. The Commentary is also available at Inland Revenue’s website: http://www.ird.govt.nz The main changes contained in that Bill, and those most likely to affect provisional tax estimates, are: Special provisions for valuing obsolete and slow moving stock will be repealed. Transitional measures will be introduced to spread any income arising from repeal of the obsolescence provisions over a three-year period. The market selling value will take obsolescence into account. Shares and other excepted financial arrangements held as trading stock will be valued at cost only. This is important for share traders who hold shares that have a value less than cost if they have valued the shares down to market value in previous years. Cost will be determined using “generally accepted accounting principles”. The requirements of the financial reporting standard for inventories (FRS-4) will apply, which may result in increased cost absorption for some taxpayers. There will be simplified rules aimed at reducing compli- ance costs for taxpayers with turnover of less than $3 million. Small taxpayers that have valued stock under the obsolescence provision or that are share traders may be affected by the changes. The first provisional payment for the present income year falls due on 7 July 1998 for a standard 31 March balance date. Early balance date taxpayers who have under-paid their provisional tax payments may make additional tax payments at any time. Budget information in next month’s TIB The Government’s 1998 budget was introduced into Parliament just after this TIB went to print, so we were unable to include any information on it in this issue. We will cover the tax-related parts of the budget in the June TIB (Volume Ten, No.6), and will include this material in the TIB section of our website as soon as possible – even before the full June TIB is available. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 5 Standard practice statements These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Temporary shortfall – permanent reversal Standard Practice Statement INV-230 Summary This Standard Practice Statement sets out the Commis- sioner’s position on permanent reversal as it applies to a temporary shortfall. The Commissioner will accept that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed if: •It appears from the taxpayer’s actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall, or •Through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself. This statement does not apply to corrections, as the Commissioner cannot be satisfied that they will be corrected in the next period. Application date This Standard Practice Statement applies to assessments of shortfall penalties issued on or after 1 May 1998. If you have been assessed with a shortfall penalty between 1 May 1998 and the date of this statement, please contact the Inland Revenue officer concerned and, if applicable, your assessment will be adjusted to reflect the 75% reduction to the shortfall penalty. Background Inland Revenue’s practice has been to restrict the temporary shortfall reduction to instances where Inland Revenue has received the return containing the correc- tion or reversal before the taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation. An issue has arisen concerning the timing of GST input credits. Many of the resulting refunds claimed can be quite substantial and could be subject to GST checks before the release of the refunds. GST refund checks are undertaken very quickly after the returns are received which means that the taxpayers may not have had an opportunity to furnish the following return which would permanently reverse the overclaim made in the previous period. The tax shortfall is actually a timing shortfall but Inland Revenue’s practice, prior to 1 May 1998, was not to allow the temporary shortfall reduction unless the return containing the reversal had been furnished prior to notification of audit or investigation. This situation could also arise in other tax types, for example, income tax, FBT or PAYE. Legislation A temporary shortfall is defined in section 141I of the Tax Administration Act 1994. If a taxpayer is considered liable for a shortfall penalty and the tax shortfall is a temporary shortfall, the penalty warranted will be reduced by 75%. Subsection (3) defines a temporary shortfall as follows: A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall for a return period if the Commissioner is satisfied that– (a)The tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that (disregarding penalties or interest) the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability in respect of the item or matter that gave rise to the tax shortfall; and (b)No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period in respect of a similar item or matter; and (c)No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage; and (d)The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. Practice applicable from 1 May 1998 The Commissioner’s new interpretation of a temporary shortfall The Commissioner considers that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if: •it appears from the taxpayer’s actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall, or •through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself. To reverse a situation does not necessarily mean to achieve a complete remedy – it only means to take steps that will lead to the remedy in due course. For example, when a ship goes off course, one remedies it by turning it back towards the right heading. The mistake has been remedied when the turn is made but getting the ship back to the position it should be in takes some time to take effect. continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 6 and the property developer pays a deposit of $75,000 on 5 April 1998. The balance of the purchase price is payable on 5 May 1998. The vendor of the property is not registered for GST, so the property developer is purchasing a secondhand good and is entitled to claim a GST input credit only on the amount actually paid. The property developer is regis- tered for GST on an invoice basis and files GST returns every two months. In the GST return for the period ended 30 April 1998, the property developer claims an input credit of $83,333 which is 1/9 of the total purchase price of the property. The correct claim in that period is $8,333, so there is a tax shortfall of $75,000. As the matter relates to an issue of interpretation and is over the specified threshold, the developer must have an acceptable interpretation for the tax position taken. As the standard has been breached, they are liable to a shortfall penalty of 20% of the tax shortfall. The taxpayer is entitled to claim 1/9 of the payment that will be made on 5 May 1998 in the GST return for the period ended 30 June 1998. The taxpayer has already made the claim in the previous GST return, and was not intending to make the claim in the June GST return. Therefore, at the time of making the full claim in the April return, the taxpayer had permanently reversed the tax shortfall, as they never intended to make a double claim, even though, due to the speed of the audit, the May/June return had not been received. In this case, the 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall is available. GST output tax not returned As part of his taxable activity, a taxpayer entered into an unconditional agreement to sell real property. The GST return for the period ended 31 May 1998 was audited and it was noted that output tax with respect to the deposit only had been returned. The taxpayer is queried and advises that he is going to return the balance of the sale in the next return as that is when he will receive the monies outstanding for the property. As the time of supply was triggered upon receipt of the deposit, a tax shortfall is ascertained for the balance of the property sale that was not returned. The taxpayer advises that he wasn’t sure whether he should return the entire sale and had intended making an inquiry but just didn’t get around to it. It is considered that a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s category of taxpayer, when unsure, would have obtained advice prior to preparing his GST return. Accordingly, the taxpayer is liable to a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care. The taxpayer prepares his returns from his bank state- ments; therefore, the internal system will pick up the from page 5 Using this rationale, when the taxpayer claims the entire GST input claim in the first GST return, the taxpayer has made the reversal because no claim for an input credit relating to the same property purchase will be made in the following return. This means the reversal will be treated as made when the full input claim is made in the earlier return. The same would apply to income tax or any other revenue. In these scenarios, the taxpayer would be entitled to a 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall. This is because the taxpayer has made the claim in the earlier return period so they cannot make the claim again in the later period. The case may not be so clear when gross income is not returned in a correct return period. For example, an auditor ascertains that a taxpayer should have returned a sale in the return being audited. In order to qualify for the temporary shortfall reduction, Inland Revenue would have to be satisfied that the sale would have been returned in the next return period. This will involve making enquiries of the taxpayer and checking the internal systems, bank statements, etc. If the sale is recorded in the system that the taxpayer normally prepares the tax return from, Inland Revenue could safely assume that the sale would have been returned in the next return period. In this case, Inland Revenue would allow the temporary shortfall reduction of any shortfall penalty warranted. Arguably, a 5% penalty for a full year’s deferral of income tax is much lower than a 5% penalty for deferral of GST for one, two or six months. Inland Revenue considers that the reason for shortfall penalties should not be confused; shortfall penalties address culpability. Interest will be charged to taxpayers for paying tax late. When the adjustment is made to the return, interest will be charged from the time that the taxpayer should have paid the correct amount of tax. In summary, a taxpayer is not required to have furnished the return containing the reversal prior to notification of audit, but Inland Revenue must be satisfied that, had the following return been received, the reversal would have been made. The extended interpretation of temporary shortfall will be available for all tax types including income tax. This interpretation of the word “reversed” applies only to the definition of temporary shortfall. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy Examples GST Input tax claim A property developer enters into an unconditional sale and purchase agreement for the purchase of real prop- erty. The full purchase price of the property is $750,000 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 7 Correction A taxpayer prepares the GST return and claims a GST input credit for some overseas travel and personal expenses. An audit is undertaken and a tax shortfall is ascertained for the above mentioned claims. There is no guarantee that the incorrect input claims will be corrected in the following GST return. Therefore, if culpability were established, no reduction for a tempo- rary shortfall is available. receipt of the balance of the sale of the property. It is clear that the output would have been returned in the next period. Therefore, the tax shortfall has been re- versed even though the following return has not been received because of the speed of the audit. In this case, the 75% reduction to the shortfall penalty would be warranted. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 8 Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it.

Domestic air travel – zero-rating for GST purposes Public Ruling BR Pub 98/3 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”) unless otherwise indicated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11(2)(aa). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of air travel in the following circumstances: •The travel involves the transport of passengers by aircraft (any other mode of transport will not qualify, e.g. transport by road, sea, or rail); and •The transport is a direct flight from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand (referred to in this Ruling as “domestic air travel”); and •The domestic air travel is part of a wider agreement or contract for air carriage in respect of which all the parties to the wider agreement or contract (and in particular the party providing the domestic air travel services) contemplate that either: •The place of departure is within the territory of one country and the place of destination is within the territory of another country, not being travel where New Zealand is the place of: •Departure, and the Cook Islands, or Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is the place of destination; or •Destination, and the Cook Islands, or Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is the place of departure; or •The place of departure and the place of destination are both within the territory of a single country, but there is an agreed stopping place in an- other country. The term “agreed stopping place” refers to any place that the aircraft intends to land in accordance with the travel contract, not being travel that has a place of departure and destination both located in the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands unless there is an agreed stop- ping place in a country other than New Zealand, Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands. •All the parties to the wider agreement or contract for air carriage (i.e. all the carriers and the passenger or other party to the contract or agreement), and in particular the supplier of the domestic air travel, regard the domestic air travel to be supplied as part of the wider agreement or contract for air carriage and as a single operation of international carriage.

Background Domestic air travel within New Zealand will often be part of an international travel package which involves travel to, or from, New Zealand. Generally, domestic air travel within New Zealand is standard rated for GST purposes because the travel is considered to be a service which is supplied in New Zealand. However, the GST Act provides for domestic air travel to be zero-rated in certain circumstances when international travel is involved, and the domestic air travel constitutes “inter- national carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. According to the Ruling, it applies to the supply of air travel in the following circumstances: •The travel involves the transport of passengers by aircraft (any other mode of transport will not qualify, e.g. transport by road, sea, or rail); and •The transport is a direct flight from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand (referred to in this Ruling as “domestic air travel”); and •The domestic air travel is part of a wider agreement or contract for air carriage in respect of which all the parties to the wider agreement or contract (and in particular the party providing the domestic air travel services) contemplate that either: •The place of departure is within the territory of one country and the place of destination is within the territory of another country, not being travel where New Zealand is the place of: •Departure, and the Cook Islands, or Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is the place of destination; or •Destination, and the Cook Islands, or Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is the place of departure; or •The place of departure and the place of destina- tion are both within the territory of a single country, but there is an agreed stopping place in another country. The term “agreed stopping place” refers to any place that the aircraft intends to land in accordance with the travel contract, not being travel that has a place of departure and How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •The supply of the domestic air travel by any supplier will constitute “interna- tional carriage” for the purposes of the Carriage By Air Act 1967 (“the CBA Act”) and so will be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). This Ruling is based on the state of the Carriage By Air Act 1967 (and the treaties to which that Act gives effect) as at the date this Ruling is made. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to the supply of domestic air travel to the extent that that supply occurs during the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2001. For the purposes of determining the period for which this Ruling applies, the time of supply of air travel is the earlier of the time an invoice is issued or pay- ment is received by the supplier in respect of that supply. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of May 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 98/3 continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 10 whether the supply constitutes “international carriage” under the CBA Act. To determine whether a supply constitutes international carriage under the CBA Act, the Commissioner must be able to determine the meaning of that term for the purposes of that Act. The Commis- sioner considers that he can issue a ruling which in- volves interpreting the meaning of a term contained in a non-Revenue Act if the application of a provision of a Revenue Act depends on the meaning of that term. Legislation Goods and Services Tax 1985 Under section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act, if a supply of services would otherwise be charged with GST under section 8 of that Act, that supply shall be charged at the rate of zero percent if: (aa)The services comprise the transport of passengers from a place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand to the extent that the transport is by aircraft and constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the Carriage By Air Act 1967 ... Carriage By Air Act 1967 Section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act applies to air carriage which constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. There are three possible ways that air carriage can constitute “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. Firstly, under the Hague Protocol; secondly, under the Warsaw Conven- tion; and thirdly, under section 18 of the CBA Act. The Hague Protocol Part I of the CBA Act gives effect to the provisions of the Warsaw Convention of 1929 as amended by the Hague Protocol of 1955, and supplemented by the Guadalajara Convention of 1961. The Convention is a multi-lateral treaty, intended to unify international law as it relates to carriers’ rights, obligations and liabilities and to override member nations’ differing domestic laws. In this Commentary, the amended and supplemented Convention is referred to as “the Hague Protocol”. Section 7 of the CBA Act states that the Hague Protocol has the force of law in New Zealand. The Hague Proto- col is set out in the Schedule to the Act. Parties to the Hague Protocol are referred to in it as “High Contracting Parties”. “International carriage” is defined in Article 1(2) of the Hague Protocol (as set out in the Schedule to the CBA Act) as follows: For the purposes of this Convention, the expression interna- tional carriage means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a trans-shipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State: even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage destination both located in the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands unless there is an agreed stopping place in a country other than New Zealand, Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands. •All the parties to the wider agreement or contract for air carriage (i.e. all the carriers and the passenger or other party to the contract or agreement), and in particular the supplier of the domestic air travel, regard the domestic air travel to be supplied as part of the wider agreement or contract for air carriage and as a single operation of international carriage. As long as these requirements are fulfilled, the Ruling will apply irrespective of whether: •The wider air carriage agreement is in the form of one contract or a series of contracts; or •The carriage is all with one carrier or with a series of carriers; or •Any of the air carriage contracts which form part of the wider air carriage agreement or contract consist purely of domestic travel; or •There are breaks between each flight; or •The domestic air travel is a connecting flight which takes a person out of New Zealand or to another place in New Zealand. The Ruling will be of primary interest and application to the airlines that supply domestic air travel services in New Zealand. If the Ruling applies, and the air travel services supplied to the passenger constitute “interna- tional carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act, the airline must zero-rate the domestic air travel services. Authority to make the Ruling One purpose of binding rulings is to give taxpayers certainty about how the Commissioner will apply the taxation laws. To achieve this aim, sections 91A, 91D, and 91E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allow the Commissioner to issue binding rulings that set out how a taxation law will apply to any person and to any arrange- ment. Section 91C(1)(c) permits the Commissioner to make a binding ruling on any provision of the GST Act (except sections 12 and 13 of that Act). Section 11(2)(aa) is a provision of the GST Act. The Commissioner is author- ised to make a binding ruling on how this section will apply to any person and any arrangement. To determine whether section 11(2)(aa) applies to any person and any arrangement, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the services supplied comprise the transport of passengers within New Zealand by aircraft and that the transport constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. It will be impossible for the Commissioner to administer and apply section 11(2)(aa) unless he first determines from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 11 whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a trans- shipment, are within the territories of two countries or within the territory of a single country if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another country: Section 19 of the CBA Act provides for the application of Part II of the Act and states: (1) This Part of the Act applies to any carriage by air (not being international carriage) performed by a carrier as part of an air transport service in which, according to the contract between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination are both situated in New Zealand and there is no agreed stopping place outside New Zealand; notwithstanding that the aircraft in which the carriage takes place is at the same time engaged in international carriage and notwithstanding that the contract for the carriage of any passenger is made without consideration. (2) For the purposes of determining whether or not any carriage is international carriage, every island in the Cook Islands, Niue, and every island in Tokelau shall be deemed part of New Zealand and any carriage between such islands or between New Zealand (as defined in section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924) and any such island shall be deemed to be carriage within New Zealand and shall not (unless there is an agreed stopping place outside any such place) be interna- tional carriage for the purposes of this Part of the Act. Application of the Legislation Section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act allows zero-rating of services when the services comprise the transport of passengers by aircraft from one place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand to the extent that the transport constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act 1967. It can be seen from the above CBA Act extracts that the term “international carriage” has the following meanings in the CBA Act: •The definition contained in Article 1(2) of the Hague Protocol (which is given the force of law in New Zealand by section 7 of the CBA Act), as modified by Article 1(3) of the Hague Protocol (which relates to undivided carriage by successive carriers). •The definition contained in Article 1(2) of the original Warsaw Convention, as modified by Article 1(3) of that Convention (these sub-articles are substantially the same as Article 1(2) and (3) of the Hague Proto- col), as kept alive by section 15(2) of the CBA Act. •The definition contained in section 18 of the CBA Act which applies only to Part II of the CBA Act and defines the type of carriage to which Part II does not apply. Each of the meanings of “international carriage” in the CBA Act have some of the same components, but they are not identical. The main differences are: 1.“International carriage” under the Hague Protocol must involve places of departure and destination that are within countries which are both High Contracting Parties to the Hague Protocol. Similarly, “interna- tional carriage” under the Warsaw Convention must between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention. Sub-Article 1(3) states: Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State. The Warsaw Convention A number of countries, including the United States, are signatories to the Warsaw Convention, but not to the Hague Protocol. The Hague Protocol does not apply to one way carriage between a Hague Protocol High Contracting Party (such as New Zealand) and a country which is not a signatory to the Hague Protocol. This is because that other country will not be a “High Contract- ing Party” to the Hague Protocol. If the travel is between New Zealand and a country which is a party to the Warsaw Convention only, the Warsaw Convention will apply to the carriage. This is because section 15 of the CBA Act keeps alive the provisions of the old Carriage By Air Act 1940, which gave the Warsaw Convention the force of law in New Zealand. In some cases a country may be a High Contracting Party to the Hague Protocol, but not to the original Warsaw Convention. Articles XXI and XXIII of the Hague Protocol provide that if a country adheres to the Hague Protocol, but is not a signatory to the original Warsaw Convention, that country automatically be- comes an adherent of the Warsaw Convention. Thus, if travel is between a country that is a signatory to the Hague Protocol only and a country that is a signatory to the Warsaw Convention only, the Warsaw Convention will apply because the Hague Protocol country is automatically an adherent to the Warsaw Convention. If the Warsaw Convention applies, the definition of “international carriage” in Article 1(2) of that Conven- tion applies. The definition of “international carriage” in the Warsaw Convention is very similar to the definition of “international carriage” in the Hague Protocol. Section 18 of the CBA Act Part II of the CBA Act provides rules for carriage by air that is not international carriage (international carriage is dealt with in Part I and by the Conventions, as discussed above). Section 18 of the CBA Act defines “international carriage”, for the purposes of Part II of the CBA Act (i.e. for the purposes of working out what is not interna- tional carriage), as: “International carriage”, in relation to carriage by air, means carriage in which, according to the contract between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 12 place in another country. It is therefore necessary to ascertain who the “parties” to the agreement are, what the “agreement” between them is, and where the places of departure, destination, and any agreed stopping place are. The parties to the agreement In applying section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act and determining whether domestic air travel constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act, the Commissioner considers that the parties to the agreement or contract for carriage for the purposes of section 18 of the CBA Act and for the purposes of Article 1(2) of each Convention, are: •The passenger, if that passenger (or his or her agent) has arranged the carriage •All the carriers that are to provide carriage under the agreement or contract •If applicable, a person or organisation (not being the passenger or an agent of the passenger) will be a party to the agreement or contract for international carriage if that person or organisation enters into contractual relationships concerning the international carriage of the passenger. An example is an employer of a passenger if the employer has arranged the carriage. Such a carriage will not be prevented from being “international carriage” simply because the passenger is not a party to the contract: Ross v Pan American Airways 85 NE 2d 880 (1949); Block v Compagnie Nationale Air France 386 F 2d 323 (1967); Bafana & Anor v Commercial Airways (Pty) Limited (1990)(1)(SA)368. The agreement between the parties When determining whether carriage is “international carriage”, it appears that the important factor is what was the contemplation of all the parties who made the agreement or contract for carriage at the time the agreement or contract was made. Layovers and stops, even for extended periods of time, are unimportant if what was originally contemplated by the parties meets the descriptions in Article 1(2) or section 18 – i.e. if the parties originally contemplated that the places of depar- ture and destination would be in different countries or if they originally contemplated that the places of departure and destination would be in the same country but with an agreed stopping place in another country. Carriage which may, from the passenger’s perspective, be part of his or her journey, but which is arranged subsequently will not have been the contemplation of all the parties at the time the original agreement was made, and so does not form part of the original agreement or contract for “international carriage”. (However, depending on whether the subsequent carriage meets the criteria of Article 1(2) or section 18, that subsequent carriage may constitute a new and separate agreement or contract for international carriage.) involve places of departure and destination that are within countries which are both High Contracting Parties (or deemed High Contracting Parties) to that Convention. The section 18 definition is not limited to travel between particular countries, and potentially applies to carriage involving places of departure or destination in any country. 2.The Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol contain Article 1(3), which deems carriage per- formed by successive carriers to be one undivided carriage if that carriage has been regarded by the parties to it as a single operation. There is no equiva- lent of this provision in section 18. 3.Article 1(2) in the Hague Protocol speaks of “the agreement between the parties”. By contrast, sec- tion 18 refers to “the contract between the parties”. 4.For the purposes of applying Part II of the CBA Act, section 19(2) states that “international carriage” does not include any travel between New Zealand and the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands unless there is an agreed stopping place in another country. This is because these islands are deemed to be part of New Zealand for the purposes of Part II of the CBA Act. These islands are not deemed to be part of New Zealand for the purposes of Part I of the CBA Act or the conventions. In many cases, the question of whether a domestic flight within New Zealand comprises “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act can be answered by reference to the definitions in the Conventions, since most carriage involving two or more countries will be convention carriage under either the Hague Protocol or the Warsaw Convention. In some cases, however, the carriage may involve a place of departure or destination in a country that is not a Convention country. The Commissioner’s view is that the words ‘constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the Carriage By Air Act 1967’ in section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act mean: constitutes “international carriage” for any of the purposes of the Carriage By Air Act 1967. Thus, if the travel involves a place of departure or destination which is not a Conven- tion country, the Commissioner considers that the question of whether a domestic flight within New Zealand comprises part of a contract of “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act can be decided by reference to the section 18 definition. The requirements of “international carriage” under the Conventions and under section 18 are discussed below. Whether or not carriage constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the Warsaw Convention or the Hague Protocol or section 18 will depend fundamen- tally on whether, according to the agreement or contract between the parties, the parties agree that the places of departure and destination are in two different countries or are in a single country if there is an agreed stopping from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 13 If the re-ticketing merely changes the time or date of the original flight, or the airline with which the passenger is flying, the re-ticketing is likely to be a variation of the original contract. However, when a passenger alters a destination or adds a side-trip, the re-ticketing will amount to a new contract. For example, in Stratton v Trans Canada Airlines (1962) 32 DLR 2d. 736 the passenger booked flights from Seattle to Calgary, via Victoria and Vancouver. The passenger later decided to take a more direct route to Calgary, and booked a direct flight from Seattle to Vancouver (he intended to buy a ticket to Calgary when he arrived in Vancouver). This re-ticketing was a new contract that was not in the parties’ original contempla- tion at the time that the original arrangements were made. If the re-ticketing amounts to a new contract, rather than a mere variation of the original contract, the new contract will not be part of a “single operation” that the parties contemplated at the start of the agreement. The new contract will need to be examined to determine whether travel pursuant to it constitutes “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. If this is the case, the domestic flights which form part of the new contract will be able to be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). Otherwise, the domestic flights under the new contract should be standard rated. If a side-trip which is not part of the original contract is wholly domestic, it will be a separate contract from the original and will not be “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. The side-trip should be standard rated. Place of departure and place of destination Both the conventions and section 18 require the places of departure and destination to be within the territories of two different countries, or within a single country as long as there is an agreed stopping place outside that country. In Grein v Imperial Airways Ltd \[1936\] 2 All ER 1258, Greene LJ discussed the nature of the places of departure and destination. At page 1280 he said: ... every contract of carriage has one place of departure and one place of destination. An intermediate place at which the carriage may be broken is not regarded as a “place of destina- tion”. ... If the contract is for a circular voyage, starting at Berlin, visiting various European capitals, and ending at Berlin, the contractual carriage begins at Berlin and ends at Berlin. And at page 1282 he said: ... the contract by reference to which the place of departure and the place of destination are to be ascertained may be any contract of carriage whether for a single journey, for a circular journey, or for a return journey; that the place of departure the place of destination means the places at which under the particular contract in question the contractual carriage begins and ends. Multiple airlines There is no requirement in section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act that the air carriage services must be supplied by one supplier. For the purposes of that section, as long as the services supplied constitute “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act, those services are entitled to be zero-rated. Article 1(3) of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol specifically provides for carriage with succes- sive carriers to be treated as international carriage for the purposes of the convention if the parties have regarded the carriages as one undivided operation. Further, this sub-article provides that the fact that one carrier per- forms carriage totally within one country does not mean that the wider carriage loses its international character. There is no deeming provision which is similar to Article 1(3) for the purposes of the definition of “inter- national carriage” in section 18. However, in determin- ing whether section 11(2)(aa) applies to domestic air travel, the Commissioner considers that the same treatment will apply to carriage with successive carriers for the purposes of section 18 of the CBA Act as applies for the purposes of Article 1(3). In other words, for the purposes of applying section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act and determining whether domestic air carriage is “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act, carriage which is performed by successive carriers will be regarded as one undivided carriage if it is regarded by all the parties, and in particular the supplier of the domestic air travel services, as part of a single operation for international carriage. In order for successive carriage to be regarded as one undivided carriage, all the carriers must have regarded the flights as a single operation at the time the agreement or contract was made. It is clear from the authorities that if a series of flights was contemplated by one party, but not another, at the time the agreement or contract for carriage was made, the flights with successive carriers could not be viewed as a “single operation”: Karfunkel v Compagnie Nationale Air France 427 F Supp. 971 (1977); Lemley v TWA Inc 807 F 2d 26 (1986). In particular, if a second carrier is organised by the main carrier, or any other person, and the second carrier does not know that its services are part of a larger operation of carriage, its services may not be part of an “undivided carriage”: Stratton v Trans Canada Airlines (1962) 32 DLR 2d. 736. If the second carrier is operating a domestic flight in New Zealand, and does not know any details of the wider air travel arrangements, so that it cannot be said to regard the domestic flight services that it is providing as being part of a “single operation” with the wider arrangements, the domestic flight services will not be part of the “international carriage”. Re-ticketing Re-ticketing can amount either to a variation to the original contract, or to the formation of a new contract. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 14 country other than New Zealand, Cook Islands, Niue and the Tokelau Islands. In this situation the travel can be “international carriage” under section 18 for the pur- poses of Part II of the CBA Act. This will satisfy the zero-rating requirements under section 11(2)(aa). The above comments are applicable only to air travel involving the Islands mentioned. If section 19 of the CBA Act had not deemed these Islands to be part of New Zealand, travel that cannot be zero-rated as de- scribed above could have been considered to be “inter- national carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act under section 18 of that Act. This is the only reason why the Commissioner considers that travel involving these countries is treated differently from travel involving other non-Convention countries. Section 19 of the CBA Act deems travel to these Islands to be travel within New Zealand “for the purposes of Part II of that Act” only. These Islands are not part of New Zealand for the purposes of the definitions con- tained in the Conventions, nor are these Islands part of New Zealand for the purposes of any other provision in the GST Act. This also means that the actual flight to these Islands can be zero-rated under section 11(2)(a). This is irrespective of the treatment applicable to the domestic flights associated with such travel. The treat- ment of the domestic flights is linked to the CBA Act and must be considered separately from the actual flight to these Islands. However, this Ruling is concerned with the application of section 11(2)(aa) (not section 11(2)(a)) which in- volves the zero-rating flight services between two points in New Zealand and whether the “domestic flights” can be considered to be “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act. Comments on technical submissions received The principal submissions received on the first exposure draft focused on travel involving the Cook Islands, Niue, and the Tokelau Islands. However, as discussed in the above commentary, the unique GST treatment arises as a result of provisions contained in the CBA Act. Examples The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to cater for all circumstances that may arise. Example 1 Passenger A intends travelling to Australia to attend a wedding. The travel agent arranges air travel from Wellington to Auckland to Sydney. No return flights have been arranged. The tickets are provided to Passenger A in a single book of tickets. Passenger A pays for them in advance. The tickets show that the flights are from Wellington to Auckland to Sydney. Only one airline carrier will undertake to carry If more than one carrier is involved, the “place of destination” is not the destination of each successive carrier, but is the place where the carriage finally ends according to the intention of the parties. As a final point, it should be noted that travel solely between New Zealand and the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands is considered to be “domestic travel” within New Zealand for the purposes of Part II of the CBA Act 1967. Accordingly, such travel cannot be considered to be “international carriage” under sec- tion 18 of that Act. As a result, any air travel within New Zealand that is associated with travel to or from the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands cannot be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act by virtue of section 18 of the CBA Act. In addition, these Islands are not signatories in their own right to the Conventions. Accordingly, one way travel between New Zealand and these Islands is not “interna- tional carriage” for the purposes of the Conventions because the places of departure and destination are not both within the territories of parties to Conventions. As a result, any air travel within New Zealand that is associ- ated with one way travel to or from the Cook Islands, Niue, or the Tokelau Islands cannot be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa) of the GST Act. As an example, a flight from Wellington to Auckland cannot be zero-rated even where there is a single contract of carriage which involves taking the passenger to one of the Islands. The exception to this is if there is an agreed stopping place located in a country other than New Zealand, Cook Islands, Niue, and the Tokelau Islands. In this case, although this is non-Convention carriage, section 18 of the CBA Act can be applied. Under this section travel from New Zealand to the Islands is considered to be travel within New Zealand. However, if there is an agreed stopping place other than in New Zealand or the Islands, e.g. Australia, this will satisfy the definition of “international carriage” for the purposes of Part II of the CBA Act. However, in the case of circular flights, it is necessary to determine where the places of departure and destina- tion are located. If a circular flight involving travel to the Islands starts and ends in New Zealand, any domestic flight included in the contract of carriage will be “inter- national carriage” for the purposes of the Conventions. This is because New Zealand is a party to the Conven- tions and the travel is from New Zealand to New Zealand with agreed stopping places outside New Zealand. In this case it does not matter that the agreed stopping place is located in a country that is not a party to the Conventions. If, on the other hand, the circular flight starts and ends in one of the Islands, any domestic flight cannot be consid- ered for zero-rating under section 11(2)(aa) as such travel will not be “international carriage” for any of the purposes of the CBA Act. However, the exception will be if a flight starts from one of the Islands and returns to that Island but there is an agreed stopping place in a from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 15 Consequently, these facts do not fall within the Arrangement to which the Ruling applies. There are, prima facie, two separate contracts or agreements that are to be performed independently of each other. Given that all the requirements of the Ar- rangement contained in the Ruling are not satisfied, the flight from Christchurch to Auckland cannot be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). Example 3 Passenger C wishes to arrange a holiday tour package involving a return journey from Tokyo, Japan. The tour is to include various New Zealand destinations. Passenger C contacts a local travel agent in Tokyo to arrange the tour package. The Japanese travel agent contacts a New Zealand travel agent to arrange the New Zealand portion of the tour. The tour involves the following: •Flight from Tokyo to Christchurch; •Hotel accommodation in Christchurch for two nights and a sightseeing bus tour around Christchurch; •Flight from Christchurch to Wellington; •Sightseeing tour around Wellington; •Same day flight from Wellington to Hamilton; •Four days of accommodation and sightseeing around the Waikato arranged; •A bus trip to Auckland from Hamilton and a five day stopover there; •Flight from Auckland to Tokyo. All this is arranged as a single package for Passenger C. Several different books of tickets and information are provided to Passenger C, and the flights also involve several airlines. Some airline tickets are issued on domestic ticket stock while others are issued on international stock. However, the domestic tickets are noted that they are issued in conjunction with the international tickets. In respect of the Arrangement contained in the Ruling, the following can be determined from the above: •The package involves more than just airline travel. The bus travel, accommodation and sightseeing services must be ignored when considering zero- rating under section 11(2)(aa). Only the air travel is relevant. •The package does contain domestic air travel, i.e. from Christchurch to Wellington to Hamilton. •The place of departure and destination can be said to be Tokyo. The carriage commences and ends in Japan. •The package is arranged as a return journey. It is assumed that all the parties, being all the carriers and Passenger C, regard all the air travel as a single operation. The whole operation is arranged as a package and the domestic tickets note that Passenger A to Sydney. The airline acknowledges that the flight is an international flight with a connection in Auckland. With respect to the Arrangement contained in the Ruling, it can be determined that: •The travel is by air; •It does involve travel from one place in New Zealand to another place in New Zealand, i.e. from Wellington to Auckland; •The places of departure and destination are within the territories of two countries, i.e. New Zealand and Australia respectively; •The factors that indicate that the two flights may be part of a single operation to transport Passenger A from Wellington to Sydney include: •The fact that the flights are arranged together by the travel agent; •The flights are ticketed together and provided in a book of tickets; •The passenger contemplates going to Sydney and not to Auckland. However, all factors surrounding the circum- stances of particular passengers must be taken into consideration in forming a view as to what was contemplated by the parties to the contract or agreement. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that all parties contemplate that the travel is to be performed as a single operation. The domestic leg of the journey can be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). Both New Zealand and Australia are parties to the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol and the journey can be regarded as Convention carriage. In addition, this travel would also satisfy the definition of “international carriage” in section 18 of the CBA Act. Accord- ingly, the domestic leg of the travel to Australia is “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA Act and, therefore, the requirements of section 11(2)(aa) are satisfied. Example 2 Passenger B arranges air travel from Christchurch to Auckland to attend a conference. This is arranged through a travel agent one week before the confer- ence. The ticket is booked and paid for. One day before this travel, Passenger B contacts the travel agent again to arrange an additional flight from Auckland to India with a stopover in Singapore. Passenger B believes that the additional flight may as well be taken advantage of as Passenger B will be in Auckland. The second flight is booked by the travel agent and a separate ticket is provided to Passenger B for this flight. The circumstances of Passenger B would suggest that not all the parties have contemplated all the flights to be performed as a single operation. continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 16 Act and, therefore, the requirements of section 11(2)(aa) are satisfied. Example 4 While in Auckland, Passenger C, in Example 3 above, decides to add a trip from Auckland to Queenstown return before returning to Japan. The travel agent arranges this additional trip and adds it to the tour package. The domestic ticket is noted as being issued in conjunction with the international tickets. This additional trip was not contemplated by all the parties at the time the original package was put together. This additional trip is a separate contract or agreement from the international carriage contract or agreement. Consequently, these facts do not fall within the Arrangement to which the Ruling applies. As this additional trip is purely domestic, it cannot be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa).

It is assumed that the international carriers are aware of these domestic flights and consider these flights to be part of the interna- tional carriage. These factors are indicative of all the flights being performed as a single operation. However, it is also necessary to be satisfied that all the carriers regard the flights as part of a wider contract or agreement involving international travel, especially given that more than one carrier is involved. For the purposes of this example, it is assumed that this is the case. The domestic flights can be zero-rated under section 11(2)(aa). Japan, like New Zealand, is a signatory to both the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Proto- col. In addition, section 18 could also be applied to treat the carriage as “international carriage”. Ac- cordingly, the domestic leg of the overall travel is “international carriage” for the purposes of the CBA from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 17 Schedule: States that are party to the Hague Protocol Afghanistan Algeria Argentina Australia Austria Bahamas Bangladesh Belarus Belgium Benin Brazil Bulgaria Cameroon Canada Chile Colombia Congo Costa Rica Cote d’Ivoire Croatia Cuba Cyprus Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Denmark Dominican Republic Ecuador Egypt El Salvador Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) Fiji Finland France Gabon Germany Greece Grenada Guatemala Guinea Hungary Iceland India Iran, Islamic Republic of Iraq Ireland Israel Italy Japan Jordan Kuwait Lao People’s Democratic Republic Lebanon Lesotho Libyan Arab Jamahirrya Liechtenstein Luxembourg Madagascar Malawi Malaysia Mali Mauritius Mexico Monaco Morocco Nauru Nepal Netherlands, Kingdom of the New Zealand Niger Nigeria Norway Oman Pakistan Papua New Guinea Paraguay Peru Philippines Poland Portugal Qatar Republic of Korea Romania Russian Federation Rwanda Samoa Saudi Arabia Senegal Seychelles Singapore Solomon Islands South Africa Spain Sudan Swaziland Sweden Switzerland Syrian Arab Republic Togo Tonga Trinidad and Tobago Tunisia Turkey Ukraine United Arab Emirates United Kingdom Vanuatu Venezuela Viet Nam Yemen Yugoslavia Zambia Zimbabwe AMP Society’s demutualisation – issue of shares does not constitute a claim Product Ruling BR Prd 97/78 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of the definition of “claim” in section OB 1 and the life insurance rules as defined in section OZ (1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the demutualisation of the AMP Society whereby the rights of members of the AMP Society are extinguished in exchange for shares in AMP Limited. Background On 11 December 1996 the board of the AMP Society unanimously voted to rec- ommend to members that the AMP Society demutualise. continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 18 AMP Limited will be formed and will act as the ultimate holding company of the AMP Society and other operating subsidiaries. A meeting of members of the AMP Society will be convened (anticipated to take place in November 1997) to consider approving the demutualisation. If the meeting gives the requisite approval, the AMP Society will apply to the Attor- ney-General of New South Wales for a Certificate of Conversion under the Australian Mutual Provident Society (Demutualisation & Reconstruction) Act 1997 (the Demutualisation Act). The issue of the Certificate of Conversion will formally trigger the provisions of the Demutualisation Act and specify the Demutualisation Date (expected to be 1 January 1998). Demutualisation will have effect at the Conversion Time (pro- posed as 12 noon on 1 January 1998). At the Shareholding Time (proposed as 11.30 am on 1 January 1998), AMP Insurance Limited (a newly incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary of AMP Limited) will have its rights as an existing policyholder converted to rights as a shareholder in the AMP Society (the Subscriber Shares) in accordance with the Demutualisation Act. At the Conversion Time, the AMP Society will demutualise and all membership rights, but not the Subscriber Shares held by AMP Insurance Limited, will be extinguished. Simultaneously, AMP Limited will issue shares to the members of the AMP Society. Subsequent to the issue of shares, AMP Limited will seek to be listed on the Australian and New Zealand Stock Exchanges within the period prescribed by law. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumption that: •AMP Limited will not be a “life insurer”, as defined in section OB 1, at the time of issuing the shares to the former members of the AMP Society. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The issue of shares in AMP Limited to those members of the AMP Society eligible to receive shares as a result of the demutualisation, does not constitute a “claim” as defined in section OB 1. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from the date of the ruling to 31 December 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7th day of October 1997.

Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 unless other- wise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 61 and 63, and to the definitions of “disposition of property” and “gift” in section 2(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the demutualisation of the AMP Society whereby the rights of members of the AMP Society are extinguished in exchange for shares in AMP Limited. Background On 11 December 1996 the board of the AMP Society unanimously voted to rec- ommend to members that the AMP Society demutualise.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) AMP Society’s demutualisation – issue of shares does not constitute a dividend Product Ruling BR Prd 97/85 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Non-binding tax statement to AMP policyholders This non-binding statement is issued by the Commissioner in order to clarify how income arising from the demutualisation of the AMP Society may be assessable in the hands of policyholders. It is included with the preceding product rulings at the request of AMP. There will be no tax consequences for most policyhold- ers upon the receipt of shares on the demutualisation of AMP. In particular, shares received as part of the demutualisation process and the proceeds of the first sale of those shares, or alternatively the receipt of the cash value of the share entitlement in respect of a policy, will not ordinarily generate assessable income in the hands of a policyholder if: •the policy was taken out for personal or family reasons. This includes the assignee of such a policy where the assignee is a relative or family trust; or •the policy was taken out over the life or well-being of an employee or business principal of the business (corporate or otherwise); or •the policy was taken out to protect personal earnings or business income in the event of disablement or trauma of an individual; or •the policy was taken out over the life or well-being of a member, or a group of members, of a New Zealand registered superannuation scheme by the trustees of the scheme. The on-distribution of shares by trustees to members will not give rise to taxable income in the members’ hands; or •the policy is an accident and disability or trauma policy taken out for the purposes of providing a lump sum, or non-earnings related payment in the event of the disablement or trauma of an individual. However, there may be tax consequences for those policyholders whose business activities mean that they deal in insurance policies or are otherwise ordinarily taxable on such receipts, or any policyholders who demonstrate that they acquired shares for the purpose of sale or other disposal. In addition, if a person acquires further shares with the purpose of resale, any profit on the sale of those shares will be taxable. The views expressed in this non-binding statement represent the Commissioner’s policy in relation to the demutualisation of AMP. Relevant policyholders should note that the treatment of the shares issued (or their cash equivalent) will not affect the tax status of the proceeds of any claim paid under a policy. MJ Carr National Manager, Corporates January 1998 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 22 Notice of Product Ruling BR Prd 98/11 1. This is a notice of a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2. Product ruling 98/11 was issued on 29 April 1998. It relates to bloodstock leasing, and the application of various sections and definitions within the Income Tax Act 1994, and will be published in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin Volume Ten, No.5 of May 1998. 3. A copy of the ruling may be obtained by writing to the Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings), National Office, Inland Revenue, P.O. Box 2198, Wellington. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) The above notice was published in the New Zealand Gazette of 7 May 1998. We have since been notified of the withdrawal of publication permission. However, copies of the ruling are available as per paragraph 3 of the notice. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 23 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Rev- enue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess tax- payers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. GST and debt factoring Notice of withdrawal of item in Public Information Bulletin 164 An item in PIB 164 of August 1987 (at page 27, para- graph 5), and another in Technical Rulings (at paragraph 104.9.4) conclude that where a registered person ac- counting for GST on the invoice basis sells a debt for less than its face value, that person can claim as a bad debt the difference between the amount of GST ac- counted for and the actual amount received in respect of the supply. The inference being that the difference is a bad debt for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188 (which is being appealed) reached a different conclusion. In particular, the Taxation Review Authority concluded that where a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the factor is not a bad debt. The Commissioner agrees with the decision in Case T27. The Commissioner advises that the items in PIB 164 and in Technical Rulings are inconsistent with current law principles. Accordingly, the items are withdrawn from 1 June 1998, and from that date should not be consid- ered to be an expression of the Commissioner’s view on the law. A public ruling on the issue is now being drafted and will be released for external consultation in the near future. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 24 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Vehicle registration plates bought as an investment – income tax implications Section CD 3, CD 4 – Items included in assessable income: A taxpayer wishes to know the income tax implications of the purchase and eventual sale of a vehicle registration plate that she has acquired as an investment. The registration plate purchased is an investment plate, not a personalised number plate. Profits from the sale of the vehicle investment plate could be assessable in two situations, firstly, under section CD 3: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. “Business” is defined in section OB 1 and includes: any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. If the taxpayer buys and sells vehicle investment plates as part of a business of trading in those items, any profit or gain is assessable income under this section. If the taxpayer is in business under the above definitions, the plate will constitute trading stock. This means it must be brought in as stock on hand at the end of the year, and be valued at its cost price, its market selling value, or the price at which it can be replaced. The taxpayer has the option of which of these values to use. Secondly, under section CD 4, income tax is payable on: any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any personal property or any interest in personal property (not being property or any interest in property which consists of land), if the business of the person comprises dealing in such property, or if the property was acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it, and any amount derived from the carrying on or carrying out of any undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. Inland Revenue’s view is that it would be difficult to see any other reason for acquiring an investment plate other than for eventual sale at a profit. As there is no other income stream associated with the purchase, the onus would be on the taxpayer to demonstrate that the “investment” is not purchased with the inten- tion of resale. If the taxpayer purchased the investment plate as an investment with the pur- pose of eventual resale, any profit on the sale of the plate will be assessable income. Correspondingly, any loss made on the sale of the investment plate would be deductible. A deduction will be allowed under section BD 2 for any expenses incurred for the purchase (other than the purchase price) and holding of the plates, in the year the expense is incurred. The purchase price is allowed as a deduction in the year of sale. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 25 Endowment policy taken out to repay a business loan Section DJ 11 - Expenditure incurred in borrowing money or obtaining lease: A taxpayer is anxious to obtain a $500,000 loan for her business. A representative of a financial institution has advised her to take out an endowment policy that will mature after 15 years, yielding the amount of the loan. The period of the policy corresponds with the period of the loan. The representative claims the annual premiums of $20,000 are deductible under section DJ 11, and the taxpayer has sought confirmation of this. Section DJ 11 allows a deduction: ... as the Commissioner thinks fit in respect of expenditure incurred by the taxpayer during the income year for the preparation, stamping, and registration of any lease of property used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, or of any renewal of any such lease, or in the borrowing of money employed by the taxpayer as capital in the derivation of gross income. Section DJ 11 allows a deduction for expenses incurred in borrowing money, not the repayment of the money itself. It applies to expenses that are generally one- off costs, such as loan application fees, brokerage, legal or accounting fees, etc. Such expenses are generally incurred before taking out the loan. In Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No.9 (February 1995) it was agreed that “mortgage repayment insurance” taken out to obtain a loan would be deductible under this section. Mortgage repayment insurance is taken out as protection against certain misfortunes. For example, the policy may provide for the repay- ment of a mortgage if the taxpayer is injured and no longer able to work. Alter- natively, it may provide for mortgage payments to be made by an insurance company while the taxpayer is ill and unable to make the payments, with the taxpayer resuming responsibility for payments once he or she has recovered and returned to work. The scheme proposed in this case is that the taxpayer pays into an endowment policy over the period of the loan. During the period of the loan, the taxpayer will be meeting interest payments only. At the time the loan is due for repay- ment, the endowment policy will have attained a value sufficient to repay the amount of the loan. It is the Commissioner’s view that the annual premiums are not expenses incurred in borrowing money. Rather, such an arrangement is intended to provide funds for the repayment of the money that has been bor- rowed. Inland Revenue advised the taxpayer that a deduction for the annual premiums was not permitted under section DJ 11. Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Approved Issuer Levy – Commissioner’s policy on late payments Section 86M – Beyond reasonable control: Approved issuer levy (AIL) is a levy paid for the right to issue interest bearing securities that are subject to a zero rate of non-resident withholding tax. One of the objectives of AIL is to attract foreign investment to New Zealand through a concessionary levy mechanism that ben- efits non-residents who are unable to claim credit for any NRWT paid on interest earned in New Zealand. Inland Revenue may withdraw approved issuer status if the payer is guilty of serious default or neglect of their tax affairs – which may include late or non- payment of AIL. continued on page 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 26 We have recently had several enquiries about the circumstances in which we would accept a late payment of AIL as being on time, as provided for by section 86M of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. This section allows the Commissioner to fix or alter the due date for payment of AIL so that a payment made after the original due date can be accepted as being paid on time. This discretion is important because if the AIL is paid late, the interest may no longer be subject to the zero rate of non-resident withholding tax. The interest would become liable to the usual rate of non-resident withholding tax (10% or 15%). In order for the Commissioner to alter the due date for payment, he must be satisfied that the payment is late for reasons “beyond the payer’s control”. Al- though the term “beyond the payer’s control” is not statutorily defined, the usual legislative meaning of this term includes accident or illness. For the purposes of this section the payer cannot be separated from the errors or omissions of em- ployees. A payer is expected to maintain a reasonable standard of business organisation standards and professional conduct throughout periods of change and pressure of work. The following reasons do not meet the test of “beyond the payer’s control”: •employee error •employee oversight •employee failure to follow instructions •personnel changes as a result of usual staff turnover and or restructuring •pay-in slips (IR 67A) not received. Inland Revenue considers every instance of late payment of AIL carefully, be- cause of the financial impact of the interest being liable to non-resident with- holding tax at 10% or 15% rate. Only unanticipated, unplanned or unforeseen circumstances which prevent the timely payment of the levy meet the criteria of being beyond the payer’s control and can therefore receive favourable considera- tion under section 86M. Note: This policy is to be read separately to that existing for applications for remission of penalties on late payments of tax. from page 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 27 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Tax avoidance – trading company shares sold to holding company at inflated price Case:TRA No. 90/207, 94/154, 93/59, 94/152, 93/58, 94/155, 93/62, 94/153: Decision No 7/98 Decision date:16 April 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keyword:Tax avoidance Summary:Barber J found that the Commissioner had followed the 4-step practice statement and that “the facts of this case cry out the concept of tax avoidance”. Facts:This is a template case as detailed in Case R25 and summarised in Miller/ McDougall v CIR. The usual application of the template has shareholders in a trading company selling their shares in that company to JGR entities at an in- flated price and then JGR entities paying for those shares using the profits earned by the company, less the fees to JGR entities. Effectively the profits of the trading company pass to loss owning JGR entities and, less JGR fees, are paid back to the shareholders as capital. The vendor shareholders continue to manage the business and usually have an option to put it back at a time for a nominal sum, when sometimes the whole process recommences. Decision:Barber J was of the opinion that the case was similar to Miller and he considered that the arguments advanced by the taxpayers were simply a repackage of the arguments in Miller. His Honour found that the Commissioner had followed his 4-step practice statement. His Honour considered it appropriate that prior knowledge of the Russell template could be used in making the 4-step analysis and that this was a proper use of that knowledge. He accepted that the assessments were not invalid for want of that analysis as it was done. His Honour also considered that there was nothing sinister about the Commis- sioner deciding to assess the shareholders rather than the trading companies in the circumstances. He found that the test of whether the assessments were intelligible was an objec- tive one and it did not matter that the taxpayers or their advisors did not under- stand them, provided that the assessments were intelligible applying objective standards. The Commissioner, accordingly, had met the Lowe threshold. His Honour considered that the reopening of the statute barred years was proper, as the income was not mentioned in the returns made and it made no difference if the Commissioner was aware of the scheme and its effect. The statutory test focused on the returns made and nothing else. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 28 Planning and legal costs – whether capital or revenue Case:Case 96/081: Decision No. 8/98 Decision date:28 April 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keyword:Deductibility of planning and legal costs Summary:Barber J found that the costs claimed as a deduction were a capital cost and not deductible. Facts:The Objector is a private company carrying on business as an importer of used farm machinery for resale. The Objector incurred legal and planning costs to obtain the necessary resource consent to conduct its business from a chosen premise. It claimed these costs as a deduction in its 1994 tax return. The Commissioner assessed the Objector on the basis the costs were capital expenditure. Decision:Barber J regarded the expenditure incurred to be for the re-establishment of a business structure (a capital cost) and not deductible under section 106(1)(a). His Honour stated that there could be circumstances where the costs of obtaining a resource consent could form part of a business’s income earning process rather than its capital structure. However, the issue would always turn on the particu- lar facts. Power company: non-deductibility of laying underground cables, assessability of value of electricity supplied but not yet metered or invoiced Case:Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Limited v CIR Decision date:30 April 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Assessable income; deductions for underground cables Summary:This is the first of the Electric Supply Authority cases concerning laying under- ground cables. Facts:Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd (formerly the Hawkes Bay Power Board) is an energy supply authority. Since 1969 Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd’s main policy objective was to replace the overhead wiring in its residential areas with underground cabling, which it did at a rate of 14 kilometres per year. Two issues arose for consideration. First, whether the Objector was entitled to a deduction under the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”) for expenditure incurred in laying electricity cables underground. Second, whether the Objector was re- quired to treat as assessable income under the Act an estimation of the value of electricity which, at the end of the income year, had been supplied but neither metered nor invoiced. Decision:Goddard J held that money spent on replacing the overhead lines with under- ground cables was capital in nature. Her Honour found that the underground systems and overhead systems were different in character and that the replace- ment of the overhead cables involved the progressive replacement of one type of asset with another. Her Honour also found that the electricity supplied by the Objector (but neither metered nor invoiced at balance date) constituted derived income and was therefore assessable. Goddard J stated that the income was assessable, as the earning process was complete when the electricity was supplied and consumed by consumers. It was at that point that a legally enforceable right to the income from the “sale” arose. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.5 (May 1998) 29 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

That case dealt with the timing of deductions and, in particular, the meaning of “incurred” (as it now appears in section BD 2(1)(b)) in the context of warranty expenditure. The Privy Council held that the taxpayer in the case incurred future estimated warranty expenditure in the year in which it sold the warranted vehicles and, as a consequence, was entitled to take a deduction for that estimated expenditure in that income year. This statement sets out Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the meaning of “incurred” in the light of Mitsubishi. It also considers: •what is required in terms of a reasonable estimation of future estimated expenditure; •how to account for estimated liabilities, including in the first year that an estimated basis is adopted; and •the application of section EF 1. In this regard, this statement reaches the following conclusions: •The Mitsubishi decision applies to express warranties of the type considered in the case. It also applies to warranties and guarantees of a similar nature implied under statute. It is acknowledged that the decision has potentially widened the meaning of “incurred”. In some situations this will mean that taxpayers are able to claim deductions in anticipation of expenditure, where previously a deduction could be claimed only after an obligation to pay a particular sum had arisen. However, it will always be necessary to identify the event which gives rise to the liability, and to determine whether that event has occurred prior to year-end. •In addition, to rely on Mitsubishi taxpayers must be able to make a reasonable estimation of the relevant future expenditure. To the extent that it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation, the expenditure has not been incurred in that income year. The authorities indicate that a rigorous standard, as regards the provision of detailed information and calculation methods to support claims for deductions based on estimations, is required. To this end, Inland Revenue will require taxpayers who seek to rely on the Mitsubishi decision to substantiate claims made on the basis of estimated future expenditure in the light of their particular circumstances. •The approach taken in the insurance industry in relation to expenditure which has been “incurred but not reported” (IBNR) reporting is accepted as a workable treatment for accounting for estimated future expenditure for which deductions are available in accordance with Mitsubishi. In changing to such a method, it is acceptable to take a deduction in the first year of adjustment of all estimated future expenditure for which a deduction is available on the basis of the reasoning in Mitsubishi. In this regard, the Commis- sioner will exercise his discretion under section EC 1(1) and EC 1(3) to permit a deduction for all estimated future warranty claims in the first year, without requiring any corresponding adding back of the estimated claims as at the beginning of that year. In some cases it may be necessary to re-estimate (either upwards or downwards) estimated claims relating to previous income years. In both cases, the adjustment should be made in the year in which the revised estimate is made, and not in the original year of deduction. •Inland Revenue accepts that section EF 1 does not apply to require the adding back of warranty expendi- ture in the same or similar factual situations to those which arose in Mitsubishi. It is considered to be unclear whether the words of section EF 1 are wide enough to apply to expenditure incurred by a warran- tor in the same or similar circumstances to those which arose in the case. Given such ambiguity it is necessary to look to the legislative context and background to the enactment of the provision, as considered by the courts. Taking into account such matters, and in particular the recent Court of Appeal judgment in Thornton Estates Ltd. v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577, it is considered that the better view is that the section is aimed at achieving matching of the timing of deductions with the income flowing from that ex- penditure, and should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with that aim. To apply section EF 1 to facts analogous to those arising in Mitsubishi would result in a taxation treatment that differs from matching in those terms. Summary IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 5 Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (“MMNZ”) assembled new motor vehicles and sold them through franchised dealers. The dealers in turn sold those motor vehicles under warranty to retail customers. The war- ranty provided against defects appearing in the material or workmanship of the vehicle during the warranty period. Under the terms of their dealership franchise, MMNZ reimbursed dealers for expenditure incurred by dealers in meeting warranty claims. The issue before the courts was whether, in computing its profits or gains, MMNZ could deduct its anticipated liabilities under warranties which remained unexpired at the end of the income year, for vehicles sold during that income year. The High Court found in favour of the taxpayer: Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,163. Doogue J held that the taxpayer was definitively committed to the warranty expenditure as at the time of sale and delivery of the vehicles. The Court of Appeal also found for the taxpayer, but on a different basis: CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,099. The Court considered that MMNZ was not definitively committed to warranty expenditure because the liability was contingent on a defect manifesting itself within the warranty period. However, the Court reached a similar result by conclud- ing that part of the sale price represented unearned income; income that was not derived until performance of the warranty was completed or discharged. The Commissioner appealed from that decision to the Privy Council. The Privy Council dismissed the Com- missioner’s appeal, finding for the taxpayer on the question of deductibility on the basis that the taxpayer was definitively committed to the future warranty expenditure. Inland Revenue released an issues paper, Implications of the Mitsubishi Decision on 10 December 1996 (Issues Paper No 2: reference 3533) (“the issues paper”). The submissions received in response to that paper have been fully considered in the formulation of this interpretation statement. In December 1997 the Court of Appeal heard the case of Thornton Estates Ltd. v CIR. That decision is discussed below in relation to the issue of the application of section EF 1 to the deductibility of warranty expendi- ture. Background Legislation Section BD 2(1) determines what is meant by an allow- able deduction. It states: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer ... (b)to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i)incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii)necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (iii)allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), H (Treat- ment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). (Emphasis added) Section BD 4 allocates allowable deductions to particu- lar income years. It states: (1)A taxpayer or the Commissioner must allocate each allowable deduction to an income year in accordance with this section. (2)If an allowable deduction is subject to a timing regime, the deduction must be allocated to an income year in accord- ance with that regime. (3)An allowable deduction that is not subject to a timing regime must be allocated to the income year in which the allowable deduction is incurred. (4)If an expenditure or loss gives rise to more than one allowable deduction, the allowable deductions may be allocated to income years to the extent that their total does not exceed the amount of that expenditure or loss. (Empha- sis added) Section EC 1 provides a mechanism by which the Commissioner may make adjustments in one income year for incorrect accounting practice in previous years. It states: (1)This section applies if in respect of an income year (that income year being referred to in this section as the “year of adjustment”) the Commissioner is satisfied that the gross income or allowable deductions of a person in respect of a business for any income year or income years (that income year or those income years being referred to in this section as the “preceding period”) preceding the year of adjust- ment have been understated or overstated by reason of the whole or any part of that gross income or those allowable deductions having been calculated - (a)By reference to cash receipts or outgoings and without taking into account amounts owing to or by the taxpayer at the beginning or end of any income year in the preceding period; or (b)By taking into account provisions or reserves which are not allowed as deductions; or (c)Without taking into account provisions or reserves which are allowed as deductions; or continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 6 from page 5 (d)By including as gross income for an income year in the preceding period an incorrect proportion of any amount received by the taxpayer in respect of transactions not completed at the end of the income year. (2)The Commissioner may, with respect to a taxpayer to whom this section applies and to a year of adjustment, deem the following amounts to be gross income derived by the taxpayer in that year - (a)Where subsection (1)(a) applies, the total of the amounts owing to the taxpayer at the end of the preceding period; and (b)The total amount of any provisions or reserves to which subsection (1)(b) refers; and (c)The total of any amounts to which paragraph (d) refers that are in respect of transactions not completed at the end of the preceding period and that had not been included in annual gross income for any income year in the preceding period. (3)The Commissioner may, with respect to a taxpayer to whom this section applies and to a year of adjustment, deem the following amounts to be allowable deductions incurred by the taxpayer in that year - (a)Where subsection (1)(a) applies, the total of the amounts owed by the taxpayer at the end of the preceding period; and (b)The total amount of any provisions or reserves to which subsection (1)(c) refers; and (c)The total of any amounts to which subsection (1)(d) refers that are in respect of transactions not completed at the end of the preceding period and that had been incorrectly included in annual gross income for any income year in the preceding period. ... Section EF 1 deals with “accrual expenditure”. It provides a “qualification” to the general position under the Act that outgoings relating to the gaining or produc- tion of assessable income are deductible when incurred. Although a deduction is allowed for the expenditure incurred, under section EF 1 assessable income is deemed to include the amount of the unexpired portion of any “accrual expenditure” that relates to future income years. It states: (1)Where any person has incurred any accrual expenditure - (a)That expenditure is allowed as a deduction when it is incurred in accordance with this Act; and (b)The unexpired portion of that expenditure at the end of an income year shall be included in the gross income of the person for that income year and shall be allowed as a deduction in the following income year. (2)(repealed) ... (5)The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be - (a)Where the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods, the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in deriving gross income: (b)Where the expenditure relates to payment for services, the amount of expenditure incurred on services not performed: (c)Subject to subsection (8), where the expenditure is incurred by way of monetary remuneration for services that have been performed, the amount of the expendi- ture that has not been paid in the income year or within such further period as is specified in subsection (6): (d)Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. (5A)For the purposes of this section, any payment to which section CB 12(1) applies is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the payer as payment for services performed in the year or years in which the recipient of the payment is expected to incur the expenditure to which the payment relates. ... (7)In this section - “Goods” means all real or personal property; but does not include choses in action or money: “Services” means anything which is not goods or money or a chose in action. ... “Accrual expenditure” is defined in section OB 1: “Accrual expenditure”, in sections EF 1 and FE 4, in relation to any person, means any amount of expenditure incurred on or after 1 August 1986 by the person that is deductible under this Act, or was deductible under the Income Act 1976, other than expenditure incurred - (a)In the purchase of trading stock; or (b)In respect of any financial arrangement; or (c)In respect of a specified lease, or a lease to which section EO 2 applies; or (d)Under a binding contract entered into before 8.30 p.m. New Zealand Standard Time on 31 July 1986: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 7 Facts As indicated in the “Background” section, the case involved the timing of the deductibility of warranty expenditure. The taxpayer assembled new motor vehi- cles and sold them under warranty through franchised dealers. The warranty provided against defects appearing in the material or workmanship of the vehicle during the warranty period. The issue before the courts was whether, in computing its profits or gains, the taxpayer could deduct its anticipated liabilities under warranties which remained unexpired at the end of the income year, for vehicles sold during that income year. Decision The Privy Council dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal, finding for the taxpayer on the question of deductibility on the basis that the taxpayer was defini- tively committed to the future warranty expenditure. The Privy Council was satisfied that the evidence showed that it was in accordance with proper accounting treatment for the taxpayer to match the reasonable estimation of the cost of meeting warranty claims against the corresponding income earned from vehicle sales in the relevant income year. Their Lordships noted that the evidence before the High Court satisfied Doogue J that a reasonable estimation could be placed upon the antici- pated liabilities. The Privy Council considered that the New Zealand courts have “followed Australian authorities” on the meaning of “incurred”. “Incurred” has been held to mean that the taxpayer must have either paid or become “definitively committed” to the expenditure before a deduction will be available. As a summary of the test in the Australian and New Zealand context, their Lordships referred to the four propositions put forward by Henry J in AM Bisley & Co Ltd v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,082 at 5,096, i.e.: •a particular expenditure is incurred for tax purposes in any income year if it constitutes an existing obliga- tion which arose in the course of that year; •where the expenditure arises under a written deed or agreement, determining whether or not it is an existing obligation is a question of construction of that deed or agreement; •the fact that the expenditure is not payable until some future date does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation; •the fact that the expenditure is a defeasible liability does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation. The Privy Council made two specific observations about the test. First, that the test focuses on particular items of expenditure. Their Lordships noted that this is a different approach from that usually adopted for accounting purposes. To be deductible, each item must satisfy the test of being an “existing obligation”. There is no basis for taking an aggregate approach as is acceptable for accounting purposes. Secondly, that the test involves characterising the nature of the legal relationship between the taxpayer and the person to whom the obligation is owed. It was noted that “on one view” this requires, as a matter of construction, deciding whether the obligation is “contingent”, or, alternatively, “vested, but defeasible”. The Privy Council described this as being a “nice distinction” and noted that it is one which can easily become a matter of language rather than substance and lead to conflicting results. The Privy Council considered that these two specific features of the meaning of “incurred” demonstrate that the test is a jurisprudential rather than a commercial test. The Privy Council noted that this is an “unusual ap- proach to a taxing statute”, and one which can lead to tensions if formal legal doctrine is wholly divorced from commercial reality. In their Lordships’ view this was illustrated to some extent by the Australian decisions in this area. The Privy Council considered that the “incurred” test is primarily one of construction. It was therefore necessary to consider the words of the warranty. The warranty provided: 1.The vendor of the new vehicle described herein warrants to the original purchaser and subsequent owners that if in normal use and service during the relevant warranty period as provided below any defect appears in the material or workmanship of any part of the vehicle not otherwise warranted, and as soon as reasonably possible within 21 days of becoming aware of the defect, the purchaser returns the vehicle to the vendor’s premises and notifies the vendor of the defect, the vendor will at the vendor’s cost either (a) supply and fit, or (b) repair any such part acknowledged by the vendor to be defective. 2.This warranty shall not apply if the vehicle has been repaired or altered in any way other than by the vendor or in any service workshop not authorised by the vendor, or if the vehicle has been subjected to misuse neglect or accident, or if it has been loaded beyond manufacturer’s loading capacity or operated in such a way that is not recommended by the manufacturer. 3.The vendor shall not be liable for any loss or any conse- quential loss damage or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the defect. 4.This warranty is in lieu of all warranties terms conditions representations expressed or implied whether by common law or statute. 5.The new vehicle warranty period shall be 12 calendar months after delivery of the vehicle to the original purchaser or until the vehicle shall have run 20,000 km whichever first occurs. Privy Council decision continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 8 from page 7 However, their Lordships then went on to say that in their view the form of the warranty was not the final consideration. It was also necessary to look to two other principles, i.e.: •the fact that the jurisprudential approach to the meaning of “incurred” does not rule out statistical estimation of facts which have happened, but are not yet known to the taxpayer. (The Privy Council saw this as being distinct from treating an aggregate of contingent liabilities as a statistical certainty, which their Lordships acknowledged is not permitted under the jurisprudential approach.); and •whether, in the light of all the surrounding circum- stances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. The Privy Council looked to a body of case law dealing with the insurance industry. In particular, the Australian decision in RACV Insurance Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1974) 4 ATR 610. In that case, an insurance company was allowed to make a deduction from its premiums of an estimated sum to represent its IBNR liabilities. In law the liabilities were not contingent because they had occurred within the relevant year of account. This was the case even though the insurance company did not know about them. Applying the approach taken in the insurance cases to the facts in Mitsubishi, the Privy Council then concluded (at page 12,355): The relevance of this principle is that estimation on the basis of statistical experience can be used to conclude that 63% or thereabouts of the vehicles sold by MMNZ in fact had defects which would manifest themselves within the warranty period of twelve months or 20,000 km. The finding of Doogue J on the evidence was that “63% or thereabouts of all vehicles sold by \[MMNZ\] contain defects”. Since this information could only be derived from MMNZ’s experience of warranty claims, their Lordships understand the finding to mean that this was the level of defects notified to dealers in accordance with the terms of the warranty. Counsel for the Commissioner sought to refute this conclusion by arguing that the 63% of reported defects might include some defects which were not present at the time of sale, but manifested themselves within the warranty period. If this were correct, then using past warranty claims information to estimate the liability for defects which had happened at year-end would not be reliable, because the estimate would include both types of defect. The Privy Council rejected this argument. Counsel was unable to think of any examples of defects which were not present at the time of sale. The Privy Council doubted that a defect in the material or work- manship of the vehicle would appear within 12 months of sale, unless it were present, even if hidden, when the vehicle left the assembly plant. It was therefore legiti- mate to have regard to the evidence that established that 63% of the vehicles would in fact have had defects. Although, the Privy Council reconfirmed the Court of Appeal’s analysis of the warranty, i.e. that it requires manifestation and notification to trigger liability, the Privy Council considered that the Australian cases dealing with the meaning of incurred show that the resolution of this issue does not simply depend on whether “future events which may determine liability are expressed in the language of contingency or defeasance”. This may give rise to merely “theoretical distinctions”. Their Lordships restated this aspect of the test in the following terms (at page 12,355): ...whether, in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. The Privy Council considered whether there was a contingent, or merely a theoretical, liability in the case of warranty claims in relation to vehicles sold by the taxpayer, given that the warranty required notification. The Privy Council concluded that there would be a contingent liability if one looked at all the vehicles in question, but not if one only concentrated on the 63% of vehicles which were estimated to have defects. In the case of those vehicles, the Privy Council considered that the existence of such defects “was a matter of existing fact, not future contingency”; it being only a theoretical contingency that the owners would be content not to make a claim. The Privy Council considered (at page 12,356) that owners of defective vehicles would not make a claim only in the most trivial of cases and that this contingency: ...would not make any material difference to the accuracy of the estimated amount of expenditure to which the taxpayer could be said, as a matter of law, to be definitively committed. On the basis of this analysis the Privy Council held that the estimated warranty costs were deductible at the time of sale. Conclusions It is possible to draw the following conclusions from the Privy Council’s analysis and application of the meaning of “incurred”: •Where the expenditure arises under an agreement then it is fundamental to analyse the nature of the obliga- tion as set out in that agreement. However, this is only a first step. •Where the event which gives rise to the liability has already happened as at year-end, but is just not known to the taxpayer, then it is permissible to adopt a reasonable estimate to determine the extent of that liability. That reasonable estimate may be based on past expenditure for a number of liabilities of a similar kind. •In determining whether a liability is contingent or vested, but defeasible, theoretical contingencies are to be ignored. The question must be viewed in the light of all the surrounding circumstances and not just on the terms of the agreement which gave rise to the liability (which might appear to include a contingency, but which in practice is not in any practical sense likely to impede liability). In circumstances such as those in the case, the failure to notify once manifesta- tion had occurred was simply a theoretical contin- gency, unlikely to happen in practice. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 9 continued on page 10 The meaning of “incurred” following the decision The Mitsubishi decision provides a new statement of the existing law on the meaning of “incurred”. The existing law included cases in the insurance arena which permit- ted deductions for liabilities which had occurred, but were unknown and/or uncertain as to quantum at year- end. The Privy Council decision applies that line of cases to a new fact situation, i.e. warranty expenditure to remedy inherent defects. In evaluating how Mitsubishi restates the meaning of “incurred”, it is useful to “measure” the decision against the four propositions laid down in Bisley (referred to by the Privy Council and set out above): •a particular expenditure is incurred for tax purposes in any income year if it constitutes an existing obliga- tion which arose in the course of that year; The Mitsubishi decision suggests that whenever an event giving rise to a liability can be said to have occurred within the relevant period, and the number of such events and cost of meeting the aggregate liability can be reasonably estimated, then that cost is deductible. The requirement that there be a reasonable estimation can be on the basis of an aggregate, rather than a single, assessment of liability. The Privy Council reached this position notwithstanding that it acknowledged (at page 12,353) that to date the word “incurred” (now in section BD 2(1)(b)) had been interpreted as referring to particular items of expenditure “rather than the aggre- gate sums which would concern a businessman drawing up his accounts”. In their Lordships’ view the insurance cases give support to this “aggregated approach”. •where the expenditure arises under a written deed or agreement, determining whether or not it is an existing obligation is a question of construction of that deed or agreement; It is still vital to look to the terms of the arrangement which give rise to the liability so as to establish what is the event that gives rise to liability, and at what point in time an existing obligation to fulfil that liability arises. However, that is not the end of the matter. First, it is necessary to consider whether this is a situation where the liability has arisen, but is just not known, and can be reasonably estimated. And, secondly, whether there are any aspects, given all the surrounding circumstances, which make the liability to pay something less than an existing legal obligation. •the fact that the expenditure is not payable until some future date does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation; This proposition was not discussed directly in the case. This is because the case was not concerned with the deductibility of specific liabilities as at year-end. How- ever, implicitly the decision acknowledges that expendi- ture may be incurred even if the obligation to pay, i.e. a pecuniary liability, necessarily does not arise until some future date. •the fact that the expenditure is a defeasible liability does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation; The Privy Council criticised the language used to date to express this aspect of the test. On one interpretation, the decision has replaced the “contingent, versus vested, but defeasible” dichotomy with a new test as to “defeasibility”, i.e. whether, in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. In applying this test it is necessary to disregard merely theoretical contingencies. It is also possible in some cases to look beyond any legally binding arrangements which are pertinent to the creation of the liability, e.g. notice requirements. Warranties Mitsubishi provides authority for the claiming of reasonable estimates for future warranty costs where motor vehicles are sold under a warranty against inher- ent defects. The decision will apply to other motor vehicle industry manufacturers and assemblers that provide warranties of the same, or similar, type to that which featured in the case. The decision will generally also apply to other manufac- turing, distributing, wholesaling, and retailing taxpayers who provide warranties to remedy inherent defects in new goods sold, e.g. computer manufacturers and distributors. However, in every case it will be necessary to show that anticipated future warranty expenditure relates to defects present at the time of sale. If a warranty provides cover on a different basis, for example “to keep goods in good working order”, it may be that the liability under the warranty does not arise at the time of sale. The liability may relate to contingent events that occur after the time of sale, e.g. the manner in which the goods are used by the customer. In every case, in accordance with the Privy Council decision, it will also be necessary to satisfy Inland Revenue that a reasonable estimate of future costs supports the deduction sought. The decision will only apply to taxpayers who are able to provide sophisticated, reliable information, being those taxpayers who have maintained records for a statistically relevant period, in the light of the taxpayer’s particular circumstances. Given this standard, the amount deducted for tax purposes may vary from the reserve adopted for finan- cial accounting purposes. Free servicing Many taxpayers who offer warranties to customers for new goods sold also offer free servicing for a defined Application IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 10 from page 9 period, or at a set time or times, from the date of sale, e.g. a motor vehicle warranty may include one free service after 10,000 kilometres. A free service may be offered on a general basis or may involve a defined set of services, e.g. oil check, wheel alignment, etc. It is generally accepted that on the basis of Mitsubishi, taxpayers offering free servicing of this nature will be able to take a deduction for future free servicing costs in the year of sale. This is because the obligation to provide the free service arises at the time of sale. Considering all the surrounding circumstances, a legal obligation to make a payment in the future has arisen at the time of sale. In most cases it will not be reasonable to argue that the customer may not take up the offer, or not fulfil the terms of the offer, e.g. not drive the requisite distance. In most cases, particularly where the period in which the free service must be taken up is of a relatively short duration, it is only a theoretical contingency that custom- ers will not take advantage of the free service. Inland Revenue accepts that this is analogous to the Privy Council’s finding that it was only a theoretical contin- gency, limited to customers with trivial defects, that customers with defective vehicles would not seek remedial work under the warranty. However, a deduction at the time of sale will only be available if the taxpayer is able to substantiate the amount sought with reference to accurate servicing data, including the average cost of providing such a service (e.g. labour and costs). (In Mitsubishi the permitted deduction was based on a reasonable estimate calculated with reference to actual past claims.) The offer of a free service on fixed terms (i.e. to provide a pre-determined number of services or replacement parts) is to be distinguished from a service contract. A service contract is usually an agreement whereby the vendor agrees to provide services as required by the customer over a period of time, e.g. 12 months from the date of sale. A service contract will generally not relate only to a pre-determined number of services, but will cover all repairs necessary during the contract period. Accordingly, at the time of sale it is uncertain whether the vendor will incur expenses under the service con- tract. This will depend in part on the manner in which the goods are used by the customer, and events subse- quent to the entering into of the service contract. Sometimes the distinction between warranties, free servicing arrangements, and service contracts may be difficult to discern. A consideration of the terms of particular arrangements will always be necessary to determine whether a deduction for anticipated expendi- ture is available at the time of sale. In some cases it may be appropriate to apportion between anticipated ex- penses relating to inherent defects and free servicing arrangements, and other types of expenditure. Implied warranties Inland Revenue accepts that Mitsubishi also applies to taxpayers who provide products subject to statutorily implied guarantees as to fitness, in so far as those guarantees relate to remedies for inherent defects present at the time of sale, e.g. those imposed under the Sale of Goods Act 1908, the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993, and the Motor Vehicle Dealers Act 1975. Provided taxpayers are able to give reasonable estimates of the level of claims made for particular products under the applicable legislation, and the claims relate to defects which were in existence at the time of sale, it is accepted that the reasoning in the Mitsubishi decision will gener- ally apply. Inland Revenue anticipates that not all taxpayers who meet claims made under statutorily implied conditions will necessarily have sufficient historical and detailed statistical information to support the taking of a deduc- tion. However, it is acknowledged that, in time, taxpay- ers may introduce recording systems to permit them to rely on the decision in the future. Some taxpayers who provide a wide range of products, and/or an ever-changing selection of products, may never be able to rely on the decision. This is because it will be impossible to establish that a certain consistent level of warranty claims is made in relation to any particular product line. Inland Revenue considers that Mitsubishi only applies in cases where the estimated level of warranty costs can be attributed to particular items based on their individual sales records. In other cases it will generally not be possible to provide a reasonable estimate of future liability. In such cases it will not be sufficient to produce statistics based on total sales compared with claims made. Fair Trading Act 1986 In this context a further issue arises as to whether similar principles might apply to obligations imposed under the Fair Trading Act 1986. Broadly, the Fair Trading Act prohibits misleading and deceptive conduct by suppliers of goods and services to consumers. For example, it prohibits the making of false representations in relation to the supply of goods and services, and prohibits a range of specific practices, e.g. offering goods and services where there is no intention of supplying them, : pyramid selling schemes, importing goods bearing false trade descriptions or trade marks. The Act also provides for the prescribing of consumer information standards requiring disclosure of information relating to such matters as the kind, grade, quantity, origin, performance, care, use, etc., of goods and services. Generally speaking, contravening any of the provisions of the Act is an offence and gives rise to either civil liability alone (most notably in the case of misleading or deceptive conduct), or both civil and criminal liability. The Act extends rights to the public to take action against suppliers or manufacturers. A court is empow- ered to make a range of orders in such cases, including ordering compensation or the refunding of money. In this way, the focus of the Fair Trading Act is essen- tially on the prevention of wilful acts of deception. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 11 Although on one level it might be possible to say that a supplier or manufacturer from time to time supplies goods or services which are inherently in contravention of the Act, it would seem somewhat unusual for a supplier or manufacturer to be in a position where its past conduct was such that it could reliably estimate what its future liability would be from year to year. This seems contrary to the aim of the fair trading legislation which is to deter future offending by imposing penalties. It also ignores the fact that it would presumably be very difficult to estimate the level of claim, even if the frequency of offending could be reliably estimated. Therefore, intrinsically, obligations arising under the Fair Trading Act do not seem to be analogous to obliga- tions arising under warranties against inherent defects, whether contractual or implied. In the case of a warranty against inherent defects, the underlying rationale is that the manufacturer or supplier strives to sell a defect-free product, rather than deliberately or recklessly selling defective items subject to a warranty. In summary, subject in every case to being able to make a reasonable estimation of future liabilities, Inland Revenue accepts that taxpayers who provide products subject to statutorily implied guarantees as to fitness, in so far as those guarantees relate to remedies for inherent defects present at the time of sale, may rely on Mitsubishi. However, the reasoning in Mitsubishi will not apply to obligations imposed under the Fair Trading Act. Service providers A further issue in this context is whether the reasoning in Mitsubishi may extend to taxpayers who provide services, rather than products. This would permit service providers to take a deduction for estimated future claims for deficient services in the year the services are pro- vided, e.g. professional advisers such as lawyers and accountants might argue that a level of tortious or contractual liability under common law always exists in the giving of their advice. Inland Revenue acknowledges that there may be situa- tions where the reasoning in Mitsubishi applies to service providers. However, the arguments for applying the reasoning in those instances are considered to be significantly weaker as regards the provision of services. Mitsubishi dealt with sales of goods of like kind, i.e. vehicles, under warranty. The warranty established liability for inherent defects in the materials and work- manship. In many instances the provision of services will not involve the provision of services of such a similar and repetitive nature. Furthermore, whether services are deficient or “defective” in terms of meeting the requirements of the agreement they are provided under, or obligations implied under statute or at common law, may not be certain. It may not be able to be said that the services were deficient at the time they were provided. This may be a contingency which depends in part on circumstances arising after the services were provided. In addition, when compared with the facts in Mitsubishi, it is considered that it would be unusual if a service provider could estimate with a reasonable degree of certainty that “x”% of its services were inherently defective. It would seem more likely that a service provider will have an erratic history of claims made against it which would make it difficult to argue that any particular sum is a reasonable, annual estimate of potential future claims for particular “defective” serv- ices. It is also considered to be more likely that in the services arena taxpayers will be held liable not only for expenditure in the nature of “repairs” (i.e. putting right the direct “defect”), but also for any consequential loss. Given this, it is considered reasonable to assume that in most cases it would not be possible to quantify liability for consequential loss on any reliable, annual basis. In the case of some service providers, the distinction may be between a “provision”, suitable for financial account- ing purposes, and a quantifiable deduction for tax purposes. Although, it is acknowledged that in very limited situations it may be possible to make a reasonable estimation of future liability in relation to the repeated provision of certain, discrete services, in general the Commissioner considers that the reasoning in Mitsubishi will not apply to taxpayers who provide services. However, if taxpayers who provide services are in doubt in relation to their particular circumstances, they may approach their local Inland Revenue office for guidance. Wider implications Inland Revenue acknowledges that the reasoning in Mitsubishi is potentially wider than the giving of warranties. However, in seeking to rely on the decision it will always be necessary to determine the “event” which triggers liability. Only where that event can be said to have occurred during the relevant income year will a deduction be available (subject to providing a reasonable estimate). As seen in the Mitsubishi decision itself, it is not always an easy task to identify the event which creates liability. The Court of Appeal thought it was the manifestation of the defect; the Privy Council, in effect, disagreed and considered it to be the act of sale of a vehicle containing an inherent defect which would manifest itself within the warranty period. The difficulty with the “incurred” test has always been in anticipating how it will apply to new or unique fact situations. It is considered that the Privy Council decision raises further difficulties in terms of applying it to new fact situations because: •although the Privy Council recognised that the test for deductibility in section BD 2(1)(b) is concerned with particular items of expenditure, rather than deductions for aggregate sums (at page 12,353), their Lordships went on to reach their decision on the basis of an estimate of aggregate liability (at page 12,356). •the decision purports to apply the same principles as were applied in the “insurance cases” (RACV Insur- ance and Commercial Union Assurance Co of Aus- tralia Limited v FCT (1977) 7 ATR 435). However, in continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 12 from page 11 those cases a deduction was permitted in the current income year for liabilities which had occurred during that income year, but had not been reported to the taxpayer. Because of the nature of the insurance under consideration, it was probable that the taxpayer would be made aware of its liability to particular insured parties within a reasonable period following that income year. In Mitsubishi a deduction was permitted for a liability occurring in the current income year (the sale of an inherently defective vehicle subject to a one year warranty). Again, in practical terms, the taxpayer was likely to be aware of the actual number of claims arising out of those sales within a reasonable time following that income year due to the relatively short warranty period. Had the warranty period been for longer, e.g. ten years, this would not have been the case - although, arguably, applying Mitsubishi a deduction for a reasonable estimate of future liability during that period would still be available. It should be noted, however, that longer warranty periods may also raise questions as to whether future liability can be attributed to defects which were present at the time of sale. •the decision does not address the issue of how to determine the level of deduction where liability may be absolute, in terms of the contractual obligations of the taxpayer, but the likelihood of having to meet that expenditure is less than 100%. This issue did not arise in the case because the Privy Council chose to dis- count the possibility of some owners not claiming remedial work for defective vehicles sold during the relevant income year. Their Lordships considered that this possibility could be ignored because it was only likely to happen in the most trivial of cases and therefore would not affect the accuracy of the esti- mated amount of expenditure. By ignoring this potential reduction to the estimated liability, their Lordships were able to accept the estimate of liability for the current income year, based on past claims made. But, it is considered that such an approach leaves it unclear as to how to deal with the possibility that the actual level of liability may be less than the contractual liability. In cases where there is a more than trivial difference between the level of contractual liability and the estimated actual level of liability, it may be arguable that there is no existing obligation - the liability is still a contingent one. In addition, Inland Revenue considers that in applying the meaning of “incurred” in the future, taxpayers should bear in mind that Mitsubishi dealt with a particular set of facts - essentially trying to ascertain whether an aggre- gate of liabilities (the cost of meeting warranty obliga- tions for inherent defects present in vehicles sold during the relevant income year) had been incurred. The issue of whether certain expenditure has been incurred will not always arise in situations analogous to that in Mitsubishi. In particular, it is suggested that in cases of “one-off” expenditure, case law prior to Mitsubishi will still be of relevance. For example, in such cases it will still be relevant to ask whether the particular expenditure is no more than “impending, threatened or expected”: New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd. v FC of T (1938) 5 ATD 36, 49. Conclusions The Mitsubishi decision applies to express warranties of the type considered in the case. It also applies to warran- ties and guarantees of a similar nature implied under statute. Inland Revenue acknowledges that the decision has potentially widened the application of the meaning of “incurred”. This will mean that certain taxpayers are able to claim deductions in anticipation of expenditure where previously a deduction could be claimed only after an obligation to pay a particular sum had arisen. However, it will always be necessary to identify the event which gives rise to the liability, and to determine whether that event has occurred prior to year-end. Reasonable estimation To rely on the Mitsubishi decision taxpayers must be able to make a “reasonable estimation” of the quantum of the liability concerned. The Privy Council noted (at page 12,352) that the High Court was satisfied on the evidence that a reasonable estimate could be placed on the anticipated liabilities. However, there is no legal discussion by the Privy Council as to what constitutes a reasonable estimation, nor what methods may be adopted in reaching such an estimation. Nor, was there any discussion of this issue in the High Court or Court of Appeal judgments. The issue of what constitutes a reasonable estimate of expenditure or loss under section BD 2(1)(b) has had very little consideration by the New Zealand courts. However, the Australian courts have considered the question relatively recently. In ANZ Banking Group Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 27 ATR 559, 571-573, the Full Federal Court of Aus- tralia, drawing in part on earlier decisions, had the following to say about what is a reasonable estimate in the context of a provision for insurance claims: •An “estimate” does not involve arbitrarily seizing upon any figure. •An estimate involves forming a judgment or opinion based on reason. •The opinion or judgment must be bona fide, but need not be exact as estimation involves a process of approximation. •There is no rule as to the proper way of making an estimate. It is a question of fact and figures whether the way of making the estimate in any case is the best way for that situation (Sun Insurance Office v Clark \[1912\] AC 443, 454). •The concept of a “reasonable estimate” appears to mean “susceptible of more or less accurate estimation” IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 13 or “capable of approximate calculation based on probabilities”. The fact that an estimate is wrong, does not necessarily mean it is unreasonable. In the ANZ Banking case, the estimate of workers’ compensation liabilities for a self-insurer in respect of injuries which had occurred prior to balance date was accepted as a reasonable estimation, even though there was a relatively short history to utilise in calculating the estimate. In particular, Hill J agreed that the estimation was bona fide and that the method of estimation (case by case analysis carried out by an appropriate expert) was acceptable and was an exercise capable of approximate calculation on the basis of probabilities. The ANZ Banking case supports a rigorous approach to the application of Mitsubishi to estimations provided by taxpayers. Although it is difficult to set general guide- lines for what is required by individual taxpayers in terms of providing reasonable estimates, in broad terms, at a minimum, Inland Revenue will require taxpayers to substantiate their estimations by reference to documenta- tion evidencing past liabilities, e.g. sales records, claims data, etc., and be able to justify any adjustments made from that information for future years. It will be neces- sary for taxpayers to justify their methods of calculation in the light of their particular circumstances and to continually reassess the method of estimation adopted in the light of changing circumstances. It will also be necessary to have sufficient data, in terms of providing a credible “history of past expenditure”, in order to give a reliable estimation. It would generally not be appropriate for taxpayers to simply adopt a set percentage of sale or cost price from year to year without reference back to actual levels of warranty expenditure, for the same or similar products, for past years. Nor, would it generally be acceptable for taxpayers to base deductions on some kind of “industry standard”, unless it could be shown that those standards apply to the taxpayer’s specific circumstances. Taxpayers will need to show that their deductions for each year reflect a reasonable estimate of future warranty expenditure calculated for that particular income year. Use of an inflexible percentage calculation may suggest that the taxpayer is simply making a provision. This may be appropriate for financial accounting purposes, but will generally not be a reasonable estimate for tax purposes. If taxpayers are unsure as to what is required in their particular situation, then they may approach their local Inland Revenue office for further guidance. In other cases, it may not be possible for a taxpayer to make a reasonable estimate due to: •no past history of claims (e.g. in the first year of operation); •inadequate record keeping; and/or •changes in product line or other relevant circum- stances which make it difficult to use past years’ information to reliably ascertain future liability. In cases where taxpayers are unable to make a reason- able estimation (and thereby take a deduction for estimated expenditure), a deduction will generally be available for that expenditure in the year that the liability becomes capable of reasonable estimation. Establishing that a liability is capable of reasonable estimation is considered to be part of the test of whether that liability has been “incurred”. Accordingly, a deduction may be made in the earliest year that a reasonable estimation of the future expenditure can be determined. In some cases no deduction will be available until the year in which actual payment or liability for payment for an individual and identified amount occurs. This is because no reasonable estimation can be made before that time. In addition, a reasonable estimation for future expendi- ture may need to take into account anticipated rises and falls in the cost of meeting that expenditure at the time that it is reasonable to anticipate that the expenditure will be paid. However, any increase (or decrease) on current costs will also need to be substantiated on the basis of a reasonable estimation. In this regard, it is also noted that the Act does not require any “discounting” of expendi- ture which has been “incurred” in a particular income year to take into account the fact that it will not be paid until some time in the future. The Act applies to nomi- nal, rather than present value, sums (e.g. Burrill v FCT 96 ATC 4,629). Standard of estimation It is acknowledged that the previous analysis imposes a high standard. A contrary view is that there is authority to support a “reasonable attempt” or “conservative estimate” as being sufficient and that smaller taxpayers should not be disadvantaged (in comparison with larger corporate taxpayers) solely because they do not maintain sophisticated systems, or have detailed information. For example, it might be argued that the essence of Lord Loreburn’s judgment in the Sun Insurance Office decision is that where an estimate is required, then the method that “comes nearer to the truth” than any other method should be accepted (rather than no estimate at all being taken). On such a basis, it should be possible for smaller taxpayers to make a provision based on a conservative (from a tax perspective) estimate and, as a result would resolve issues concerning the level of information required and the consequences of changes in product lines. What standard of evidence is required? It is considered that the common thread throughout the case law in this area is that an estimate must be reasonable and reliable, and what is reasonable and reliable in any particular case will necessarily depend on the facts of that case. For example, in Sun Insurance itself the taxpayer, a fire insurer, carried to reserve each year a sum equal to 40% of the year’s premium income. It was estimated that this was the amount necessary to meet unexpired risks. The House of Lords held that this was a reasonable and proper allowance, given that in assessing a fire insurance company it was necessary to proceed by estimate. Lord continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 14 Loreburn accepted the taxpayer’s method as being the only way in which the true gains of the company could be ascertained, but noted that this result was not of universal application (at page 77): ...there is no rule of law as to the proper way of making an estimate. There is no way of estimating, which is right or wrong in itself. It is a question of fact and figure whether the way of making the estimate in any case is the best way for that case. Similar sentiments were expressed in ANZ Banking, where Hill J noted (at page 571) that: The concept of “estimate” does not involve arbitrarily seizing upon any figure. What is involved is the formation of a judgment or opinion based upon reason. That judgment or opinion must necessarily be made bona fide but it need not be exact for the process of estimation involves a process of approximation. Applying those principles to the facts of that case, Hill J concluded (at page 573): In my view the present is not a case where it can be said that there can be no process of estimation or that no process of estimation was in fact made because the figure adopted was not reasonably arrived at. Rather, the establishment of provisions in the present case was an exercise capable of approximate calculation based on probabilities. On this basis, Inland Revenue does not accept that any “guess” will do, or that a small, conservative (in tax terms) deduction, taken on the basis that the future liability is bound to exceed that amount, is permissible. The cases tend to indicate that there must be some method advanced to support the deduction taken, and that method must be based on past experience – the deduction sought thereby being “capable” of estimation. Estimation as part of the “incurred” test It has been suggested that the question of whether an expense has been incurred, and the quantification of that expense, are completely separate issues, i.e. the require- ment to make a reasonable estimate is not part of the “incurred” test. The fact that expenditure is incurred means that the taxpayer may (and in fact is required to) make the best possible estimate based on the information available, even if there is a paucity of such information. However, this approach is not consistent with the reasoning of the Privy Council in Mitsubishi. At page 12,355 of the decision, having agreed with the Court of Appeal’s analysis of the warranty provision, i.e. as being one that gave rise to a liability contingent on a defect appearing and being notified within the war- ranty period, Lord Hoffman went on to state that this was not the end of the matter because of two further principles that must be taken into account; the first being: ...that although the jurisprudential approach prevents one from treating an aggregate of contingent liabilities as a statistical certainty, it does not rule out statistical estimation of facts which have happened but are unknown... The relevance of this principle is that estimation on the basis of statistical experience can be used to conclude that 63% or thereabouts of the vehicles sold by MMNZ in fact had defects which would manifest themselves within the warranty period of twelve months or 20,000 kms. ... This, however, is not in itself enough to show that a liability was incurred. ...(Emphasis added) The Privy Council felt able to circumvent the problem of an aggregate of contingent liabilities because of the taxpayer’s ability to make an estimation of that collec- tive liability. Although, the judgment does not address how reliable that evidence needs to be, their Lordships’ reasoning makes it clear that the requirement that there be a reasonable estimate is intrinsic to the application of the “incurred” test in similar fact situations. It is not a separate consideration, but rather a fundamental aspect of the test, i.e. without the ability to make a reasonable estimate the liability has not been incurred. This approach is not new. For example, the decision in Texas Co (Australia) Ltd v FCT (1940) 63 CLR 382 has always stood for the principle that a taxpayer may completely subject itself to a liability notwithstanding that the quantum of that liability cannot be precisely ascertained, provided that it is capable of reasonable estimation. A similar approach was taken in the ANZ Banking Group decision discussed above and confirmed by Hill J in Ogilvy & Mather Pty Ltd v FC of T (1990) ATR 841, 874. The question is how much can actually be said to have been incurred, not how low should the amount taken as a deduction be to ensure that it will not ultimately be exceeded. Section BD 4 refers to the allocation of allowable deductions to the income year in which the deduction has been incurred – this is the only legal basis on which a deduction may be taken in a particular income year. It follows that determining how much should be deducted in any year must form part of the “incurred” test. In addition, the suggestion that estimation does not form part of that test does not address the situation where the taxpayer is unable to make any kind of estimate (e.g. in some cases in the first year of operation). If the require- ment to be able to reasonably estimate is interpreted as not being part of the “incurred” test, then no deduction is available at all in that year, or subsequently, due to the ability to deduct being linked to the year of incurrence. It is considered that this result also suggests that the ability to estimate reasonably is part of, rather than an adjunct to, the “incurred” test. Conclusions In order to rely on Mitsubishi it is paramount that taxpayers are able to make a reasonable estimation of the relevant future expenditure. To the extent that it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation, the expendi- ture will be treated as having not been incurred in that income year. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 15 The standard of calculation demonstrated by the tax- payer in Mitsubishi, and past case law on what is a reasonable estimation, indicate that a rigorous standard, as regards the provision of detailed information and calculation methods to support claims for deductions based on estimations, is required. To that end, Inland Revenue will require taxpayers to substantiate claims made on the basis of estimated future expenditure in the light of their particular circumstances. If taxpayers are unsure as to what is required in their particular situation, then they may approach Inland Revenue for further guidance. Accounting for estimated liabilities Mitsubishi permits taxpayers to make deductions in the year of sale for estimated warranty costs. In most instances such estimates will prove to be incorrect in following years, when compared with actual expendi- ture. The original deduction will prove to be either an over- or under-statement of the actual expenditure incurred. In the case of most warranties it will be several years after the expiration of the warranty before the total warranty costs for any particular year are known. The fact that an estimate will almost inevitably not reflect the “true” future liability has not been seen by the courts as being fatal to the taxpayer’s ability to make a deduction based on an estimate - as seen the estimate does not have to be “right”, just reasonable: RACV Insurance at pages 618 and 627. However, this raises the issue of how to deal with the potential mismatch be- tween estimated expenditure and actual expenditure. It also raises the issue of how to deal with revised esti- mates. IBNR approach As seen above, the Privy Council decision refers to the taxation treatment of the general insurance industry; in particular, the judicial acceptance that reasonably estimated provisions for “incurred but not reported” (IBNR) claims are deductible. Inland Revenue currently permits general insurance companies to take a deduction for IBNR reserves. A deduction is permitted for esti- mated IBNR claims as at the end of the relevant income year. However, the taxpayer must add back as income the value of claims settled during the income year for IBNR claims for previous income years. There is no statutory authority for this treatment. However, there is judicial support for this approach indirectly in RACV Insurance and more explicitly in the Commercial Union decision. The treatment was summarised by Newton J in Commer- cial Union (at page 445): In a case where a provision for claims outstanding at the end of a year is an allowable deduction in calculating the taxable income of an insurer for that year, then when those claims come to be paid in the future, they must for income tax purposes be debited against the amount of that provision, so far as it is sufficient for the purpose. The claims cannot be treated as allowable deductions from the assessable premiums earned by the insurer in the year in which the claims are paid for the purpose of calculating the insurer’s taxable income of that later year, except insofar as the provision proves insufficient to meet them. Otherwise claims would be treated as allowable deductions twice over. (Emphasis added) Newton J went on to describe how this treatment is achieved in the taxpayer’s accounts: A convenient method of achieving the result just referred to, is to treat the amount of the provision for outstanding claims at the end of one year as part of the insurer’s assessable income of the following year together with the earned premiums of that year, and then to calculate the insurer’s taxable income for that second year by deducting all the claims in fact paid during that year, plus a provision for outstanding claims at the end of that year, plus, of course, administration and like expenses attributable to that year. Many of the claims paid during the second year will of course have been claims which were outstanding at the end of the first year, and they will thus in fact be debited against that provision for outstanding claims at the end of the first year, because that provision is treated as part of the assessable income of the second year. This method is perhaps technically incorrect, because the provision for outstanding claims at the end of the first year was part of the assessable income of that year, and cannot therefore also be part of the assessable income of the second year, except insofar as the provision may prove to have been excessive ... however this may be, the method nevertheless produces the correct result...(Emphasis added) Newton J noted (at page 445) that a shorthand method to achieve the same result is to compare the provision for claims outstanding at the end of one year with the provision for claims outstanding at the end of the following year, treating any increase as an allowable deduction for that second year and any decrease as part of the assessable income of that year. Further support for this approach is found in the Privy Council decision Southern Pacific Insurance Co (Fiji) Ltd v IRC (Fiji) \[1986\] STC 178. That case concerned the deductibility of IBNR reserves by a underwriter of general insurance, including third party motor insurance. The Privy Council confirmed that the amount of the liability of the taxpayer company for accidents which had occurred, but were not reported, in a particular year is part of the expense of the company in carrying on its insurance business during that year, and must be de- ducted in arriving at the total income of the company for that year. Of relevance to the question of adjustments, the Privy Council noted: ...the Court of Appeal suspected that provision for an IBNR claim in one year would be duplicated by providing for an outstanding claim once the IBNR claim was reported. This suspicion is ill-founded. A claim, when reported, disappears from the next valuation of IBNR and becomes part of the next valuation of outstanding claims unless it has been settled in the meantime. IBNR and outstanding claims are adjusted each year by reference to the provision made at the beginning of the year. There is thus no double provision. continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 16 from page 15 This treatment has also been endorsed by the Australian Taxation Office in IT 2663 Income Tax: Basis of Assessment of General Insurance Activities (20 Decem- ber 1991) at paragraphs 136 to 139. The ruling provides for a general insurer to compare the amount of its outstanding claims provision at the end of an income year, with the amount of the provision at the previous year-end. Any increase in the provision is allowed as a deduction; any reduction in the provision is included as assessable income. The ruling refers to the RACV Insurance and Commercial Union cases in support of that approach. Thus, adjustments for over- and under-estimations in the insurance industry are made on a “rolling” basis (in a similar fashion to the treatment of trading stock and the operation of section EF 1). This has the practical advan- tage of not requiring previous years’ assessments to be reopened. In the case of warranty costs this would inevitably involve reopening past years at the end of each income year as it became apparent that the actual costs incurred were different from those estimated and/or that past estimations in themselves should be adjusted up or down. It is acknowledged that this may lead to an unworkable position from a compliance perspective. Adoption of an IBNR approach Inland Revenue considers that the approach taken in the insurance industry in relation to IBNR reporting pro- vides a workable treatment for dealing with adjustments in the context of estimated warranty costs. This approach has been upheld by the courts in the context of general insurance taxpayers and applied for many years. Al- though there may be difficulties with explicitly justify- ing an IBNR approach within the statutory framework for the recognition of income and deductions (dicta from the Commercial Union case highlight the fact that this treatment is not strictly in compliance with ordinary income concepts), it is considered that in the absence of express legislation dealing with estimated but incurred expenditure, such an approach produces the best and most workable solution to the question of adjustments. It is therefore proposed to apply an IBNR approach to estimated warranty costs for which deductions are available in accordance with Mitsubishi. First year of deduction The adoption of an IBNR approach to estimated future expenditure raises the question of how the first year of estimated deductions should be handled. This is essen- tially an issue concerning changes in accounting treat- ment, similar to those raised in cases such as Henderson v FCT (1970) 119 CLR 612 and Country Magazine Pty Limited v FCT (1968) 15 ATD 86; (1968) 42 ALJR 42. The issue in this context is whether it is possible to take a deduction in the first year for all estimated future expenditure outstanding at year-end, whether it relates to events giving rise to liability occurring in that income year, or past income years. The alternative would be to restrict the deduction to only estimated future expendi- ture arising out of events that occurred in that income year, on the basis that it is only that expenditure which has been incurred in that year. This would be achieved by requiring taxpayers to make a notional opening balance adjustment in the first year – effectively adding back estimated claims as at the beginning of that year. It is considered that from a purely technical perspective there is a strong case for requiring an opening balance adjustment to be made. This particularly flows from a close analysis of the Commercial Union decision. In that case it was held that the taxpayer, an insurance com- pany, could take a deduction for provisions made for IBNR claims, even though it was a condition precedent of the relevant insurance policies that insured persons make their claims within a certain period. The Court held that there was in effect strict liability and, therefore, the taxpayer became definitively committed to the liability upon the happening of the insured event. The case also concerned the issue of how IBNR provi- sions should be accounted for. Prior to the year ended 30 June 1973 the taxpayer had only taken deductions for outstanding and reported claims, although it was ac- knowledged that those estimates had been uplifted by 5% to 10% each year to take into account IBNR claims. During the 1973 income year it became apparent that this method of providing for IBNRs was unsatisfactory, and from that year on it was decided to estimate the IBNR claims separately. As regards the way in which the IBNR claims had been accounted for, the Commissioner argued that: •even if the IBNRs were deductible in principle, the company had not adopted a consistent basis of esti- mating IBNRs at the end of the income year and the preceding income year; and •because the taxpayer’s IBNR estimates included amounts in respect of unreported insured events that had occurred in prior years, those amounts should be excluded from the allowable deductions for the year in question since they would have been incurred in previous years. Newton J rejected both arguments. As discussed above, as regards the first argument his Honour confirmed that the IBNR approach, although perhaps technically incorrect, was acceptable given that it gave the right result. He then went on to directly consider the issue of whether or not a notional amount should be added back in the “first” (1973) year (at page 446): It was contended in substance on behalf of the Commissioner that if in fact the provision of $5,864,866 in respect of claims incurred but not reported as at 30 June 1973, was an allowable deduction in calculating the taxable income of the Commercial Union Pool for the year ended 30 June 1973, as part of the total deduction of $60,020,125 for all outstanding claims as at 30 June 1973, then for the purpose of calculating the taxable income of the Pool for the year ended 30 June 1973, an appropriate amount in respect of claims incurred but not IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 17 reported as at 30 June 1972, should be added to the sum of $39,559,704 which, as earlier stated, had been included in the assessable income of the Pool for the year ended 30 June 1973, as representing the provision for outstanding claims as at 30 June 1972. If this were done, then of course the allowance of the sum of $5,864,866 as a deduction would be offset by a substantial amount... (Emphasis added) Newton J rejected this contention. His Honour noted that if it were correct then in his view no deduction would ever be allowed in respect of IBNR claims as at 30 June 1972 in calculating the taxable income of the taxpayer for any year, not even when the claims were paid. The reasons for this conclusion are interesting – Newton J considered that there was no material differ- ence between the character of the provision for all claims as at 30 June 1973 and as at 30 June 1972. This was despite the fact that the later year included a sepa- rate IBNR amount. His Honour considered that both sums were a “total provision” for outstanding claims as at the end of the income year. In addition, the 1972 provision included an amount for IBNR claims, although not separately calculated. On this basis, Newton J concluded that there was no change in accounting methods – “there was merely a refinement in the method of calculation or estimation of the component of the provision for outstanding claims at the end of the year, which was intended to represent claims incurred but not reported”. He then expressly noted (at page 447) that on this basis it was unnecessary for him to consider what would be the position if there had been a material difference in the character of the provisions so that there was a relevant change in accounting methods. Newton J also rejected the Commissioner’s second argument, i.e. the contention that on no view could a provision for IBNR claims, where the event insured against had occurred before 1 July 1972, be an allowable deduction in calculating the taxpayer’s income for the year ended 30 June 1973. His Honour considered that in so far as the IBNR figure as at 30 June 1973 represented any claims arising out of events occurring in previous years, this simply represented a re-estimate of the taxpayer’s liability in respect of those claims. He considered that the words “assessable income” in section 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 meant assessable income of the taxpayer generally without regard to division into annual accounting periods and therefore, just as it is possible to take an IBNR deduction for claims arising out of events in the relevant year, it is possible to take a deduction for an increase in an esti- mate at the end of that year for any claims arising out of previous years which are then still outstanding. In this way, Newton J treated the 1973 IBNR amount as being simply a re-estimate of the earlier IBNR deduc- tions which formed an unspecified part of the outstand- ing reported claims for those previous years. Therefore, although on the facts of the case Newton J decided that there was no need to add back a notional opening amount, this essentially turned on the fact that in prior years there had been some kind of deduction made for IBNR claims – meaning that there was no movement to a new accounting method, and the first year in which a separate IBNR deduction was taken simply represented a re-estimate of IBNR claims relating to previous years. In response to the Commercial Union decision the ATO released ruling IT 110 General Insurance Companies: Claims Incurred But Not Reported (28 October 1977). The ruling set out the “advice” that was sent to branch offices in the light of the decision. The ruling adopts the view that the conclusion that the company’s method of calculation of outstanding claims in the first year that IBNRs were separately claimed was merely a refinement of earlier methods was a reasonable one in the circum- stances. However, the conclusion reached on the second issue discussed above, i.e. whether it is possible to take an IBNR deduction in one year in respect of unreported insured events that had occurred in prior years, is considered by the ATO to be “more doubtful”. IT 110 notes: However, that issue is of relatively minor importance once the basic principle of the deductibility of IBNRs is accepted and the Judge’s approach to it is a logical and reasonable one, at least from a practical viewpoint. The ruling goes on to conclude that where IBNRs are claimed as a separate item for the first time in a year of income, because it is probable that an over-estimate of outstanding reported claims has occurred (as was the situation in the case) or because the IBNRs are really no different in character to those claims (Newton J’s second argument), then: It will not be necessary in these cases, therefore, where a company has claimed IBNRs as a separate item for the first time in a particular year of income, to reduce the deduction claimed by some amount which ought to have been claimed as IBNRs in the immediately proceeding year (except in the extremely unlikely event that an insurance company has operated for a number of years without ever claiming deduc- tions for outstanding claims of any kind). Therefore, although Newton J decided on the facts before him that it was not necessary for the taxpayer to add back any notional amount to relate to IBNRs for previous income years, this seems to be based on factors that would not be present in the case of taxpayers seeking to rely on the Mitsubishi decision. It is more likely that such a taxpayer would be moving to a new accounting treatment whereby it would be taking a deduction for estimated expenditure, as opposed to actual expenditure, for the first time. On a strict applica- tion it follows that this change in accounting treatment should result in only deductions for future estimated expenditure relating to that income year being taken. This is achieved by requiring an “add-back” of the notional amount of estimated future expenditure at the beginning of the first year so that only the increase between the amount attributable to estimated future costs at the end of the income year and the amount of such claims at the beginning of the year, is deductible. continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 18 from page 17 Section EC 1 Section EC 1(1) applies if in relation to any income year (the year of adjustment) the Commissioner is satisfied that the allowable deductions of a person, in respect of a business for any preceding income year or years, have been understated by reason of those deductions having been calculated without taking into account provisions or reserves which are allowed as deductions. Under section EC 1(3), the Commissioner may deem the amount of such provisions or reserves as allowable deductions incurred by the taxpayer in the year of adjustment. Section EC 1 was first enacted as section 92A of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. It was a response to the decision in Henderson where it was held that if a taxpayer moved from a cash basis to an earnings basis of accounting for income, it was correct not to account for income earned in the cash basis years, even though it was paid to the taxpayer in subsequent years. Section EC 1 was, therefore, primarily designed to enable the Commissioner to include within assessable income any income that might otherwise escape taxation as a result of a change in a taxpayer’s method of tax accounting. However, the wording is clearly wider because, in addition, it gives the Commissioner a discretion to make an adjustment in a taxpayer’s favour where he considers that there has been an understatement of income through failure to take into account allowable deductions which have been treated as provisions or reserves. What constitutes a provision or reserve was considered by the Court of Appeal in CIR v The Farmers’ Trading Company Limited (1989) 11 NZTC 6,007. In that case the Commissioner had attempted to apply the precursor to section EC 1 in order to bring to account proceeds from certain credit sales made in earlier years which the taxpayer had not brought to account due to having adopted a “profits emerging” accounting basis. The Court held (applying the decision in CIR v National Bank of New Zealand Limited (1976) 2 NZTC 61,150) that the equivalent to section EC 1(1)(b) had no applica- tion to a situation where the taxpayer had omitted income altogether, rather than brought income in from which an unauthorised deduction for a provision or reserve had been made. Richardson J (as he then was), who delivered the judgment of the Court, considered (at page 6,010) that as no guidance is given in the Act as to the meaning of the phrase “provisions or reserves” it was appropriate to look to generally accepted accounting principles and ordinary commercial practice in determin- ing its meaning. In that regard, he referred to the defini- tions of the terms given in paragraph 2(1) of the Eighth Schedule to the Companies Act 1955 which provides: For the purposes of this Schedule, unless the context otherwise requires, - (a)The expression “provision” shall, subject to subclause (2) of this paragraph, mean any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewals, or diminution in value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy: (b)The expression “reserve” shall not, subject as aforesaid, include any amount written off or retained by way of providing for depreciation, renewals, or diminution in value of assets or retained by way of providing for any known liability: He also commented (at page 6,011) that in general terms a provision reflects a charge against profits, whereas a reserve reflects an allocation, or setting aside, of profits for future use or advantage. It is considered that this definition of “provisions or reserves” is broad enough to encompass a situation where a taxpayer has brought to account income from the sale of warranted goods, and for financial reporting purposes, but not for tax purposes, has created a provi- sion for the cost of meeting estimated future warranty claims. This would appear to be an amount retained (or charged against profits) by way of “providing for a known liability of which the amount cannot be deter- mined with substantial accuracy”. Notwithstanding that a strong case can be made for the need to make an opening balance adjustment in the first year that a taxpayer changes to an estimated basis from an actual basis for accounting for warranty expenditure, it is acknowledged that this may lead to an unworkable position. Given this, and the scope of section EC 1, the Commissioner is prepared to exercise his discretion under that provision to permit a deduction for all estimated future warranty claims in the first year, without requiring any corresponding adding back of the estimated claims as at the beginning of that year. Re-estimation Another feature of the treatment of insurance claims is the recognition by the courts that in some cases it may be necessary to re-estimate previous years’ estimates for claims, i.e. to make a further adjustment for anticipated claims relating to a previous period which at the end of the current accounting period are still outstanding. The need to re-estimate reflects the fact that at all times the deduction taken should reflect a “reasonable estimate” of the quantum of the underlying liability. In the context of estimated warranty costs, a need for re- estimation might occur where the cost of replacement parts suddenly escalates, or it is shown that an unex- pected repetitive defect in a particular warranted product has arisen. It is acknowledged that in such instances it may well be prudent from an accounting/commercial perspective to re-estimate the anticipated cost of meeting outstanding warranties. The insurance cases indicate that re-estimations of this type should be taken as a deduction in the year in which the re-estimation is made and not in the year the original deduction was made: RACV Insurance at pages 610 and 618; Commercial Union at pages 435 and 448, and the NZSA Financial Reporting Standard No. 7 (1994): Standard 5, at paragraphs 5.21 and 5.22. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 19 Conversely, there is also authority for the need to return income in the event that revised estimates which reduce the estimated liability are made in subsequent years. Again, income is returned in the year in which the revised estimate is made, and not in the original year of deduction: Commonwealth Aluminium Corp Ltd v FCT (1977) 7 ATR 376, 386 and International Nickel Aus- tralia Limited v FCT (1977) 7 ATR 739; 743, 751 and 755. It should also be noted that re-estimating in some circumstances, given the level of the re-estimation and/or the nature of the events surrounding the re- estimation, may indicate that the original estimates were not in themselves reasonable, and, in turn, raise issues as regards the methods of estimation being adopted by the taxpayer. As indicated previously, it is considered that taxpayers must at all times satisfy a rigorous standard as regards their methods of calculating estimated liabilities. If Inland Revenue finds that taxpayers have not adopted, or have not continued to adopt, such a standard, it may not be possible to rely on the reasoning in Mitsubishi in relation to the timing of expenditure deductions. Conclusions Inland Revenue accepts that the approach taken in the insurance industry in relation to IBNR reporting pro- vides a workable treatment for accounting for estimated future expenditure for which deductions are available in accordance with Mitsubishi. It has been used and accepted for a long time in the context of general insurance taxpayers and IBNR reserves, and in that context has received judicial support. In changing to such a method it is acceptable to take a deduction in the first year of adjustment of all estimated future expenditure for which a deduction is available on the basis of the reasoning in Mitsubishi. The Commis- sioner is prepared to exercise his discretion under sections EC 1(1) and EC 1(3) to permit a deduction for all estimated future warranty claims in the first year, without requiring any corresponding adding back of the estimated claims as at the beginning of that year. In some cases it may be necessary to re-estimate esti- mated claims relating to previous income years. This may involve, in the light of new information, increasing the quantum of those claims, and thereby taking a further deduction or, conversely, returning additional income in the event that revised estimates reduce the quantum of the estimated liability made in previous years. In both cases, the adjustment should be made in the year in which the revised estimate is made, and not in the original year of deduction. The need to re-estimate simply reflects the fact that at all times the deduction taken should reflect a “reasonable estimate” of the quantum of the underlying liability. In cases where taxpayers have not adopted, or have not continued to adopt, such a standard of estimation, it may not be possible to rely on the reasoning in Mitsubishi in relation to the timing of expenditure deductions. Section EF 1 Section EF 1 is a “qualification” to the general position under the Act that expenditure relating to the derivation of gross income is deductible when incurred. Although a deduction is allowed for the expenditure incurred, under section EF 1 gross income is deemed to include the amount of the unexpired portion of any “accrual ex- penditure” that relates to future income years. In this way, section EF 1 modifies the section BD 2(1)(b) “incurred” test where expenditure is incurred in one year, but the benefit extends beyond that year. Its effect is to progressively write down the expenditure over later years. Under section EF 1(1), although accrual expenditure that has been incurred is deductible when it is incurred in accordance with the Act, the unexpired portion (if any) of that expenditure must be added back as gross income. Section EF 1(5) determines the amount of the unexpired portion of any accrual expenditure. The amount depends on the character of the expenditure, i.e. whether it relates to goods, services, monetary remuneration (which is not relevant here), or a chose in action. Section EF 1(3) permits the Commissioner to make determinations for exemption from section EF 1. The current determination is Determination E10 which applies for the 1994/95 income year and all subsequent income years until it is cancelled. Section EF 1 was not argued before the courts in Mitsubishi. However, it has been suggested that section EF 1 may apply to the facts of the case. That is to say, although the Privy Council established that the estimated warranty costs were deductible under the equivalent of section BD 2(1)(b), that deduction, or a part of it, may still have to be added back under section EF 1. This would have the practical effect of largely reversing the timing advantage that Mitsubishi affords taxpayers who are able to rely on the decision. What follows is an analysis of the words of the section (and the issues raised in that regard), the legislative background to section EF 1 and a discussion of the Thornton Estates Court of Appeal decision. Preliminary issue – is section EF 1 limited to pre-paid expenditure? It is understood that section EF 1 is commonly seen as only applying to “pre-paid expenditure”, i.e. taxpayers are required to add back the cost of goods, services or chooses in action actually paid for in advance of those items being applied to the production of assessable income. In this regard it has been suggested that sections EF 1(5)(b) and 1(5)(d) were never intended to apply to future payments, i.e. they were only aimed at pre- payment situations. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the legislative intent at the time of enactment, notwithstanding the subsequent introduction of section EF 1(5)(c) which clearly applies more widely. It has been observed that in the warranty context this continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 20 from page 19 approach has the attraction of eliminating the problems of applying those subsections – the taxpayer will not have made a payment for any goods or services, or for, or in relation to, any chose in action. Although it is acknowledged that such an interpretation may resolve some of the uncertainty arising from the potential application of section EF 1 to warranty ex- penditure, it is considered that this approach is doubtful both in terms of the wording of the provision and the background to its introduction. Section EF 1 applies to all accrual expenditure. “Accrual expenditure” is defined as being “any amount of ex- penditure incurred on or after 1 August 1986 by the person that is allowed a deduction under this Act ... other than expenditure incurred...”. Under section EF 1(1), if any person has incurred any accrual expenditure, that person is allowed to take a deduction when it is incurred, but the unexpired portion of that expenditure at the end of an income year must be included as gross income. There is nothing in those words to suggest that the provision only applies to expenditure that has been incurred and paid for. Although section EF 1(5)(b) refers to “payment”, i.e. “the expenditure relates to payment for services; as does section EF 1(5)(d), i.e. “the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action”, there is nothing in the wording of the section to suggest that the word “payment” should be read down as only applying to situations where a payment has already been made. It is consistent with the terms of the provision to interpret it as referring to both past and future payments. In addition, the introduction of section EF 1(5)(c) now makes it very difficult to argue on a plain reading of the section that the meaning of incurred and payment should be read down. To do so would mean that section EF 1(5)(c) applies in a wholly different way than the other subsections. The converse view is that there is at least some ambigu- ity as regards the scope of sections EF 1(5)(b) and 1(5)(d) because they refer to “payment”, and this may be interpreted as requiring that actual payment has taken place. It may be suggested that this is more consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term. For example, The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993) provides: payment 1 An act, or the action or process, of paying. (Foll. by of the money etc. paid, the debt discharged, the payee; for the thing bought or recompensed.) 2 (A sum of) money etc. paid In addition, some support for this interpretation comes from section EF 1(5A) which also uses the word “pay- ment”. For the purposes of section EF 1, that provision deems any payment to which section CB 12(1) applies to be expenditure incurred by the payer as payment for services performed in the year or years in which the recipient of the payment is expected to incur the ex- penditure to which the payment relates. Section CB 12(1) refers to “an amount paid by an employer in respect of an employee’s employment or service”. In this context “payment” seems to require physical payment. Given this potential ambiguity, it is necessary to look to the background to the introduction of the provision to try to ascertain its true meaning. A preliminary point is that the section applies to “accrual expenditure” which, uses the term “incurred” – a common law concept that at the time of the introduction of section EF 1 (in 1987) was clearly understood as being wide enough to encapsulate future expenditure (this had been the understood position as early as 1938 with the decision in New Zealand Flax Ltd v FC of T (1938) 5 ATD 36). The Consultative Document on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure (October 1986) recom- mended the introduction of a regime for the timing of deductions for expenses other than interest. Chapter 14 sets out the broad outline for what became section EF 1. Nothing in the general discussion indicates whether the Committee envisaged the provision applying to all incurred expenditure, or only to prepayments. However, all of the examples concern prepayment scenarios. The comments made in the subsequent Report of the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure (April 1987) are also inconclu- sive in this regard. However, there is one indication that the focus may have been on prepayments. In Appendix III to the Report: Recommendations of the Consultative Committee to the Minister of Finance, in referring to the precursor to section EF 1(5)(a) and the change from a “delivery” test to a “use” test for goods, the following comment is made: Clause 12 of the amended Bill deals with how the accruals treatment will apply to the specified categories of expenditure, other than interest, outlined in your Budget. The treatment for non-interest expenditure in the Bill follows the treatment outlined in your Budget, with one exception. Your Budget announcement required the add-back of expenditure on goods only to the extent that the goods were paid for but not received by the end of the income year. Under clause 12 however, expenditure on goods must be added back where the goods have not been used at the end of the income year. Thus goods are treated in the same way as other types of accrued expenditure. That is, a deduction for the whole of the expendi- ture is allowed in the income year in which it is incurred but that part of expenditure related to future years is added back to the taxpayer’s assessable income. This treatment is similar to the current treatment of expenditure incurred on trading stock and conforms with one of the options outlined in the Consulta- tive Document. (Emphasis added) From this statement it might be inferred that section EF 1(5)(a), at the very least, was only aimed at prepayments, i.e. that was the intention when it applied a “delivery” test, and the same approach applied under the eventually adopted “use” test. However, it is considered that the comments made about the regime being the same as for other types of accrued expenditure, and in particular the trading stock regime, seem to be somewhat at odds with that interpretation. For example, the definition of “trading stock” does not differentiate IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 21 between payments actually made and future payments – trading stock is essentially what has been acquired or purchased at year-end, whether actually paid for or not. In addition, the definition of “trading stock” was amended in 1987 to expressly provide that it included “anything in respect of which expenditure is incurred after 23 October 1986 and which, if possession of that thing were taken, would be trading stock”. Arguably, the reference to “incurred” makes it even clearer that the trading stock regime operates on an accruals basis, i.e. recognising all expenditure that has been incurred at year-end, regardless of whether that expenditure has been physically paid out. Although not completely free from doubt, it is consid- ered that the better view is that section EF 1 is not limited to pre-payments. The concept of “incurred” expenditure is clearly wider. Although the examples provided in the consultative documents referred to above all dealt with pre-payment situations, there is nothing in the background to the provision’s enactment that expressly limits it in that way. (In this regard it should be noted that in cases such as Marac Life Assurance Limited v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086, at pages 5,093, 5,095, 5,100 and 5,104 and CIR v Dewavrin (1994) 16 NZTC 11,048 at page 11,054, the Court of Appeal noted a word of caution regarding taking into account background discussion papers as being indicative of the underlying purpose of any provision or as necessarily identifying the mischief that the legislation was designed to counter. Although such background material may be helpful, it is always necessary to look at the plain words of the legislation actually promulgated to determine what Parliament intended.) In addition, since the enact- ment of section EF 1(5)(c), it is considered very difficult from an interpretative stance to read the other subsec- tions down in the manner suggested. This statement therefore proceeds on the basis that section EF 1 poten- tially applies to all incurred accrual expenditure. It is also noted that this result is consistent with the comments made by Inland Revenue in Technical Policy Circular 88/2 (Part 2), the text of which was subse- quently published in the same form in Public Informa- tion Bulletin No 167 (December 1987). Although the examples given all involve pre-payments, the perceived mischief is stated more broadly (at page 51) as being the ability to take a deduction for expenditure that has been incurred, but not paid for: Mischief As noted in the 1986 Budget many tax avoidance schemes depend upon deficiencies in the rules governing the timing of tax deductions and the derivation of income. Under section 104 of the Act a deduction is allowed for expenditure as it is incurred, i.e. when the taxpayer is under a legal obligation to make payment, not when payment is actually made. Given that a deduction could be taken in advance of actual payment there were obvious cashflow advantages in advanc- ing the point in time at which an obligation to make payment was assumed. The new section 104A removes such timing anomalies by introducing a regime similar to the treatment of trading stock for expenditure that is wholly or partly attribut- able to income years other than the year in which the expendi- ture is incurred. (Emphasis added) It is also interesting to note that the taxpayer in Thornton Estates Ltd. v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577 argued before the Court of Appeal (at page 13,582) that section EF 1 was directed at pre-payments, and particularly at payments for consumable aids. Although this argument is not addressed in the reasoning, it seems implicit in the decision reached that the Court did not see the provision as being limited in anyway to pre-payments. Application to deductions for warranty costs The Privy Council in Mitsubishi held that the taxpayer had “incurred” a liability to meet future warranty costs arising out of sales of vehicles in the relevant income year and was entitled to make a deduction equivalent to a reasonable estimation of those costs. The expenditure in question was the estimated warranty costs. This type of expenditure falls within the definition of “accrual expenditure”. It has not been incurred in the purchase of trading stock, nor in respect of any specified lease or financial arrangement. (The question of whether the warranty was a financial arrangement was consid- ered by the Court of Appeal. That Court reached the view that although a contract of sale which includes an indemnity in respect of conditional obligations under warranties to be performed (at a cost) in the future came within the broad reach of paragraph (b) of the definition of “financial arrangement”, the fact that the warranty was an integral part of an agreement for sale and pur- chase of property meant that the entire arrangement was an “excepted financial arrangement” and therefore outside the accruals regime.) Under section EF 1 the “unexpired portion” of any accrual expenditure must be added back. Deciding whether there is any “unexpired portion” requires consideration of section EF 1(5). Section EF 1(5) determines what is meant by the “unexpired portion” of any amount of accrual expenditure with reference to the type of expenditure. That is, in this context, whether the expenditure relates to the purchase of goods (section EF 1(5)(a)), payment for services (section EF 1(5)(b)), or payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action (section EF 1(5)(d)). Each subsection uses the phrase “relates to”, e.g. the relevant expenditure must relate to the purchase of goods. Given this, before considering the application of each part of section EF 1 to warranty expenditure it is useful to consider the meaning of that phrase. This issue is key to determining the potential breadth of the provision. “relates to” The meaning of “relates to” in section EF 1 has not been directly considered by any New Zealand court. How- ever, the words “relates”, “in relation to”, and “relating to” have been considered by the courts, both here and overseas. continued on page 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 22 A leading case on the meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” is Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303. In that case the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to the employment” in the definition of “mon- etary remuneration” and “extra emolument” in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The words “in respect of or in relation to” were held to be “words of the widest import”. However, given that the words “in relation to” appear as a compound term in section 2 with the words “in respect of”, it is arguable that their scope is naturally broader in that context. In Department of Internal Affairs v Poverty Bay Club Inc \[1989\] DCR 481, the District Court held that the mean- ing of the word “relates” in section 2(c) of the Antiqui- ties Act 1975 is the ordinary meaning of the word, i.e. “to have a connection or to establish a relationship with”. In the High Court decision Picture Perfect Ltd v Camera House Ltd \[1996\] 1 NZLR 310, Barker J considered the scope of the word “relates” as it appears in section 29(1)(c) of the Commerce Act 1986. Barker J did not have to draw any final conclusions on this point, how- ever he observed that the interpretation of “relates” in this context could involve either a flexible or restrictive approach. He noted that it had been suggested that the preferable interpretation in the context before him was that the “relates to” concept should be given a “liberal view” (i.e. to extend to situations with only an indirect connection) to reflect the underlying legislative inten- tion. The Supreme Court of Canada also gave a wide interpre- tation to the words “relating to” in Slattery (Trustee of) v Slattery \[1993\] 2 CTC 243. The Court considered the meaning of “in respect of proceedings relating to the administration or enforcement” of the Income Tax Act. Iacobucci J gave “relating to” the same meaning as “in respect of” and “in connection with”. The Court consid- ered that these words suggested a wide, rather than a narrow, interpretation of the section containing those words. However, a narrower interpretation of “relating to” was preferred by McLachlin J in his dissenting judgment. He was of the opinion that the context and jurisprudence concerning the section within which the phrase was used determined its meaning and indicated a narrower construction. From this analysis it is considered that “relates to” means that one thing has a connection or establishes a relationship with some other thing. However, the scope of this connection will depend on the statutory context in which the relating to concept appears. Having considered the potential meaning of “relates to”, it is necessary to consider the ordinary meaning of the words of sections EF 1(5)(a), (b) and (d) as they might apply to warranty expenditure. Section EF 1(5)(a) - Goods Section EF 1(5)(a) deals with expenditure that “relates to the purchase of goods”. “Goods” are defined as meaning all real and personal property, but not including choses in action or money. It is considered that in the context of warranty expendi- ture, section EF 1(5)(a) could be interpreted as poten- tially applying to: •the purchase price of goods acquired for, and paid (or to be paid) for by, the taxpayer; and/or •the purchase price of goods acquired by a third party, but paid for (or to be paid for) by the taxpayer (al- though only to the extent that such expenditure is deductible under section BD 2(1)(b) in the first instance); and/or •expenditure paid for (or to be paid for) by the tax- payer, being ancillary, or relating to, the purchase of any such goods (e.g. freight, custom or other transpor- tation charges). On this basis, the estimated warranty costs incurred by a taxpayer in an analogous position to the taxpayer in Mitsubishi, would not fall within the provision. The expenditure is not payment for the purchase of goods by the warrantor, or by any third party (customers paying for the purchase of their own vehicles). Nor, does the expenditure relate to any such purchase. However, it is acknowledged that an alternative, and potentially wider, interpretation of section EF 1(5)(a) is possible. It is arguable that the inclusion of the words “relates to” extends the provision to apply to any expenditure that has a connection with the purchase of goods, regardless of whether the taxpayer (the warran- tor) has paid, or is to pay, for the purchase of those goods. It is only necessary that the expenditure relates to, in a general sense, the purchase of goods. Taking this wider approach, it can then be argued that the warranty expenditure which a warrantor may incur relates to the purchase of goods, i.e. the purchase of vehicles by consumers. In Commissioner of Customs and Excise v Ingram \[1949\] 2 KB 103, the Court of Appeal considered whether a “person concerned with the purchase .... of goods” could be required to furnish information relating to a sale of goods by that person to others. That case concerned section 20(3) of the Finance Act 1946 (UK) which dealt with purchase tax and provided: Every person concerned with the purchase or importation of goods or with the application to goods of any process or manufacture or with dealings with imported goods shall furnish to the Commissioners within such time and in such form as they may require information relating to the goods or to the purchase or importation thereof.... The Commissioner contended that the phrase “informa- tion relating to the purchase thereof” required the taxpayer to not only furnish information about goods purchased by him, but also information relating to the from page 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 23 sale of those goods by him to others. The Commissioner argued that the phrase must be read in the context of, and having regard to, other sections of the Act which imposed purchase tax. The Court accepted the Commissioner’s arguments. The Court looked to the definition of “purchase”. For the purposes of the Act it was defined as meaning any contract which is a contract of sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act 1893. This meant that “pur- chase” must be read in section 20(3) as applying to buyers and sellers. However, in reaching this decision the Court noted: It must, we think, be conceded that the drafting of the sub-section is not in any way felicitous: and .... it seems to us that a first and natural reading of its terms would confine “purchase” to the purchase by the “person concerned”. Preliminary conclusion on the words of section EF 1(5)(a) It is unclear if section EF 1(5)(a) is intended to apply only to expenditure relating to purchases of goods paid, or to be paid for, by the taxpayer seeking the deduction. However, in the light of Ingram it is considered that the better view is that the section is limited in this way. As seen, “relates to”, and similar phrases, have generally been given a broad interpretation by the courts, although the breadth of their meaning tends to be influenced by the legislative context. Arguably, if Parliament had intended to apply section EF 1(5)(a) to both purchases and sales it could have provided for this expressly. It is considered that the better view of the meaning of “relates to” is that it extends the provision to cover expenses ancillary to, or paid in connection with, the purchase of goods by the taxpayer, e.g. freight charges, or storage charges. But, it does not extend section EF 1(5)(a) to cover expenditure relating to the purchase of goods by a third party for which the taxpayer does not pay, or become obliged to pay, consideration for. In the context of warranty expenditure, adopting this interpretation means that section EF 1(5)(a) does not apply to payments made by taxpayers (warrantors) for the cost of goods applied to remedy defects under warranties. Section EF 1(5)(b) – Services Section EF 1(5)(b) deals with expenditure for services. “Services” is defined as anything which is not goods, or money, or a chose in action. The ordinary meaning of “service” confirms its wide application. The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993) defines “service” as: IV 18 Provision of a facility to meet the needs or for the use of a person or thing...20 Assistance or benefit provided to someone by a person or thing;...21a An act of helping or benefiting another; an instance of beneficial, useful, or friendly action. b The action of serving, helping, or benefitting another... B vt 1 Be of service to; serve; provide with a service. 2 Per- form maintenance or repair work on (a motor vehicle etc.) Section EF 1(5)(b) applies where the expenditure in question relates to payment for services. As for section EF 1(5)(a), in the context of warranty expenditure section EF 1(5)(b) could be interpreted as potentially applying to: •the cost of services supplied to the taxpayer and paid (or to be paid) for by the taxpayer; and/or •the cost of services supplied to a third party, but paid (or to be paid) for by the taxpayer (subject to being deductible under section BD 2(1)(b) in the first instance); and/or •expenditure paid (or to be paid) for by the taxpayer, being ancillary, or relating to, the payment for any such services. To determine if, and how, section EF 1(5)(b) might apply to warranty expenditure, it is necessary to ask whether any “services” have been or will be provided, and whether “payment” has been made for those serv- ices by the warrantor. Warranty claims by customers will generally involve the supply of services, i.e. vehicle repair work. Although the facts in different arrangements may vary, it is generally the case that those services are provided directly by dealers to customers. Dealers then seek reimbursement for the cost of providing those services from the distributor or manufacturer (the warrantor). It may be arguable that dealers, in providing repair work to customers, also provide a “service” to their distribu- tor/manufacturer by honouring the terms of their dealer- ship arrangement with that party. The service is the processing of warranty claims, including the provision of repair work. Alternatively, it might also be argued that the warrantor pays dealers to provide repair services to customers. It is considered that the repair services provided by dealers to customers, to the extent to which they are not paid for by the warrantor, would not come within this provision. Although, it is possible to argue for an alternative and potentially wider interpretation of section EF 1(5)(b) based on the meaning of “relates to”, it is considered that the reference to “for” in section EF 1(5)(b) strongly indicates that for the section to apply the taxpayer must be obliged to pay for the underlying services. This result is consistent with the interpretation of section EF 1(5)(a) discussed above, i.e. that the section only applies if the taxpayer has paid for (or will be obliged to pay for) the goods in question. It is consid- ered reasonable to assume that Parliament intended for there to be consistency between the various subsections where the same words, i.e. “relates to”, are used. For these reasons, it is considered that the better view is that section EF 1(5)(b) does not apply to the provision of repair services by dealers to customers, to the extent to which those services cannot be said to have been paid for (or will be paid for) by the taxpayer (the warrantor) seeking the deduction. continued on page 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 24 Accepting that section EF 1(5)(b) does not apply to services provided to third parties and not paid for, or to be paid for, by the warrantor, the question becomes whether it could apply to the relationship between dealers and warrantors. The issue becomes whether it is possible to say that: •the warrantor has paid for, or is obliged to pay for, services supplied to it by the dealer; or •the warrantor has paid for, or is obliged to pay for, the repair services provided to customers. In either case it would then be arguable that section EF 1(5)(b) applies to require the adding back of the future estimated warranty expenditure by the taxpayer. Has the taxpayer paid for services supplied to it by the dealer? In most situations, warrantors require dealers to process warranty claims and undertake repair services to fulfil obligations under warranties provided by dealers to customers. This will be in accordance with the dealers’ responsibilities under their dealership agreements with the warrantor. It might be argued that, to that extent, dealers do also provide a “service” to the warrantor, i.e. repair work for a third party, but for the indirect benefit of the warrantor. It is arguable that the warrantor makes payment for those services in the form of the reimbursement of the cost of the repairs (and replace- ment parts). It is acknowledged that some support for this analysis is available in the Taxation Review Authority decision Case R34 (1996) 16 NZTC 6,190 and the supplementary decision dealing with the same facts and taxpayer, Case S88 (1997) 17 NZTC 7,551. Although those decisions concerned GST, they include an analysis of the relationships which may exist between customers, dealers, and distributors in the motor vehicle industry. In both cases the question was whether reimbursements for warranty repair costs made by the overseas manufactur- ing company to the objector, a New Zealand distributor (a party in approximately the same position as the taxpayer in Mitsubishi in the chain of distribution), were subject to GST. In Case R34 the Commissioner had conceded the argument that there was no supply of any services by the objector to the manufacturing company. The argument focussed on whether the payments made by the manufacturing company to the objector were consideration for the supply of repair services by the dealers. On this basis the Commissioner lost. However, in Case S88 the Commissioner argued successfully that there was a supply of repair services by the objector to the manufacturing company. Barber DJ noted (at page 7,562) that the result of the respondent’s approach is to construct three supplies out of the one set of repair work, namely: from the dealer (who did the actual physical repair work) to the objector; from the objector to the customer of that warranty work, for which consideration is in the purchase price of the car; and the supply of services from the objector to the manufacturing com- pany. These cases must be viewed with some caution given that they deal with the issue of whether consideration has been paid for the supply of services in the context of GST, and the facts differ from those in Mitsubishi, (e.g. in these cases the warranty was provided by the distributor to the customers, whereas in Mitsubishi warranties were given by the dealers to customers, rather than by the taxpayer, through the dealers). However, they do tend to support the conclusion that in some cases a dealer, in providing repair services to customers under warranties, also supplies services to a distributor who reimburses the dealer for the cost of those services. And, in addition, that a distributor who effects repair services through its agent in order to fulfil obligations under a warranty it provides to its dealers’ customers, also provides those repair services to the manufacturer who in turn provides a warranty to that distributor. However, there is a contrary argument. That is, that the services provided by dealers are only provided to customers, and not also to the party that reimburses the dealer for the cost of providing those services, i.e. the warrantor. On this basis, dealers merely fulfil the terms of their dealership agreements (and the underlying warranties) for which they are indemnified by a third party. They do not provide a service to the party that reimburses them for the cost of providing those services. Has the taxpayer paid for services supplied to customers? Even if it is accepted that no services have been supplied to, and paid for by, the warrantor, it is arguable that section EF 1(5)(b) might still apply on the basis that the taxpayer has paid for (or is obliged to pay for) the services supplied to customers. However, for the reasons set out above, the section will not apply if the relation- ship is not one of “payment for services”. The better view is that it will not apply where there is only a reimbursement or indemnification of services provided to a third party. Preliminary conclusion on the words of section EF 1(5)(b) It is considered that the above analysis demonstrates that it is not possible to decide the exact scope of section EF 1(5)(b) by simply considering the ordinary meaning of the words used. This is because the words used may be interpreted in different ways. A broad interpretation tends to indicate that the resolu- tion of these issues in any particular case will depend on the exact terms of the relevant dealership arrangements, including establishing who provides the warranty and on what basis. In particular, in this context the application of section EF 1(5)(b) seems to turn on whether the warrantor is paying for the services of the dealer under the warranty arrangement, or paying for services to be provided by the dealer to customers, compared to a situation where the warrantor is simply reimbursing or indemnifying the dealer for fulfilling obligations under the warranty. In the former case, it is arguable that given the language of section EF 1(5)(b) it potentially applies; in the latter situation it does not. However, even if this interpretation is sustainable, it is considered at least from page 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 25 questionable as to whether these distinctions were intended by Parliament to be determinative of the application of the section in this context. On the other hand, a narrow interpretation of section EF 1(5)(b) would tend to indicate that the provision is limited to situations where the taxpayer is paying for services (and/or ancillary expenses) provided for its own benefit. Given this ambiguity, in accordance with the approach to statutory interpretation endorsed in cases such as CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd. (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175, in order to determine the scope of the provision it is necessary to look beyond the words of section EF 1 and consider its underlying purpose. This is discussed below. Section EF 1(5)(d) - Choses in action Section EF 1(5)(d) deals with choses in action. A chose in action is not defined for the purposes of the section. Both “goods” and “services” are defined as not includ- ing choses in action. A “chose in action” is an expression used “to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by physical possession”: Torkington v Magee \[1902\] 2 KB 427, 430. A warranty is an enforceable right under a contract and as such is a chose in action. Section EF 1(5)(d) applies to expenditure which relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action. On a similar basis as for sections EF 1(5)(a) and (b), the types of warranty expenditure potentially within the provision may be identified as follows: •the payment by the taxpayer for, or in relation to, a chose for the benefit of the taxpayer; and/or •the payment by the taxpayer for, or in relation to, a chose for the benefit of a third party; and/or •expenditure paid for by the taxpayer, being ancillary, or relating to, the payment for any such chose in action. As for sections EF 1(5)(a) and (b), because of the phrase “relates to”, it is possible to argue that the payment for the chose in action does not need to be made by the taxpayer in question. It is enough if the expenditure merely relates to a payment made by a third party for a chose in action. However, again, it is considered that the better view is that the inclusion of the word “for” requires that the expenditure be for (or in relation to) a chose in action paid for by the taxpayer; the chose being for either the benefit of the taxpayer or a third party. It is considered that the words “relates to” must be read in the light of the word “for”. As for section EF 1(5)(b), this analysis then raises the question of whether a warrantor can be said to have paid for a chose in action in terms of the estimated warranty expenditure. With regard to warranties, it is the customer that has the benefit of the warranty, i.e. the right to make a claim in the event of a defect appearing within the warranty period. It is the customer’s chose in action, and not the warrantor’s. On that basis, it is suggested no payment is made for a chose for the direct benefit of the taxpayer. However, in certain cases it may be possible to argue that a payment is made for the customer’s chose in action by a warrantor. Again, it is considered that whether this is the case in any particular situation will depend on the exact terms of the dealership arrange- ments (including the relevant warranty) and the basis on which payment is made by the warrantor to dealers. On a literal interpretation of section EF 1(5)(d), it is acknowl- edged that to the extent that payment is made for the underlying warranty, even though this will be for the direct benefit of customers and not the taxpayer/warran- tor seeking the deduction, the provision may apply. “in relation to” In addition, unlike sections EF 1(5)(a) and 1(5)(b), section EF 1(5)(d) also includes the words “in relation to”. As seen, the words “in relation to” tend to have been interpreted in a broad manner by the courts. By the inclusion of these words it is reasonable to assume that Parliament intended to broaden the application of section EF 1(5)(d), when compared with sections EF 1(5)(a) and 1(5)(b). A similar phrase, “for or in connection with”, as it appears in section 26AB of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (which deals with payments for the grant or assignment of a lease) was considered in Berry v FCT (1953) 89 CLR 653. The Court in that case concluded that the words “for or in connection with” covered a payment received for something other than the main property in question, so long as the receipt of the payment had a substantial relation, in a practical busi- ness sense, to that property. This might suggest that the words “for or in relation to” are wide enough to cover a payment made by a warrantor for warranty costs, in that although that payment may not be for the chose in action (i.e. the warranty) it is a payment made “in relation to” that chose. To that extent, section EF 1(5)(d) would apply to the estimated future warranty costs. However, such an interpretation of section EF 1(5)(d) requires reading the words “for, or in relation to” disjunctively. That is, the section will apply even if the taxpayer has not made any payment for, or is obliged to make any payment for, the acquisition of the underlying chose in action. Provided that a payment has been made in relation to that chose, that will be enough to come within the section. A narrower interpretation would be that for the provision to apply the taxpayer must have made payment for a chose in action, before any other payment made in relation to that payment is caught. However, it is acknowledged that the difficulty with this argument is that it tends to attribute the same meaning to the words “in relation to” and “relates to”, i.e. expenses ancillary to the principal payment for the underlying chose. Unless it continued on page 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 26 can be accepted that the words are simply otiose, principles of statutory interpretation suggest that the words “in relation to” have a meaning distinct from the words “relates to”. One possible meaning for the phrase would be that it extends the provision to apply to expenditure which merely relates to a third party’s chose in action. On this basis section EF 1(5)(d) would be potentially wide enough to cover a deduction for future estimated warranty costs made by a warrantor. A further difficulty with adopting a broad interpretation of section EF 1(5)(d) arises out of the way in which the unexpired portion is calculated. The provision states that the amount of the unexpired portion is “the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period, in relation to which the chose is enforceable”. In the context of warranty expenditure it is difficult to find a relationship between that expenditure and the warranty period. This method of calculating the unexpired portion of the accrual expenditure suggests that section EF 1(5)(d) was intended to apply to the cost of acquiring choses in action for the taxpayer’s own benefit, rather than other types of payment relating to a third party’s chose in action. Preliminary conclusion on the words of section EF 1(5)(d) As for section EF 1(5)(b), section EF 1(5)(d) permits of more than one interpretation. Applying a broad interpretation, the provision poten- tially applies to all warranty expenditure to the extent that the terms of any particular warranty arrangement involves the warrantor paying for the underlying war- ranty, although not for its own benefit, but for the benefit of the customer. This is consistent with the wide judicial interpretation that tends to be given to the phrase “relates to”. In addition, the inclusion of the phrase “in relation to”, suggests that section EF 1(5)(d) is broad enough to encompass such payments. A narrower approach would restrict the provision to situations where the taxpayer is paying for a warranty (and/or ancillary expenses) where the warranty is for its own benefit. As for section EF 1(5)(b), given this ambiguity, it is considered that in order to determine the scope of section EF 1(5)(d) it is necessary to look beyond the words of the provision and consider the underlying purpose of section EF 1, as may be determined from the legislative background to the provision, and relevant case law. Purpose of section EF 1 Legislative background Section EF 1 forms part of the accruals regime enacted in 1987. As previously noted, the Consultative Docu- ment on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expendi- ture (October 1986) proposed a test of delivery (rather than the current “use” test) for expenditure relating to the purchase of goods. At paragraph 14.2.1 it states: Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on the purchase of goods will be deemed to relate to the income year in which the goods are supplied or provided to the taxpayer. (Emphasis added) At that stage, at least in regard to “goods”, it seems clear that the goods in question had to be goods acquired by the taxpayer seeking the deduction. The Consultative Document also deals with services. The commentary does not make it clear whether or not the services must be performed for the direct benefit of the taxpayer seeking the deduction. However, the thrust of the discussion, and the examples given, suggest that this was the focus. At paragraph 14.2.2, dealing with “services”, the following comments are made: Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on services will be deemed to relate to the income year in which the services are provided. Where the expenditure is for services to be provided in more than one income year, the expenditure related to each income year will be determined on the basis of the fair market value at the date the expenditure is incurred of (sic) the services provided that year. A written statement from the supplier of the services to the purchaser will normally be accepted as sufficient evidence of the amount of the total expenditure relating to the services in each year. ... Expenditure incurred on contingent service contracts (i.e., contracts for the supply of services contingent upon certain events, such as a contract for the repair of equip- ment in the event that the equipment breaks down) is to be pro-rated over the period to which the contract relates. (Emphasis added) It is considered that although this extract does not expressly say that the services in question must be performed for the benefit of the taxpayer seeking the deduction, this seems a reasonable implication. The assumption is that the “purchaser” of the services is the taxpayer seeking the deduction. In the case of contingent service contracts, the assumption is that the taxpayer is the party which has paid for the benefit of the contract, e.g. to cover any breakdown of its equipment. By the time of the Consultative Committee’s Report of April 1987, the test for determining whether expenditure in relation to the purchase of goods was fully deductible had changed to a “goods used” test. A “use test” makes it at least arguable that the goods do not have to be those of the taxpayer (on a broad interpretation payment need only relate to the purchase of goods by a third party). However, there is nothing in the report to suggest that the “use test” was intended to be wider in this respect than the former delivery test. The focus is on a test analogous to the trading stock regime (i.e. a regime dealing with expenditure on stock acquired by the relevant taxpayer). Paragraphs 60 to 62 of Part II of the Report indicate that the emphasis was on consumable aids, i.e. non-capital goods used by a business in the production of assessable income which are not trading stock. The reference to consumable aids again suggests that the Committee had the purchase of goods by the taxpayer seeking the deduction in mind. from page 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 27 Statements by Inland Revenue released shortly after the enactment of the precursor to section EF 1 also tend to show that the focus was on goods, services, or choses acquired by the taxpayer for the direct benefit of the taxpayer seeking the deduction, with the timing of that deduction being linked to the application of that ex- penditure to the production of assessable income: Public Information Bulletin No 167 (December 1987), para- graphs 14 and 35. Case law Section EF 1 has recently been considered by the Court of Appeal, on appeal from the High Court decision: Thornton Estates Ltd. v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,230. The case concerned a property developer which acquired land for development. In the year of acquisition it claimed a deduction for the cost of the land, develop- ment costs, and other expenses which it argued were directly attributable to the utilisation of the land. The taxpayer maintained that it did not have to bring to account the value of the land, nor, alternatively, any expenditure on purchasing and developing the land, as a corresponding revenue item. High Court Hansen J held that although the taxpayer was entitled to a deduction for the expenditure (under the equivalent to section BD 2(1)(b)), this was subject to the application of section EF 1. Section EF 1(5) applied to the purchase of goods, which included real property. The taxpayer argued that under section EF 1(5)(a) the land (i.e. the good) had been “used” as soon as it had been applied for the production of assessable income. This meant that the total costs associated with the land could be taken as a deduction from the time the develop- ment commenced, even though the use was spread over a number of income-producing years. Hansen J rejected the taxpayer’s argument and con- cluded that the land was not used in terms of section EF 1(5)(a) until the land was sold, i.e. it had produced assessable income - this treatment being analogous to the treatment of trading stock. In reaching this conclusion, Hansen J rejected the taxpayer’s arguments for adopting the ordinary meaning of the word “use”. Instead he was prepared to apply a “scheme and purpose” approach to the interpretation of section EF 1 (at page 12,245): In my view, it is correct to interpret this legislation in that manner. As was noted earlier, the purpose of the accrual regime was to achieve tax symmetry by the matching of expenditure and income. It seems to me that for the legisla- tion to have the required effect, it is necessary to interpret and apply these sections in the manner the Commissioner has done in this particular case. To interpret “use” in the manner Mr Martin urged me to would be to make the accruals regime pursuant to s104, if not totally ineffective, then very close to it. (Emphasis added) Court of Appeal In an unanimous decision the Court disallowed the taxpayer’s appeal. The Court found that where a land developer is entitled to deduct expenditure on the acquisition and development of land, section EF 1 requires that that part of the expenditure which relates to land still on hand at balance date must be added back under section EF 1(1). This result was considered to be consistent with the purpose of section EF 1 – to match deductible expenditure and revenue production. Richardson P noted (at page 13,581): A crucial problem addressed by the special regimes \[financial arrangements, leases of personal property and accrual expendi- ture\] was that the timing of tax deductions and income recognition was not symmetrical. In particular expenditure might be deductible much earlier than when the income to which it related would be assessable. The mismatch allowed taxpayers scope to defer taxes even where there was a resulting asset held in the interim on revenue account, depending on the terms of the general legislation. ... The obvious purpose implicit in s\[EF 1\] is to match deductible expenditure and revenue production. The section focuses on the effect of expenditure in the current year by bringing into account as income and thereby offsetting the expenditure by that part of the expenditure which remains attributable to the future period. In discussing the scheme of section EF 1, his Honour went on to note (at page 13,582): The next step in the statutory matching scheme is to ascertain the extent to which the effect of expenditure is referable to the subsequent year. Under the description of “the unexpired portion ... of any amount of accrual expenditure” paras (a), (b) and (c) of s104A \[paras (a), (b) and (d) of sEF 1(5)\] deal with goods, services and choses in action respectively. Under (b) the unexpired portion is “the amount of expenditure incurred on services performed”. Under (c) the unexpired portion is “the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable”. Under (a) the unexpired portion is “the amount of expenditure incurred on goods not used in the production of assessable income”. In all three cases the apportionment is time related: under (a) it is the goods yet to be used; under (b) it is the services yet to be performed; and under (c) it is the amount for which the charge is then enforceable. In harmony with (b) and (c) the assump- tion underlying (a) is that the extent that goods, including land, have not been used in the production of assessable income, the amount of the accrual expenditure is not attributable to the income year when the expenditure was incurred but belongs to the next year and subsequent years. The subsection proceeds on the premise that in such cases the effect of the expenditure is not spent and there is an unexpired portion of expenditure to be included in the assessable income for the income year (subs(4) \[subs(1)\]). (Emphasis added) The Court of Appeal rejected the taxpayer’s argument that “used” in the precursor to section EF 1(5)(a) meant “employed, applied, committed or dedicated”, preferring the meaning “used up”. That meaning was considered to be consistent with the matching purpose of the legisla- tion (at page 13,583): The obvious purpose of the accruals provision is to achieve a closer matching of the timing of deductions and income recognition for tax purposes. To that end s104A \[sEF 1\] continued on page 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 – Appendix (June 1998) 28 allows the taxpayer the benefit of the deduction as and when goods purchased on revenue account are expended through being consumed or incorporated into other assets. The net result reflecting the income earning activity is that while the expenditure is deductible in full the unexpired portion is brought back in as assessable income, the assump- tion being that the difference, i.e. the expired portion, has been reflected in product sales or in products on hand. The contrary interpretation espoused by Mr Martin ignores the continued existence and continuing availability for the use of the land in its then state beyond the income year. That interpre- tation would produce an irrational result turning on how much of the land has been subjected to development work rather than what was still on hand at the end of the income year. It would also undermine the purpose of the accruals regime and would be inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles and commercial practice. (Emphasis added) The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision and confirmed that the underlying purpose of section EF 1 is to match the timing of the deduction of revenue expendi- ture with the production of assessable income to which it relates. Notwithstanding these comments, in seeking to deter- mine what is the underlying purpose of section EF 1, it is acknowledged that an alternative argument may be made. On the basis of the language of section EF 1(5) it is arguable that the purpose of the legislation is to match the timing of deductions for expenditure with the actual benefit that flows from that expenditure (by the use of the goods, the performance of services or the expiry of the period of the relevant chose in action), rather than the income derived by virtue of such expenditure. The matching of the timing of deductions with the benefit through consumption derived from such expenditure will not always correspond with the matching of deductions and the production of income from that expenditure. In Thornton Estates, the Court of Appeal was not confronted with a situation where, although the expendi- ture in question had been used to derive income (product sales), the direct benefit of that expenditure had not yet arisen (e.g. benefits flowing to a third party under a warranty in terms of the provision of goods and services to repair defective vehicles). In that case, at the time the deduction was taken for the expenditure, although arguably the taxpayer had received the direct benefit of that expenditure (e.g. goods and services acquired to develop the land), it had not been used to derive income. This would only arise when, and to the extent that, the land was subsequently sold. Notwithstanding this difference, it is considered that the Court of Appeal decision stands for the principle that section EF 1 should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the matching of expenditure and income. Applying such an approach to the facts in Mitsubishi leads to the result that section EF 1 does not apply because its application causes a mis-matching of the timing of the deduction (for warranty costs) with the income that flows from that expenditure (vehicle sale proceeds). This is also inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles and commercial practice as referred to by the Court of Appeal in Thornton Estates, and by the Privy Council in reaching their decision in Mitsubishi. Conclusions Inland Revenue considers that section EF 1 is not limited to pre-payments of accrual expenditure and therefore has potential application to future estimated warranty expenditure. It is acknowledged that it is possible to argue that the words of section EF 1, when applied to the same or similar facts to those in Mitsubishi, are wide enough to cover expenditure incurred by a warrantor. This would be on the basis that the warranty expenditure relates to payment for services (either provided to the warrantor or to the customer), or because it is for, or in relation to, a chose in action (the warranty). However, it would appear that a payment which is a reimbursement or indemnifica- tion for the cost of services provided, as distinct from a payment for services, is not covered. In the case of services, applying section EF 1 means that the expenditure is not deductible until the warranty has been honoured by the performance of the repair services. In the case of a chose, the expenditure would need to be spread over the period of the underlying warranty. However, it is unclear on the words of the provision which subsection (section EF 1(5)(b) or 1(5)(d)) would apply in any particular case. (The result will be different given the different way in which the unexpired portion is calculated.) It is also unclear why Parliament would have intended a wider interpretation to apply to services and choses in action, than to goods – the better view of section EF 1(5)(a) being that it is limited to payments for goods acquired for the benefit of the taxpayer. It may be suggested that this difficulty of classification stems from the fact that although estimated future warranty expenditure may be for the future supply of particular goods or services (repair of the defective vehicle), prima facie they are payments made to honour a warranty. That is to say, they are first and foremost warranty costs. Given this uncertainty on the words of the provision, it is necessary to consider the underlying purpose of section EF 1 as demonstrated by the legislative background to the provision, and considered by the courts (most notably the Court of Appeal in Thornton Estates). That analysis shows that the section is aimed at achieving matching of the timing of deductions with the income flowing from that expenditure and should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with that purpose. To apply section EF 1 to facts analogous to those arising in Mitsubishi would result in a taxation treatment that differs from matching in those terms. Therefore, Inland Revenue accepts that section EF 1 does not apply to require the adding back of warranty expenditure in the same or similar factual situations to those which arose in Mitsubishi. from page 27
