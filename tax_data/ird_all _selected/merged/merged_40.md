Both tax policy and tax administration must be working well for us to have a good tax system, which will help business grow and to make New Zealand attractive to investors. Our key advice is that the tax system needs to be considered as a whole. For example, individual tax policy changes cannot be considered in isolation. They need to be examined with a view to how they dovetail into building an overall coherent tax system. This involves coherence with both other policies and with our ability to operate the tax system in ways that are as low-cost and as helpful to taxpayers as possible. The briefing is a stocktake on how we see the tax system is functioning. Overall, we see the tax system as operating well. We collect revenue to finance government spending using broad tax bases and mostly low rates. This is likely to minimise the economic costs of raising taxes. Despite recent downturns, our revenue collections from our three main tax bases – personal income, company income and expenditure on goods and services – have over time been robust. We collect significant amounts of revenue from these taxes. We believe that the tax system is mainly seen as fair. Compliance costs are relatively low by international standards. The money the government spends on Inland Revenue per $100 of revenue raised is moderate by international standards and is declining. Nevertheless, there are some growing pressures. None of these should be viewed as a matter of alarm. The tax system is generally operating well. However, there are some growing problems which, if left untreated, have the potential to erode our ability to deliver a high quality tax system. One concern is the overall coherence of the tax system. To an increasing extent, the tax paid by an individual depends on the way in which that income is earned. There is ample evidence that people are using different entities to structure their affairs in ways which reduce their tax liabilities. The scope that the current tax system provides for this to happen imposes costs that can lower the wellbeing of New Zealand as a whole. It can also create considerable business uncertainty around what is and what is not tax avoidance. It can create a mentality that rather than tax being something which is paid by all, tax is something for the smart, the able and the well-advised to avoid. Over time, this can erode confidence that the tax system is fair. There are a number of possible ways of reforming the tax system to create greater coherence. We believe that an important priority for the government is to settle on a broad framework for reform and to take systematic steps over time to increase the coherence of the tax system. A second concern is maintaining a robust company tax base as any substantial erosion of this base is likely to put upward pressure on other tax rates. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 6 of 57 In charting a future path it is important for the government to be aware that governments around the world have been reducing their company tax rates. This creates pressure for New Zealand to do likewise. Despite New Zealand’s recent reduction in its rate, the 30 percent company rate is still higher than average in the OECD. As other countries reduce their rate, this puts pressure on New Zealand to do likewise. But other things being equal, the lower the company tax rate is relative to higher rates of personal income tax, the greater will be the scope for taxpayers to structure their affairs in ways which shelter their income from higher rates of personal tax. Another concern is the high effective marginal tax rates that many taxpayers face because of taxes and the abatement of social benefits that depend on income. High effective marginal rates can leave people with little real incentive to work harder or smarter or to undertake training to improve their productivity. It also creates scope for tax planning. This is not an easy problem to resolve. Reducing these effective marginal tax rates either requires providing less assistance, which could hurt many who are not well off, or involves abating social benefits more slowly, which can be costly. But these effective marginal rates need to be taken into account when considering future reform. It seems generally desirable to avoid adding to effective marginal rates and, where possible, to lower them. These policy challenges are echoed on the delivery side. Problems with the coherence of policy settings flow through to the administration of the tax system. Our relatively high reliance on company tax, combined with the increasing integration of the world economy, makes it important that Inland Revenue has the skills necessary to protect our tax base. Those skills are also necessary to provide quick and accurate responses to give businesses and the public as much certainty as possible in applying the tax laws. New Zealand is unlikely to have the lowest tax rates in the world but we can contribute to the international competitiveness of the economy through high-quality tax administration. New Zealand has the advantage of a history of strong tax administration, but we cannot afford to stand still. The world continues to change, with new technology being an obvious example. Moreover, over time, Inland Revenue has picked up a large number of additional tasks, including Working for Families tax credits, child support, student loans, paid parental leave and KiwiSaver. This has put pressure on key aspects of our system, in particular the payment and processing of employer tax obligations. Our systems need to work well and be able to handle inevitable government policy changes, including those in the National Party’s Post-election action plan. As requests on the system have expanded, systems that were designed well for dealing with tax matters have been progressively modified and adapted to take on additional tasks. This has created a quite complicated administrative system that is becoming less agile and more costly in taking on urgent and important new tasks. A priority will be to consider both policy options and systems redesign options that will alleviate these concerns. Inland Revenue is therefore undergoing a period of significant transformation. To manage the transformation, we are developing a programme of initiatives which will equip our infrastructure and our people to deliver better value for money, make it easier and less costly for individuals and businesses to comply with their obligations and receive their entitlements, and allow Inland Revenue to respond quickly and efficiently to changing government expectations. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 7 of 57 1. Introduction As Minister of Revenue you are accountable for the overall working of New Zealand’s tax system and for the Inland Revenue Department. Tax policy decisions are made jointly by yourself and the Minister of Finance. For the year ended 30 June 2007, Inland Revenue collected 75.4 percent of total government revenue and 83.1 percent of total tax revenue. 1 Total staff at 30 June 2008 numbered 5,976 (measured in full-time staff equivalents). Constitutionally, tax can only be levied in accordance with laws enacted by Parliament. Inland Revenue has an obligation to levy tax in accordance with the law to the best of our ability. We also have an important obligation to maintain confidentiality of people’s tax affairs. The Commissioner has statutory independence from Ministers to ensure we are able to levy tax and carry out our duties independently. We also administer KiwiSaver and a range of social policy initiatives which are not part of the tax system but are generally administered using the infrastructure put in place to collect tax. The Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, jointly with the Treasury, provides advice to Ministers on tax policy and assists with the management of tax legislation through Parliament. Inland Revenue has an obligation to ensure that the tax system as a whole is well- functioning. This is important to the government, the economy and society. We have identified six key factors that contribute to a good tax system. First, there should be clear and well-understood tax policy and legislation. Complying with tax liabilities should not be like walking through a minefield where an inadvertent error produces dire consequences. Taxpayers should be able to get on with their affairs while spending as little time and as few resources as possible consulting the Income Tax Act, Goods and Services Tax Act (GST Act) or seeking tax advice. This is helped by having a clear and simple policy framework and clear legislation, which helps not only taxpayers and their advisors but also the courts in coming to clear and consistent decisions. Second, even with the clearest of policy and legislation, taxpayers will need to contact Inland Revenue on occasion. There are clearly administrative costs that the department incurs when people make contact. However, taxpayers should receive high levels of service and timely responses from good, technically competent and receptive people. Third, finding information and receiving assistance should not be a struggle for taxpayers. For this to be provided cost-effectively, it is desirable for as much as possible to be provided electronically in easy-to-access ways. Providing information electronically also provides scope for information to be tailored to taxpayer needs as efficiently as possible. 1 Source: The Treasury, Budget 2008. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 8 of 57 Fourth, Inland Revenue should be able to anticipate and respond quickly to policy and administrative challenges. This is helped by having good, technically competent and receptive staff. It is also important, however, that agility of response does not lead to a culture of lobbying for favoured tax treatment or create uncertainty. To this end, the policy framework and legislation must be articulated as clearly as possible so that policy problems are evident. Fifth, high tax rates and narrow tax bases are likely to increase the economic costs of taxation. High rates and narrow tax bases make it easy for taxpayers to alter their affairs in ways which reduce their tax burden. Where possible, it is attractive to ensure that tax is levied at low rates over broad tax bases. Finally, a good tax system is characterised by high levels of voluntary compliance, which is helped by the tax system being perceived as broadly fair. That is more likely when the policy framework is clear. But it is also necessary to have good tax administration which makes it as easy as possible for those who wish to do so to get it right and as hard as possible for those who wish to do so to get it wrong. We see our job as doing whatever we can to ensure that the government has a good, cost-effective tax system. The key functions that Inland Revenue performs are: • collecting tax to finance government spending; • redistributing income in line with the government’s equity objectives; • delivering specific programmes that are not necessarily part of tax collection – including Working for Families tax credits, the student loan scheme, child support, KiwiSaver, paid parental leave, research and development (R&D) tax credits, and audits for government grants to firms; • helping make the New Zealand economy competitive – not only by minimising the costs of collecting tax but also by providing high levels of service; and • building trust and confidence in the public sector. None of these functions stands alone. If the tax system is performing well in each area, they will be mutually reinforcing. Weaknesses in one area can undermine the others. Our key advice is that the system we administer needs to be considered as a whole. An individual tax policy proposal needs to be considered not only on its individual merits but also on how it dovetails with other aspects of tax policy. The company tax rate, for example, needs to be considered in terms of how it fits with personal tax rates. When considering whether Inland Revenue should deliver a non-tax programme, consideration needs to be given to how this might impact on the management of the tax system. Similarly, a policy proposal may have merit but may have adverse operational implications for the department’s overall activities. When a problem with the revenue base arises, the best response may be administrative action, such as educational and support initiatives, audits, a legislative change or a combination of these. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 9 of 57 This briefing is our stocktake of how the tax system is functioning. Overall, we see the tax system as operating well. By international standards we have robust tax bases which generally collect taxes efficiently over broad bases at moderate rates. We believe that the tax system is seen as reasonably fair. Compliance costs are relatively low and the administration cost per $100 raised is modest. However, in all of our key functions there are pressures and risks that the government will need to manage over the next few years. The current worldwide financial turmoil and New Zealand recession will affect revenue collections and debt levels. They also may, on occasion, create the need for rapid policy or administrative responses. We need to be well prepared and ready to provide considered responses as circumstances change. The increasing integration of global commerce poses challenges to tax policy and administration. New government programmes and an increase in the public’s expectation of the level of service that needs to be provided are stretching Inland Revenue’s administrative capacity. The overall tax system is becoming less coherent as the same income is being taxed at increasingly different tax rates, depending upon the form in which it is earned. The delivery of social policy programmes on a platform designed to collect tax has created costs, complications and business pressures which will have to be addressed. Some core infrastructure will also need to be renewed. The current tax system can be summarised as strong but not stable. While there are many good features of the tax system, certain aspects will need to change over the next few years, in some cases significantly, to meet the challenges we face. The government will need to make decisions in terms of both tax policy and how the tax system is delivered. Given the strains on the existing system, this needs to be a managed change process. Overall, we consider that the process would be one of evolutionary change rather than a radical departure from the current architecture. Collecting tax to finance government expenditure New Zealand’s revenue is mainly derived from income tax (71.6 percent of total tax revenue for the year to 30 June 2008), GST (19.7 percent) and excises (2.8 percent). Other taxes (5.9 percent) are customs duty, road user charges, gaming duty, motor vehicle fees, energy resources levies, the approved issuer levy and gift and cheque duties. 2 The primary purpose of taxation is to raise revenue to finance government spending. Our education and health systems, police and defence forces, for example, require a robust and sustainable tax system that raises sufficient revenue to make them affordable, in conjunction with a sound government fiscal position. A sound fiscal position provides the platform for the government’s economic policies and can provide the government with the fiscal flexibility to pursue its overall policy objectives. 2 Source: The Treasury, Financial Statements May 2008. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 10 of 57 The current tax system has performed well in this regard in recent years. Given the size of current government expenditure, tax needs to be a substantial fraction of the economy. According to OECD figures, tax now amounts to 36.0 percent of GDP in New Zealand. Figure 1 shows tax as a percentage of GDP in New Zealand and a number of other countries. Figure 1: Total tax revenues as percentage of gross domestic product 15 20 25 30 35 40 196519681971197419771980198319861989199219951998200120042007 New ZealandAustraliaOECD TotalOECD AmericaOECD Europe Source: OECD Revenue growth has been very strong but there are signs of weaknesses in parts of the tax base. The main elements of the New Zealand tax system are described in chapter 3. The main challenges we see are maintaining the very strong past performance of the corporate tax base in the light of international developments and, to a lesser extent, individual income tax given the reduced coherence of the tax system that is becoming evident. These issues are considered in chapter 4. Redistributing income in line with the government’s equity objectives While the primary purpose of tax is to raise revenue, it is also universally used by societies to redistribute income towards lower income earners. A progressive income tax system such as ours that imposes higher average and marginal rates on higher incomes is often used to achieve this. Even a proportional tax system (where marginal rates are constant) such as our GST has a redistributive function since more tax is still paid by those earning and spending the most over their life-times. Government spending on health, schools and social programmes will also have distributional effects. The Tax Review 2001, chaired by Robert McLeod, (the McLeod Review) argued that most redistribution occurs through government spending and that, if an increase in progressivity is desired, this would best \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 11 of 57 be achieved through an increase in targeted spending, not an increase in tax rates. 3 While a key decision for the government is how redistributive to make the tax system, it is important to bear in mind that it is not only taxation but also government spending that will determine the overall progressivity of the government’s fiscal programme. We believe that our total tax system is mostly seen as fair. Our tax bases are more comprehensive than most countries’, leaving fewer loopholes that can undermine redistribution objectives and perceptions of fairness. From a tax administration point of view, this is especially important since these elements impact heavily on voluntary compliance. A tax system that is seen as fair will raise revenue at lower cost and help build trust and confidence in the public sector. However, a reduction in the coherence of the tax system appears to be undermining this critically important element of our system. To a growing extent, different types of income are being taxed at different rates, and rates are becoming increasingly dependent on the form in which income is earned. Unless this is happening in accordance with explicit policy that is understood, this can undermine the integrity of the tax system. Taxpayers are increasingly entering into arrangements which exploit these inconsistencies in order to minimise tax. Over time this can undermine the revenue base. The challenges in this area are discussed in chapter 4. Delivering non-tax programmes Since the mid-1980s, Inland Revenue has taken on new tasks, including student loans, Working for Families tax credits, child support, paid parental leave and KiwiSaver. This year we have also taken on the new R&D tax incentive. We must ensure that these programmes run smoothly and efficiently. Nevertheless, if Inland Revenue is to fulfil its core mandate of providing a good tax system that raises sufficient revenue to finance government spending, an important question is how broad the set of tasks assigned to it should be. As we take on a greater set of tasks, departmental resources and management time are drawn away from core tax matters. Where the tax system is used to deliver social policy or other objectives, it is important to consider whether systems that have been designed with one objective in mind are serving us adequately when used for another purpose. Using the tax system to provide incentives for certain activities may sometimes be a cost-effective way of delivering assistance but there are important effects on the coherence and clarity of the tax system that need to be taken into account. 3 http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/reviews-consultation/taxreview2001 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 12 of 57 Delivery mechanism for social policy or other objectives In our view, Inland Revenue has done a good job of expanding its set of activities. Indeed, a key reason why Inland Revenue has continued to be the delivery agency for new initiatives is that it has been successful in delivering in the past when it has taken on new functions. However, there are undoubtedly some growing tensions. The continued addition of functions puts operational pressures on the department. A particular concern is that systems that operate successfully for dealing with tax issues have been extended to deal with non-tax matters. This has meant that systems designed to deal with tax have evolved to take on these different tasks. If one were designing a social policy delivery system from scratch it would be fundamentally different from a system based on tax collection. One example is Working for Families tax credits. Despite being only 6.3 percent of tax registrations in the year to December 2007, Working for Families generates approximately 17.5 percent of phone calls to Inland Revenue at peak times. There are often much larger end-of-year adjustments that need to be made for Working for Families than for income tax. Many of the phone contacts are aimed at ensuring that these end-of-year adjustments are correct. This means that systems which work quite well in an income tax context may work less well in other areas. A second example is KiwiSaver, which works off employer monthly schedules. There appear to be many minor errors that employers make when filing these schedules. It would not be sensible to require that all minor errors are corrected if tax were the only use of the schedules. However, because Inland Revenue is effectively providing a banking service for those saving in KiwiSaver accounts, it has a duty to ensure that exact amounts of money are recorded in each saver’s account. Practical compromises that can be sensible in an income tax context may not be sensible when new functions are added to Inland Revenue’s set of tasks. Using the tax system as the delivery platform for other policies also affects the way those policies are designed. The student loan collection system, for instance, is complex and would most likely have been designed very differently if it had not been linked to the tax administration. The design is markedly different from how a bank would typically manage the risks associated with a debt-book based on unsecured loans to a highly transient population. We continually review whether we have the best methods in place for administering our expanded set of tasks. This includes consideration of possible policy changes which would make it less costly for both Inland Revenue and taxpayers. Where substantial new functions are being contemplated for Inland Revenue, it is sensible to make these major changes carefully and to give full consideration to how best to adapt systems for these new functions. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 13 of 57 Irrespective of views on whether it would be good, in principle, for Inland Revenue to be the delivery agency for further social policy or other objectives, we currently face an important practical short-term constraint. The range of tasks that Inland Revenue has taken on in recent years has seriously strained our systems. Inland Revenue is addressing those strains and ensuring it is equipped to meet future expectations of government and taxpayers by developing a multi-year proposal to renew our infrastructure and capability. Essentially, through the overlay of new functions, our business has changed and we need to change the way we do business accordingly. We are planning initiatives which will equip our infrastructure and our people to deliver better value for money, make it easier and less costly for individuals and businesses to comply, and allow Inland Revenue to respond quickly and efficiently to changing government expectations. Administrative issues are explored further in chapter 5. Tax incentives A second issue is the use of the tax system to provide incentives to achieve non-tax policy goals. A government may, at times, wish to use the tax system to provide incentives for certain activities. However, there are also costs to be considered. The more often the tax system is used for providing incentives, the more murky will become its guiding principles. This will create more need for taxpayers to seek tax advice when making normal commercial decisions. It will make it more difficult for Inland Revenue to apply anti-avoidance provisions in a consistent and predictable way. It will also make it more difficult to identify and correct any policy defects. This is because it will become more difficult to spot whether measures which appear to penalise some firms relative to other firms reflect flaws in policy or deliberate policy intentions. There will always be pressure on black-letter borderlines in the law. Not all of the benefit of tax incentives will go to the firms undertaking the desired activities. Some is likely to be eaten up in accounting fees as accounting firms attempt to ensure that expenditure is described in ways which will meet the requirements of the incentive. Moreover, tax incentives and concessions narrow the tax base, requiring higher tax rates. Another potential concern with using the tax system to provide incentives is that it may often be a poorly targeted way of delivering an incentive. This is because the benefit of tax concessions will often vary depending on the tax rate of the recipient and whether the recipient is in a profit or loss position. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 14 of 57 Helping make the New Zealand economy competitive Tax is a substantial cost on individuals (from whom resources are transferred to the government) and to the economy as a whole (since it creates disincentives to work, save and invest). Taxes create compliance costs for the public, and the cost of administering the system is expenditure that the government cannot devote to other priorities. Nevertheless, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, “Tax is the price we pay for a civilised society”. It is therefore orthodox policy advice to seek to have the benefits of taxation with minimal costs. This means minimising compliance costs (keeping the tax system simple), administration costs (getting value for Inland Revenue funding) and the very substantial economic costs taxes impose (minimising distortions caused by taxes). As discussed in later chapters, the New Zealand tax system seems to rate highly in terms of its low economic costs (chapter 3), and its simplicity and value for Inland Revenue funding (chapter 5). We should nevertheless look at the tax system from a wider perspective, in terms of its impact on business and the economy. The tax system is one of the main interactions business has with government. If the government wants to create an environment in which business can grow and that attracts investment and entrepreneurship, the tax system must be responsive and easy to deal with. The certainty of the tax system and the speed with which that certainty can be obtained can be as important to business as the actual rate of tax being levied. A good tax system is essential for a competitive economy. A good tax system is not just a matter of good tax policy. It also requires a good tax administration. Both need to be working well to help business grow and make New Zealand attractive to investors. Good tax policy is not simply just what can be read in a textbook. Policies need to take into account administrative constraints and, if possible, policies should enhance administrative agility. Good tax policy needs to have good tax policy processes so that the concerns of the private sector are taken into account and so that legislative anomalies are corrected. These issues are discussed in chapter 2. A good tax administration is not simply one that has the lowest cost. A professional, approachable, effective and efficient tax administration is an investment in a good environment in which to undertake business. What this means for Inland Revenue as it responds to the changing and increasing expectations of government and society is explored in chapter 5. New Zealand is increasingly likely to be competing with low-tax jurisdictions for investment. So long as New Zealand continues to provide a high level of government services, it is likely to be unable to compete by undercutting the rates of tax levied in these countries. What we can do is ensure our tax policy and administration are as competitive as possible. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 15 of 57 Building trust and confidence in the public sector Building trust and confidence in the public sector is important to any government. Inland Revenue is one of the most frequent ways that all parts of society deal with the core public sector. In the year to June 2008 Inland Revenue handled 16.34 million contacts with the public, including letters, phone calls and visits to Inland Revenue offices. It is vital for our reputation and the reputation of the public sector generally that those contacts are handled well. If the public loses trust and confidence in Inland Revenue, it is likely to impact on all parts of the public sector. Inland Revenue deals with substantial amounts of public funds and protects the confidential data of individuals, families and businesses. People rightly expect that Inland Revenue staff maintain the highest possible standards of behaviour. Two important vehicles for reinforcing the commitment to integrity are the staff Code of Conduct and Inland Revenue’s Charter, which makes broad commitments about the standards and approach people can expect when they deal with Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue has important responsibilities to protect the confidentiality of the data it has on people and businesses under the secrecy provisions of the Tax Administration Act. Just as building trust and confidence in Inland Revenue is dependent on maintaining a good tax system, so maintaining that trust and confidence is necessary to make the tax system work well. If the public does not trust Inland Revenue, the integrity of the tax system and the voluntary compliance necessary for a good tax system will be undermined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 16 of 57 2. The policy development process Since 1994, tax policy has been developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. The process was introduced to ensure better, more effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals, such as their revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs, and economic and social objectives. Another key feature of the process is that it builds external consultation and feedback into the policy development process, providing opportunities for public comment at several stages . The tax policy consultative process In the years immediately preceding the introduction of the Generic Tax Policy Process, the public usually had its first look at proposed tax reforms when a bill introducing them was tabled in Parliament. Likewise, the opportunity to express views on proposed changes usually came only when the select committee considering the bill invited submissions, which was almost too late in the process if affected taxpayers did not agree with the general concept of a given reform. Major tax initiatives are now subject to much greater public scrutiny at key stages in their development – from broad proposal through to post-implementation review. As a result, we now have more opportunity to develop workable options for reform by drawing upon information provided to us by the private sector early in the process. Consultation throughout the policy process also contributes to greater transparency of policy-making, allowing the government to set out the policy objectives of proposals and the trade-offs it has made in developing them. Therefore it helps the public to understand the rationale behind government policy proposals. It also helps to ensure that when Ministers are making policy decisions they are fully informed of different views on their merits. The consultative process cannot, of course, be used for changes that require immediate action to protect the revenue base. It would not be possible to move quickly and, at the same time, to engage in wide consultation on changes to close a recently identified loophole, for example, or to block a scheme that is losing the country hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. To judge from mainly anecdotal evidence, New Zealand’s tax policy consultation process has an excellent reputation internationally. For example, the Australian Board of Taxation in its 2007 review of Australia’s tax consultation system, which included a multi- country survey of how consultation is handled elsewhere, made extensive reference to New Zealand’s consultative process. In the course of the review, representatives of the Board visited New Zealand to talk with officials and the private sector about our process, “as it was identified as a best practice model on several occasions” in its survey. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 17 of 57 Within New Zealand, the Generic Tax Policy Process has been so accepted as the way to make tax policy that tax professionals and professional associations have come to expect it to be used, as a matter of course. Indeed, the Australian review cited as one of the main success factors in the operation of the New Zealand system, “a view shared by key officials and external stakeholders that they all need to contribute constructively in the best interests of the New Zealand tax system and economy. This leads to cooperation, assistance and frank dialogue both on parties’ contribution to consultation and other processes.” Although consultation on tax policy can take several forms, the most common medium is the government discussion document. Its use has increased considerably over the last decade, with 13 consultation papers published in 2006 and 11 papers published in 2007, compared with four papers in 2000. 4 The increasing opportunity for consulting on tax policy has resulted in growing numbers of individuals and organisations making submissions on proposed changes, whether they are set out in a discussion document or introduced in a taxation bill. The downside is that submissions are becoming increasingly technical and detailed, which in turn makes the process lengthier and requires greater policy, private sector and parliamentary resources. Developing a new tax policy work programme One of the first steps for the new government in relation to the Generic Tax Policy Process is to develop a three-year revenue strategy that is effectively linked with the government’s economic strategy. The next stage is the development of a rolling tax policy work programme that gives effect to the revenue strategy. At present, the work programme covers an 18-month period. Developing the work programme involves scoping broad policy proposals and prioritising and sequencing the development of initiatives. We also look at budgeted resource requirements, the time needed to develop, legislate for and implement initiatives, and modes of consultation and communication to be employed throughout the process. This stage of the Generic Tax Policy Process culminates in a joint report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and the Treasury to the Treasury Ministers and Minister of Revenue that suggests a policy work programme. Once approved, the work programme becomes a detailed tax policy agreement between the government and the two departments. The work programme is generally made public, attracting strong interest from the tax and business communities, to whom it provides greater certainty and an understanding of the government’s direction in tax policy. 4 http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 18 of 57 As time passes and the work programme is updated and new policy initiatives are added to it, there is a risk that there will be more items on the programme than can be progressed during the 18-month period. It is therefore important that when items are added to the work programme, existing priorities are reviewed to ensure that the government’s expectations across the work programme are met. The work programme in recent years The focus of the tax policy work programme over the last three years has been on tax reforms that reflected the government policy goals of increasing productivity and growth, making Zealand businesses more competitive internationally, and increasing personal savings and improving the way they are used. Work programme priorities over the last three years have included: • Business Tax Review, which resulted in a reduction in the company tax rate from 33 percent to 30 percent, an associated reduction in the tax rate for certain savings vehicles, and introduction of the R&D tax credit. • Review of New Zealand’s international tax rules for outbound investment, to align them more closely with those of most other countries. The first stage of the review resulted in the proposed exemption from domestic tax of the active income of controlled foreign companies, which was the central feature of the taxation bill that was before Parliament when it rose for the general election. • Measures to reduce tax-related compliance costs for businesses. • Tax changes intended to make it easier for people to save for retirement and to remove any bias against saving through collective investment vehicles, which resulted in new tax rules on offshore portfolio share investments, the advent of PIEs – or portfolio investment entities, and the introduction of KiwiSaver. • The personal tax cuts and complementary changes to Working for Families tax credits announced in Budget 2008. • Tax changes to promote charitable donations, which included the removal of tax rebate limits on charitable donations by individuals and the deduction limit on donations by companies and Māori authorities. • Modernising tax rules, which included completion of the 15-year rewrite of income tax law. • Maintaining and negotiating double tax agreements with other tax jurisdictions. The development of a new work programme will be a top priority for both Ministers and officials. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 19 of 57 Setting priorities The work programme must balance the resource requirements of the Minister of Revenue’s main tax policy initiatives against those required for initiatives introduced by other Ministers – for example, in the areas of social policy or sector assistance – which can have substantial tax implications. It must also allow room to meet private sector concerns when tax legislation is identified as causing unintended practical problems. Finally, there is an increasing demand for tax policy resources to be allocated to international tax areas such as OECD work and trans-Tasman tax matters, a reflection of the increasing extent to which New Zealand must take into account international tax trends in setting its domestic rules. Given the many areas of government policy that have tax implications, the complexity of tax issues and the finite resources available to deal with them, it is essential for Ministers to discuss and set out their tax policy priorities. Since many areas of government raise important tax policy issues, the allocation of tax policy resources is likely to affect the government’s ability to use tax to pursue non-tax policy objectives, especially in economic development and social policy. It is therefore desirable for Ministers in those areas to be clear about the implications for the tax policy work programme of policy developments in their portfolios. Budgetary fiscal rules The tax policy work programme can also be affected in very important ways by any budgetary fiscal rules the government decides to adopt. In setting fiscal rules, it is essential to ensure that fiscal discipline on expenditure applies in an equal way to initiatives that would reduce tax revenue – otherwise there is an incentive for expenditure initiatives to be packaged as tax initiatives. That said, unless governments want to increase tax collections over time, it is important not to focus solely on the size of the government deficit or surplus. If reducing the size of the deficit or increasing the surplus is seen as “good”, there is a danger of tax reductions being seen as inherently bad and tax increases being seen as inherently good. But of course there are two ways of closing a deficit or increasing a surplus: either by increasing taxes or by cutting back on government spending. As well as making judgements about the size of the government deficit, governments need to make decisions about whether they want to see taxes and government spending rise or fall over time, and these decisions should be incorporated into the budgetary fiscal rules. The tax policy implications of any fiscal rule proposals, therefore, must be considered before such rules are adopted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 20 of 57 The legislative programme The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which was introduced in July 2008, lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament on 3 October, in anticipation of the general election. Reforms proposed in the omnibus bill included: • reform of New Zealand’s international tax rules; • raising a number of tax thresholds to reduce compliance costs for smaller businesses; • clarifying the law to ensure employer payments for relocation and overtime meal allowances are tax-free; • reform of the taxation of the life insurance business; • introduction of a voluntary payroll-giving system for charitable donations; • updating the petroleum mining tax rules; • strengthening the definitions of “associated persons” in income tax law; and • most of the necessary taxation rules to support emissions trading. Ministers will need to consider its reinstatement when the new Parliament convenes. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 21 of 57 3. Taxes, distortions and the New Zealand tax system Taxes are needed to finance government spending. At the same time, raising revenue creates administration and compliance costs. Moreover, taxes distort economic behaviour, which can inhibit economic performance in many different ways. Although almost all taxes can distort economic behaviour, personal and company income taxes are likely to be particularly distorting. Taxes on labour income can influence decisions about whether people move into paid market work or not. They can also reduce entrepreneurship and discourage people from working as long or as hard as they otherwise would or from moving to a more challenging job. In extreme cases, they may even affect decisions on whether or not an individual chooses to continue to reside in New Zealand. High and increasing marginal rates may reduce incentives to take risks or upgrade qualifications. All of these distortions can affect productivity and growth. Income taxes can also affect the amounts that people save and, if different forms of savings are taxed differently, the types of savings being undertaken. This can lower economic welfare by causing people to save in intrinsically less valuable ways – in other words, in ways they would not have preferred had there been no tax biases. In theory, taxing investment income need not be very distorting if income is taxed at modest rates over a very comprehensive economic income base. In practice, difficulties such as measuring how assets actually fall in value and reflecting these in tax depreciation allowances mean that it is simply not viable to tax all forms of investment income neutrally. Moreover, certain forms of investment income such as imputed rental income (the benefits that people get from owning and living in their own houses) are not taxed either in New Zealand or in most other OECD countries. This means that taxes on personal and corporate incomes can distort decisions on the types of investment the country undertakes and thus lower capital productivity. Even if all forms of investment income were taxed neutrally, taxes would tend to discourage investment, reducing New Zealand’s stock of plant and equipment and buildings, reducing labour productivity and growth. These distortions will be higher the higher income tax rates are. A recent OECD paper, “Tax and Economic Growth”, published in July 2008, ranks different taxes and argues that corporate and personal income taxes are likely to be most distorting. The OECD measures distortions in terms of their effects in reducing long-run GDP per capita. This is a partial measure because taxes can be distorting without necessarily affecting GDP per capita. For example, in a small open economy such as New Zealand’s, taxes on savings could, in theory, have little effect on GDP but still be quite distorting. However, even if we were to measure distortions more broadly, it is still likely that corporate and personal income taxes will be particularly distorting because of difficulties associated with defining and taxing income comprehensively. Not only are income taxes likely to be the most distorting taxes, it is income taxes where most pressures appear to be emerging. International tax competition is putting downward pressure on New Zealand’s company tax rate. However, a company tax rate that is less than the higher rates of personal tax creates opportunities for people to use companies to shelter their incomes from higher rates of personal tax. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 22 of 57 New Zealand’s main sources of revenue are personal income tax (48.7 percent of tax revenue), GST (19.7 percent of tax revenue) and company income tax (15.3 percent of tax revenue), as illustrated in figure 2.

This allows lower tax rates and a more efficient tax system than would otherwise be possible. In this chapter, we present some data on the New Zealand tax system and benchmark it against the tax systems of other countries. The data presented below suggest that: • New Zealand’s tax to GDP ratio is towards the middle of the range for OECD countries. • New Zealand collects a relatively high proportion of its revenue through taxes on income and profits. • New Zealand has relatively broad bases for GST, company tax, and income tax. This allows substantial amounts of tax to be collected at rates which, with the exception of the company tax rate, are relatively low by OECD standards. • New Zealand’s taxes appear to have relatively low compliance costs. • Despite New Zealand having a relatively low top personal marginal tax rate by OECD standards, many households face much higher effective marginal tax rates as a result of the abatement of Working for Families tax credits and other income-contingent measures. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 23 of 57 Taxes in New Zealand and other OECD countries Tax as a percentage of GDP In 2007, New Zealand’s tax collections amounted to 36.0 percent of GDP.

Many non- OECD countries have lower ratios – for example, the 2007 tax to GDP ratios for Hong Kong and Singapore were 13.8 and 14.8 percent respectively. 5 Tax mix Compared with other OECD countries, New Zealand collects a relatively high proportion of its taxes on income and profits, as shown in figure 4. This is in large part because New Zealand has no social security tax. Australia, which has no social security tax, and Denmark, which has a negligible social security tax, are the other two countries collecting the highest proportion of taxes on income and profits. Often social security taxes will fall on employees and may have similar effects to an income tax in distorting labour supply decisions. 6 Since social security taxes, unlike income tax do not tax investment income, they do not distort savings decisions. 5 Source: Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department and Statistics Singapore. 6 If an individual benefits directly from his or her own social security contributions, these taxes may be less distorting than taxes on labour income. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 24 of 57 Figure 4: Tax revenue of main headings as percentage of total tax revenue (2007) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 New Zealand Denmark \* Australia \*\* Japan \*\*\* Canada United States Norway Switzerland Iceland Finland United Kingdom Ireland Sweden Belgium Luxembourg Italy Spain \* Korea Germany Austria Netherlands ^ Mexico ^^ Portugal Hungary ^^^ Czech Republic France \* Greece \*\* Turkey Poland \*\* Slovak Republic Income and profitsSocial securityGoods and servicesPropertyPayrollOther Note: Countries are ranked from highest income and profits tax revenue as % of total tax revenue to lowest. \* The total tax revenues have been reduced by the amount of capital transfer.

This means that it collects substantial revenue despite (at least in the cases of GST and personal income taxes) having relatively modest statutory rates of tax. For example, New Zealand’s GST rate is 12.5 percent. Setting aside the United States, which has no GST, this was the sixth lowest statutory rate of tax in the 29 other countries in the OECD. Nevertheless, in 2006 7 our GST collections amounted to 9 percent of GDP – the fourth highest level of tax collections (see figure 5). 7 This is the latest year for which data is available across the OECD. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 25 of 57 Figure 5: Value added/goods and services tax rates and revenues (2006, in percent) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Iceland Denmark Sweden New Zealand Portugal Finland Poland Norway Ireland Austria Hungary Slovak Republic Netherlands Belgium France Greece United Kingdom Czech Republic Spain Germany Italy Luxembourg Turkey Korea Mexico Australia Switzerland Canada Japan United States \* VAT/GST rateVAT/GST revenue as % of gross domestic product Note: Countries are ranked from highest VAT/GST revenue as % of gross domestic product to lowest.

This is the revenue collected from GST as a proportion of the revenue that would be raised if the standard rate of GST were applied to all consumption. C-efficiency varies from a ratio of 32.6 percent in Mexico to 93.5 percent in New Zealand, as figure 6 shows. It is clear that the breadth of the New Zealand base allows substantial amounts of GST to be raised at a relatively low rate.

Source: OECD New Zealand New Zealand has a relatively low top personal marginal tax rate of 39 percent. In 2006, this was the eighth lowest top marginal rate for the 30 OECD countries, as shown in figure 8. Despite this, New Zealand raises 14.9 percent of GDP in personal tax collections, which was the third highest amount of tax collected in the OECD. One reason for New Zealand’s relatively high level of personal income tax collections may be that New Zealand’s top personal marginal rate applies from a relatively low level of income (at a multiple of 1.4 of the average wage). Many countries have higher multiples than New Zealand. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 27 of 57 Figure 8: Personal income tax rates and revenues (2006, in percent) 1.5 0.5 2.7 3.4 1.6 3.1 1.3 4.4 4.9 0.8 2.6 1.3 1.0 2.7 1.4 1.1 1.9 2.0 10.6 3.5 1.2 4.6 1.8 2.8 1.7 1.8 0.3 1.4 1.4 1.1 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Denmark \* Sweden New Zealand Iceland Finland Belgium Canada Australia Italy United Kingdom Switzerland United States Austria Norway Ireland Germany France \* Luxembourg Netherlands Spain \* Hungary Portugal Japan Greece Poland Czech Republic Korea Turkey Slovak Republic Mexico \*\* Top marginal all-in personal income tax ratePersonal income tax revenue as % of gross domestic product Note: Countries are ranked from highest personal income tax revenue as % of gross domestic product to lowest. \* The total tax revenues have been reduced by the amount of capital transfer.

The effective marginal tax rate measures the proportion of an additional dollar of income that is lost either through taxation or in some other way such as abatement of social assistance or income-contingent payments or repayments. It is effective marginal rates rather than statutory marginal rates which will determine incentives to work and save. It is also gaps between these effective marginal rates and the tax rates in companies, trusts and other entities that will influence the tax integrity pressures that are discussed in chapter 4. 9 The indicator measures the time to prepare, file and pay (or withhold) three major types of taxes: corporate income tax, value added or sales tax, and labour taxes, including payroll taxes and social security contributions. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 29 of 57 One reason for effective marginal tax rates to exceed statutory marginal tax rates is the Working for Families tax credits scheme. This scheme provides support to families, reducing their net tax paid (as shown in figure 10) for the year ended March 2007. The dark solid line in the graph shows the net tax paid by an individual or a family with no children with a single income earner. Net tax is positive, which means that income taxes paid exceed transfer payments received. The light dotted and solid lines show the net tax paid by single income families with, respectively, one and three children. Net tax paid is negative for lower income families, which means they receive larger transfer payments than the amount they pay in income tax. Many people will be paying negative amounts of net tax. It is essential to ensure that those who end up bearing the tax burden are not discouraged from increasing their earnings by working longer or more productively. Assistance rises with the number of children, which is why the light solid line is lower than the dotted lines which is lower than the dark solid line for incomes below the levels where assistance is fully abated. At incomes above about $12,000, net tax paid rises faster for families with children than for individuals or families with no children. This is because of higher effective marginal tax rates for families as a result of reduced transfer payments. Figure 10: Net tax paid (year ended March 2007, non-beneficiaries, in dollars) -20,000 -10,000 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 0 4,0008,000 12,00016,00020,00024,00028,00032,00036,00040,00044,00048,00052,00056,00060,00064,00068,00072,00076,00080,00084,00088,00092,00096,000 Income Net tax paid Single earner with no childrenOne-earner couple with one childOne-earner couple with three children Source: Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue People receive larger transfer payments than they pay income tax. Income taxes paid exceed transfer payments received. The effective marginal tax rates, taking account of statutory tax rates, ACC, and the abatement of Working for Families tax credits, are shown for the year ended March 2007 in figure 11. There is a short period where the minimum family tax credit, a component of the Working for Families tax credits package, is abated dollar for dollar in addition to ACC levy being collected. This leads to an effective marginal tax rate of 101.3 percent \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 30 of 57 between incomes of $10,660 10 and $21,658. For higher income families with either one or three children, Working for Families tax credits abate at 20 cents in the dollar for incomes over $35,000. This makes the effective marginal tax rate 20 percentage points higher than the statutory marginal rate and ACC levy. For both types of families, the effective marginal tax rate is 54.3 percent (a statutory rate of 33 percent together with a 1.3 percent ACC levy and 20 percent Working for Families tax credits abatement) until income reaches $60,000. After that, the effective marginal tax rate rises to 60.3 percent until Working for Families tax credits are fully abated.

For example, additional income can lead to the requirement to make higher student loan repayments or child support payments. Whether these should be considered as part of effective marginal tax rates is an open question. For example, as student loans are repaid, borrowers have the benefit of a reduced student loan, reducing the amount which must be repaid in the future. However, there is some tax element because making student loan payments now rather than in the future will increase the present value of these payments. Similarly, some parents paying child support may do so willingly because of the benefits their children receive. In this case, child support should not be seen as a tax. On the other hand, for those who do not choose to pay child support voluntarily these obligations are very much a tax. There are also other measures which abate with income, including childcare assistance and accommodation supplement. These are not taken into account in figures 11 and 12. Thus, these graphs provide a lower bound on possible effective marginal tax rates. Benefit abatement has not been taken into account in figure 11 but has been taken into account in figure 12, which shows the numbers of taxpayers on various effective marginal tax rates above 30 percent. 10 This assumes only one adult. Incomes below $10,660 are unlikely to qualify for the “full-time work” requirements of the minimum family tax credit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 31 of 57 Above $60,000, there are significant numbers in the 40 to 50 percent range, although many are only just in this range because of a statutory marginal tax rate of 39 percent plus an ACC levy of 1.3 percent. 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 35,000 40,000 45,000 50,000 55,000 60,000 65,000 70,000 75,000 80,000 85,000 90,000 95,000 100,000 105,000 110,000 115,000 120,000 Over 120k 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 140,000 160,000 Number of people Income (in dollars) Figure 12: Effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) distribution for people with EMTRs over 30 percent (year ended March 2007, excludes student loans, child support, child care assistance and accomodation supplement) 60 % or more \[ 50 % to 60 % ) \[ 40 % to 50 % ) \[ 30 % to 40 % ) EMTR faced Source: Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue In total there are around 3.3 million individual taxpayers. Of these about 668,450 people are on tax rates of 30 to 40 percent, 383,250 on tax rates of 40 to 50 percent and 167,250 on tax rates above 50 percent. Including other income-contingent measures such as student loans, child support, the accommodation supplement and childcare allowance would increase the numbers facing higher effective marginal tax rates. It is clear that for some people there will be limited incentives to earn additional income, which may discourage productivity and growth. As discussed further in chapter 4, New Zealand’s high effective marginal tax rates also create scope for tax planning. But this is not an easy problem to resolve. Reducing these high effective marginal tax rates either requires providing less assistance, which could hurt many who are not well off, or involves abating social benefits more slowly, which could be costly. Nevertheless, the high effective marginal tax rates need to be taken into account when considering future reforms. It seems generally desirable to avoid adding to effective marginal tax rates and, where possible, to lower them. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 32 of 57 Figure 13: Effective marginal tax rates (year ending March 2010, non-beneficiaries, in percent) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 0 4,0008,000 12,00016,00020,00024,00028,00032,00036,00040,00044,00048,00052,00056,00060,00064,00068,00072,00076,00080,00084,00088,00092,00096,000 100,000104,000108,000 Income One-earner couple with three childrenOne-earner couple with one childSingle earner with no children 101.4 % 13.9 % 22.4 % 34.4 % 54.4 % 40.4 % 60.4 % Source: Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue Figures 11 and 12 reflect numbers on effective marginal tax rates in the past (year ended March 2007).

Policy challenges Compared with other OECD countries, New Zealand has broad bases for personal and company income and for goods and services tax. With the exception of the company tax rate, which is still relatively high by OECD standards, New Zealand has relatively low marginal tax rates. This helps the New Zealand tax system to be relatively robust and operationally efficient. Nevertheless, pressures identified in our 2005 Briefing to the Incoming Minister remain. First, globalisation is continuing to put downward pressure on the company tax rate. Despite New Zealand’s reduction in its company tax rate from 33 percent to 30 percent, it remains higher than most OECD countries. The incentives this creates for multinational companies to stream profits away from New Zealand means that New Zealand may be forced to cut its current company tax rate in the future. Second, domestically, there continues to be evidence of individuals using companies and trusts to shelter personal income from higher rates of personal tax. The greater the gap between the company tax rate and higher marginal income tax rates, the greater the benefits of doing so. There are a number of possible ways of achieving greater consistency in personal taxation, and this chapter concludes by considering some of these options. Globalisation and downward pressure on the company tax rate In the years beginning 1 April 1986 and 1987, New Zealand’s company tax rate was 48 percent, which was around OECD norms. This is shown in figure 14. 11 In the year beginning 1 April 1988, the company tax rate fell to 28 percent and was raised back to 33 percent a year later, where it remained until the year beginning 1 April 2007, with a reduction to 30 percent from 1 April 2008. The company tax rate was relatively low compared with rates in other OECD countries from the late 1980s until about 2000. However, since the mid-1980s there has been a downward trend in company tax rates around the world and, even given New Zealand’s recent cut in its company tax rate, New Zealand’s rate is now above the average for OECD countries. There are concerns with having a company tax rate that is too high. In particular, despite New Zealand’s relatively broad company tax base, there will always be considerable difficulties in measuring income accurately. There will also be biases between business income taxed at the company rate and forms of income which are untaxed, such as the imputed income that people earn through owning and living in their own houses. Reducing the company tax rate will tend to minimise these biases. 11 The data reported for New Zealand is the tax rate applying at 1 April of a given year. For example, the tax rate in 2006 is the tax rate applying for the year beginning 1 April 2006. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 34 of 57 Figure 14: Historical trends in statutory company tax rates (in percent) 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 198519871989199119931995199719992001200320052007 AustraliaEU-15 averageNew ZealandUnited StatesOECD average Source: OECD A high company tax rate may also discourage innovation, constrain inbound investment and make New Zealand an unattractive place to base a business, all of which have the potential to reduce productivity and growth. There is, however, an offsetting economic consideration. Taxing company income is a way of taxing foreign residents on the profits they make through investing in New Zealand. If foreign-owned firms are making economic profits from their investments in New Zealand, reducing the company tax rate could potentially lead to higher economic profits for their shareholders with little effect on investment. In this case, much of the benefit of a company tax cut could go to foreign residents. Levying replacement taxes on New Zealanders may make New Zealand as a whole worse off. There is another important consideration. A relatively high company tax rate can make it attractive for multinational firms to stream profits away from New Zealand and into lower tax countries. This might be achieved by firms “thinly capitalising” the New Zealand operations (by financing as much of their New Zealand activities as possible by using debt rather than equity) or by transfer pricing arrangements where New Zealand entities pay as high as possible prices and charge as low as possible prices on transactions with associated companies overseas. There are measures to prevent transfer pricing and thin capitalisation but these are not completely effective. Incentives to stream profits from New Zealand overseas will tend to arise when the New Zealand company tax rate is higher than in other countries, or when the other country has an imputation system. As countries around the world have responded to these sorts of “tax-competition” pressures, company tax rates have fallen. However, as company tax rates have fallen across the world, company tax revenues have not declined as a proportion of GDP. Between 1985 and 2006 the average company tax rate fell from 48.3 to 28.1 percent but company tax collections increased from 2.6 to 3.9 percent of GDP (columns (1) and (4) in table 2). This is in large part because many countries have broadened their corporate income base while reducing their company tax rates to protect company taxation as a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 35 of 57 source of revenue. We believe that maintaining a broad and neutral income base is an important element in future New Zealand tax reforms. The OECD experience is compared with that of New Zealand and Australia in columns (2)-(3) and (5)-(6) in table 2. In New Zealand and Australia, the increase in company tax as a percentage of GDP has been much larger than the OECD as a whole. In recent years a major reason has been the strong growth in corporate profitability in both countries. Part of the reason may also be the base protecting effects of our imputation schemes. No doubt part of the reason is also that our company rates are less than our top personal rate, which has created incentives for incorporation to shelter income from higher rates of personal taxation.

A particular area of concern for New Zealand is Australia’s imputation scheme and the fact that 54.5 percent of foreign direct investment into New Zealand at 31 March 2008 was from Australia. 12 At present, the Australian and New Zealand company tax rates are aligned at a rate of 30 percent. However, Australian parent companies with Australian shareholders have an incentive to stream profits from any New Zealand subsidiaries back to the parent companies. This is because the shareholders will receive imputation credits (called franking credits in Australia) for Australian but not for New Zealand company taxes. One way to overcome these pressures would be mutual recognition of New Zealand imputation credits and Australian franking credits. If this were to proceed, it would involve a major step towards the creation of a single economic market in Australia and New Zealand. It would involve Australia and New Zealand cooperating to do what is in Australasia as a whole’s best interest rather than competing on tax. New Zealand has responded to an invitation by Australia to make a submission on mutual recognition to the Australian Future Tax System Review. 13 Decisions from the review not only on 12 Source: Statistics New Zealand. 13 http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/files/other/2008-10-nz-submission-mutual- recognition-afts.pdf \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 36 of 57 mutual recognition but also on tax reform more broadly are of strong interest to New Zealand because of our highly integrated economies. Globalisation and international capital mobility can constrain choices in other ways. It is now increasingly less realistic for New Zealand to adopt tax policies without examining tax settings in other countries. For many years New Zealand stood out in the OECD as the only country to attempt to tax the foreign-sourced income of its overseas subsidiaries as this income accrued while allowing credits for foreign taxes. Other countries had rules which exempted foreign active income or taxed it with foreign tax credits but only when profits were remitted. The upshot was that firms wanting to expand internationally had incentives to relocate to other countries such as Australia with more generous offshore tax rules than New Zealand. It is no longer viable for New Zealand to impose rules which encourage dynamic firms which are expanding internationally to relocate to other countries. As a consequence, the International Tax Review 14 has recommended that New Zealand introduce an exemption for active offshore income. Robustness of personal tax system Policy pressures also arise because individuals are able to shelter personal income from higher effective marginal rates using companies, trusts, portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and other savings vehicles. This can erode confidence in the fairness of the tax system and undermine voluntary compliance. In terms of statutory tax rates, New Zealand has a progressive tax system, with increasing marginal and average tax rates. It also has a targeted social assistance programme under which assistance is abated as income rises, leading to high effective marginal tax rates at middle income levels for programme recipients. Information derived from tax collection data since 1999 indicates that there has been considerable rearrangement by taxpayers to minimise tax and avoid the full application of the apparent progressivity of the tax system. From 1 April 2000, the top personal marginal rate was increased from 33 percent to 39 percent. At the same time, the company tax rate, trustee tax rate and tax rate applying to many other savings entities were kept at 33 percent. This provided scope for those on the top marginal rate to shelter income in these entities. From 1 October 2007, the new PIE rules were introduced, with a top rate of 33 percent on income earned in these entities. From the year beginning 1 April 2008, the company tax rate, the top tax rate on PIEs and the tax rate on other widely held savings vehicles were all reduced from 33 percent to 30 percent. These tax rate changes have increased incentives and opportunities for individuals to structure their affairs in ways which reduce their exposure to higher personal marginal tax rates. However, this change is too recent to be picked up in the data. 14 http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/archive.php?year=2007&view=563 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 37 of 57 The aggregate income of individuals in different income bands for the years ended March 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2007 is shown in figure 15. The year 1999 was before the introduction of the 39 percent top marginal rate for incomes above $60,000 and at that stage there was no spike of taxpayers clustered at $60,000. Since then there has been an obvious spike. For example, in 2007 there is much more income attributable to people earning between $59,000 and $60,000 than for other $1,000 bands of income on either side. This is evidence that those who would otherwise be facing the top marginal rate are using companies, trusts and other savings vehicles to shelter income from higher rates of personal tax.

Source: Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue There are a number of ways of escaping higher marginal and effective marginal tax rates by diverting income to lower-taxed companies or trusts. For example, by earning income through a company, an individual can ensure that income is taxed at a 30 percent rate so long as profits are retained within the company. While income may eventually be taxed at the shareholder’s marginal rate when dividends are paid, there can be substantial benefits from tax deferral if income is retained for a number of years in a company before it is distributed as dividends. The saving can be permanent if the dividends are trapped in a trust and trustee tax of 33 percent is paid. A sharp increase in the amount of imputation credits held by closely held companies (see figure 16) suggests there is significant deferral of dividend payouts for such companies in order to avoid the higher personal marginal tax rates. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 38 of 57 Figure 16: Excess imputation credits (year ended March) 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 19971998199920002001200220032004200520062007 Imputation credit account closing balance (in dollar millions) Closely held companiesWidely held companies Unit trustsQualifying and loss attributing qualifying companies Consolidated groups and other \* The data for the year ended March 2007 is at August 2008 and incomplete. Source: Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue It is clear that there has been rapid growth in excess imputation credits of closely held companies following the increase in the top personal marginal tax rate to 39 percent in 2000. These pressures are likely to increase with the recent reduction in the company tax rate to 30 percent. Annual growth rates in numbers of individuals in different income bands are shown in figure 17. Over the period from 1999 to 2007 there has been very slow growth in the numbers of taxpayers on higher incomes relative to growth rates in earlier years. Again, this seems likely to be evidence of greater income sheltering.

Source: Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue In summary, current tax rules provide considerable scope for taxpayers to use companies, trusts and other entities to shelter their income from higher rates of personal taxation. There is continued evidence that they are doing so, and recent reductions in the company tax rate and the capping of tax rates for PIEs have increased both the pressure and the opportunity for tax sheltering. This raises concerns about whether it is fair for some taxpayers to be able to escape higher personal rates while others, such as salary and wage earners, face the top statutory tax rate. It also raises efficiency concerns. It is not without cost for people to set up tax-efficient entities. From the nation as a whole’s perspective, the resources spent doing so is a source of economic waste. There is also uncertainty among taxpayers and in Inland Revenue about when escaping higher marginal tax rates becomes unacceptable tax avoidance. This is costly for businesses and puts pressure on voluntary compliance. It also makes it difficult for Inland Revenue to fulfil its mandate of reducing compliance risk. Currently, significant Inland Revenue and taxpayer resources are being applied to disputes in this area, and it is a current priority area for Inland Revenue’s compliance programme. This issue would appear to be best resolved by possible legislative options, discussed later, which could enhance the integrity of the tax system. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 40 of 57 The current tax provisions raise questions about the achievement of the objectives underlying the current statutory personal tax rates and thresholds, and other measures which also affect effective marginal tax rates (such as abatement of Working for Families tax credits, student loans, and child support). These all apply if individual income is received and taxed as personal income, but not if earned in other ways such as through companies, trusts or PIEs. Moreover, there are considerable differences between the tax treatments of sheltered forms of income. For example, an individual can set up a company which derives business income. If the individual earns income through the company, this will be taxed at the company rate of 30 percent so long as it is retained in the company. It will be subject to a wash-up tax on distribution and taxed at the individual’s marginal rate so long as shares are held directly. If the individual is on a 39 percent rate and all income is distributed, income would end up being fully taxed at the 39 percent rate. For this person there may be little tax sheltering benefit from using the company if most of the profits are distributed soon after they are earned by the company to finance personal consumption. However, there are more tax-efficient options. If, instead, a trust is interposed between the individual and the company so the shares in the company are held by the trust in which the individual is a beneficiary, the company’s profits will once more be taxed at 30 percent so long as they are retained in the company and not distributed. On distribution to the trust, however, these can be taxed as trustee income at a final tax rate of 33 percent. In this case, if all income were distributed to the trust, the company’s income would end up being taxed at a 33 percent tax rate. Trusts are increasingly being used in this way not only to avoid the top marginal tax rate but also to avoid the higher effective marginal tax rates brought about by other social policy measures. If passive forms of capital income are being earned, it may be more attractive for these to be earned through PIEs or other forms of widely held savings vehicles where 30 percent will be a final rate of tax. Thus, the current tax rules often treat passive forms of capital income more favourably than active forms of income which, at least on distribution, may face a higher tax rate. It is hard to see a good reason for passive income being taxed at lower rates than active business income. Table 3 shows the rates at which income would be taxed on accumulation and on distribution if those on different marginal tax rates are earning income in different ways. The table allows for the possibility of individuals on a range of effective marginal tax rates of 59 percent (a 39 percent statutory marginal tax rate plus abatement of Working for Families tax credits at 20 cents in the dollar), 39 percent, 33 percent and 21 percent. We assume that the distribution policy is tax efficient. For example, if income is earned through a trust it may either be taxed in the trust as trustee income (at a rate of 33 percent) and then distributed to beneficiaries or else be distributed to beneficiaries and taxed in their hands at their marginal rates. Thus, tax-efficient distribution means the tax rate will be 33 percent for a beneficiary on a 39 percent marginal rate and 21 percent for a beneficiary on a 21 percent marginal rate. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 41 of 57 There is considerable variety in the way that income is taxed, depending on exactly how the income is earned.

Accumulated at entity level Case study – PIEs The practical implication of taxing income differently can be illustrated by considering the new PIE rules. Individuals saving through PIEs are taxed at a maximum rate of 30 percent on their PIE income. These rules have been designed to support government goals of promoting saving. But this means that those on the top (39 percent) marginal rate and those on higher effective marginal tax rates as a result of social taxes are much better off earning passive capital income through PIEs than they would be if they earned the same income directly. This has meant that it is now common practice for banks and other financial institutions to offer so- called cash PIEs. This involves a bank setting up a PIE for those who would otherwise be earning interest income, so a final top marginal rate of 30 percent can be offered. Even if PIEs are a more costly and less efficient vehicle, the tax benefits they offer can result in them being used ahead of standard savings accounts. The current tax treatment may also create arbitrage opportunities. Suppose an individual who has $100,000 of income taxed at a rate of 39 percent wishes to shelter this income from the 39 percent rate. By borrowing $1 million at a 10 percent interest rate and lending this through a PIE at a 10 percent rate, the individual might claim a deduction for $100,000, which would reduce the personal tax liability by $39,000. The PIE income would only bear $30,000 of tax. Thus, a scheme like this might be used to generate a net tax benefit of $9,000. At this time it is doubtful that any of these schemes could be struck down as tax avoidance without much greater clarification of that term by the courts. Exact borderlines are uncertain. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 42 of 57 In summary, the current tax system suffers from a lack of consistency. Economically equivalent income streams are taxed at different rates, depending upon the arrangements under which the income is earned. The effect of the inconsistency calls into question a government’s progressivity goals. If these are expressed by the statutory marginal tax rate schedule, people’s ability to shelter income will undermine these goals and frustrate the desired targeting of other programmes (such as the Working for Families tax credits, student loans or child support) administered through the tax system. If, on the other hand, the government’s progressivity goals are adequately achieved by having a top marginal rate of 30 percent, it is difficult to see why this opportunity is not available more broadly. Of course, governments must juggle a wide variety of conflicting considerations when considering how best to tax different forms of savings entities. Moreover, New Zealand is clearly not alone in having different forms of savings taxed in different ways. But our inconsistency in tax treatment leads to unfairness as taxpayers in similar economic circumstances are treated differently. It undermines the integrity of the tax system and could reduce confidence in the fairness of the system. Over time this may reduce voluntary compliance. Finally, it adds to the costs of administering the tax system and to taxpayer compliance. Enhancing the integrity of the tax system Greater consistency in the tax system can be accomplished by reducing the variation in tax rates facing taxpayers in different situations. There are a number different ways in which tax rate variation could be reduced. Decisions by government are required in a number of areas: • A fundamental decision, which frames other decisions on the rate structure, is the level of the company tax rate relative to the tax rates (particularly the top rate) on personal income. • The second decision concerns the marginal tax rates to be applied at different personal income levels and, as discussed below, possibly on different types of income. • The third addresses the degree to which social programmes are to be targeted using abatements, which add to effective marginal tax rates over their abatement ranges. • Finally, decisions are required on the more detailed tax policy changes necessary to give effect to the government’s general decisions on the three issues above. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 43 of 57 Choices by government on tax rates applied to the income of individuals will reflect views on the level of revenues required to fund government spending programmes, the appropriate progressivity of the tax system, and efficiency considerations related to the effect of taxation on economic behaviour. Choosing the appropriate company tax rate reflects a balance of revenue objectives, international considerations and the structure of taxation of domestic income. Finally, the tax system must be administratively feasible and should strive to minimise compliance costs to the extent possible. It is important to decide on a future direction for the tax system, so that tax changes are compatible with the government’s longer-term goals. Ideally, the tax system should be flexible so that it can evolve as New Zealand’s needs change. For example, fiscal demands may change as there are economic or demographic changes, or particular tax parameters may need to be calibrated as a result of external factors – for example, a lowering of the company tax rate in response to continued reductions in company tax rates internationally. Fiscal considerations and administrative constraints may mean that consistency needs to be attained progressively over a number of years rather than in “one hit”. In particular, the administrative constraints discussed in chapter 1 mean that it would simply not be viable to implement a major structural change to the tax system in the near future. There is no one best way of balancing these considerations, and different countries have chosen different routes to achieving their objectives. These are summarised below as a guide for possible approaches to lessening the current inconsistency in marginal tax rates. Conceptually, tax rates could be made more consistent in three different ways: • By means of overall rate alignment – which is essentially a return in structure to New Zealand’s pre-1999 alignment of the company, trusts and top personal tax rates. • Through adoption of integrity measures – which would introduce provisions to prevent current tax deferral and diversion possibilities, while retaining a company tax rate lower than the top personal tax rate; with deep company tax rate cuts this could be considered similar to the Irish approach. • Through use of a split rate system – which would introduce a lower tax rate applied to income from capital that aligns personal tax rates on investment income with the company tax rate, but continues to tax labour income at full personal tax rates; variations of this approach have been adopted by the Nordic countries. These approaches are offered to illustrate the potential ways in which the integrity concerns facing the New Zealand tax system can be addressed. If the government wishes to increase the consistency of the tax system, an important question is whether one, or perhaps a combination, of these approaches is the best direction for future reforms. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 44 of 57 Overall rate alignment This approach would reduce the higher marginal tax rates on personal income to restore alignment of the top personal marginal rate with the current company tax rate. The trustee tax rate would also be reduced and aligned with the company tax rate and top personal marginal rate. This would remove incentives for many individuals to use companies or other entities to shelter income from higher personal tax rates. Changing personal tax rates does not remove incentives for individuals with abating Working for Families tax credits to use companies or other entities to shelter income from higher effective marginal tax rates. In the context of a rate alignment approach, incentives could be eliminated by removing the 20 percent abatement of the credits by making them universal. But there are other reasons for high effective marginal tax rates (such as abatement of the accommodation supplement, childcare subsidies, student loan repayments or child support). These may make it difficult to prevent all forms of tax sheltering in companies or other entities. Aligning rates is the most direct way to increase the coherence of the tax system. The major questions raised by the approach relate to cost, targeting and future flexibility. In the absence of other changes, this approach would have a significant revenue cost. For example, reducing higher marginal tax rates to 30 percent would cost in the order of two billion dollars a year. One option would be to align rates at a higher tax rate than the current company tax rate of 30 percent. Given the international tax pressures noted above, this does not appear to be a feasible option. Alternatively, the change could be part of a shift in the tax mix away from direct taxes and toward indirect taxes by increasing the rate of GST to make these cuts in personal tax rates more affordable. Cutting the top personal tax rates and/or introducing universality of the Working for Families tax credits reduce the progressivity of the tax system. Locking tax rates together also reduces the flexibility of the tax system. There will be continued international pressures for company tax rate cuts. In this event, either tax rate inconsistency would be reintroduced into the rate structure or the government would need to make difficult compromises between responding to international pressures and achieving its domestic objectives for the level of revenue required, the tax mix and the distribution of the tax burden. In the longer run, this direction of reform may require the government to consider either reductions in the rate of growth of government spending or an increase in the rate of GST. Increasing the rate of GST could allow personal tax rates to be lowered in a way which has little effect on progressivity while increasing the coherence of the tax system. Rate alignment is by far the simplest approach for resolving current integrity concerns, as it does not require the introduction of new mechanisms or distinguishing between different types of income. It would eliminate the incentive for taxpayers to enter into complex and wasteful arrangements to avoid the higher marginal tax rates. The revenue cost of this approach could be mitigated by spreading rate alignment over a number of years. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 45 of 57 Reductions in marginal tax rates and taxing income the same regardless of the form in which it is earned would increase the efficiency of the tax system and reduce disincentives to work and save. Integrity measures The second approach would introduce measures to make higher marginal tax rates stick. There are a number of possible mechanisms to achieve this result, the choice of which would depend upon concerns about complexity and the difference in the company and top personal tax rates. A mix of mechanisms would also be possible. At the simplest, this would involve increasing the trustee tax rate and top PIE rate to align these with the top personal marginal tax rate. Assuming that international pressures prevent an increase in the company tax rate, companies could still be used to defer tax on personal income, but the imputation system would be relied upon to levy the personal tax rate when the funds are eventually distributed. If further company tax rate cuts occur in the future, this option becomes less viable, especially in the absence of a capital gains tax on the sale of shares. A more comprehensive, but more complex approach, one adopted by a number of countries, would introduce anti-deferral mechanisms to be applied to investment income earned in closely held companies and private trusts. These mechanisms can take various forms, but essentially apply the top personal tax rate to investment income earned by closely held companies. Accordingly, such income would need to be distinguished from ordinary business income. Special rules might also need to apply to widely held New Zealand or Australian companies, which generate substantial amounts of interest or other forms of investment income. The latter approach is more complex than simply adjusting the PIE and trust rates, but eliminates the potential for deferral by using companies, as illustrated in table 3. It allows more flexibility to accommodate future company tax rate cuts or for changes in the progressivity of the personal tax system. In the absence of other measures, it would raise tax revenues and realise the progressivity implicit in the personal marginal rate schedule. It would also raise marginal tax rates for activities that have been structured to minimise tax, increasing tax rates on savings and work. These impacts could be reduced and efficiency improved if the funds raised were used to provide more general tax rate reductions for all taxpayers. The choice between these two approaches depends critically on the difference between the company tax rate (current and future) and the top personal tax rate. With a small difference between the rates, the simpler rate adjustment approach would be viable. With a somewhat larger difference, explicit anti-deferral mechanisms for companies may be needed. In Ireland, which has a substantial difference between its 12.5 percent company tax rate and its top personal tax rate of 41 percent, dividends are double-taxed under a classical tax system, there is a capital gains tax and anti-deferral mechanisms are in place. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 46 of 57 Changes to income tax rates would not stop companies or other entities being used to shelter income from the abatement of transfer payments. Making these abatement rates effective would require some form of look-through rules to include income earned indirectly through trusts and companies in the calculation of family income for abatement purposes. Such rules would be complex. Their form and the timing of any changes would need to be considered in light of the considerable resource pressures that exist in administering the current system. Split rate system A third approach would be to tax capital income at a lower rate than labour income. This approach has been implemented more or less comprehensively by the various Nordic countries. The simplest option could provide that income from investments earned by individuals and trusts would be taxed at the company tax rate. On the other hand, labour income would continue to be taxed at full marginal rates. To preserve the integrity of labour income taxation, certain personal service income earned through companies and trusts could be taxed at the top personal tax rate, perhaps through extensions of the attribution rules. However, no attempt would be made to distinguish the labour income component implicit in the business income of a closely held company or unincorporated business, in contrast to what happens in Nordic countries. A more comprehensive, and thus complex, option would be to make a formal distinction between labour and capital income for these businesses. This would involve a very substantial redesign of the tax system as it would require some method for identifying what part of the income of a closely held business is labour income and what part is capital income. Either of these approaches involves a major shift away from the proposition that all types of income should be taxed equally. A key motivating argument for the Nordic countries adopting a dual income tax approach has been the belief that higher marginal tax rates on savings have more deleterious effects on economic activity than taxes on labour. However, it is clear that New Zealand has a highly mobile labour force and high taxes on labour incomes are also likely to be inefficient. These approaches achieve their integrity objectives relating to the taxation of investment income by accepting the company tax rate as the appropriate personal tax rate for such income. Public acceptability of this direction of reform would require agreement that it is fair for those with high levels of capital income to sometimes pay lower amounts of tax than individuals with lower levels of labour income. Problems with the diversion of labour income potentially remain and would need to be addressed as noted above. Concerns with avoidance of the abatement of transfer payments also remain. Moreover, the logic of the split rate system for income taxation, that investment income should be taxed at a reduced rate wherever it is earned, would suggest that investment income would not be included as income for abatement purposes, contrary to the objective of targeting such assistance to those most in need. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 47 of 57 This result underlines the different analytic frameworks applicable to a progressive tax system and a targeted social programme. Either system would increase complexity of the tax system as a result of the line-drawing required between different types of income. In the experience of the Nordic countries, making a formal division of business income into income from labour and capital has been complex and problematic. The system would also link the taxation of personal investment income to the company tax rate, which might be under pressure internationally for cuts that would be at odds with the distributional and revenue objectives of the domestic personal income tax system. The way forward Current inconsistencies in the tax treatments of different forms of income can create horizontal inequity, meaning that people with the same income end up paying different amounts of tax depending on how they earn the income. There is strong evidence that companies, trusts, PIEs and other savings entities are being used to shelter income from higher rates of personal income tax. We are concerned that, over time, this may reduce voluntary compliance and corrode confidence in the integrity of the tax system. At the same time, it pushes people to save in complex and costly ways and creates considerable uncertainty. There are a number of possible directions for reducing inconsistencies. A key decision for the incoming government is the best longer-term direction for reform in this area. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 48 of 57 5. Administrative issues The earlier chapters of this briefing have concentrated on tax policy issues that will be a focus of Ministerial attention. However, an overall well-functioning tax system requires this policy be delivered through Inland Revenue in a cost-effective way that: • meets the government’s revenue requirements by achieving high levels of public compliance with tax law; • meets the government’s requirements relating to non-tax programmes; • helps make the New Zealand economy internationally competitive; and • builds trust and confidence in the public sector. Inland Revenue interacts with New Zealand families, individuals and businesses in a host of ways. Our ability to manage this well influences overall trust in the public sector and helps determine whether New Zealand has a tax environment of low compliance cost and certainty that makes it easy to do business. We therefore place much store on building and maintaining public confidence and trust. We also believe that public confidence in Inland Revenue underpins voluntary compliance; people are more likely to pay the right tax and access the correct entitlements if they have confidence that Inland Revenue acts effectively and with integrity. As noted earlier, Inland Revenue has seen a significant increase in its operations. The department has a strong track record of delivering a growing range of initiatives, including Working for Families tax credits, the R&D tax credit, and KiwiSaver, which has grown at a rate surpassing any projections since its introduction in 2007. These initiatives have significantly increased the number of people with whom Inland Revenue interacts, and added to the variety and complexity of those interactions. This chapter focuses on Inland Revenue’s priorities and the challenges it faces if it is to continue to deliver good service to New Zealanders and provide value for money in implementing the range of policies that governments ask it to do. Delivering an efficient tax administration Government and the public generally expect public agencies to deliver services and manage customer contacts efficiently and effectively – providing services that represent value for their money. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 49 of 57 Internationally, New Zealand is recognised as having an efficient tax system and tax administration. In 2007, the OECD commented that New Zealand’s tax system was regarded as one of the simplest and most efficient in the OECD. Figure 19 compares the administrative costs of collecting 100 units of revenue in OECD countries. 15 In 2004 it cost $0.81 to raise $100 of revenue in New Zealand.

The growth in social policy functions has been a key driver of the overall growth in staff numbers in recent years. Between 1999 and 2008, total staff numbers (measured in full- time staff equivalents) grew by 1,819, from 4,157 to 5,976.

To manage risks and meet future expectations of the government and the public, a transformation of Inland Revenue’s business platform is required. As noted earlier, the nature of our business has changed and we need to change our business practice accordingly. Increasingly, it is not cost- effective to keep delivering a range of social policy functions using a system that was designed for a pure tax function. There is an opportunity in coming years to improve the coherence and sustainability of our business platform. In doing so we need to provide better value for money, make it easier for individuals and businesses to deal with us and equip ourselves to respond quickly and efficiently to new government needs. Inland Revenue’s wide portfolio of functions has increased the diversity and complexity of interactions with the public and resulted in increasingly complex technology systems. The department’s core tax processing system (FIRST) was designed for processing and administering tax requirements; it was not intended to fit social policies which have subsequently been overlaid. In simple language, successive “work-arounds” and “bolt- ons” have been added to FIRST. That is an expensive way to do business and it limits our ability to make changes quickly and simply. To increase voluntary compliance and meet people’s expectations of managing their own tax affairs – in the same way they can access and manage their bank accounts online – Inland Revenue must be able to deliver greater access to more sophisticated e-services. The department has identified what will be required to deliver effectively and efficiently on our outcomes and to be positioned to meet future challenges. This initial work indicated that fundamental change is required over the next five to seven years to manage the risks that the department faces 16 and to achieve increased agility, effectiveness, efficiency and customer service performance. 16 These risks include unsustainable increases in operating costs, a reduced ability to respond appropriately to government initiatives or to environmental changes, a potential for decreased service performance and levels of voluntary compliance, and the failure to collect or disburse revenue. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 51 of 57 Over the coming two years, the main focus will be on standardising and simplifying our business processes, delivering value for money and making it easier for the public to deal with us. A large part of this will be making it easier for taxpayers to access their own Inland Revenue “accounts” and self-manage their interactions with Inland Revenue. From the government’s point of view, it will improve our ability to collect maximum revenue, address the risks our business faces and respond more swiftly to policy changes. The changes made in these areas will help us to develop new capabilities that include: • simplified end-to-end customer processes; • developing more automated processes that remove to an extent the need for manual processing; and • building a comprehensive channel approach that provides for the greater application of e-services. Increasingly, people will be able to access and manage their accounts, requiring less manual intervention from Inland Revenue. During 2008–09, Inland Revenue will be undertaking more detailed financial modelling of the cost-benefits associated with the transformation as we develop individual business cases and proposals. The department will be analysing current and future capabilities to identify what needs to be done to close any gaps between the two. This will also involve agreeing relative priorities and looking for opportunities for policy alignment. Making it easier to contact Inland Revenue Inland Revenue receives a large number of contacts every year and has been facing year-on-year growth in these contacts. A good tax system and public confidence in Inland Revenue makes it essential that people are able to contact us and receive timely and accurate responses. Table 5 indicates the volume of contacts and the growth between 2006–07 and 2007–08 across various contact methods. 2006-072007-08 Correspondence1.81 million3.22 million Counter enquiries218,726233,080 Telephone calls and referrals4.90 million4.67 million Self-help service enquiries5.99 million8.22 million Table 5: Summary of operations (year ended June) Source: Inland Revenue Annual Report 2007 and 2008 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 52 of 57 While there has been a positive growth in the uptake of the department’s self-help services, the high volume of contacts received through call centres is a concern. The large volume of telephone contacts continues to put considerable pressure on the department’s ability to respond to them in a timely fashion. Telephone contacts are increasingly more complex in nature, and it is taking longer to deal with them. Despite these factors, the public continues to express high levels of satisfaction with our call centre performance (83 percent in the September quarter 2008). Like any large call centre operator, Inland Revenue must deal with peaks in calling volumes. In Inland Revenue’s case there are yearly, monthly and weekly patterns of call volumes. To fund call centres to meet maximum levels would be an inefficient use of taxpayers’ money. However, at the same time, people expect their calls to be answered within a reasonable time. Our contact with other tax administrations shows that most are dealing with similar challenges. Like other call centre operators, we continue to explore technology and workforce planning initiatives to improve our ability to meet demand. Inland Revenue is now using a technology called Virtual Hold in its call centres. This allows callers to choose to receive a phone call, rather than wait on line. These initiatives are improving our performance, but we expect the issue to be difficult for some time. Inland Revenue’s response to mitigating this pressure has partly been through supplementing traditional service channels with more self-help services (e-business) options —providing more options for people to obtain information and do transactions with us electronically. At present, they can obtain comprehensive information about many of our products, get information about their KiwiSaver accounts, file various returns electronically, and access a growing range of other services. Even so, the delivery of more information on-line has not led to the anticipated transference away from telephone calls or reduced the public’s reliance on the telephone as a way of obtaining information from us. On the contrary, many people now want to confirm information they have obtained from our website; they may have partially resolved a question through the website but want to call to take the matter to a conclusion. Although the department will continue to make contacts as effective as possible, it is also essential to ensure that effective and realistic contact options are built into tax policy. Simply increasing resources to meet increasing public demand is unlikely to be cost- effective. Policy options to reduce the need for contacts by simplifying and automating online services will need to be considered as part of the transformation of Inland Revenue’s business over the next few years. Increasing voluntary compliance The New Zealand tax system relies on voluntary compliance, and the vast majority of people comply with their obligations within required timeframes. Inland Revenue’s intent is to create an environment which promotes compliance. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 53 of 57 Figure 20: Tailoring responses to degree of non-compliance Through the use of the voluntary compliance model shown in figure 20, Inland Revenue tries to identify people’s attitudes to compliance and tailor its responses to their behaviour according to the degree of non-compliance – from assistance and education through to enforcement. The legislative framework and our public interaction and enforcement activities are directed at encouraging people to meet their obligations voluntarily. We do publicise the consequences of non-compliance, and will continue to use the full force of the law for those who do not meet their obligations. The traditional approach to compliance has been to focus on auditing for non-compliance. We have been moving to a more comprehensive approach incorporating customer education, providing assistance and helping people claim entitlements, as well as the more traditional use of audit enforcement. Inland Revenue operates a Compliance Management Programme through which compliance risks have been prioritised on the basis of evidence, research and analysis. We respond to these risks through integrated, co-ordinated, cross-department activities that are tailored to the needs and behaviour of the groups concerned. The current areas on which we are focussing are: • identifying common errors people make so that these can be reduced by education and assistance programmes; • e-commerce – ensuring people understand that e-commerce trade can give rise to tax liabilities and that a reasonable level of compliance is established with respect to these activities; • assisting employers to meet their tax obligations in areas such as PAYE, student loans and KiwiSaver; • increasing the degree to which taxpayers file on time; • following GST refund claims to ensure that they are appropriate; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 54 of 57 • auditing the extent to which personal income is diverted to companies and trusts to reduce overall tax liabilities; and • auditing property transactions to ensure that tax rules are complied with. By prioritising our compliance activities in this way we can provide more value for our funding and minimise our involvement with low-risk areas, allowing business people to get on with the job of running their businesses. We are also moving to a more transparent approach to compliance. From 2009–10 we plan to publish annually a document outlining the Compliance Management Programme, detailing the compliance risk priorities we plan to focus on. It will set out the patterns of compliance risks that have attracted our attention and how we plan to respond to them, along with activities we will undertake to make it easy for people to comply voluntarily. Working in an international arena The increasing globalisation of international commerce poses particular risks to the tax system. This is particularly true of our company tax base, which forms a significant proportion of our overall revenue. Although Inland Revenue is a small tax administration by international standards, it faces the same risks and challenges that larger administrations do. The pace of globalisation (including opportunities presented by rapid advances in technology) continues to open up new directions for business development here and overseas. But these also increase our tax risks. These include businesses being able to shift tax liability from New Zealand, increased use of technology to shift functions off-shore and the transfer of intangibles to overseas entities. Many of these factors also add more complexity to determining tax liabilities. It is vital that Inland Revenue is equipped to meet the full range of challenges while at the same time making New Zealand an attractive destination for investment and business. The international nature of compliance risks means we need to work closely with other tax administrations and organisations to respond to those risks. Many international businesses operate in New Zealand. We need them to comply with their tax obligations without imposing higher compliance or administrative burdens on them than they experience in other countries. Dealing with these matters often requires a legislative approach coupled with operational approaches to maintain the integrity of our tax system. Just as tax policy is dependent on good delivery of that policy, so good administration is dependent on good tax policy. To the extent to which some of the tensions in the coherence of policy mentioned in earlier chapters can be resolved, this will assist our compliance work. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 55 of 57 Building relationships with large businesses and tax intermediaries Large businesses are especially internationally mobile. To attract foreign investment and be internationally competitive we need to make it as easy and cost-effective as possible for large businesses to comply with their tax obligations. Our experience is that large businesses value certainty from the tax administration. They expect timely and reliable information about their obligations, particularly in areas such as binding rulings. Following discussions with the Australian Taxation Office, its priority rulings approach may present lessons for improving the timeliness of our rulings. In common with other OECD countries, the department is focusing on how to work with tax professionals and tax intermediaries to improve compliance. Part of this focus involves working with the OECD and its tax intermediaries project, which arose from the 2006 Seoul Declaration. In early 2008, the OECD’s “Study into the Role of Tax Intermediaries” report discussed the role of tax intermediaries within tax systems, particularly in relation to unacceptable tax minimisation arrangements. The report also recognised the need to strengthen relationships between large business, tax intermediaries and revenue authorities. It is long recognised that tax intermediaries play a vital role in all tax systems – helping taxpayers understand and comply with their tax obligations in an increasingly complex world. However, some of them also design and promote aggressive tax planning – a role that has a negative impact on tax systems. This is one of the risks revenue bodies have to manage in order to collect the tax due under their tax systems. Aggressive tax planning typically requires the involvement of tax professionals and intermediaries. They represent the supply side of aggressive tax planning, but large corporate taxpayers, tax intermediaries’ clients, set their own strategies for tax-risk management and determine their own appetites for tax risk. They are the ones who decide whether to adopt particular planning opportunities. Taxpayers, therefore, represent the demand side of aggressive tax planning. To maintain the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system and identify and deal with risks to our revenue base, Inland Revenue needs to be as sophisticated as those tax intermediaries. Over the coming year, it will be important to harness lessons from countries (for example, the United Kingdom and the United States) that have large intermediaries actively promoting aggressive tax planning activities. Inevitably, there will be disputes between Inland Revenue and businesses or their agents despite the fact that most business transactions are not tax-driven. As far as possible, businesses want certainty on the tax consequences of their actions and speed in getting that certainty. We recognise the need to work alongside businesses, understand their problems and respond quickly. To that end, we have recently instituted a system to provide businesses with Inland Revenue’s indicative views of how tax law affects transactions, where this is possible. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 56 of 57 Developing our people The department operates in a tight labour market, competing with other government departments, the private sector and the international labour market to recruit and keep the best people. It is vital to develop our staff to meet existing and emerging needs and to help drive greater levels of agility and flexibility. Planning for future workforce requirements is a strategic priority, particularly in those areas where we are experiencing shortages of specialists (such as tax technical, legal, information technology and human resources). Shortages in these areas and high turnover within the first two years of employment continue to threaten the department’s ability to develop skills and experience in the workforce and to sustain capability. While we compete with the private sector for people, we also actively recruit from private firms. Many of our people at all levels through the organisation have come from private sector roles; they bring highly valued perspectives to the organisation, helping us to understand our business taxpayers better. Inland Revenue must have the best possible recruitment procedures. Recently, the department established a centralised recruitment function for National Office recruitment and appointed a number of preferred supplier agreements among recruitment agencies. We are about to begin a national review of all the department’s recruitment procedures, with the intention of implementing an effective future recruitment model across the organisation. The department also needs to provide strong leadership to maximise the potential and performance of our people, particularly in times of transition and change, and to achieve the behavioural change required to support our evolving operating environment. Maintaining public confidence in the tax administration Maintaining public confidence in Inland Revenue is critical. One of the more important underlying principles of the tax system is voluntary compliance. People more willingly comply with their tax obligations and ensure they are receiving the correct entitlements if we make it easy for them to do so and they know there will be consequences if they break the law. At the core of that model is public trust in Inland Revenue as an organisation that is efficient, effective and committed to acting always with integrity. Inland Revenue has two core documents that seek to uphold trust and integrity. The Inland Revenue Charter – refreshed in 2008 – gives people strong commitments about how we will deal with them, and what they can do if they do not believe they are getting excellent service. Internally, the Code of Conduct, which all staff members must read and sign up to, commits all Inland Revenue people to clear and readily understood standards of integrity. There are strong disciplinary procedures in place, including dismissal, for breaches of the Code of Conduct. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2008 Page 57 of 57 In the most recent community perception research, conducted in May 2008, the department found that a majority of people were either confident or very confident that Inland Revenue does a good job (63 percent of the general public, 68 percent of small business taxpayers and 61 percent of large business taxpayers). In another indication of confidence in the tax system, more than 90 percent agree with the statements “paying tax is the right thing to do” and “by paying tax you are contributing to New Zealand society”. The department also measures satisfaction levels among people who have had recent contacts with us. In the September quarter 2008, the overall satisfaction rating achieved was 81 percent. This was up from 78 percent a year earlier. For coming years, we are developing our survey approach to give us more detailed information about New Zealanders’ perceptions, in line with the State Services Commission’s recently launched Kiwis Count survey, which measures people’s overall satisfaction levels across many government services.
1 MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF FRANKING CREDITS AND NEW ZEALAND IMPUTATION CREDITS A New Zealand Submission to the review Australia’s Future Tax System Summary of Submission This submission presents a case for Australia and New Zealand mutually recognising imputation and franking credits for income tax paid to the other country. It concludes that establishing mutual recognition would improve the welfare of Australia and New Zealand collectively through greater trans-Tasman investment efficiency and increased product market competition. Mutual recognition would also be an important step toward both governments’ shared goal of a Single Economic Market. 1. Introduction On 17 July 2008 the New Zealand Minister of Finance and the Australian Treasurer agreed that the Australian and New Zealand governments were open to the idea of moving towards the mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits. Hon Swan invited New Zealand officials to make a submission on this issue to the review Australia’s Future Tax System. This submission is in response to that invitation. New Zealand and Australia have imputation rules as integral parts of their tax systems. Imputation is a mechanism which provides credits against personal taxes on dividends received by shareholders for taxes paid at the company level. However, in common with standard international practice for such systems, the relief is generally restricted to company taxes paid within the jurisdiction. Foreign taxes are not ‘recognised’ as giving rise to imputation or franking credits. This means that there is a single layer of tax on domestic profits but two layers of tax on foreign-source profits when they are distributed to domestic shareholders. This submission examines the case for New Zealand and Australia to depart from this practice and provide imputation or franking credits to their resident shareholders for the company taxes paid to the other jurisdiction. That is, between Australia and New Zealand there would be mutual recognition for imputation purposes of company taxes paid to the other jurisdiction (‘mutual recognition’). The New Zealand government has been interested in examining the possibility of introducing mutual recognition for some time. We see mutual recognition as the next logical step in enhancing and enriching the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER) and working toward the vision that Australia and New Zealand share of a Single Economic Market. Mutual recognition would provide economic benefits through greater trans-Tasman investment efficiency and increased product market competition in our two economies. The lack of mutual recognition has been a concern for both Australian and New Zealand businesses because of the double taxation of trans-Tasman profits which currently occurs. This reduces 2 economic efficiency as it discourages trans-Tasman investment and can deter otherwise productive cross-border investments. Mutual recognition would remove tax barriers to investment flows in much the same way as CER removed tariffs on flows of goods. The absence of mutual recognition can also distort the form of investment and introduce tax base risk for both countries. There are incentives for New Zealand subsidiaries of Australian parent companies to stream taxable profits to their Australian parent in order to maximise the franking credits available to attach to dividends paid to Australian-resident shareholders. There are similar incentives for Australian subsidiaries of New Zealand parent companies to stream profits to their New Zealand parents. Techniques for profit streaming are complex and costly, and are inconsistent with the source principle of taxation of profits arising from an activity carried on in a jurisdiction. Mutual recognition would remove the incentive for such tax planning by putting the company taxes paid in each jurisdiction on an equal footing for imputation purposes. This would have real economic benefits as it would reduce the deadweight costs of tax planning. It is also likely to increase the stability of our tax systems. Section 2 of the submission provides a background on the highly integrated nature of our two economies and tax systems and on the trade liberalising environment of CER and the SEM within which mutual recognition would sit. Section 3 discusses imputation systems and company tax reform. Section 4 considers the advantages of mutual recognition. Section 5 (together with attached appendices) discusses implementation of a mutual recognition system. Finally, section 6 concludes. We would be happy to meet to discuss any of the issues raised in this submission. 2. The trans-Tasman economic and trade relationship New Zealand and Australia already have highly integrated economies. We take similar approaches to many policy issues and enjoy a high degree of labour and company mobility. There are also many similarities between our tax systems. We are both notable within the OECD for our absence of social security taxation, considerable reliance on company and personal income taxation as a revenue source and our full imputation systems. Both countries have reasonably broad income tax bases. More broadly, Australia and New Zealand are committed to an ongoing process of economic integration. This process builds upon the foundation instrument of the bilateral trade and economic relationship – CER, finalised 25 years ago this year. Since its inception, CER has been based on the principles of comprehensiveness and simplicity. The goal was originally to free up trade in goods (and, subsequently, services) between Australia and New Zealand. Over the last quarter-century, the basic trade liberalising construct of CER has evolved to a more sophisticated, ‘next generation’, vehicle: the Single Economic Market. This is a shared goal of both Australia and New Zealand, grounded in the recognition that integrating both economies more closely will deliver significant benefits to businesses operating 3 domestically, to levels of GDP in both countries, and as a platform for strengthening the way that both countries interact with the rest of the world. As Prime Minister Rudd noted during a recent visit to New Zealand, “the challenge before governments on both sides of the Tasman is to drive forward the creation of a Single Economic Market, building a seamless economy between Australia and New Zealand”. 1 It is against the background of that shared commitment and aspiration that New Zealand makes this submission on mutual recognition. The goal of the Single Economic Market is ultimately to create a seamless trans- Tasman business environment, not one distorted by different incentives or different policy settings in different jurisdictions, by allowing goods, services, and factors of production, including capital and people, to flow freely across the Tasman. CER has already delivered major benefits in terms of trade flows and economic growth in both countries. As Australian and New Zealand Ministers agreed at the 2008 CER Ministerial Forum, CER has played an exceptionally important role in driving a mutually beneficial expansion in trans-Tasman economic links. In the 25 years since CER was signed, New Zealand exports to Australia have increased by 493 percent while exports to the rest of the world have increased by 230 percent. Australia remains by far New Zealand’s largest trading partner, taking, in the year to December 2007, nearly 22 percent of our merchandise exports, worth NZ$8.0 billion, and providing nearly 21 percent of our merchandise imports, worth NZ$8.6 billion. In turn, New Zealand is both Australia’s fifth largest individual export market and Australia’s fifth largest merchandise trading partner overall. New Zealand is Australia’s largest market for exports of elaborately transformed manufactures. As for services trade, in the year to December 2007, Australia imported AUD$2.4 billion worth of services from New Zealand, over 5 percent of Australia’s total services imports. Australia’s service exports to New Zealand were worth AUD$3.4 billion, over 7 percent of Australia’s total services exports. Between 2002 and March 2007, New Zealand’s total foreign investment in Australia grew by 54 percent, to NZ$30 billion, representing the fourth largest investment in Australia. Of New Zealand’s total investment abroad, Australia is the top destination, at 27 percent. Over the same period, Australia’s total foreign investment in New Zealand grew 44 percent, to a figure of NZ$79 billion. Australia is the number one investment source for New Zealand, providing 31 percent of total foreign investment (at March 2007) 2 . Total two-way investment currently stands at NZ$109 billion. Given the breadth and scale of trans-Tasman investment, any distortions associated with the current taxation arrangements are likely to have significant economic costs. The total gains the two countries have derived from CER are likely to be very much greater than those directly associated with additional trade. Additional trade creates competition in product markets in the two countries. Over time it leads to dynamic benefits by encouraging our businesses to be internationally competitive. 1 Speech to Auckland Chamber of Commerce, 19 August 2008. 2 Stats New Zealand statistics (www.stats.govt.nz/store/2007/09/balance-of-payments-and-intl-investment- position-ye31mar07-hotp.htm?page=para004Master) 4 In the same way, the real incentive to make progress towards a Single Economic Market is the opportunities it will clearly provide for businesses to expand and succeed. Enhancing mobility within and across the Australian and New Zealand markets, and allowing those markets to operate more effectively, will increase levels of real income and welfare in both countries. It will also position both countries to deal most effectively with an increasingly globalised world by strengthening domestic productivity, growth and competitiveness. Opportunities therefore remain to enhance the benefits of the trans-Tasman economic relationship. Considerable work is already in train by Australia and New Zealand on the behind- the-border trans-Tasman business environment. This year alone will probably see the conclusion of a renegotiation of the Double Tax Agreement (which will address another important trans-Tasman tax concern, one raised by Australia, namely non- resident withholding tax rates), and the continuation of negotiations on an Investment Protocol to CER with a view to completion by mid-2009. Earlier this year, a new Treaty on Trans-Tasman Regulatory Enforcement and Court Proceedings was signed, a scheme for the Mutual Recognition of Securities Offerings came into effect, and Australia and New Zealand will soon sign an arrangement on retirement savings portability. The extensive ongoing work programme on business law harmonisation is also seeking to foster the most favourable conditions possible for trans-Tasman business. Underlying this work is recognition by both parties that a key part of maximising the benefits to both countries is to ensure that differences in regulations, institutions – and tax policies – do not drive a wedge between the costs or benefits that a business can enjoy in one market over another. It is clear that different treatment of imputation credits does have a distortionary effect on business and investment decisions and given the breadth and scale of trans-Tasman investment, any distortions associated with the current taxation settings are likely to have significant economic costs. Under the Single Economic Market, Australia and New Zealand are committed to minimising such distortions, making the logic of mutual recognition clear. This is not solely a New Zealand concern. Australian companies have raised the fact that in practice they generally cannot fully impute the dividends paid to New Zealand shareholders under the existing trans-Tasman triangular tax rules (signed on the occasion of the 20 th anniversary of CER in 2003) even though they fully frank their dividends to Australian shareholders. The trans-Tasman triangular rules therefore have little practical value to them. 3. Imputation systems and company tax reform New Zealand and Australia are now the only two OECD countries which have retained imputation systems and mutual recognition relies on both countries continuing with their imputation systems. While imputation systems were previously common in Europe, a number of factors, in particular legal decisions by the European Court of Justice, have led to their abandonment in Europe. 5 New Zealand has no current intention to move away from imputation or have tax policy settings inconsistent with imputation but could possibly re-evaluate its options if Australia were to do so. We see a number of attractions in having an imputation system. First, compared to the former classical company tax system, full imputation has a number of desirable neutrality properties. Because of the double taxation of dividends, a classical company tax system can discourage businesses from being set up as companies, even when this is most efficient from a non-tax perspective. So long as the gap between the company tax rate and the top personal rate is not too large, full imputation can largely remove this bias. A classical company tax system may discourage dividend payments and create a penalty on new equity issues. This can tend to lock capital into existing companies. By contrast, full imputation encourages distribution, which makes capital available to new and rapidly expanding companies. A classical company tax system can also create a bias favouring debt relative to new equity. Full imputation removes this bias for domestically-owned companies (although foreign-owned companies can have incentives to be highly geared). A classical company tax system can also discourage individual shareholders on lower personal tax rates from holding shares in their asset portfolios merely because of the tax treatment. Full imputation removes this bias. Second, full imputation provides a ‘belt and braces’ approach to taxation. For companies owned by domestic residents, less company tax implies higher taxes will be paid when profits are distributed to shareholders. This can reduce incentives for tax to be avoided or evaded at the company level. There has been a general reduction in company tax rates around the world. As company tax rates fall overseas, we both face pressures to reduce our company tax rates. One key reason is that as company tax rates fall overseas, multinational firms have incentives to push to the limits in thinly capitalising their domestic operations or transfer-pricing profits away from our countries and into lower-tax jurisdictions. There are methods of countering thin capitalisation and transfer pricing but these are never perfectly effective. Australia’s and New Zealand’s full imputation systems provide some protection against the streaming of profits when firms invest out of our countries and into lower- tax third countries. This is because shareholders gain imputation or franking credits for domestic but not for foreign company tax. This belt and braces approach may be at least part of the reason why both New Zealand and Australia have relatively high company tax collections as a fraction of GDP. At 6.3 percent of GDP, New Zealand has the second highest level of collections, and at 5.9 percent of GDP, Australia has the fourth highest level of collections. 3 This compares with an unweighted average of 3.7 percent for the OECD as a whole. 3 Norway has the highest company tax collections as a percentage of GDP but its figures are inflated by petroleum revenues. 6 Quite apart from the base protection benefits, there is an economic logic in our tax settings. Other things equal, it is not unreasonable for governments to have a preference for firms to pay tax domestically rather than in foreign countries because domestic but not foreign taxes will provide revenue for financing schools, universities, hospitals, infrastructure and other government spending. This is the policy rationale for not recognising foreign taxes on a unilateral basis. However, if Australia and New Zealand mutually recognise imputation and franking credits it would increase the efficiency of trans-Tasman investments, enhance the competitiveness of our two economies and boost the welfare of Australasia as a whole. Full imputation systems clearly become less neutral the greater is the gap between the top personal tax rate and the company rate. If either New Zealand or Australia were at any stage in the future to make deep cuts in its company rate, the question of whether or not to continue with an imputation system might need to be re-examined. There is an open question as to what is the best company tax rate for a small open economy like Australia or New Zealand to levy. Australia and New Zealand will need to independently assess the most appropriate company rate in their jurisdictions. It is well known that in the absence of economic rents, any tax on imported capital is likely to be ultimately borne by domestic factors but in a less efficient way than if they were taxed directly. The argument is that company taxation can reduce the level of foreign direct and portfolio equity into an economy which can lower levels of capital such as plant and equipment. This in turn reduces the productivity of domestic factors such as labour and so reduces wage rates. In theory, wage rates can fall by more than what would have occurred if the government had taxed labour directly. By itself, this provides an argument against any rate of company tax greater than zero. There are, however, some obvious offsetting considerations. A zero rate of company tax would allow an individual’s capital income or income from professional services or from business activities conducted through companies to be sheltered from personal tax. Company taxation helps protect the integrity of the personal tax system. Also for economies such as New Zealand and Australia, economic rents may be important. The large bulk of equity investment into both countries is direct equity and the bulk of this is invested in firms which are producing goods for the local market. In this case economic rents may be important and likely more important than if either of us were a land-locked country in Europe. There may be few location-specific economic rents associated with establishing a factory in Austria if there is the alternative of establishing one in Germany instead. If economic rents are important for foreign direct investment, a large part of any reduction in company tax would flow to foreign investors rather than being reflected in higher levels of plant and equipment. On the basis of the preceding arguments, New Zealand officials have concluded that there appears to be, on balance, little cause for deep cuts in New Zealand’s company tax rate. At current tax rate levels, imputation remains a sensible basis for taxing income earned through companies. 7 One final issue is the question of whether imputation credits should be provided on a unilateral basis for taxes raised in third countries. As was discussed above, there is a logic behind New Zealand’s current tax settings. We do not see a unilateral recognition of foreign taxes for imputation credits as likely to be in New Zealand’s best interest. 4. Advantages of mutual recognition We would see a number of advantages in mutual recognition. These include the following: • greater bilateral efficiency of investment; • greater product market efficiency; • more flexible trans-Tasman investment by small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs); • logical next step in the CER relationship and Single Economic Market agenda; • remove artificial bias for profit streaming; • more stable tax system. (i) Gain in bilateral efficiency of investment At the domestic level, Australia’s and New Zealand’s full imputation system provides an approximation to a full integration ideal under which profits are taxed only once in the hands of the ultimate shareholder. Both imputation systems achieve this but only to the extent that profits are distributed. Both systems, however, intentionally work very much like a classical (double tax) system when a New Zealand resident receives dividend income from an Australian company or when an Australian resident receives dividend income from a New Zealand company. The ultimate result is that the shareholder in the foreign company is double taxed on the same item of income, once in the company’s jurisdiction, and then on the net distributed amount in the shareholder’s jurisdiction. The outcomes are illustrated in the following general calculations of Australian and New Zealand shareholders investing in companies resident in their own or the other jurisdiction, and when tax is paid by the company only in the jurisdiction where it is resident. All company profits are distributed, as shown in Tables One and Two. 8 T ABLE ONE T AX TREATMENT OF AN AUSTRALIAN RESIDENT INVESTING IN AN A USTRALIAN OR A NEW ZEALAND COMPANY Australian company New Zealand company Company income 100 100 Tax paid 4 30 18 Income after tax 5 70 82 Less New Zealand NRWT (12) Cash dividend to shareholder 70 70 Imputation credit 30 Foreign tax credit 12 Assessable income 100 82 Tax on assessable income 46.50 38 Less franking rebate (30) Less foreign tax credit (12) Tax payable 16.50 26 Net dividend received 53.50 44 Effective tax rate 46.5% 56% 4 Based on all income being sourced in the home jurisdiction and fully taxable and allowing for New Zealand’s foreign investor tax credit (FITC) system (this is under review as part of New Zealand’s ongoing review of its international tax rules). 5 Including the supplementary dividend required under the FITC rules. 9 T ABLE TWO T AX TREATMENT OF A NEW ZEALAND RESIDENT INVESTING IN A N EW ZEALAND OR AN AUSTRALIAN COMPANY New Zealand company Australian company Income earned 100 100 Tax paid 30 30 Income after tax 70 70 Less Australian NRWT 0 Cash dividend to shareholder 70 70 Imputation credit 30 Foreign tax credit 0 Gross income 100 70 Tax on gross income 39 27 Less imputation credits (30) Less foreign tax credit 0 Tax payable 9 27 Net dividend received 61 43 Effective tax rate 39% 57% As a result of this double-taxation, trans-Tasman investment flows will need to generate higher pre-tax returns in order to be as attractive as domestic investments on an after-tax basis. Suppose for example, that an investment in Australia earning 10% was marginally profitable for the Australian 46.5% investor. After payment of tax, the shareholder receives 5.35%. A New Zealand investment would need to generate a pre-tax return of 12.2% to provide the same return for the investor. Conversely, suppose an investment in New Zealand earning 10 percent is marginally profitable for the New Zealand 39% shareholder who earns 6.1% net of personal tax on such an investment. Investment in Australia would need to generate 14.2% to provide the same after-tax return. The fact that trans-Tasman investment needs to be generate a higher pre-tax return implies investment inefficiencies. By removing this bias, mutual recognition would increase the productivity of investment within Australia and New Zealand and boost our international competitiveness. In practice, there are a number of factors which will influence the size of any investment distortions. Shareholders are taxed at a variety of marginal rates. Also, if profits are retained for a period this will reduce the effective impost of shareholder taxation. This will affect the size but not the general direction of this trans-Tasman investment bias. The aim of mutual recognition would be to remove these biases. 10 (ii) Greater product market efficiency Both New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, Australia are small economies with more limited product market competition than is likely to be the case in larger economies. Our CER agreement increased product market competition in areas where goods or services can be directly imported from the other country. In many cases, however, product market competition may require a physical presence in a country. For example, competition in the telecommunications industry requires Telstra to have a physical presence in New Zealand and Telecom New Zealand to have a physical presence in Australia. The double taxation of trans-Tasman investment flows can constrain such competition. Mutual recognition would remove this bias and is likely to have a longer-term dynamic benefit through promoting productivity, growth and international competitiveness in both countries. (iii) More flexible trans-Tasman investment by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) We understand that the lack of mutual recognition currently encourages SMEs that invest across the Tasman to be set up in ways which are not intrinsically efficient. For example, taxes may drive New Zealanders to establish an Australian business through a more complex structure rather than as a company even though, taxes aside, a company may be a more efficient form of business organisation. Mutual recognition would remove this bias. (iv) Logical next step in the CER relationship and toward a Single Economic Market Over the years, CER has evolved to focus more strongly on removing barriers behind the border – not just barriers to free flows of goods and services, but also seeking to facilitate flows of factors of production such as capital and people between the two countries and to improve the business environment in which they operate by streamlining regulatory and other burdens – in essence, to create a Single Economic Market. This integration process has generated momentum for further integration. But there is potential to derive even greater benefits from the trans-Tasman economic relationship. The extension of CER to a Single Economic Market model requires deep rather than shallow integration. It is not always necessary to replicate measures in the two countries – differences of circumstances will imply that each country needs to retain flexible policy levers. The goal is to co-ordinate, to the fullest extent possible, economic policies and regulation across both markets 6 , in order to remove impediments to mutually beneficial activities. Mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits is one way that this could be furthered. 6 A fuller discussion of this concept can be found in the (Australian) Productivity Commission research report, Australian and New Zealand Competition and Consumer Protection Regime, Canberra, 2004. 11 By its very nature, a Single Economic Market points to mutual recognition. There are no tax barriers to investment flows among Australian states and territories, or between different regions in New Zealand. Just as it makes sense that income tax paid by a company in Victoria can be credited to its shareholders in, for example, New South Wales because of the efficiency gains that come with treating Australian states as a single market, so it makes sense for trans-Tasman investors in a single Australia-New Zealand market to operate an equivalent system of tax credits. In both cases (whether within a country, or between Australia and New Zealand), the mutual recognition of imputation or franking credits would remove a disincentive for otherwise efficient investment and business transactions – something which the Single Economic Market aims to remove. Mutual recognition would allow the underlying economics rather than artificial tax barriers determine decisions on company location and organisation. This will support that broader strategic goals of the Single Economic Market, such as promoting the Australian and New Zealand markets as a single entity ‘home base’ from which to extend outwards to third markets. Mutual recognition also presents an opportunity to obtain wider benefits in the way New Zealand and Australia interact with the wider international community. The Single Economic Market concept recognises that strengthening and deepening trans- Tasman economic links improves the ability of New Zealand and Australian firms to deal with the risks and opportunities presented by the growing globalisation of business, trade, rule-making and markets. Equally, the Single Economic Market gives both countries a stronger platform to look outward – to strengthen regional (Pacific and Asian) relationships and institutions, and to act as ‘thought leaders’ in the international convergence of rules and norms in many areas. The Australia’s Future Tax System discussion document notes that the purpose of the Australian review is, inter alia, to ensure ‘appropriate incentives for investment and the promotion of efficient resource allocation to enhance productivity and international competitiveness’; and to reduce the ‘complexity and compliance costs’ of the tax system. On both counts, as noted above, these objectives are fully consistent with the broader Australia-New Zealand goals for the Single Economic Market. (v) Remove artificial bias for profit streaming Currently New Zealand’s and Australia’s full imputation systems provide incentives for tax to be paid in the country where the final shareholders of a company reside. This will often provide incentives for a New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian parent company or for an Australian subsidiary of a New Zealand parent company to attempt to stream profits across the Tasman. It may also provide incentives for trans- Tasman firms to attempt to shift profitable functions. These tax-driven behaviours result in real losses to the Australasian economy. Mutual recognition would reduce or eliminate these losses. 12 (vi) Increased stability of tax systems Mutual recognition would be also likely to increase the stability of our tax systems. In the absence of mutual recognition, there can be incentives to stream profits across the Tasman even when our company tax rates are aligned. For New Zealand to remove these incentives for a New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian parent requires us to have a lower company tax rate than Australia. Likewise, for Australia to remove these incentives for an Australian subsidiary of a New Zealand parent requires Australia to have a lower company tax rate than New Zealand. Thus, the incentives this provides are unstable. Clearly, other considerations such as the integrity of the personal tax system may be more important when deciding on our company tax rates. Moreover, to date both New Zealand’s and Australia’s company tax collections have been robust. But it is unattractive for either country to have to question whether undercutting the other’s company tax rate is necessary to protect its domestic company tax base. 5. Implementation and status of arrangements Ways in which mutual recognition can be implemented While New Zealand and Australia have many aspects of their tax concepts in common, including being the only OECD members that have retained imputation, important differences exist. Appendix One examines in more detail whether these differences lead to obstacles to mutual recognition which would require adjustments to the tax systems of either country. These differences can arise in two main areas: specific provisions implementing the imputation mechanism; and, the general provisions of the taxation of income including tax rates and the determination of the tax base. There are important differences in the imputation rules between the two countries, particularly in the approach employed to ensure that imputation credits cannot be diverted from their economic owners. Analysis does not suggest that these differences would prevent the implementation of a mutual recognition arrangement. There are also a number of differences in the tax bases of both countries which may result say in imputation credits being generated on income in New Zealand when similar income, if derived by an Australian company, would not generate franking credits. The converse would happen in Australia in circumstances where the Australian tax base is broader than New Zealand’s. In addition, while currently the company tax rates are 30% in both countries, policy changes may result in the rates shifting out of alignment. While a wide disparity in company tax rates could call mutual recognition into question, analysis suggests that minor differences in tax rates and differences in tax base calculations would not prevent the implementation of mutual recognition. 13 There are two broad approaches to implementing a mutual recognition system. One would be to implement a detailed separate set of rules in each jurisdiction to be applied to credits arising in the other. A second, simpler approach would require New Zealand to treat franking credits as imputation credits, and Australia to deem imputation credits to be franking credits. The second approach seems more practical although there may need to be some adjustments in particular circumstances. As a general proposition, our initial thinking is that eligibility of imputation/franking credits, including which entities pay them, should be determined by the rules of the country in which the dividend payer is located. A dividend with New Zealand imputation credits attached should have the same Australian tax consequences for an Australian shareholder as if the same shareholder received an Australian dividend with franking credits attached, and vice versa for a franked dividend received by a New Zealand shareholder. Status of mutual recognition arrangement Although mutual recognition would be an important extension to the economic integration between our two countries, neither country should be bound to a permanent bilateral commitment to it. This would allow either country to alter its taxation commitments in the future. However, it is standard practice in CER instruments to include a consultation mechanism. The 2003 exchange of letters on the triangular trans-Tasman tax reforms provides a useful example. A similar approach could be used for mutual recognition of imputation credits. Under such a provision, Australia and New Zealand would be encouraged to discuss (but not to seek the other’s approval for) any major changes to tax policy that could impact on the integrity of the mutual recognition arrangement. Consultation should also take place should one country make changes to its taxation law that would impact significantly on mutual recognition, such as, for example, one country unilaterally providing credits for non Australian and New Zealand taxes, or a wide disparity between the countries in the corporate tax rate as a result of a policy change. The best form of consultation is for there to be regular discussions as required between the tax policy officials of both countries. 14 6. Conclusions We submit that Australia and New Zealand mutually recognising imputation and franking credits for income tax paid to the other country would improve the welfare of Australia and New Zealand collectively, and would be an important step towards our shared goal of a Single Economic Market. We recommend that the Australia’s Future Tax System Review support this position, and that it should propose a mutual recognition regime for imputation and franking credits between Australia and New Zealand. 15 Appendix One DEVELOPING A MUTUAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM Comparison of New Zealand and Australia’s tax systems An important consideration in developing a mutual recognition model is for it to be consistent with other aspects of each country’s tax system. We believe that our imputation systems are sufficiently similar for mutual recognition to be a practical option. New Zealand and Australia are now the only two OECD countries with imputation systems. The New Zealand imputation system and the Australian franking credit system are based on broadly comparable principles. (A comparison of the two systems is presented in Appendix Two). To prevent double taxation of profits, both allow resident corporate tax entities that pay local tax to pass on to resident members a credit for income tax paid on profits when they distribute them. In August 2008, the New Zealand government issued the discussion document Streaming and refundability of imputation credits, which was the first step in the review of the country’s imputation system. As stated in the discussion document, there is no intention to change the fundamental nature of the system, but to understand whether the current rules regarding imputation credit streaming cause concerns to taxpayers and to also seek feed-back on the possibility of refunding imputation credits to certain taxpayers. The discussion document acknowledges the attraction of aligning New Zealand’s imputation system with aspects of Australia’s imputation system as much as is feasible and consistent with each country’s policy goals, and it seeks feed-back on the possibility of some movement in the direction of Australian anti-streaming rules. The major substantive differences in our imputation systems appear to be in the approaches to prevent streaming of imputation credits. 7 There are also differences in the types of entities eligible for refunds of excess imputation or franking credits. Australia permits refunds for superannuation funds and some other savings-type entities to individuals and to charities (and certain other similar entities) while New Zealand allows refunds to investors in portfolio investment entities (most superannuation funds and unit trusts) and to Maori Authorities. However, excess imputation credits can be used by other New Zealand taxpayers to offset the tax liability on other income, which has the same effect as refunding the credits. The major difference between the two jurisdictions is their treatment of credits received by charities (and similar entities). New Zealand is considering whether to allow refunds of excess credits to charities. 7 New Zealand’s approach is to have benchmark dividend rules as Australia has, but to prescribe detailed shareholder continuity requirements for companies, and to buttress these with specific anti-streaming rules and prohibitions against certain imputation selling transactions. New Zealand does not currently have rules comparable to Australia’s exempting credit and holding period rules. 16 Designing a mutual recognition system There are two broad options for implementing mutual recognition. Any final arrangement could be a mixture of the two. The first broad approach assumes that imputation credits and franking credits can be made to be completely interchangeable by creating a specific regime for recognizing imputation credits in Australia and franking credits in New Zealand. A precedent exists in the current rules for trans-Tasman imputation, which incorporate Australian companies into New Zealand’s imputation system (and vice versa in Australia). A simpler and preferable approach is for both countries to amend their respective tax legislation so that franking credits and imputation credits could simply be deemed to be the same and to have similar tax consequences in both countries. When a company paid tax in both countries, there should in theory be no need to distinguish between the two when attaching the tax paid as franking credits or imputation credits. The current domestic rules for crediting of taxes to the imputation credit and franking credit accounts would remain. However, creditable taxes would be extended to include both Australian and New Zealand taxes (including withholding taxes, as is currently the case in the trans-Tasman imputation rules). For mutual recognition to proceed, it would not be necessary for there to be complete alignment of imputation systems. There may be a need to align some aspects, such as the date at which the balances are tested, and possibly some of the anti-streaming provisions so that each jurisdiction is satisfied that credits could not be streamed in the other country in a way which is contrary to their own policy. These details could be considered in design of the regime. Differences in both countries tax and corporation law systems should not provide insurmountable problems to implementation of mutual recognition. Some of the issues to consider include: • Tax base differences – we do not consider existing tax base differences to be incompatible with mutual recognition or that there needs to be any special rules to account for them. For example, Australian franking credits may reflect tax paid under Australia’s broad base capital gains tax. New Zealand should allow those credits against a shareholder’s tax liability notwithstanding it does not have an equivalent tax. Conversely, Australia would provide credits in respect of profits that would not be taxable in Australia in situations where the New Zealand tax base is broader. • Definition of dividend – whether a ‘dividend’ to which a credit may be attached be determined under the law of the payer or the recipient. Our initial thinking is that the former is preferable. 17 • Arbitrage – whether any arbitrage opportunities give rise to tax base concerns, such as potentially arises with the different rules on what constitutes debt and equity. Our initial thinking is that the law of the dividend paying country should prima facie determine imputation/franking status of a particular distribution. • Corporate tax rates – mutual recognition should still apply if there was a minor divergence in corporate tax rates (and hence the calculation of credits) from their current equality. A wide disparity, however, could call the mutual recognition arrangement into question. • Transitional rules – for example, treatment of pre-effective date credits versus post-effective date credits. Therefore design issues should not pose major problems following a decision to proceed in principle with mutual recognition. 18 How the mutual recognition would look in practice Example 1: Basic mutual recognition Australian shareholder in New Zealand company Consider a New Zealand company that has an Australian and a New Zealand shareholder, each owning 50 percent of the shares. The company earns $4,000 of New Zealand income, with an effective tax rate of 30%, so $1200 of company tax is paid. The company distributes 50 percent of its net income as shown in Figure One. Figure One: Australian shareholder in New Zealand company New Zealand company 50% distribution $1,400 net income Australian shareholder $700 cash $300 imputation credits and New Zealand shareholder $700 cash $300 imputation credits New Zealand income $4,000 Tax $1200 19 The New Zealand foreign investor tax credit rules provide a tax credit to New Zealand companies which distribute imputed dividends to non-residents. Specifically, a New Zealand company distributing imputed dividends to non-residents will provide a supplementary dividend calculated by multiplying the imputation credits the company would usually distribute to non-residents by a factor of .411806. The supplementary dividend is equal to the amount of the non-resident withholding tax when the dividend is fully imputed. The imputation credit distributed to the non-resident is reduced by the amount of the foreign investor tax credit. The application of the FITC rules would need to be considered in a mutual recognition context. However, for the purposes of illustration, this example will assume that the non-resident withholding tax will be treated as the equivalent of an imputation credit. Under mutual recognition, the $700 cash dividend would therefore be grossed up by the $180 imputation credit and $120 non-resident withholding tax to give a franked distribution of $1000 for Australian tax purposes. The taxation consequences for various Australia investor tax rates and investor types would follow the same consequences as if they received a franked distribution from an Australian company. as shown in Table Three.

The $700 cash distribution, plus $300 franking credits would result in a $100 taxable dividend for New Zealand tax purposes. This is shown in Figure Two.

T ABLE FOUR T HE TAX TREATMENT BY A NEW ZEALAND INVESTOR OF A FULLY FRANKED AUSTRALIAN DIVIDEND UNDER MUTUAL RECOGNITION When the 21% investor is an individual, the $90 excess imputation credits can be offset against the tax liability on other income, and any remaining excess will be carried for offset in future tax years. If the 21% investor is investing in the Australian shares through a portfolio investment entity (PIE) the excess credits are rebated to the PIE for the benefit of the investor. 8 The Australian-resident shareholder would have the same tax consequences as under current law. There need not be any difference in the way the Australian company would comply with its franking obligations. Example 2: Triangular investment Consider an Australian company that has an Australian and a New Zealand shareholder, holding respectively 80 percent and 20 percent of the shares. The company earns $3,000 of Australian income and $1,000 of New Zealand income, in the same unit of currency. The effective tax rate in both countries is assumed to be 30%, so $900 in tax is paid on the Australian income and $300 tax is paid on the New Zealand income. This is shown in Figure Three. 8 For simplicity of comparison, the PIE tax rate was shown as 21%. However, PIEs do not have a 21% tax rate, although they do have a 19.5% tax rate for some investors. 39%% 21% Taxable dividend $1000 $1000 Tax due $390 $210 Imputation credits\* $300 $300 Further tax payable/(refundable or offsettable) $90 ($90) Net $610 $790 Effective tax rate 1 39% 21% 22 The following discussion illustrates the comparative benefits to Australian and New Zealand-resident shareholders of mutual recognition over the current trans-Tasman triangular rules. The first variation looks at the situation of a 50 percent distribution of profits, and the second examines the case of a 100 percent distribution. Table Five table illustrates what would happen under both the current trans-Tasman imputation rules and the proposed reform to the tax payable on the dividends received by the New Zealand shareholder. (Ignore supplementary dividends and non-resident withholding tax for the purposes of the example.) Under the current trans-Tasman imputation rules, the New Zealand shareholder can only claim credit for her pro-rata share of New Zealand imputation credits, that is, $60 (20 percent of $300).

There is also no wastage of franking credits and imputation credits that would incur under that regime. The tax treatment of the Australian shareholder in Figure Three would be no different under either scenario, as he would receive a fully franked dividend, and use the $480 franking credits against his Australian tax liability.

The credits are components of the Working for Families Tax Credits. The requirement for this review was included in the Income Tax Act at the time that the Working for Families package was introduced. The requirement was intended to ensure that the policy objectives of the instruments would continue to be met over time. This report fulfils the statutory requirement, and recommends no changes to the amounts at this time. Based on available evidence, the in-work tax credit appears to be fulfilling its objective of making work pay for families with children, as well or better than it was at the time it was designed and implemented. This report also provides background and contextual information on the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit. The in-work tax credit was introduced from 1 April 2006 as part of the package of Working for Families reforms and is designed to assist working people, especially low to middle income families, to make the most of economic opportunities by improving the returns from work. It supports working-age parents, especially sole parents to take up and stay in employment by providing a boost to the earned incomes of those low to middle income families. This helps to ensure that they are better off in work than on a benefit. The in-work In Confidence PAD2008/138, T2008/1401,REP/08/07/410: Working for families tax credit : a review of the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit Page 2 tax credit requires a direct attachment to work by requiring for the care-giver, and/or the spouse or partner of the caregiver, if there is one, to be normally a full-time earner receiving income from a work activity. In its first year following implementation, the in-work tax credit was received by over 197,300 families. When the Working for Families package was designed it was considered that the relevant consideration for setting future levels of the in-work tax credit would be the change in the “gap” between benefit levels and wages rates for low and middle income families over the preceding three years. As the credit was introduced only from 1 April 2006, the comparisons for the purpose of this review have been between benefit rate and wage movements from 1 April 2004, when the decisions were made, and 1 April 2008. In that period, benefit rates have increased by approximately 12% for sole parents and 6% for couples. By contrast, average earnings have increased by 17% and the minimum adult wage by 32%. In addition, the reduction in personal income tax rates from 1 October 2008 and the concurrent increase in the amounts of the family tax credit will further improve incentives to work. Finally, the focus of the Working for Families evaluation during the second half of this year is also expected to produce highly relevant information on the impact of the Working for Families package on movement into work. Officials therefore consider that it would be premature to change the in-work tax credit at this time and recommend no change. The legislative requirement is for a further review in three years time, by 30 June 2011. The parental tax credit was introduced in 1999 to assist with the initial extra costs faced by a family in the weeks immediately following the birth of a new child. The maximum amount of the credit, which has not changed since its introduction, is $1200. It represents payment for the first 56 days following the birth of a child and is not available to families receiving an income-tested benefit, student allowance, New Zealand Superannuation or veteran’s pension, or paid parental leave. The parental tax credit has been largely replaced by paid parental leave, which is now the government’s main instrument for helping with costs associated with a newborn child. Since paid parental leave was introduced in 2002, there has been a steady decline in the numbers of people receiving the parental tax credit. However, there was a slight reversal of that trend in the 2007 tax year showing that the parental tax credit is still a better option for some families. Ministers have, over the past year, considered a number of options for possible enhancements to the paid parental leave scheme. However, officials understand that the Minister of Labour has obtained approval from the Cabinet Policy Committee to defer further consideration until December 2008. Officials therefore propose no change to the amount of the parental tax credit now, but that Ministers consider it concurrently with their further consideration of paid parental leave in December 2008. This would allow Ministers to provide for any increase in the amount of the parental tax credit to recognise the loss of value over time in the context of their decisions for Budget 2009.

In making its final decisions on the Working for Families package, the government acknowledged that it was important to maintain the effectiveness of the real value of family income assistance over time, both in terms of maintaining income adequacy and the effectiveness of the work incentive measures. However, whereas a link for the family tax credit (formerly family support) to movement in the Consumers Price Index was appropriate, the factors to consider to maintain the effectiveness of the in-work tax credit as a work incentive are more complex. Similarly, any future adjustments to the parental tax credit, as well as considering the value of the credit, must have regard to developments in the provision of paid parental leave. The government therefore decided to provide for a review of the in- work tax credit and the parental tax credit every three years \[CAB Min (04) 13/4 refers\]. 2. The need to maintain the effectiveness of the Working for Families Tax Credits is given effect through mandatory requirements in the Income Tax Act 2007 for periodic reviews of each of the component credits. In the case of the family tax credit, the amount and the abatement threshold 1 are automatically increased from the following tax year when there has been a five percent movement in the New Zealand Consumers Price Index. The annual adjustment of the minimum family tax credit responds to changes in benefit rates. However, a review of the amounts of the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit is required to be undertaken no later than 30 June 2008, and no later than 30 June in the third year after each preceding review. 3. In the case of the in-work tax credit, the current maximum amounts are $3,120 per year for a family of up to three children, with an additional $780 per year for each additional child. The maximum amount of the parental tax credit is $1200, representing payment for the first 56 days following the birth of a new child. 4. Fifteen member countries of the OECD 2 have significant in-work schemes. They range from lump sum payments on entering the workforce, as in Australia, to ongoing allowances, some in combination with an entry payment. 5. This paper presents first the issues for consideration in reviewing the in-work tax credit and, second, the issues to consider in relation to the parental tax credit. In-work tax credit The purpose of the in-work tax credit 6. The three key objectives of the Working for Families package as a whole were to: 1 The abatement threshold applies to all the Working for Families Tax Credits except for the minimum family tax credit. 2 www.oecd.org In Confidence PAD2008/138, T2008/1401,REP/08/07/410: Working for families tax credit : a review of the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit Page 7 • make work pay; • ensure income adequacy; • achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work. 7. The in-work tax credit is the key instrument designed to make work pay within the context of the whole package. It supports working-age parents, especially sole parents, to take up and stay in employment, by providing a boost to the earned incomes of low to middle income families to help ensure that they are better off in work than they are on a benefit. 8. The child tax credit, which was replaced by the in-work tax credit, was a payment to families who met a simple test of not being in receipt of an income tested benefit, a veteran’s pension, New Zealand superannuation, a student allowance or earnings-related compensation (ACC) for more than three months. The in-work tax credit goes further, requiring a direct attachment to work by requiring the care-giver, and/or the spouse or partner of the caregiver, if there is one, to be normally working a minimum of 20 hours per week in the case of a sole parent or, for a couple, a minimum of 30 hours per week between them. The in-work tax credit also extends assistance to several other groups of parents who were not eligible for the child tax credit, including superannuitants, people caring for an orphan or unsupported child and long-term recipients of ACC. 9. The purpose of the in-work tax credit, as stated in the supporting policy paper to joint ministers on 19/3/2004, “Future Directions: Regular Adjustment of Family Income Assistance”, was “to improve replacement ratios, i.e. the gap between income on benefit and income when in work”. The relevant consideration for setting the level of the in-work tax credit is therefore the existing “gap” between benefit levels and wages rates for low and middle income families, and how the size of that gap has moved over the preceding three years. In relation to adjustments, the 2004 paper stated: “Over time, this gap is affected by changes in both benefit and wage rates. Assuming benefit rates are CPI indexed suggests that the rate of IWP should be adjusted in relation to movements of real wages for low- to middle-income earners. That is, when these real wages rise, the need for an IWP to maintain work incentives declines (and conversely, when real wages fall). One option for allowing this to occur is not to index the IWP at all”. Who is receiving the in-work tax credit? 10. Approximately 197,300 families have received the in-work tax credit for the tax year ended 31 March 2007, its first year of implementation. The number may increase slightly as late end-of-year tax returns are filed. The majority of these families had income in the range of $25,000 to $65,000, as illustrated in the following graph. It should be noted that families at the low end of the income range would have met the qualifying hours for less than a full year.

When the Working for Families package was designed, the AOTWE 3 (for the December 2003 quarter) was $736.26. It had increased to $783.98 (December 2005 quarter) by the time the in-work tax credit was introduced from 1 April 2006. It has further increased to $861.55 (December 2007 quarter), an increase of 17 percent from December 2003, or almost 10 percent from the time of implementation of the in-work tax credit. 12. Over that same period the minimum adult wage has increased from $8.50 per hour in December 2003 4 , to $9.50 per hour in December 2005 and $11.25 5 per hour in December 2007. For a 30 hour week (the minimum qualifying hours for the in-work tax credit for a couple), this would equate to an increase from $255 per week to $337.50 per week, a 32 percent increase over the time since the policy decisions were made; or an 18 percent increase since the in-work tax credit was implemented. 13. Social security benefits are, by convention, increased from 1 April each year in response to inflationary movement as measured by the Consumers Price Index in the year to the previous December quarter. 14. At the time the Working for Families policy decisions were made, the rate (applying from 1 April 2004) of sickness or unemployment benefit for a couple with children was $290.72, while the rate for a sole parent with one child was $235.12. 3 Average ordinary time weekly earnings (males and females combined, as measured by the Quarterly Employment Survey conducted by Statistics New Zealand. 4 All amounts are for December quarter for better comparisons. 5 The rate has further increased to $12.00 per hour from 1 April 2008.

From 1 April 2005, concurrent with an increase in the family tax credit (formerly family support), those benefits were restructured to remove the child component in the case of the couple rate, and to remove the component for children after the first child in the case of the sole parent rate. The rates (after tax) were: From 1 April 2005 From 1 April 2006 From 1 April 2008 Sole parent $241.47 $249.10 $263.78 Couple $280.96 $289.84 $306.92 16. It should be noted that the couple rate reduced between April 2004 and April 2005, when the child component was removed from the benefit. The percentage movements in benefit rates have been: • For a sole parent from 1/4/04 6 to 1/4/08 — 12.18% • For a sole parent from 1/4/06 to 1/4/08 — 5.89% • For a couple from 1/4/04 to 1/4/08 — 5.79% • For a couple from 1/4/06 to 1/4/08 — 5.89% Current context/environment 17. As reported to the Cabinet Business Committee \[CBC (08) 262\], the early findings of the evaluation of the implementation of the Working for Families package are that it is having a positive impact and is contributing to movement off benefits into work, particularly for sole parents who already had some labour market attachment. In particular, the in-work tax credit is being received by a large and growing number of families and appears to be fulfilling its objective of making work pay for families with children, as well or better than it was at the time it was designed and implemented. In its first year of implementation, the tax year ended March 2007, the in-work tax credit was received by over 197,300 families. 18. New Zealand has also experienced a significant fall in the number of people receiving the Domestic Purposes Benefit (DPB) 7 since the Working for Families package was implemented, with a particularly rapid fall just prior to and following the introduction of the in-work tax credit.\[CBC (08) 262\] 19. Now that we have data available for a full tax year during which the in-work tax credit was in place, the evaluation of Working for Families in the second half of 2008 will focus on evaluating the Working for Families package against the objectives of making work pay and improving income adequacy. This will include an analysis of the whether people have 6 Benefit rates from 1 April 2004 were known at the time of the original policy decisions and had regard for CPI movement to the December 2003 quarter. 7 DPB numbers fell from 108,768 at the end of August 2004 (just prior to the introduction of the first WFF changes) to 96,480 at the end of August 2007. In Confidence PAD2008/138, T2008/1401,REP/08/07/410: Working for families tax credit : a review of the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit Page 10 responded to the in-work tax credit by moving into or out of work. Interim findings from that work are not yet available. The first phase of analysis should be available to be presented early in 2009, with detailed analysis due to be reported in June 2009, Upcoming changes 20. In Budget 2008, the government announced the following changes to tax rates and the Working for Families Tax Credits from 1 October 2008, and further tax changes from 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011. The changes are relevant to these considerations as they increase the gap between wages and benefits: From 1 October 2008 Income tax on the first $14,000 of income will reduce to 12.5% Income tax on income $14,001 — $40,000 21% Income tax on income $40,001 — $70,000 33% The income threshold at which the Working for Families Tax Credits begin to abate will increase to $36,827 and family tax credit rates will increase to: First child if under 16 years $4,487 pa $86 per week First child if 16 years or over $5,198 pa $99 per week Subsequent child under 13 years $3,119 pa $59 per week Subsequent child 13-15 years $3,557 pa $68 per week Subsequent child 16 years or over $4,651 pa $89 per week 21. The reduction in tax rates and the concurrent increases in the amounts of the family tax credit will further improve incentives to work. In addition, the increase in the income threshold in combination with the increases in family tax credit rates will move entitlement to the in-work tax credit further up the income scale. In Confidence PAD2008/138, T2008/1401,REP/08/07/410: Working for families tax credit : a review of the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit Page 11 Actual in-work tax credit expenditure data 22. Progress figures for the in-work tax credit, subject to late income tax returns being filed, is that it was received by 197,300 families in the tax year ended 31 March 2007. The average amount received was $2,564 per family. 23. Total expenditure on the in-work tax credit was $80 million for the fiscal year ended 30 June 2006, and $461.1 million for the year ended 30 June 2007. Conclusion 24. In the time since the in-work tax credit was implemented, benefits have increased by approximately 6 percent, whereas average earnings have increased by 10 percent and the minimum adult wage has increased by 18 percent. 25. Comparisons from the time that the Working for Families policy decisions were made are complicated by the removal of the child component from main benefits. They are further complicated by the increase in the abatement threshold and the reduction in the abatement rate, concurrent with the introduction of the in-work tax credit from 1 April 2006. From 1 April 2004 to 1 April 2008, benefits for sole parents have increased by 12 percent, but for couples by approximately 6 percent. In that period, average earnings have increased by 17 percent and the minimum adult wage by 32 percent. 26. In addition, the tax changes from 1 October 2008 will increase the take-home pay of working families earning above the threshold for the minimum family tax credit. The incomes of all eligible working families will be boosted further by the increases in the family tax credit. 27. The focus of the Working for Families evaluation during the second half of this year is also expected to produce highly relevant information on the impact of the package on work incentives. Officials therefore consider that it would be premature to consider any change to the in-work tax credit at this time, and recommend no change. 28. The law requires a further review of the in-work tax credit in three years time, by 30 June 2011, and the current situation indicates that this is appropriate. The review would need to consider changes in the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2011. However, officials will assess the extent to which the evaluation findings change the findings of this review and, if necessary, they will report further. In Confidence PAD2008/138, T2008/1401,REP/08/07/410: Working for families tax credit : a review of the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit Page 12 Parental tax credit The purpose of the parental tax credit 29. The parental tax credit was introduced in 1999 to assist with the initial extra costs faced by a family in the weeks immediately following the birth of a new child. The maximum amount of the credit, which has not changed since its introduction, is $1200. It represents payment for the first 56 days following the birth of a child. It is the last of the Working for Families Tax Credits to be abated on account of the family’s income. The parental tax credit is not available to families receiving an income-tested benefit, student allowance, New Zealand Superannuation or veteran’s pension, or paid parental leave. Interface with paid parental leave 30. Since 1 July 2002, working parents who qualify have had the option of choosing to receive paid parental leave instead of the parental tax credit. Initially available to employees for up to 12 weeks, paid parental leave has subsequently been extended to self-employed persons and is now payable for up to 14 weeks of parental leave. 31. Paid parental leave is provided to one parent or shared between both parents where they are both eligible. The paid leave replaces 100% of previous earnings of employees, or self- employed recipients, up to a maximum of $407.36 (from 1 July 2008) of gross earnings a week. Self-employed recipients who make a loss, or earn less than the equivalent of 10 hours pay at the highest rate of minimum wage, will receive the minimum rate of $120.00 gross per week from 1 July 2008. 32. The maximum rate of paid parental leave is adjusted annually at 1 July according to any percentage movement upward in average ordinary-time weekly earnings. The minimum rate of payment for self-employed recipients is adjusted annually, consistent with the highest rate of minimum wage that applies under the Minimum Wage Act 1983 at 1 July each year. 33. The number of recipients of the parental tax credit peaked at 20,900 in the year prior to the introduction of paid parental leave. In subsequent years, the number of families who received the parental tax credit dropped each year, concurrent with annual rises in the numbers receiving paid parental leave. 34. Although numbers are not yet final, the trend seems to have reversed slightly for the tax year ended 31 March 2007. The number of recipients of paid parental leave increased to 27,100 (from 24,400 in 2006); however, the number of families who received the parental tax credit also increased (to 15,600 from 13,800 in 2006). 35. Ministers have, over the past year, considered a number of options for possible enhancements to the paid parental leave scheme. However, officials understand that the In Confidence PAD2008/138, T2008/1401,REP/08/07/410: Working for families tax credit : a review of the in-work tax credit and the parental tax credit Page 13 Minister of Labour has obtained approval from the Cabinet Policy Committee to defer further consideration until December 2008. Actual PTC data 36. As indicated above, the number of families receiving the parental tax credit peaked at 20,900 in the tax year ended 31 March 2002. Numbers declined steadily to a low of 13,800 in the tax year ended 31 March 2006, but the progress figure for 2007 shows a rise again to 15,600. 37. For the 2007 year, at a family income of $45,000 and above, most recipients of the parental tax credit were likely to have two or three children. This suggests that the eligibility criteria for paid parental leave are more likely to be met for the first child for those families. 38. Expenditure on the parental tax credit for the fiscal year to June 2007 was approximately $20.7 million. Conclusion 39. Assuming that the costs of a newborn child have moved approximately in line with inflation, there could be a case for an increase in the parental tax credit of approximately 24 percent or $288. 40. Based on the number of recipients in the 2007 year (15,600), this would have a maximum fiscal impact of approximately $4.4 million. 41. However, officials note that the parental tax credit has not been reviewed since its inception, and that paid parental leave is now the government’s main instrument for helping with costs associated with a newborn child. Officials therefore propose no change to the parental tax credit now, but that Ministers consider it concurrently with their further consideration of paid parental leave in December 2008. This would allow Ministers to provide for any increase in the amount of the parental tax credit, to recognise the loss of value over time, in the context of their decisions for Budget 2009.

The report itself will be discoverable in the proceedings Child Poverty Action Group v The Attorney-General and is concurrently being made available to the Crown Law Office.

Page 1 19 December 2008 Special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Repeal of the research and development tax credit As part of the recently enacted Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008, the research and development tax credit has been repealed from the 2009-10 income year. The tax credit remains in place for the 2008-09 income year. This special report is intended to help claimants who have early balance dates and their advisors to understand the legislative consequences of the repeal. A more detailed account of the legislation will be published in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published in 2008. Background A 15% tax credit for eligible expenditure on R&D activities was introduced in 2007, with effect from the 2008-09 income year. The subsequent repeal of the tax credit was foreshadowed in the 2008 general election campaign. As the explanatory note of the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Bill explained “. . . The Government’s objective in repealing the tax credit is to move towards a broad-based low-rate tax system, which will improve the quality of investment and reduce distortions. Removing the R & D tax credit will also partially fund the reduction in personal tax rates. The Government considers the benefits of reducing tax rates are certain, whereas the benefits of the R&D tax credit are less certain. The Government is concerned that much of the credit will fund R&D that would have occurred in any case, the compliance costs associated with claiming the credit are high and that the credit will be paid out on standard operating expenditure re-characterised as R & D related expenditure.” Page 2 Key features of the legislation Main repeal (sections LH 1 to LH 6, LH 8 to LH 14, and LH 16, YA 1, YB 20(2)(ob) and schedule 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The provisions that determine eligibility for the tax credit and that calculate the value of the tax credit have been repealed from the 2009-10 income year. Expenditure on activities that take place in the 2009-10 or subsequent income years will not be eligible for the tax credit. Example – Effect on research and development projects F Co starts a two-year R&D venture in the 2008-09 income year that includes activities that meet the definition of eligible R&D activities in each year. The eligible expenditure and depreciation loss totals $350,000 in the 2008-09 income year. In that year F Co incurs $100,000 on activities carried out in New Zealand and $250,000 on activities carried out in Australia. The activities continue into the 2009-10 income year, and the firm incurs $300,000 of expenditure on activities carried out in New Zealand that would have been eligible for the tax credit had the credit not been repealed. F Co can claim the R&D tax credit for the eligible New Zealand expenditure and depreciation loss for the 2008-09 income year, but not for any portion of the overseas expenditure or depreciation loss for that year (since more than half of the eligible expenditure or depreciation loss must be incurred in New Zealand). Expenditure in the 2009-10 income year is no longer eligible for a tax credit. Consequential amendments repeal schedule 21 and the definitions of “district health board”, “industry research co-operative”, “listed research provider”, “overseas eligible expenditure”, “research and development project” and “tertiary institution” from section YA 1. For simplicity, the repeal date of the schedule and these definitions is aligned with the last possible date of the 2008-09 income year. Deferred or carried forward expenditure (sections LH 2 and LH 6(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007) Expenditure on activities carried out in the 2008-09 income year that would have been eligible for a tax credit only in a subsequent year will no longer be eligible. Therefore an adjustment made in the 2008-09 income year, under section DB 50 of the Income Tax Act 2007, for unpaid expenditure on employment income will not be eligible when the deferred income is paid out in a subsequent period. Similarly, overseas eligible expenditure that has to be carried forward from the 2008-09 income year because the claimant has insufficient local expenditure on the same R&D project in that year will no longer be eligible for the tax credit. Page 3 Example – Eligible overseas expenditure A New Zealand company, G Co, incurs eligible expenditure of $1 million on R&D activities carried out in New Zealand in the 2008-09 income year. In the same year it also incurs eligible expenditure of $400,000 on R&D conducted overseas on the same R&D project. In the following year it incurs expenditure of $500,000 on work in New Zealand as part of the same R&D project, which would have been eligible for a tax credit had the tax credit not been repealed. G Co can claim the R&D tax credit for the local expenditure in the 2008-09 income year and on any overseas expenditure incurred that year that is equal to 10% of the New Zealand eligible amount, which in this case is $100,000. The other $300,000 of overseas expenditure is not eligible for a tax credit in the 2008-09 income year or in subsequent years. Listed research providers (sections LH 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The provisions that relate to a listed research provider (LRP) will be repealed from 1 October 2009. That will allow claimants, including those with late balance dates, to use the exception to the minimum threshold for eligible expenditure paid to a non- associated LRP. Administration (sections 3(1), 33A(2), 43A(2), 91AAP, and 108(IB) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) Consequent to the main repeal, provisions no longer necessary to administer the tax credit have been repealed. The definition of “response period” in section 3(1) has been amended because the time periods that relate to claims for the 2010-11 and subsequent income years are no longer necessary. A similar amendment has been made to section 108(1B). Sections 33A(2)(db) and 43A(2)(d)(iib) have been repealed from the 2009-10 income year. Section 91AAP is repealed from the date that the provision was initially enacted. A number of administrative and definition provisions have been retained so that the tax credit can continue to be administered for the 2008-09 income year. Future changes Proposed remedial amendments to the R&D tax credit rules in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced in July 2008, will be progressed where they are relevant for the year the tax credit is in force. Page 4 Tax policy officials are also working on possible changes to align the R&D tax credit rules with the policy intent of the concession for the year it is in place in the following areas: • the eligibility of government agencies for the R&D tax credit; • capitalised expenditure; • the treatment of revenue account property; and • administrative issues.

Business tax measures bill introduced
=====================================

A taxation bill introduced today under urgency gives effect to several tax changes announced last week as part of a package of assistance measures for small and medium businesses. The proposed changes include removing the 5% “uplift” that businesses pay on provisional tax instalments for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years, and adjusting numerous tax thresholds.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Dunne: Tax Bill provides relief for SMEs

Tax changes being introduced in Parliament today are an important step towards helping smaller businesses deal with the current economic pressures they are facing, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne says.

Mr Dunne will introduce the Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Bill, which is a package of relief measures aimed at helping businesses' cash flow and reducing the amount of time that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) must spend on their tax obligations.

The tax changes were announced by Mr Dunne and Finance Minister Bill English last week as part of the Government's wider package of assistance measures for smaller businesses, worth more than $480 million over the next four years.

"Because SMEs account for over 95 percent of New Zealand's businesses it's important that the people who operate them can concentrate on the things that will help their businesses weather these difficult times," Mr Dunne said.

"Improving tax cash flow and reducing the number of tax returns, payments and calculations SMEs have to deal with will go some way towards easing the tax burden they currently face, and free-up their time and money so they can focus on the important job of strengthening their businesses against the economic downturn," he said.

Measures announced by the Government and contained in the bill include:

*   The 5% "uplift" rate that businesses pay on provisional tax instalments will be removed for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years, resulting in better tax cash flows for the next two years.
*   The GST payments threshold will be raised to $2 million of GST turnover from $1.3 million, so more businesses will have the cash-flow advantage of only having to pay GST when payment from invoices has been received.
*   The GST registration threshold will be raised from $40,000 to $60,000 of GST turnover, allowing businesses earning less than $60,000 to de-register if they wish.
*   Businesses with business-related legal expenditure of $10,000 or less will be able to fully deduct the expense in the year it was incurred, whether it is capital in nature or not.
*   The PAYE once-a-month filing and payment threshold will be raised from $100,000 to $500,000, allowing more employers to file PAYE returns and pay PAYE once instead of twice a month.
*   The FBT annual filing threshold will be raised from $100,000 to $500,000, allowing more employers to file FBT returns and pay FBT annually rather than quarterly.
*   The value of minor fringe benefits, such as chocolates or flowers, that can be provided to employees without attracting FBT will be raised to $300 per quarter per employee, and to $22,500 a year per employer. This means fewer businesses will be required to return FBT on certain minor benefits provided to employees.
*   Certain tax simplification measures for small and medium enterprises that are part of another tax bill currently before Parliament will be fast-tracked.

The tax relief package announced last week also included reductions to the use-of-money interest rates for underpaid and overpaid tax, and the FBT prescribed interest rate applying to low-interest, employment-related loans. These changes were made by Orders in Council last week.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax Policy Work Programme focused on international competitiveness, retaining revenue

The Government's new tax policy work programme will focus on better positioning New Zealand in the world economy and maintaining tax revenue during the current global economic crisis, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

The Ministers said good tax design had an important role to play in improving New Zealand's international competitiveness and reducing business compliance costs.

"This Government is committed to a tax system that rewards effort, provides better incentives to get ahead and allows our businesses to thrive, both at home and on the world stage," Mr English and Mr Dunne said.

Mr Dunne, who released details of the work programme in a speech today to the International Fiscal Association in Christchurch today, said the continuing reform of New Zealand's international tax rules, to better align them with other countries, was high on the agenda.

"A primary emphasis of the work programme over the next 18 months is on tax policy that will help New Zealand to be more competitive in world markets, while ensuring the necessary revenue flow is not disrupted. This aims to free New Zealand-based businesses from a tax cost their overseas competitors do not face," the ministers said.

An international taxation bill, currently before Parliament, will make changes in this area. The next step will be considering extending the exemption of active income arising from the offshore operation of New Zealand-based businesses to non-portfolio investment funds, branches of New Zealand companies, and financial institutions.

Tax developments in other countries will also flow into the work programme.

"We must keep an eye on international influences such as Australia's current comprehensive review of its tax system, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. We will also be watching downward trends in company tax rates in other countries and looking at any implications for New Zealand," Mr Dunne said.

The work programme will also follow developments emerging from forums such as last month's Job Summit and the Capital Market Development Taskforce.

Job Summit ideas include widening the tax deductions regime to include 'black hole' expenditure - which is currently not covered - on capital raising and new projects and an exemption from approved issuer levy and non-resident withholding tax for widely issued bonds held by non-residents.

Mr Dunne said the work programme also gave high priority to the development of a policy on income splitting for tax purposes. As part of its confidence and supply agreement with United Future the Government has agreed to support income splitting legislation through its first reading in Parliament.

Aligning the personal, company and trustee tax at a minimum of 30 percent is also a medium-term priority of the work programme, but Mr Dunne said that would depend on the country's economic and fiscal position.

SPEECH

### Address to International Fiscal Association Conference 2009  
Hon Peter Dunne, Minister of Revenue  
Christchurch, 20 March 2009

Thank you for inviting me once again to open your conference.

Today, I would like to begin with a few comments about the current economic and fiscal environment, the challenges that poses to revenue collection and to the efficient operation of our tax system, and the thinking behind the Government's new tax policy programme for the next 18 months.

I will also cover some of the major projects on the work programme, which is being released today.

**Economic and fiscal environment, challenges ahead, influences on the tax policy work programme**

What started as a financial crisis has become a serious shock to the international economy.

Estimates of growth continue to be lowered.

New Zealand cannot escape the impact of many of our trading partners being in recession, and we are already feeling it in terms of a shrinking economy and job losses.

The short-term outlook is weak, with GDP in the UK expected to fall around 5 percent.

Similar falls are expected in Germany, Japan and the United States.

There have been even larger drops in GDP, particularly exports, in Korea and Taiwan.

While activity has held up more strongly in China, growth has slipped to 6 to 8 percent, down from 8 to 10 percent.

Even Australia, which was predicted by some forecasters to be able to avoid recession, has now reported negative growth in the December quarter, with a 0.5 percent reduction in GDP.

New Zealand is probably in its fifth quarter of falling GDP, and with the sharp deterioration in the international outlook it is likely that over 2009, the economy will be closer to the Treasury downside estimate of negative 0.2 percent growth presented in December's Economic Update.

A smaller economy means less tax for government.

Tax revenue is weaker than forecast, and the Government's operating balance shows a deficit of $5.5 billion for the seven months to January 2009.

Treasury's downside forecast scenario shows ongoing deficits of 4 to 5 percent of GDP – about $8 billion a year.

While the starting level of government debt is low by historical and international standards, it is expected to grow quickly in the future, in the absence of policy change.

The downside scenario forecast gross debt to reach 38.6 percent of GDP by 2013, with debt projected to increase to close to 80 percent by June 2023, in the absence of any policy changes.

This will clearly constrain tax policy choices.

A major tax give-away is simply not an option in the current environment.

As far as the tax policy work programme goes, there will need to be a greater focus on maintaining revenue flows.

We have not seen such a concern with revenue flows for more than ten years.

I cannot over-emphasise how significant this is.

If revenue flows deteriorate to the extent that New Zealand's sovereign risk increases, all New Zealanders will bear a cost in terms of higher interest rates.

Now, more than ever, therefore, it is essential to have a good, cost-effective tax system – one that collects the necessary revenue efficiently and at minimal cost – meaning low economic costs, low compliance costs and low administrative costs.

Such a system requires a combination of good tax policy and a good tax administration.

Both are essential to the success of the system.

It is not difficult to think of examples of countries with bad tax administrations that have tried to attract investment through tax incentives which no investor will go near.

By international standards, New Zealand is generally regarded as having a good tax system.

It is broadly based and has served us well thus far, while revenue collection has been robust.

By OECD standards, we collect substantial amounts of revenue from our three main tax bases – personal income, company income and GST – at mostly low or moderate tax rates.

One possible exception is our company tax rate, which, despite recently being cut to 30 percent, is still above the median for OECD countries.

Our costs of collecting revenue are moderate and tax-related compliance costs relatively low.

New Zealand taxpayers generally perceive the system to be fair and transparent.

That is essential if we are to ensure the voluntary compliance upon which all modern tax administrations depend.

Our process for developing tax policy – the Generic Tax Policy Process – is often cited overseas as a "best practice" model.

We are good at consulting with each other to make policy that works.

I know there are times when the Government's commitment to the GTTP is questioned.

Let me say this in response: GTTP remains a strong element of our tax policy formation process, and we will continue to take it seriously.

At the same time, there will be occasions when the Government needs to act quickly, and we will do so, but overall, our preference is to work through the GTTP process where possible.

Because we are a small country, we are fast and flexible in terms of policy and administrative response in ways that larger jurisdictions could never expect to achieve.

By international standards, our tax system has a lot going for it, and its strengths stand us in good stead.

That said, many challenges to its effectiveness as a whole, lie ahead.

Some of these arise from the current financial crisis and the pressure it is placing on tax revenue.

Others result from the increasing integration of worldwide commerce over the last decade or so.

Still others arise from a lack of coherence in our policy settings.

Clearly, tax policy cannot be set in isolation from international developments.

The internationalisation of financial and investment markets has made domestic tax settings increasingly important in determining patterns of investment.

With the deteriorating fiscal position, it becomes more important than ever to prevent significant erosion of our revenue base.

Maintaining a robust company tax system is a particular concern for us given the unusual degree to which we rely on company tax.

In developing tax policy, it is essential to have a good understanding of what is happening in the rest of the world, and with our trading partners.

Company tax rates have been falling in other countries.

As this happens, it provides incentives for multi-national firms to stream profits away from New Zealand.

A critical, ongoing concern for New Zealand is whether company tax rates in other countries will continue to fall.

So far, international cuts in company tax rates have largely been financed by expanding tax bases.

But this may become more difficult in the future.

In addition, the international financial crisis is leading to a worldwide reduction in tax collections, which may also make further company tax cuts less feasible.

We need to continually monitor what is happening in other countries as decisions overseas can constrain our choices.

Company tax rates are particularly important for New Zealand because our robust company tax base is crucial to allowing us to keep down our personal tax rates.

Tax policy developments in Australia, our closest economic partner, are of extreme importance to us, given that about 55 percent of foreign direct investment into New Zealand is from Australia, and we have effectively free labour mobility between the two countries.

The current "Australia's Future Tax System" review, chaired by Dr Ken Henry, is said to be Australia's most comprehensive examination of its tax system in over 50 years.

Dr Henry has stated that the review is looking to dramatic and far-reaching changes that may span 20 to 30 years.

Many of the problems Australia faces are relevant to New Zealand, and we will await with interest the review's conclusions and the subsequent response from the Australian government.

However, there are some important differences between the two economies that mean we will not always take the same approaches.

For example, Australia has a relatively high rate of tax on capital income, which may be a problem because of high capital mobility into and out of Australia.

While, capital into New Zealand is likely also to be very mobile, we also have a very mobile labour force, having the OECD's greatest proportion of skilled citizens living abroad.

So that means that New Zealand also needs to be concerned about high tax rates on labour income.

New Zealand's submission to the Henry review, made in October at the invitation of the Australian Treasurer, presented the case for introducing trans-Tasman mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits.

It concluded that establishing mutual recognition would benefit both Australia and New Zealand through greater trans-Tasman investment efficiency and increased product market competition.

That would also be an important step toward both governments' shared goal of having a single economic market.

In a speech to a tax forum in Sydney in February, Dr Henry commented on the possibility of the review recommending a company tax rate reduction as a trade-off for rolling back dividend imputation.

While these are early days for the review, which will canvas a number of potential directions, whatever ultimately emerges in Australia in the form of recommendations relating to imputation, will undoubtedly affect any changes or improvements that we want to make to our own imputation system.

What is happening overseas – in Australia and elsewhere – will also have implications for important areas in our own tax policy such as our continuing review of New Zealand's international tax rules.

I referred earlier to how tax revenue collection is being challenged not only by the financial crisis and developments internationally, but also by a lack of coherence in some of our policy settings.

One of the most significant examples of that can be found in the lack of alignment of the top personal tax rate, the company tax rate and the trustee tax rate.

This provides scope for people to use various entities to structure their tax affairs so as to reduce their tax liabilities.

The clear message resulting from the misalignment of rates is that how much tax you pay is determined by how you earn it.

That is patently harmful to the revenue and to public perception of the fairness of the tax system.

I have long advocated a 30/30/30 alignment of these rates as a simple solution to problems such as individuals using companies and trusts to shelter personal income.

I am therefore pleased that alignment of these rates, as a medium-term goal, occupies an important place in the new tax policy programme – although the economic and fiscal position will clearly limit our ability to reach this goal in the short term unless there is a quick turnaround in economic and fiscal conditions.

I will return to the subject of 30/30/30 alignment in a moment, when I discuss some of the detail of the tax policy work programme.

A very big challenge to the efficiency of our tax administration has arisen over the last decade or so from the strain placed on Inland Revenue tax systems by an ever increasing number of non-tax programmes that are administered through the tax system – programmes such as student loans, Working for Families tax credits and KiwiSaver.

Over recent years, Inland Revenue systems designed for tax collection have been progressively adapted to cope with these and other social policy programmes.

This has resulted in greater systems complexity, loss of agility and efficiency, and increased administration costs.

The Government is considering ways of helping Inland Revenue to improve its ageing systems and has made that a priority on the tax policy work programme, given that an efficient administration is essential to the success of the tax system.

The deteriorating economic and fiscal position calls for a tax system that is as efficient as possible in raising the revenue the Government needs to meet its funding requirements.

**The new tax policy work programme**

Turning now to the detail of the tax policy work programme that is being announced today, I do not think you will find many surprises here.

The goals of the work programme over the next 18 months are:

*   to deliver a broadly based, low-rate tax system that raises revenue in the most efficient manner to support the medium-term goal of 30 percent rate alignment;
*   to respond appropriately to the current economic position;
*   to build a simple and certain tax system; and
*   to support New Zealand as an internationally competitive economy.

The key priority of the tax policy work programme is to support the post-election confidence and supply agreements and the Government's post-election action plan.

National's post-election tax package was introduced and passed into law before Christmas, with personal tax cuts beginning on 1 April.

The two taxation bills before Parliament have also been given a high priority on the work programme.

The Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Bill, introduced under urgency in February, gives effect to several tax measures aimed at making it easier for small and medium sized businesses to manage their cash flows and meet their tax obligations – measures that should be particularly helpful in the current crisis.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back to Parliament on that Bill, and passage is expected in time for the changes to come into force on 1 April.

The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced last July, is still with the select committee.

It introduces a number of major reforms, including changing the way that the life insurance business is taxed, by introducing an integrated framework of changes that include taxing actual term insurance profits.

Of major importance in that bill is the first stage of the reform of New Zealand's international tax rules, a fundamental change in the way that we tax the offshore active income of our controlled foreign companies.

The cornerstone of the reform is the introduction of a tax exemption for active income resulting from the offshore operation of New Zealand-based businesses, which is introduced in the bill.

That will bring our tax rules on offshore income into line with the practice in other countries and help New Zealand-based business to compete more effectively in foreign markets by freeing them from a tax cost that their competitors do not face.

Other reforms in the same Bill include clarification of the law relating to employee relocation and overtime meal allowances, the introduction of a voluntary payroll giving system whereby employees can have their charitable donations deducted from their pay by employers, and changes to strengthen the definitions of "associated persons" in income tax law.

Given the time that has passed since the introduction of this very large Bill, the proposed application dates of the various measures it contains appear to be uncomfortably near for many of those affected and who have to prepare their systems for the changes.

All I can say at this point is that I am aware of the difficulties posed by the application dates as originally envisaged.

As I said earlier, alignment of company, top personal and trustee tax rates is a medium term-goal on the work programme.

That programme contributes to this goal through having a focus on maintaining the tax base to ensure there is sufficient fiscal room to lower tax rates later on.

The next step will be to consider base-broadening and tax design issues as part of developing a revenue strategy, responding to what emerges from the Henry review and considering alignment options for the future.

Setting out clear steps towards alignment would then be a primary focus of the next 18-month tax policy work programme.

Income splitting, or the idea of allowing families with children to split their income for tax purposes, also has high priority on the work programme.

The confidence and supply agreement between UnitedFuture and National includes support for the introduction of a Bill giving effect to UnitedFuture's income splitting policy.

That bill is planned for introduction next year.

A major group of inter-connected projects on the work programme is aimed at making New Zealand more competitive in world markets and will have a clear impact on investment into and within New Zealand.

These projects include the second stage of the continuing reform of our international tax rules, which will consider the extension of the active income exemption to non-portfolio foreign investment funds, branches of New Zealand companies, and financial institutions.

Also under consideration is the introduction of special rules to extend the active income exemption to certain controlled foreign companies and to non-portfolio foreign investment funds that would not otherwise qualify.

In a similar vein, the Government is also looking at the advisability of introducing an exemption from the approved issuer levy and non-resident withholding tax for New Zealand bonds issued to non-residents.

Such an exemption was raised at last month's Job Summit as a way to make bond issues and borrowing from overseas banks easier, thus reducing the cost to New Zealand firms of accessing funds.

We are also examining the provision of a relieving mechanism for non-resident withholding tax on dividends paid to shareholders if those dividends represent distributions of active offshore income.

We plan to consult on these ideas through a discussion document soon.

Submissions on last year's discussion document on whether the law should allow limited streaming of imputation credits to those who can use them and whether it should allow refunds of credits for charities and other tax-exempt entities are still under consideration.

Officials are expected to report on those by mid-year.

What emerges from the Henry review in Australia is likely to have a major influence on how our imputation review proceeds.

If mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits does proceed, we should aim to make our anti-streaming rules as compatible as possible.

Continuation of work on matters relating to the charitable, community and voluntary sectors are a high priority for me, as Minister of Revenue.

This work includes consideration of new tax incentives to encourage charitable giving, having a fresh look at the criteria and a process for approving overseas donee organisations for tax purposes, and considering the refundability of imputation credits for charities as part of the imputation project.

The child support system, especially the area of shared care, is also a high priority for me.

That work, assisted by work being done by the Families Commission, will involve seeking a better understanding of patterns of caring for children in the event of a parental separation.

This should help towards a better recognition of shared care in the child support formula, a very difficult and vexatious subject for those individuals involved.

For that, we will again need to look at developments in Australia, which now has an approach that takes into account both parents' income and accepts a lower level of shared care than our formula does.

The cost of caring for a child when parents separate is also an important issue for consideration.

I anticipate releasing a discussion document on these aspects of the child support system later in the year.

Any emerging recommendations on the child support formula will also have to take into account the work that is being done to modernise Inland Revenue systems.

I referred earlier of the urgent need to improve Inland Revenue systems, which were designed for tax matters and have come under increasing pressure in the last decade or so with the addition of a number of social policy programmes to the department's administrative role.

That has resulted in unnecessary complexity in the administrative systems.

The tax policy work programme therefore supports a number of operational projects that require policy support.

Work will begin with a review of improvements that can be made to the administration of student loans and PAYE.

The last major administrative shake-up of our tax system probably dates back to the introduction of PAYE in 1958 – now over half a century ago.

When one thinks back over all the changes and new policies we have introduced in that time it is in many ways quite remarkable that our tax administration has coped as well as it has done.

It is actually a powerful tribute to the dedication and commitment of Inland Revenue and its people over that time, which I want to publicly acknowledge.

At the same time, the combination of new technology and rapid changes in Inland Revenue's role means we cannot rely on more of the same to work for us in the future, hence the need for some form of transformation of our systems to continue to ensure the efficient operation of our tax system into the future.

While major policy change has been a hallmark of recent years, and will continue to be a focus in the years ahead, it has to be matched by the operational capability to deliver it efficiently, and the improvements I am foreshadowing in the operation of the PAYE and student loans systems will be the first steps in an important ongoing process of change.

These, then, are some of the high priority projects on the new tax policy work programme.

The work programme is not carved in stone, of course and, it is subject to change as conditions and priorities change.

What happens in the economy over the coming months will undoubtedly influence the contents of the work programme.

I have attempted to give you some idea of the thinking and conditions that have influenced the development of the work programme at this point in time, to give you a greater understanding of the Government's direction in tax policy.

The development of the work programme also involves consideration of the resources and time needed for policy development, legislation and implementation, as well as communication and consultation.

It is a complex business with many factors; many variables.

Once again, I thank you and the organisations that many of you represent for the important contribution that you make to the policy development in taking part in the consultative process.

Your contribution is greatly valued in what in many respects is an ongoing "conversation" between us.

I wish you a very successful conference.

Minister seeks application date deferral
========================================

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne is in favour of deferring the application dates of a number of tax reforms contained in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill, many of which come into force on 1 April 2009. The bill, introduced in July 2008, is under consideration by Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee and is not expected to pass before August. Mr Dunne said he had written to the chairman outlining his concerns and asking the committee to give serious consideration to deferring the proposed application dates of a number of reforms.

MEDIA RELEASE

### Dunne: tax reform application dates should be deferred

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne is in favour of deferring the application date of a number of forthcoming tax reforms, many of which come into force on 1 April, although the bill is not expected to pass into law before August.

The changes are part of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced last July and currently under consideration by Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee.

"As 1 April approaches, many business people and their tax advisors are becoming increasingly concerned about the problems of working in accordance with complex tax reforms that have still to be enacted.

"My view is that it's simply not realistic to stick to all the application dates as originally proposed, and that Parliament should consider deferring the application dates of those large reforms that are particularly problematic for compliance with and administration of the new rules.

"The application dates of most concern are those for the reforms relating to our international tax rules, the taxation of the life insurance business, definitions of associated persons, and payroll giving for charitable donations.

"There are practical problems here. For example, provisional taxpayers who get it wrong in second guessing the final form of the changes to the international tax rules may well face penalties and interest for their mistakes.

"Likewise, employers who want to get payroll giving under way on 1 April will find they have no legislative basis on which to make charitable donations from their employees' pay.

"I have therefore written a letter to the chairman of the select committee, outlining my concerns and asking the committee to give serious consideration to a number of deferments, in whole or in part, of application dates in the bill.

"I am announcing my recommendations today to give greater certainty to affected businesses, although it is the select committee that will recommend any changes to the proposed legislation.

"For the international tax changes, I have recommended that the application date remain at the 2009-10 income year only for taxpayers who have balance dates on or after 30 June, the date of the bill is expected to be reported back to Parliament. For all others, the application date would be the 2010-11 income year.

"For the reform of the rules on taxing the life insurance business, I have recommended that the application date of the new rules be deferred until a date to be determined following further discussion with the industry.

"For the changes to the associated person rules, I have recommended a one-year deferment, to the 2010-11 income year, except for the land provisions, which would be deferred from 1 April 2009 to the date of enactment.

"For payroll giving, a change keenly awaited by charities but requiring changes to employers’ payroll systems, I have recommended that the application date be deferred from 1 April 2009 to three months after enactment.

"I have also recommended deferrals of the application dates of a number of other, smaller changes, many of which are taxpayer-friendly or which simply clarify the rules. For example, changes to rules on provisional tax pooling would be deferred from 1 April to the date of enactment," Mr Dunne said.

Exemption for offshore oil & gas exploration extended
=====================================================

Budget 2009 will provide for the five-year continuation of a tax exemption that encourages oil and gas exploration, the government announced today. The exemption from tax on the profits of non-resident operators of offshore rigs and seismic vessels, introduced in 2004, was due to expire in December 2009. Legislation giving effect to the continued exemption will be part of a tax bill to be introduced late towards the end of the year.

### Tax exemption encourages oil and gas exploration

Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced positive measures to enhance the development of New Zealand's natural resources.

Budget 2009 will make provision for a five year continuation of an exemption for offshore oil and gas exploration.

The current exemption from tax on the profits of non-resident operators of offshore rigs and seismic vessels was introduced in 2004 and was to expire on 31 December 2009.

"The international exploration industry is showing increasing interest in New Zealand following recent government initiatives. To build on this interest, the government will be extending the exemption until 31 December 2014 to further encourage exploration of New Zealand's offshore hydrocarbon basins," the Ministers said.

"To give effect to this decision, it is our intention to include this in a tax bill to be introduced nearing the end of the year."

"The past five years have seen more exploration activity in New Zealand waters. The number of non-resident offshore rigs operating in New Zealand has more than doubled; the number of offshore wells drilled has increased from 12 wells in the period between 2000-2005 to 62 wells in the period since 2006.

"Offshore gas reserves have increased by 364 PJs from 2005 to 2008, with notable reserve upgrades at Maui and Pohokura."

"New Zealand is distant from other countries with petroleum programmes, and the cost of sending rigs and seismic vessels to New Zealand is high," the Ministers said.

"Before the exemption, non-resident offshore rig operators and seismic vessels had tended to stay in New Zealand for a period of less than 183 days, even if further exploration had been desirable beyond the 183 day window.

Different rigs were then required to be brought to New Zealand to complete the work, causing extra mobilisation and demobilisation costs. This also disrupted sensible exploration and development programmes.

The continuation of the tax exemption will further help stimulate the search for oil and gas here", the Ministers said.

"In conjunction with the recently announced $20-million injection into government-funded seismic data acquisition, continuing the exemption further indicates the government's commitment to the natural resources sector and its contribution to New Zealand's economic prosperity," the Ministers said.

### Background

New Zealand's domestic tax rules generally tax non-resident offshore rig operators and seismic vessels on their New Zealand sourced income. However, in some situations where non-residents come from a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement the non-resident rig operators are exempt from tax in New Zealand if they stay for less than 183 days in any 12 month period. If they stay for more than 183 days all income will result from the first day of presence in New Zealand and will be subject to New Zealand tax.

Because of this rule, prior to the exemption introduced in 2004, non-resident offshore rig operators and seismic vessels had tended to stay in New Zealand for a period of less than 183 days. Even if further exploration would be desirable beyond the 183 day window, there were strong incentives for rigs to leave by this time. Different rigs were then required to be brought to New Zealand to complete the work, causing extra mobilisation and demobilisation costs. This also disrupted sensible exploration and development programmes.

The temporary taxation exemption has had a demonstrable positive impact, with non-resident semi-submersible rigs and seismic vessels extending their length of stay in New Zealand beyond 183 days. Moreover, the numbers of offshore rigs, offshore wells drilled and offshore gas reserves booked have all increased.

Revenue Minister's tax policy update
====================================

In a speech today to NZICA's Wairarapa Special Interest Group, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne updated the audience on the government's plans for tax policy development now and in the medium term. Topics included the government's tax policy work programme, the newly established Tax Working Group, and progress on the omnibus taxation bill that is before Parliament.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### Address to NZ Institute of Chartered Accountants  
(NZICA) Special Interest Group Wairarapa  
Solway Park, Copthorne Resort, Masterton

Thank you for inviting me to speak to your organisation today.

With the current international financial crisis, tax has moved into the spotlight internationally, with governments all over the world facing greater pressures to preserve their revenue base.

New Zealand is no exception.

As Minister of Revenue, I am acutely aware of the need to ensure that our tax system is resilient enough to weather the economic downturn and that tax revenue remains sufficient to finance government spending on essential services, at the levels New Zealanders take as their birthright.

You have asked me to speak today on 'The new Government's tax policy vision', which I shall attempt to do briefly - in the context of the current economic and fiscal environment, the Government's plans for tax policy development now and in the medium term, some of the administrative problems that are putting the efficient operation of the tax system at risk, and the progress of legislation that is before Parliament.

I will then be happy to answer any questions you may have.

### The economy

The flow-on effects of the international financial crisis continue to weigh on economies worldwide, and it is likely to be some time before economic activity returns to full capacity

The crisis is also clearly affecting New Zealand.

Gross domestic product, or GDP, which measures the production of goods and services in New Zealand, contracted in 2008, while the unemployment rate rose from 3.7 percent in the March quarter 2008 to 5 percent in the March quarter 2009.

Lower production of goods and services and fewer people employed will mean less tax revenue for the Government.

For the nine months to March 2009 the Government's operating balance, which is the difference between government revenue and expenses, showed a deficit of $7.7 billion.

Budget deficits add to gross debt, which the Treasury projects could increase to above 70 percent of GDP by the year ended June 2023, in the absence of any policy changes.

Such increases in government debt would not be prudent fiscal management.

They would raise the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households because lenders would demand a higher rate of return to compensate them for the additional risk arising from the debt.

This would lead to higher interest rates and further reduction in economic activity.

The government's current and projected fiscal position therefore constrains tax policy choices and places greater emphasis on maintaining revenue flows.

### The tax policy work programme

The Government's new tax policy programme, which was released in March, focuses on better positioning New Zealand in the world economy and maintaining tax revenue during the current financial crisis.

Government commitments are top of the agenda on the work programme.

They include the tax components of the post-election action plan, and Confidence and Supply Agreements in relation to alignment of personal, company and trustee tax rates, and in relation to income splitting.

High-priority projects on the work programme include the support of legislation before Parliament and a number of specific projects which I will comment on shortly.

Other high-priority work includes the following:

*   designing a possible exemption from approved issuer levy and NRWT for New Zealand bonds issued to non-residents;
*   tax base maintenance and broadening;
*   the work of the Capital Market Development Taskforce, the Job Summit and other forums on tax issues;
*   further charitable giving initiatives;
*   child support and shared care;
*   negotiation and maintenance of double tax agreements with other countries;
*   the continuing review of the use of imputation credits;
*   the continuing reform of our international tax rules;
*   mutual recognition between New Zealand and Australia of imputation and franking credits, especially in relation to the Australian tax review; and
*   policy work to support the improvement of systems within the tax administration.

Parts of the work programme have already been achieved.

National's post-election tax package was introduced and passed into law before Christmas, with personal tax cuts having taken effect from 1April.

### Relief measures bill

We have also achieved the enactment of tax changes announced in February as part of package of relief measures aimed at helping businesses to weather the economic crisis.

The announced measures included reducing the use of money interest rate for underpayments of tax, which went down from 14.24 percent to 9.73 percent.

The rate for overpayments went down correspondingly, from 6.6 percent to 4.23 percent.

That change was made by Order in Council and took effect from 1 March.

Within a few days of the announcement, a taxation bill that was introduced under urgency provided for the other tax changes that formed part of the relief package.

They were enacted in March, and came into force on 1 April.

Those changes were aimed at easing the burden of tax on cash flow for smaller businesses, in particular, and making it easier and less expensive for them to pay taxes.

For many businesses, cash flows are especially tight at present.

One of the most important measures was the removal of the 5 percent "uplift" ratio in the calculation and payment of provisional tax for this and the next income year, given that we are clearly in a time of economic contraction nationally.

That should help to relieve some of the pressure on smaller businesses, in particular, by allowing them to hold on to tax monies longer.

The new legislation also makes it easier for individual taxpayers to use the standard uplift method of provisional tax rather than estimating their income, thus reducing their compliance costs and their exposure to use of money interest.

This change was part of the omnibus taxation bill that was introduced last July and is still before Parliament, but it was included in February's relief package of legislative changes to ensure speedy enactment.

Practical changes to a number of tax thresholds were also part of the relief package.

Those changes can lower costs for many businesses by reducing the number of returns they have to fill in, or the number of calculations they have to do, and the number of tax payments they have to make.

Some of the measures will also allow businesses to hold onto money longer.

By way of example, the GST payments threshold has been raised from $1.3 million to $2 million.

That will allow more businesses to enjoy the cash flow advantages of accounting for GST when payment from invoices is actually received rather than when the invoices are issued, where there can often be a big time lag or, in some cases, non-payment.

As another example, the PAYE once-a-month filing threshold has been raised from $100,000 to $500,000, which will allow more employers to file and pay PAYE once a month rather than twice a month.

This is a small but important measure to ease cash flow.

These are only two of the recently enacted threshold changes, all intended to make things easier for businesses in this difficult economic climate.

I will now turn to more detailed descriptions of some of the major commitments and projects on the work programme.

### 30 percent alignment

Alignment of company, top personal and trustee tax rates is a medium term-goal on the work programme.

Our economic and fiscal position will clearly limit our ability to reach this goal in the short term unless there is a quick turnaround in conditions.

I have long advocated a 30/30/30 percent alignment of these rates as a simple solution to problems such as individuals using companies and trusts to shelter personal income.

The work programme contributes to this goal through its focus on maintenance of the tax base.

That will help to ensure there is sufficient fiscal room to lower tax rates later on.

The next step, therefore, will be to consider base broadening and tax design issues as part of developing a revenue strategy, responding to what emerges from Australia's comprehensive review of its tax system, and considering alignment options for the future.

Setting out clear steps towards alignment would then be a primary focus of the next 18-month tax policy work programme.

### The Australian review and mutual recognition

New Zealand's submission to the comprehensive Australian review, 'Australia's Future Tax System', made in October at the invitation of the Australian Treasurer, presented the case for introducing trans-Tasman mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits.

It concluded that establishing mutual recognition would benefit both Australia and New Zealand through greater trans-Tasman investment efficiency and increased product market competition.

It would also be an important step toward both governments' shared goal of having a Single Economic Market.

Submissions on last year's discussion document on whether the law should allow limited streaming of imputation credits to those who can use them and whether it should allow refunds of credits for charities and other tax-exempt entities are still under consideration by policy officials.

They are expected to report on submissions by mid-year.

What emerges from the Australian review is likely to have a major influence on how our imputation review proceeds.

If mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits does proceed, we should aim to make our anti-streaming rules as compatible as possible.

### Tax Working Group

As announced last week, the Government will also be following with interest ideas that emerge from the new Tax Working Group, which will be co-ordinated by Victoria University's Centre for Accounting.

The working group is made up of invited private sector and academic experts, as well as tax policy officials.

They will meet regularly between June and November to consider medium-term policy options for the tax system.

In its meetings the working group will consider papers prepared by officials or commissioned from other tax experts, looking at the pros and cons of various policy options.

It will look at areas such as the fiscal framework, the structure of personal income tax, corporate tax, GST, and the integrity of the tax system.

Regular updates on the group's work will be publicly available from a number of sources.

The working group will not make policy recommendations to government and it is not intended to be representational.

But it will provide an important forum for informed discussion of medium-term tax policy that can feed into advice to Ministers and wider public debates on tax policy.

The work of the group will culminate in a major public conference in December, to be hosted by Victoria University.

### Income splitting

Income splitting, or the idea of allowing families with children to split their income for income tax purposes, also has high priority on the work programme.

The Confidence and Supply Agreement between National and UnitedFuture includes support to first reading stage in Parliament for a bill giving effect to the party's income splitting policy.

The bill will be introduced next year.

### Making NZ more competitive internationally

A major group of inter-related projects on the work programme is aimed at making New Zealand more competitive in world markets and will have a clear impact on investment into and within New Zealand.

Those projects include the second stage of the continuing reform of our international tax rules, which will consider the extension of the active income exemption to non-portfolio foreign investment funds, branches of New Zealand companies, and financial institutions.

Also under consideration is the introduction of special rules to extend the active income exemption to certain controlled foreign companies and to non-portfolio foreign investment funds that would not otherwise qualify.

In a similar vein, the Government is also looking at the advisability of introducing an exemption from the approved issuer levy and non-resident withholding tax for New Zealand bonds issued to non-residents.

Such an exemption was raised at February's Job Summit as a way of making bond issues and borrowing from overseas banks easier, thus reducing the cost to New Zealand firms of accessing funds.

We are also examining the provision of a relieving mechanism for non-resident withholding tax on dividends paid to shareholders if those dividends represent distributions of active offshore income.

We plan to canvass these ideas by means of consultative documents to be released later this year.

### Charitable giving

Continuation of work on matters relating to the charitable, community and voluntary sectors are a high priority for me, as Minister of Revenue.

This work includes consideration of further tax incentives to encourage charitable giving, having a fresh look at the criteria and process for approving overseas donee organisations for tax purposes, and as part of the imputation project, considering whether imputation credits should be refundable to charities.

There are a number of options for further tax incentives to promote charitable giving, all of which have been well received by the charitable sector, particularly in light of the economic environment and the negative impact it is having on levels of philanthropy and donations.

One option is to have a scheme along the lines of the United Kingdom's gift aid scheme, which enables charities to claim the tax benefits of charitable donations, rather than the donor claiming them.

Another option is to provide tax incentives for non-monetary donations to charities.

Some of these options would present problems for our tax system, so careful consideration is needed to ascertain which of them would best encourage giving to charities while having regard to the need for financial prudence and restraint in the current environment.

### Child support

The child support system, especially the area of shared care, is also a high priority for me.

That work, assisted by work being done by the Families Commission, will involve seeking a better understanding of patterns of caring for children in the event of a parental separation.

The cost of caring for a child when parents separate is also an important issue for consideration.

This should help towards a better recognition of shared care in the child support formula, a very difficult and vexatious subject for those individuals involved.

For that, we will again need to look at developments in Australia, which now has an approach that takes into account both parents' income and accepts a lower level of shared care than our formula does.

I anticipate releasing a discussion document on these aspects of the child support system later in the year.

Any emerging recommendations on the child support formula will also have to take into account the work that is being done to modernise Inland Revenue systems.

### Modernising IR systems

The Government is considering ways of helping Inland Revenue to improve its ageing administrative systems and has made that a priority on the tax policy work programme, given that an efficient administration is essential to the success of the tax system.

A very big challenge to the efficiency of our tax administration has arisen over the last decade or so.

It has arisen from the strain placed on the tax administration by the addition of an ever increasing number of social policy programmes that are administered through the tax system - programmes such as student loans, Working for Families tax credits, child support and KiwiSaver.

Over recent years, systems designed for tax collection have been progressively adapted to cope with these and other social policy programmes.

Over time, this has resulted in greater systems complexity, loss of agility and efficiency, and greater cost of administration.

A good tax system requires good tax administration and good policy.

It is now more important than ever that tax policy and administration deliver a system which is as efficient as possible in raising the revenue the Government needs to meet its funding requirements.

The focus of the improvements will be on protecting the integrity of the tax system, reducing administrative and compliance costs, delivering better services, and enabling Inland Revenue to deliver new Government initiatives faster and more effectively.

At this point I would like to publicly acknowledge the work of the Inland Revenue Department in coping so well with all the changes and new policies that successive governments have introduced.

However, we cannot rely on more of the same in the future. Further strain on tax systems from future policy changes could increase organisational risk and, consequently, risk to tax revenues.

The Government will be looking at key areas of systems strain and the underlying legislative framework.

Take student loans, for example.

With over half a million borrowers and a nominal value of $9.6 billion, the student loan scheme represents a significant Crown asset that has to be managed in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

On the other hand, Inland Revenue's current student loan systems are unnecessarily complex, largely because they are modelled on tax rules.

For example, the income tax system is an annual concept, while a loan does not naturally fit into such a cycle.

We will also be looking at the PAYE system, which is an important element of any potential change.

It is the key vehicle through which Inland Revenue interacts with employers in the collection of employee information and payments relating to PAYE and social policy programmes such as student loans, KiwiSaver and child support.

It is all inter-related.

Modernising the infrastructure to deliver PAYE would enhance the benefits of improved administrative systems for student loans and Working for Families tax credits.

It would have wider benefits as well, particularly in relation to income tax, KiwiSaver and child support.

I have gone into detail in these examples to give you some understanding of why there is an urgent need to modernise several Inland Revenue systems.

We are still considering several potential solutions to these systems problems, so it is too early to make detailed announcements.

### July bill

I understand that your group is particularly interested in the progress of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which was introduced in July last year.

It was one of 78 bills before Parliament that lapsed when the House rose for the election, and it was re-instated by the new Parliament after the election.

Still under consideration by Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee, that bill introduces a number of major reforms, including changing the way that the life insurance business is taxed, by introducing an integrated framework of changes that include taxing actual term insurance profits.

Of major importance in the bill is the first stage of the reform of New Zealand's international tax rules, a fundamental change in the way that we tax the offshore active income of our controlled foreign companies.

The cornerstone of the reform is the introduction of a tax exemption for active income from the offshore operation of New Zealand-based businesses, which is part of the bill.

That will bring our tax rules on offshore income into line with the practice in other countries and help New Zealand-based business to compete more effectively in foreign markets by freeing them from a tax cost that their competitors in other countries do not face.

Other reforms in the same bill include clarification of the law relating to employee relocation and overtime meal allowances, the introduction of a voluntary payroll giving system whereby employees can have their charitable donations deducted from their pay by employers, and changes to strengthen the definitions of "associated persons" in income tax law.

All this is still under consideration by the select committee.

Given the time that has passed since the introduction of this very large bill, I am in favour of deferring the proposed application dates of many of the measures in the bill.

As originally proposed, many of the application dates appear to be unrealistic for the affected taxpayers, who have to prepare their systems for, and work in accordance with, complex tax reforms that have yet to be enacted.

Changing a bill before Parliament is not a matter of a Minister - or anyone else - simply announcing that a change in the proposed legislation is will be made.

The correct process is for the select committee that is considering the bill to make recommendations to Parliament about changes it believes should be made, and Parliament then decides.

The select committee makes its recommendations after it has considered submissions and what officials recommend in regard to points raised in submissions.

For this reason, I wrote to the chairman of the Finance and Expenditure, Craig Foss, outlining my concerns about the proposed application dates in several cases, and asking the committee to give serious consideration to deferring many of them.

I know that the committee is concerned about the application dates because Mr Foss contacted me late last year to inform me that the committee had asked officials to look into the implications of deferral for several of the proposed measures.

The application dates of most concern are those for the reforms relating to our international tax rules, the taxation of the life insurance business, definitions of "associated persons" in the Income Tax Act, and payroll giving for charitable donations.

I announced my recommended deferrals in March to let affected businesses know we are aware there is a problem, although no-one can give absolute certainty at this point, for reasons I have explained.

For the international tax changes, I have recommended that the application date remain at the 2009-10 income year only for taxpayers who have balance dates on or after 30 June, the date the bill is expected to be reported back to Parliament.

For all others, the application date would be the 2010-11 income year.

For the reform of the rules on taxing the life insurance business, I have recommended that the application date of the new rules be deferred until a date to be determined following further discussion with the industry.

For the changes to the associated person rules, I have recommended a one-year deferment, to the 2010-11 income year, except for the land provisions, which would be deferred from 1 April 2009 to the date of enactment.

For payroll giving, a change keenly awaited by charities but requiring changes to employers' payroll systems, I have recommended that the application date be deferred from 1 April 2009 to three months after enactment.

I have also recommended deferrals of the application dates of a number of other, smaller changes, many of which are taxpayer-friendly or which simply clarify the rules.

For example, changes to rules on provisional tax pooling would be deferred from 1 April to the date of enactment.

The bill is not expected to pass before August.

### Conclusion

I will conclude my remarks today by thanking you again for the opportunity to meet with you and to discuss tax matters that are important to us all.

I acknowledge the excellent contribution that your profession makes to the operation of the tax system and the practical experience that NZICA brings to the policy consultation process.

### KiwiSaver mortgage diversion to be closed

The KiwiSaver mortgage diversion facility is to be closed to new applicants from 1 June 2009, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

Mortgage diversion is a feature of KiwiSaver that allows members to divert up to half their contributions to their mortgage repayments.

"Any benefits of mortgage diversion are outweighed by its disadvantages, while not all banks offer it and only about 600 people out of more than a million KiwiSaver members have taken it up," Mr Dunne says.

"Mortgage diversion imposes additional and unnecessary compliance costs on KiwiSaver providers and on banks that offer the facility, and these costs are generally passed on to members using the facility through increased fees.

"It also goes against a basic principle of KiwiSaver to lock in savers' funds until they are 65, thus helping them to accumulate assets for their retirement years. Someone using mortgage diversion could, for example, sell the house before he or she is 65, thus gaining access to funds.

"There is no practical way of stopping members gaining early access to their funds via mortgage diversion, without imposing further compliance costs on banks and providers and further complicating the law. It is simpler and more straightforward to stop offering the facility for new applicants," Mr Dunne says.

Mortgage diversion will be closed to new applicants from 1 June, while remaining available for existing participants. However, as providing mortgage diversion has never been obligatory, providers and banks can stop providing the facility to existing participants if they so choose.

"Legislation bringing about the change is being introduced today."

### Deferred tax cuts - fact sheet

*   The Government remains committed to lower personal income taxes.
*   The planned second and third tranches of tax cuts, which were due to take effect on 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011 respectively, have been deferred to avoid further increasing debt.
*   Even with the other debt reduction measures in Budget 2009, the Treasury is forecasting large budget deficits for 2010 and 2011. This means the Government would have added to its already considerable debt to fund the planned second and third tranches of tax cuts.
*   This has been a difficult decision. But, on balance, the Government has decided to prioritise safeguarding entitlements, improving public services and reducing debt.
*   Tax cuts will be assessed to consider whether they are affordable, as part of future budget processes.
*   The Government's first round of tax cuts delivered on 1 April 2009 is not affected. It left around $1 billion a year in the pockets of 1.5 million New Zealand workers. These tax cuts were fully funded from other policy changes rather than through borrowing.
*   By deferring the second and third tranches of the tax cuts, the Government will save around $900 million a year from 2011/12.
*   The Government's medium-term goal remains to align and reduce the top rate of personal tax, trust, and company tax rates at a maximum rate of 30 per cent.
*   The decision to defer the tax cuts will be included in legislation introduced today.

Govt consults on student loan changes
=====================================

The Government is inviting the public's views on proposed changes to simplify the way student loan repayments are managed, as part of Inland Revenue's move towards greater electronic interaction with the public. For people who have student loans, this means getting rid of yearly letters, square-ups and personal contact with Inland Revenue and gaining instant, online access to the information about their loan accounts. Consultation is taking place by means of an online forum \[site no longer available\], for those who prefer to make informal comments, and a discussion document, "[Making it easier for borrowers to repay their student loans](/publications/2009/2009-dd-student-loans)
", which gives more details of the proposed changes and invites written submissions. For more information on today's announcement, see the [media statement](/news/2009/2009-06-24-govt-consults-student-loan-changes#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt seeks views online on student loan repayment changes

The Government is inviting the public's view on proposed changes that will dramatically simplify the way student loan repayments are managed, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"This is the first time that Inland Revenue has used online consultation to seek the views of borrowers and other interested parties, Mr Dunne said.

"The proposed changes are a first step in a bigger project of changes which will move Inland Revenue increasingly towards electronic interaction with taxpayers.

"For student loans this means getting rid of the yearly letters, square-ups and telephone calls for borrowers working in New Zealand and interacting electronically," Mr Dunne said.

"The main advantage of the changes is that all borrowers will soon be able to access enhanced information and manage their loan accounts online, at any time of the day or night, from anywhere in the world.

"However, to ensure that the new system meets the needs of as many people as possible, the Government would like to hear the views of borrowers and other interested parties on the effects of the changes.

"Consultation takes the form of an online forum, for those who prefer to make informal comments, and a standard discussion document, for those who want more detail and prefer to make a written submission.

"In addition to the change to a web-based system there will be a number of other changes to how the repayment system works, and most of these will affect borrowers who are employed in New Zealand.

Removing the end-of-year annual assessment and moving to a pay period repayment system increases accuracy and lowers compliance costs. However, the improved services and ability for borrowers to self-manage their loans does come with a necessary trade-off.

"The change with the widest impact concerns the threshold at which employees must begin to repay their student loan. At present, that threshold is an annual one, currently set at $19,084. Under the proposed system, the threshold will be a weekly, fortnightly or monthly amount, depending on when the employee is paid.

"What that means for borrowers working in New Zealand is that if they work for only part of the year and exceed the specified pay-period threshold for that work, even for student holiday jobs, loan repayments will be deducted from their pay. For example, on the basis of the current annual threshold, borrowers who are paid weekly will have to start repayments once they earn over $367 a week.

"The new system will allow earlier identification and correction of deduction errors, which means there will be fewer and less significant overpayments and underpayments.

"In the case of small underpayments, future deductions can be adjusted to correct the error. Borrowers won't have to pay lump sums or late payment penalties for underpayments. Any small overpayments will be applied to their loan balances.

"We would like to hear from these borrowers and other interested parties to see if the new way of operating will have any unforeseen impacts or create major difficulties for borrowers.

"Self-employed borrowers and those based overseas will not notice many changes in how things are done, although there will be a few which they should check out. They include removing penalties for non-compliance and replacing them with lower interest rates. These borrowers will also benefit from enhanced online services and the ability to do more to manage their student loan accounts.

"At present, over 530,000 people have a student loan, a number that grows every year. Most of these borrowers have finished their studies and are repaying their loans by means of an out-of-date system that requires a lot of personal contact with Inland Revenue. As a result, the system is cumbersome for both borrowers and Inland Revenue.

"Streamlining the repayment system and improving the service is in everyone's best interests. For this reason the Government encourages all interested parties to have their say on the proposed changes, to ensure they work to everyone's benefit," the Minister said.

The closing deadline for comment is 17 July.

### Questions and Answers:

The attached covers:

*   proposed student loan policy as it applies to employees, the self-employed and borrowers who are based overseas;
*   supporting administrative changes; and
*   the online forum.

### Borrowers who are employees

#### Repayment threshold

Q. Why is the repayment threshold changing?

A. For salary and wage earners, the repayment threshold would be set on a pay period basis - weekly, fortnightly, four weekly, or monthly. This change will mean that the complexity and costs of the end-of-year square-up can be avoided.

#### Part-year income

Q. As I only earn income for part of the year, will I need to pay student loan repayments from my income?

A. Yes, if your income is over a certain threshold. With the change from an annual basis of assessment to a pay period basis you will have to make payments towards your loan if your pay period income exceeds the pay period repayment threshold.

#### Secondary income

Q. I have a second job. Will I have to make student loan repayments from my second job?

Primary income above repayment threshold  
A. If the pay from your primary job is above the repayment threshold then you will be required to make loan repayments from all you earn from your second job.

Primary income below repayment threshold  
A. You could choose to apply the "unused" repayment threshold from your first job (the difference between your income from the first job and the repayment threshold) to your second job. Otherwise, loan deductions would be made from the first dollar of income from the second job.

#### Fluctuating income

Q. My income fluctuates during the year. Will I receive a refund of loan repayments at the end of the year?

A. No, there will be no square-up at the end of the year. Under the proposed changes, your loan repayments will be 10 percent of the amount of your pay-period income (weekly, fortnightly, four weekly or monthly) that exceeds the pay period repayment threshold. This is your full repayment liability for the pay period.

Q. I have not had student loan deductions made from my pay. Will I have to pay it back?

A. If the under-deduction is small then the amount will be added to the loan balance. If the under-deduction is large then the amount will be recovered from your future pays. The threshold for rectifying errors has not been decided.

#### No end-of-year square-up

Q. Will I have to file a tax return and do an end-of-year student loan assessment?

A. No, if you are not self-employed and do not have interest and dividend income over a threshold, you will not need an end-of-year student loan assessment. You will only have to file a tax return if you have to for tax purposes.

#### Interest and dividend income

Q. I earn interest and dividend income. Will I have to make loan repayments on this income?

A. If you are not self-employed and earn a total of $1,500 (say) or less of interest and dividend income then you will not have to make loan repayments on this income. If you earn more than $1,500 of interest and dividend income then you will have to have a student loan assessment.

#### General question

Q. What will be the impact of the proposed changes on my loan balance?

A. This depends on your particular circumstances. Small underpayments during the year will be added to the loan balance while small overpayments will reduce the loan balance. However, large overpayments will reduce the loan balance, unless the overpayment is due to employer error - and then a refund can be requested.

#### Voluntary repayments

Q. I make voluntary payments through my PAYE. How will I get my voluntary payment discount?

A. The 10 percent bonus will continue to apply to any repayments of $500 or more above the compulsory repayment obligation. The details of how the bonus applies to deductions made through the PAYE system are still being worked through.

### Borrowers who are self-employed

#### Interim repayments/threshold/annual square-up

Q. I am self-employed, will I still be required to make three repayments during the year?

A. Yes, the current interim repayments and annual threshold will continue to apply to the self-employed as will the end-of-year square-up.

#### Late payment penalty

Q. I miss an interim repayment, will I be liable for late payment penalty?

A. The late payment penalty for non-payment will be replaced with a use of money interest rate.

At the moment you would be liable for a late payment penalty on underpayments from the third interim instalment onwards. The late payment penalty is 1.5% per month which equates to 19.56% per annum.

#### Interest and dividend income

Q. I earn interest and dividend income. Will I be required to make loan repayments on this income?

A. Yes, you will continue to make loan repayments on this income as part of your three interim repayments during the year. Your interest and dividend income will continue to be included in your end-of-year student loan assessment and squared up at year-end.

#### Underpayment at year-end

Q. I have underpaid my student loan liability. When is the underpayment due?

A. The underpayment would now be spread over the next three interim instalments. At present, when that happens, you are required to pay the underpayment on the terminal tax date.

### Borrowers who are overseas

#### Repayment obligations

Q. Will the current repayment obligations for overseas-based borrowers remain?

A. Yes, the current repayment obligations of between $1,000 to $3,000 (depending on the loan balance) will continue to apply.

Q. Will the changes make it easier for me to make repayments from overseas?

A. Yes, the changes will enable you to view an up to date loan balance at any time from anywhere in the world. We are considering different payment mechanisms to make repayments easier.

#### Interest

Q. Will interest be removed for overseas based borrowers?

A. No, the interest on the loans of overseas-based borrowers will remain.

#### Late payment penalty

Q. I am overseas and I fail to make a repayment. Will I be liable for late payment penalties?

A. No, the late payment penalty would be replaced by a higher rate of interest for non-payment, higher than the current 6.8% interest rate but lower than current late payment penalties.

#### Non-compliant borrowers

Q. What is Inland Revenue doing about contacting overseas borrowers who are not paying back their loans?

A. The new online services will help those who want to meet their obligations but find it too hard to manage their loans under the current system. Voluntary compliance is the cornerstone of a repayment system.

### Enhanced onlines services

Q. What services will be provided online?

A. Borrowers will be able to make use of a wide range of enhanced web based services, much as they have to manage bank accounts. A consolidated loan balance should also be available through the timely transfer of loan account information from MSD/StudyLink to Inland Revenue.

Q. What will be the consequence of these changes?

A. Contact with borrowers in the future will be online mainly. Contact by phone would be the exception and limited to complex cases that could not be handled through online services. The aim is to have borrowers manage their loan online along the same lines as internet banking.

Q. I get a lot of confusing statements and letters from Inland Revenue, will this continue?

A. The possible changes should significantly reduce the need for Inland Revenue and borrowers to contact each other. Similarly, the customised self-management of loans that should be possible under the changes should mean that only exceptional cases need to be dealt with by mail or phone calls.

### Online forum

Q. Why is Inland Revenue using the forum to consult?

A. Consultation is an established part of the way New Zealand's tax system is developed but Inland Revenue considered the usual channels, discussion documents and so on, would not have had nearly the reach desired; more than half a million people have student loans and many of them live overseas. As these proposals affect them all Inland Revenue wanted its consultation to reach as many of them as possible.

Q. What will Inland Revenue do with the feedback given on the forum?

A. The feedback will be used by Inland Revenue to develop policy proposals during the second half of 2009. If the Government proceeds with the proposals, new legislation could be introduced in late 2009, with the changes applying from early 2011.

Q. Can only those people with student loans contribute to the forum?

A. No. Anyone can contribute to the forum - you don't have to have (or have had) a student loan.

Q. How long is the forum open for?

A. The forum is open until 17 July 2009.

Q. I've got a personal question about my student loan. Where can I ask that?

A. The student loans page on the Inland Revenue website (www.ird.govt.nz/studentloans/) has answers to common questions.

Super portability agreement signed
==================================

Australia and New Zealand today signed a memorandum of understanding that paves the way for a new scheme that will allow transfers of retirement saving between certain Australian superannuation funds and New Zealand KiwiSaver funds. The scheme is expected to be in place by mid-2010. For more information see the [joint press release](/news/2009/2009-07-16-super-portability-agreement-signed#statement)

JOINT PRESS RELEASE

### Ministers take single market forward, sign up to trans-Tasman retirement savings portability

Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan and New Zealand Finance Minister Bill English today made significant progress towards a Single Economic Market at their annual bilateral meetings held in Brisbane.

The Ministers discussed the difficult global economic environment both nations are facing and noted that both Australia and New Zealand had taken decisive action to cushion their economies from the worst impacts of the global recession.

The Ministers also discussed the already close economic relationship and significantly progressed ongoing work to further strengthen ties.

The Ministers took a number of steps towards achieving the shared vision of a trans-Tasman Single Economic Market.

Today the Ministers signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a trans-Tasman retirement savings portability scheme. This will enable Australians and New Zealanders to transfer their retirement savings across the Tasman when they move. This will make it easier for people to move freely between the two countries and help to return people's 'lost' retirement savings.

The bilateral economic relationship was further enhanced by the finalisation of the new Australia-New Zealand tax treaty. These changes will be of benefit to both economies and the treaty is an important further step towards an integrated trans-Tasman economy.

In addition, the Ministers discussed the work being done toward developing an 'outcomes' based approach to accelerate regulatory harmonisation to stimulate business and create jobs. The approach will be further developed for consideration by Prime Ministers in August.

The Ministers discussed Australia's membership of the G-20 and noted that it is an important opportunity for both countries to influence the global response to the crisis.

Mr Swan and Mr English also discussed progress towards meeting their Prime Ministers' commitment to conclude an Investment Protocol by the end of 2009 to promote trans-Tasman investment flows.

New Zealand is also currently investigating the merits of establishing a Productivity Commission and in doing so has looked closely at the model provided by the Australian Productivity Commission.

Both parties agreed that if New Zealand establishes a Commission then there should be trans-Tasman cooperation between the two bodies.

This will facilitate the sharing of experiences on what policies work best to improve productivity and competitiveness, and also permit joint studies on opportunities to strengthen the Single Economic Market.

### Background on retirement savings portability

The Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Scheme Memorandum of Understanding would permit transfers of retirement savings between certain Australian superannuation funds and New Zealand KiwiSaver funds.

Participation in the scheme will be voluntary for eligible funds, as well as for individuals wishing to transfer their retirement savings.

The scheme is consistent with the objective of the two countries of creating a single trans-Tasman economic market, as is enshrined in the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement.

Once enacted it will enhance the movement of labour between the two countries by enabling individuals to streamline and consolidate their retirement savings in their country of residence.

In addition, by reducing individuals' exposure to multiple sets of fees and charges, the scheme is expected to support the growth of individuals' retirement incomes.

It will also help reduce the number of small, uneconomic accounts in the Australian superannuation system, which is consistent with the Rudd Government's focus on enhancing efficiency in the system.

New Zealanders who have returned home after working in Australia but have since lost track of their retirement savings accumulated in Australia should use the Australian Taxation Office website to check for any lost accounts: [www.ato.gov.au/superseeker](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Keeping-track/Check-your-super/)
.

The approach taken in the memorandum will ensure that the integrity of the Australian and New Zealand retirement savings systems is maintained.

The two countries will now work towards enacting the legislation necessary to give effect to this new regime.

RWT focus of new tax bill
=========================

New resident withholding tax rates on interest paid to individuals, to align them with personal income tax rates, are the central feature of an omnibus taxation bill tabled in Parliament today. The bill also introduces a new default rate and a new 30% rate on interest paid to companies, and aligns the tax rates on PIEs with personal tax rates.

Minister of Revenue

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Resident withholding tax focus of new tax Bill

The alignment of certain investment tax rates with income tax rates is the central feature of an omnibus taxation Bill tabled in Parliament today, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said.

"The Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Bill consists of a good deal of 'catch-up' legislation that makes downstream changes to tax law that follow on from earlier tax changes, as well as generally updating tax law and providing greater taxpayer certainty," he said.

"The Bill introduces new resident withholding tax (RWT) rates on interest paid to individuals, to bring them into line with recent changes to personal tax rates. The new rates for individuals will be 12.5%, 21%, 33% and 38%, depending on their income.

"The Bill introduces a new default rate of 38% for people who do not notify their bank of their correct tax rate. The new default rate will apply to accounts opened from 1 April 2010.

"There will be a transitional period for people who have a bank account at 1 April 2010 and who are on the current RWT default rate of 19.5%. They will be automatically shifted up to a 21% rate for a year from 1 April 2010. They will then have a year in which to either confirm with their bank that 21% is their correct rate or to select one of the other RWT rates. If they neither confirm the 21% rate nor elect another rate, their RWT default rate will then go up to 38% from 1 April 2011.

"The changes to the default rate are being made to motivate people to use the correct tax rate for the interest they receive from their financial institution.

"The bill also introduces a new 30% RWT rate on interest paid to companies, to align with the recent change in the company tax rate. Its use will be optional for a year from 1 April 2010 and mandatory thereafter.

"As a complementary measure, the Bill aligns the tax rates on portfolio investment entities with the new personal tax rates, so that PIE rates will be 12.5%, 21% and 30%. The changes will ensure that people who invest in PIEs are not disadvantaged relative to direct investors. Once enacted, the changes will apply from 1 April 2010," Mr Dunne said.

Other changes in the bill include:

*   Secondary tax code and extra pays: introduction of a new 12.5% secondary code and a new 12.5% withholding tax rate for extra pays that brings the withholding rates on employment income into line with new personal tax rates.
*   Forestry/climate change: clarification that the expenses of participants in the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative are to be treated as forestry business expenses for tax purposes.
*   Tax returns: changes to allow Inland Revenue to accept corrections of minor errors in subsequent returns, to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers.
*   Trusts: changes to allow tax agents more time, if needed, to allocate beneficiary income.
*   GST/waste: clarification that the new waste disposal levy, introduced on 1 July, is subject to GST.

Major tax bill passes
=====================

The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill has passed its final stages in Parliament. Introduced in July 2008, the omnibus tax bill gives effect to a number of business tax reforms. They include the reform of the tax rules relating to the offshore income of controlled foreign companies, reform of the taxation of the life insurance business, introduction of a payroll giving scheme for charitable donations, updating the petroleum mining tax rules, clarifying the law relating to employer payments for relocation and overtime meal allowances and strengthening the definitions of "associated persons" in income tax law. For more information see the Revenue Minister's [media statement](/news/2009/2009-09-18-major-tax-bill-passes#statement)
. The new legislation will be available here once it has received Royal assent, which is expected in a few days' time.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Dunne welcomes passage of major tax bill

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has welcomed the passage today of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which was introduced in July 2008.

"I am very pleased that this omnibus taxation bill, which gives effect to a number of important business tax reforms, has passed its final stages in Parliament," Mr Dunne said.

"The reforms are aimed variously at reducing tax costs for businesses, bringing tax law up to date with today's commercial environment, protecting our revenue base, ensuring the law works as effectively as possible, or supporting a culture of charitable giving in New Zealand.

"The most far-reaching change is the reform of the tax rules relating to the offshore income of our controlled foreign companies. It results in better alignment of our tax rules with those of comparable countries, especially Australia, and removes a tax cost for our controlled foreign companies that similar companies in many other countries do not face. The reform applies to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009

"The tax rules relating to the life insurance business have been updated to ensure that term insurance business is taxed on actual profits, as other businesses are taxed, and to extend the tax benefits of the PIE rules to people who save through life products. These changes generally take effect from 1 July 2010, with term insurance products sold before that date subject to transitional rules.

"The eagerly awaited payroll giving scheme for charitable donations, which will operate through the tax PAYE system, will come into being three months from the date the new legislation receives Royal assent, which probably means before Christmas. Under the scheme, people whose employers sign up for the scheme will receive the tax benefits of their donations each payday, without having to present donation receipts.

"The new legislation also makes life easier for volunteers and community groups by clarifying the tax treatment of reimbursements and honoraria, to make it easier for volunteers to meet their tax obligations and reduce the associated compliance costs. Those changes will apply from 1 April 2009.

"A change to the KiwiSaver law allows families of members who die to have quick access to funds in the dead member's account. With effect from 1 July 2007, up to $15,000 from a dead member’s account can be paid out directly to nominated persons, without their having to await probate if the member left a will, or letters of administration if the member died intestate," Mr Dunne said.

_Other changes_

Other important reforms in the new legislation include:

*   Employer payments and allowances: The law has been clarified to ensure employer payments for relocation and overtime meal allowances are tax-free, thus removing long-standing uncertainty in the law and saving time and money for everyone involved.
*   Petroleum mining: The tax rules have been updated to remove possible disincentives to further investment in oil and gas exploration and development in New Zealand, and to safeguard New Zealand's taxing rights on its petroleum resources.
*   "Associated persons": the definitions of "associated persons" in income tax law, especially in relation to land sales, have been strengthened to prevent people circumventing the law because of the closeness of the relationships of the parties involved.
*   Films and government funding: The deductible expenditure of film companies that receive Large Budget Screen Production grants will be reduced by the amount of the grant, to prevent the creation of artificial tax losses. Also, the immediate deduction incentive will be turned off for films that receive the 40 percent Screen Production Industry Fund grants.
*   Tax pooling: The provisional tax pooling rules have been extended to include reassessments of all taxes.
*   Migrant workers: Changes have been made to reduce the tax compliance costs faced by migrant workers and to ensure the correct amount of tax is deducted from their pay.
*   Non-disclosure: A change to the Tax Administration Act allows the right of non-disclosure in tax matters to apply to discovery and similar processes that occur during litigation.
*   GST and loyalty points: Certain loyalty programme operators will be allowed to defer imposing GST until loyalty points are redeemed, to ensure that GST is paid at the correct rate.

"These are some of the changes in this major taxation bill, one of the most significant to have come before Parliament in many years," Mr Dunne said. "Its passage is, indeed, an important achievement."

Revenue Minister's tax policy update
====================================

In a tax policy update to the EMA Tax Summit today, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne described the impact on tax policy of the changing economic, fiscal and international environments and the need for the tax administration to deliver greater value for money. Mr Dunne said the government was encouraging debate on what New Zealand's future tax mix might look like but made it clear that no decisions had been made.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Dunne: No Govt decision yet on future tax mix

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today told the EMA'S Tax Summit 2009 in Auckland that the Government has made no decisions on New Zealand's future tax mix.

"We are certainly encouraging debate, and of course we will look closely at the work of the Tax Working Group, which is being co-ordinated by Victoria University, and indeed the Henry Review of the Australian tax system, given the significance of our relationship with Australia.

"However, let me be very clear: the Government has made no decisions – I repeat no decisions – on the future tax mix," Mr Dunne said.

"Those who assume that every utterance or paper released by the Tax Working Group is really a coded effort by the Government to indicate its policy intentions have simply read one conspiracy novel too many," he said.

"There is a long way to go yet. The Working Group has not yet reached its final position, let alone presented it to the Government, so no one should be getting too far ahead of themselves.

"Not only has the Government not discussed these matters, but when it looks to do so, it will need to negotiate them with its support partners," he said.

Mr Dunne went on to say that the Government's overall tax vision today reflects the changes and challenges it faces.

"These can, I think, be condensed into three main issues. The first is the changing economic and fiscal environment. The second is the need to change our tax system to reflect a changing international environment.

"The third is the need for a more efficient and effective – rather than bigger – Public Service; one that provides value for money and meets the public's increasing expectations for service," he said.

"The focus is on having tax policy that meets our ongoing fiscal challenges, and producing an internationally competitive tax system that is supported by a world-class tax administration," Mr Dunne said.

SPEECH

### Address to Employers and Manufacturers Association's  
Tax Summit 2009  
'The New Government's Tax Policy Vision - Where to From Here'

Thank you for your invitation to speak to you today on the Government's tax policy vision.

From my perspective as Minister of Revenue, the key themes here are one, change, and two, continuity in the tax environment.

Change and continuity are illustrated by the large omnibus bill that has recently passed its final stages in Parliament.

I introduced that bill as Minister of Revenue in the previous Labour-led government in July 2008, and oversaw its passage through Parliament in the same role in the current National-led government.

The bill contained a number of significant reforms that bring big changes to our tax system.

They include radical reform of our international tax rules, and the taxation of the life insurance business.

This Government's tax vision reflects the changes and challenges it faces.

These can, I think, be condensed into three main issues, which I will talk to you about today in some detail:

*   The first is the changing economic and fiscal environment.
*   The second is the need to change our tax system to reflect a changing international environment.
*   The third is the need for a more efficient and effective - rather than bigger - public service; one that provides value for money and meets the public's increasing expectations for service.

I shall discuss each of these in turn, but before doing so I want to emphasise that Inland Revenue and my Revenue portfolio are not just about collecting tax, or economic and fiscal issues.

Inland Revenue also manages a raft of important social policy programmes, including the KiwiSaver scheme, Working for Families tax credits, student loans and child support.

It also has a key role in the charity sector.

These social programmes are generally about families and our community.

As Minister of Revenue and as the leader of UnitedFuture, I have always taken a particular interest in this aspect of the Revenue portfolio and will continue to do so.

You will probably be aware that I have always pursued policy goals that encourage a culture of charitable giving.

Last year saw the lifting of the caps on the tax relief for donations to charities and other philanthropic organisations.

The taxation bill that passed its final stages in Parliament last week introduced a voluntary payroll giving scheme that will allow employees to make regular charitable donations directly from their pay, as part of an employer-initiated workplace giving scheme.

The scheme will be available to employers who wish to offer it to their employees later this year.

Looking to the future, work continues on other tax incentive options that have been employed in other jurisdictions for encouraging philanthropy and generosity.

For example, the Government is exploring the merits of a gift aid type scheme that enables the tax benefits of donations to go directly to the donee rather than the donor, and making it possible to claim tax relief on items of cultural significance to New Zealand.

I am particularly delighted at the progress we have been able to make under the last two Governments to encourage a stronger culture of giving in our society.

The state-run child support system helps to provide financial support for more than 200,000 children whose parents live apart, or about 20 percent of all dependent children under the age of 19.

It is obviously important that the scheme operates as effectively as possible, and in the best interests of the children involved.

A lot has changed - in patterns of raising children, in workforce participation, and in family law - since the scheme was introduced in 1992.

It is now time to look at updating it in key areas.

To this end, I am planning to release a discussion document soon that seeks people's views on proposals to update the child support formula that determines how much child support a parent must pay.

The proposed changes will take into consideration levels of shared care, the cost of raising children today, and both parents' income.

The consultation will include an online questionnaire for those who wish to express their views in a less formal way.

Income splitting - the idea of allowing families with children to split their incomes for tax purposes, thereby reducing their overall tax liability - also remains an important possibility that needs to be explored.

Indeed, the post-election Confidence and Supply Agreement between UnitedFuture and National includes support to first reading stage in Parliament for a bill giving effect to my party's income splitting policy.

UnitedFuture has campaigned on the idea consistently, and it was floated in a formal government discussion document n April last year, to which there was a good response, showing strong support for income splitting.

That is to be followed up by an officials' issues paper, planned for release by the end of this year.

It will seek submissions on the detailed design of the proposal, and my intention is to introduce legislation next year to provide for a voluntary income splitting scheme for parents raising dependent children.

The fiscal and economic climate is always critical in setting tax policy.

The Government elected last year faced an immediate challenge from the worldwide economic crisis.

The financial meltdown in late 2008 threatened a re-run of the Great Depression of the 1930s - that is how serious things have been.

However, there is now growing confidence that such a scenario has been averted by the actions of governments throughout the world, including ours.

As a small, open economy with high levels of external debt, New Zealand was especially exposed to the economic downturn.

The position now seems to have stabilised, with the official statistics suggesting the recession may be over.

However, while there are positive signs, the world economy is not yet robust.

The hangover from the turbulence of 2008-09 will be with us for some time yet.

The New Zealand Government has gone from budget surpluses to deficits.

The Treasury's post-election, long-term fiscal projections are for budget deficits to remain until 2016 - the decade of deficits the Minister of Finance refers to.

Even then we return to a sustainable fiscal position only by fiscal drag moving the average worker on to the top personal marginal tax rate of 38%.

That is clearly as unacceptable as it is absurd, which is why the Government is committed to moving to an alignment of top personal tax rates, company rates and trustee rates at 30%.

This has long been UnitedFuture's policy and obviously has my full support.

To achieve such alignment while also achieving a sound fiscal position requires us to look again at the tax system in fundamental ways.

This is being done in conjunction with the Tax Working Group, which is being co-ordinated by Victoria University.

The working group is leading a debate on how we can best raise the tax revenue we need.

In doing so it is drawing on the experiences of other countries and their tax systems.

For example, many of them have capital gains taxes and land taxes.

The question is whether there is a place for such taxes in our tax mix here in New Zealand.

This is a discussion we should have; indeed it is one that we need to have - but it is not without considerable political difficulties.

To have this discussion at all might be considered - in the famous words of Sir Humphrey in the 1980s television classic Yes, Minister - "brave or even courageous".

However, if the Government were to take certain issues off the agenda it would only stifle discussion.

So there are times, indeed, where we need to be brave or even courageous.

But those who assume that every utterance or paper released by the Tax Working Group is really a coded effort by the Government to indicate its policy intentions have simply read one conspiracy novel too many.

Let me be very clear: the Government has made no decisions - I repeat no decisions - on the future tax mix.

I trust that this message is clear. It is not code. It is simple and straightforward.

And there will be no decisions until after the Tax Working Group's report and also the report of the Henry Committee reviewing Australia's tax system have been completed, at the end of the year, and we have had a chance to carefully consider the recommendations and implications of both.

Not only has the Government not discussed these matters, but when it looks to do so, it will need to negotiate them with it support partners, including, I might add, UnitedFuture.

At the end of the day, we need a tax system that raises sufficient revenue to meet our significant fiscal challenges, and does so in the fairest and most efficient way.

For my part, I want a broad base, low rate, internationally competitive tax system that serves New Zealand's needs well and fairly.

I have little interest in policies that are more about slogans, or satisfying the politics of envy.

The Tax Working Group process, and the decisions we make arising from its work, will assist the Government prepare for the 2010 Budget and beyond, but it would be foolhardy to jump to too many conclusions at this early stage.

The second of the key issues we face today is how to ensure our tax system remains competitive in a changing world.

This is also a key focus of the Tax Working Group.

We have already begun reform of our international tax rules.

The omnibus taxation bill that passed its final stages in Parliament last week removed tax on offshore active income.

Basically, the idea is that New Zealand needs to grow its own internationally competitive businesses.

That will not happen if they face tax disadvantages that they would not face if relocated to Australia or elsewhere.

And one of those disadvantages was our comprehensive rules for taxing that offshore active income.

We have now moved our rules into line with Australia's.

We will not tax overseas income if it is unlikely to have been diverted from New Zealand.

The next stage in the reform will be to take the policies we have now legislated for and apply them as appropriate, not just to subsidiaries, but also to branches and interests in non-controlled overseas companies. We are therefore continuing a reform programme that was initiated by the last government.

That is continuity.

At the same time, the tax system faces other international challenges as the world changes.

The recent economic turbulence has had a profound effect on tax systems throughout the world.

One good outcome has been the increasing focus on international transparency and co-operation.

The OECD has been running a project for almost 20 years to increase transparency of countries' tax laws and to improve information exchange between tax administrations.

That project had made only limited progress - partly because some significant OECD economies, notably Switzerland, maintained bank secrecy laws that did not allow effective exchange of taxpayer information.

As a direct result of the G-20 meeting April this year, in the aftermath of the economic crisis, that all changed.

Directly after that meeting, the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown stated that the age of tax havens has ended.

Almost all tax jurisdictions have now agreed to OECD standards of information exchange.

At an international meeting in Mexico earlier this month, it was agreed that a new international organisation would be established to carry this through.

New Zealand has been an active participant in this work, and will benefit from the resulting rules making it harder to evade or avoid taxes through the use of tax havens.

Nevertheless, we recognise that these developments will not remove threats to our ability to raise revenue.

Our company tax base, in particular, remains susceptible to international pressures.

New Zealand has, in response, reduced its company tax rate from 33% to 30% and aligned it with the Australian rate.

However, the international trend is for company tax rates to reduce as countries compete for capital and expertise.

As I said earlier, we want to align our top personal rate with the company tax rate, but if the company tax rate falls further that will put added pressure on revenue sources.

That is an issue that the Tax Working Group will need to consider.

We need a tax system that works now and into the future.

In the international sphere, our most critical relationship is with Australia.

What happens across the Tasman has a direct impact on us.

A classic example of that is that when Australia guaranteed deposits in key financial institutions during the economic crisis, New Zealand followed suit.

We had to.

Increasingly, we are an integrated economy.

What happens with tax policy in Australia is, therefore, critical to us.

I referred earlier to Australia's current fundamental review of its tax policy settings, under the chairmanship of Dr Ken Henry, Australia's Secretary to the Treasury.

New Zealand Ministers and officials are following their developments and we are liaising closely with our Australian counterparts over the review.

Dr Henry recently announced that his review will likely recommend a continuation of Australia's company imputation system.

He also discussed the pros and cons of trans-Tasman mutual recognition of imputation credits, keeping this option open.

Although mutual recognition will have a fiscal cost to New Zealand, it would also deliver major benefits in terms of cementing in place the trans-Tasman Single Economic Market.

I shall continue to follow developments closely.

The final key theme I want to address today is the need for a more efficient and effective Public Service, as reflected in the Inland Revenue Department, my area of responsibility.

A world-class, internationally competitive tax system is not achieved by policy measures alone.

We also need a first-class tax administration that collects revenue fairly and efficiently, and delivers services with speed and certainty.

I have been impressed with the improvements made by the department to the recommendations of the Finance and Expenditure Committee's Inquiry into Inland Revenue, which I chaired in 1999.

Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement, as the government seeks to ensure that we get increasing value for money from the Public Service as a whole.

That will not be achieved by increasing the amount spent on the Public Service.

There is simply no money for that.

The Public Service has to think and act smarter - just as the private sector has to do.

Inland Revenue is embarking upon a major transformation exercise.

It needs to move away from the technology and management style of the 1980s, when the FIRST computer system was built, to a model suited to what we need today.

That will mean making increasing use of e-business tools and the internet - tools that simply did not exist in the 1980s.

I will illustrate this point with an example.

Each working day, Inland Revenue posts, on average, over 100,000 envelopes containing various letters.

That is over half a million per week, or more than 25 million letters a year.

It is an impressive amount of mail for a population of a little over four million - if one is simply impressed by large numbers.

It can equally be seen as a rather horrific bombardment of the populace in an age of information over-load.

Perhaps you can guess which position I hold to.

I want to turn the notion that effectiveness is measured by the volume and frequency of correspondence on its head - in my view, a better measure of Inland Revenue's effectiveness in the future will be how few interventions it has with taxpayers, because the tax system is running smoothly, and compliance is more straightforward.

So my challenge to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is to cut that mail drastically.

He is enthusiastic but it will require some policy changes, which the Government will back.

We need to make those changes if we want to have a 21st century tax administration.

As a first step in the modernisation process, Cabinet has given the go-ahead to legislation that will dramatically simplify the administration of student loan repayments.

The idea is to move away from the time-consuming paper-based management of repayments to electronic management and communication.

A bill giving effect to these changes will be introduced later in the year.

In closing, I would like to return to my opening comments - the Government's tax policy vision is to have a world-leading tax system that meets the needs of the 21st century.

It is a point worth coming back to.

The focus is on having tax policy that meets our ongoing fiscal challenges, and producing an internationally competitive tax system that is supported by a world-class tax administration.

These are our priorities as a government.

Our tax policy work programme, announced in March of this year, has now been slightly revised as a consequence.

There is a lot of continuity in the updated work programme, which contains no surprises.

The changes are largely a matter of re-prioritising so that we are completely focused on the vision that I have described today.

Thank you.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

### Speech to 2009 NZICA Tax Conference:  
Expert Opinion to Navigate the New Tax Landscape  
Auckland, 16 October 2009

I am delighted to have been invited once again to deliver the opening address at your annual conference.

This year's conference is once again densely packed with discussions of recent tax policy developments, many of which I will touch upon this morning, as I look at where we are and where we are going over the next year or so, in the context of the Government's tax policy work programme.

The policy work programme, which was announced in March this year, and updated in September, has four broad themes. They are:

1.  Better positioning New Zealand in the world economy.
2.  Responding effectively to the changing economic and fiscal environment.
3.  Maintaining tax revenue.
4.  Improving tax administrative systems, so that they can operate more effectively and deliver greater value for money.

These four, very broad themes cover just about everything on the government's tax policy work programme although not all projects fall neatly into one category or another.

Before I go on to discuss individual projects, I would like to turn briefly to the always critical influence on tax policy of the fiscal and economic climate.

### **Fiscal and economic climate**

When it was elected, late last year, the new Government faced an immediate challenge from the worldwide economic crisis.

As a small, open economy with high levels of external debt, New Zealand was especially exposed to the economic downturn.

The financial meltdown in late 2008 threatened a re-run of the depression of the 1930s.

Several months down the track, there is now growing confidence that such a scenario has been averted by the actions of governments throughout the world, including New Zealand's.

The position now seems to have stabilised.

There are positive signs, even though the world economy is still not robust.

The hangover from the turbulence will be with us for some time, however.

Since 2008 the New Zealand Government has gone from budget surpluses to deficits.

And the Treasury's post-election, medium-term fiscal projections are for budget deficits to remain until the 2016/17 year.

Even then we will return to a sustainable fiscal position only by fiscal drag moving the average worker on to the top personal marginal tax rate of 38 percent.

The Government is committed to moving to an alignment of the top personal tax rate, company rate and trustee rate at a maximum of 30 percent as a desirable medium-term goal.

This has long been United Future's policy, so obviously has my full support.

To move towards such alignment while also achieving a sound fiscal position requires us to look again at the tax system in fundamental ways.

**Tax Working Group**

This examination is being done in conjunction with the Tax Working Group, which is being co-ordinated by Victoria University.

The working group is leading a debate on the medium-term direction of New Zealand's tax system.

In doing so it is drawing on the experiences of other countries and their tax systems.

Other countries have capital gains taxes and land taxes.

One question for the working group is whether there is a place for such taxes in the New Zealand tax mix.

This is a discussion we should and need to have, but encouraging the debate is not without its political difficulties.

Publication of various background papers prepared for the Tax Working Group's consideration has been accompanied by a lot of media interest on details of the contents and speculation on Ministers' views on the various options being explored - will the Government introduce a capital gains tax, a land tax, rental property tax, and so on?

I want to stress once again that the Government has made no decisions on the future tax mix.

What is more, the working group itself has not even yet reached a final position on the many options, let alone presented it to the Government.

While the working group has not been set up as a revenue-raising body, at the end of the day we need a tax system that raises sufficient revenue to meet our significant fiscal challenges, and does so in the fairest and most efficient way.

The Tax Working Group process will assist the Government as it prepares to meet future challenges.

**The Henry review**

The Government is also closely monitoring the progress of the Henry review, which is expected to report to the Australian government in December.

Tax developments in Australia, our closest economic partner, are of special importance to us, given our economic interaction and the fact that about 55 percent of foreign direct investment into New Zealand is from Australia.

New Zealand's submission to the Henry review, made in October last year at the invitation of the Australian Treasurer, presented the case for introducing trans-Tasman mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits.

It was interesting to note that in a speech delivered in August this year, Dr Henry said that he did not think the time had come for dividend imputation to be abandoned.

It should be retained, at least in the short term.

He cited as significant benefits of the system that it assists small and medium-size firms in accessing equity capital, ensures that the labour income of owner-managers that is paid out as dividends is appropriately taxed, albeit with some potential deferral, and it encourages Australian companies to pay Australian tax.

New Zealand's full imputation scheme has been an important part of the tax system for similar reasons.

Interestingly, in the same speech Dr Henry talked about mutual recognition.

He acknowledged arguments advanced in New Zealand's submission as well as counter-arguments.

He noted, however, that different considerations arise when the issue is viewed from the objective of developing a Single Economic Market.

I believe that mutual recognition is essential if we are to have a truly Single Economic Market, while retaining our respective imputation systems.

We have put our own review of aspects of the imputation system on hold until we know what the Henry review will be recommending.

That should become clearer before too long.

### **The changing international environment**

**International reforms**

Regardless of what results from the Henry review, there will doubtless be important tax consequences for New Zealand.

That is a reminder of how important it is to ensure our tax system remains competitive in a changing world.

It is also a key focus of the Tax Working Group.

We have already begun reform of our international tax rules.

The omnibus taxation bill that passed its final stages in Parliament last month removes tax on active income earned through offshore subsidiaries and on foreign dividends received by New Zealand parent companies.

The idea behind this far-reaching reform is to help New Zealand grow its own internationally competitive businesses.

That will not happen if our businesses face tax disadvantages they would not face if they moved to Australia or another country.

And until last month, one of those disadvantages was our comprehensive rules for the taxation of that offshore active income.

We have now moved our rules into line with Australia's.

We will not tax CFC income if it is unlikely to have been diverted from New Zealand.

The next stage in the reform will be to take the policies we have now legislated for and apply them as appropriate, not just to subsidiaries but also to branches, joint ventures and other significant offshore investments.

To this end, a discussion document with suggestions on how the active income exemption could apply to significant interests in foreign investment funds will be released within the next few months, while rules for branches and financial CFCs will be developed next year.

Officials are also investigating the desirability of a mechanism for relieving withholding tax on dividends paid to foreign shareholders if those dividends represent distributions of active foreign-sourced income.

That could reduce the cost of capital for businesses that expand offshore.

**Other international challenges**

Our tax system faces other international challenges.

The recent economic turbulence has put enormous pressure on government revenues and this, in turn, has had a profound effect on tax systems throughout the world.

One positive outcome has been an increasing focus internationally on the need to increase transparency of countries' tax laws and to improve information exchange between tax administrations.

The OECD has been running a project with this objective since the mid-1990s.

That project had made only limited progress until this year.

In part, that was because some important OECD jurisdictions, notably Switzerland, maintained bank secrecy laws that did not allow effective exchange of taxpayer information.

All that changed as a direct result of escalating international pressure resulting from the economic crisis.

It culminated in the G20 Leaders Summit in April this year, where it was agreed to take action against non-cooperative jurisdictions, including tax havens.

As its official communiqué stated: "We stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems. The era of banking secrecy is over."

Almost all tax jurisdictions have now agreed to implement OECD standards of transparency and information exchange.

At an international meeting in Mexico earlier this month, it was agreed that a new international organisation - the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information - would be established to ensure that the standards are implemented.

**TIEAs**

New Zealand has been a strong supporter of the OECD work on transparency and exchange of information, and of the developments arising out of the G-20 this year.

The implementation of OECD standards on transparency and exchange of information will enable tax authorities to obtain tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, ownership information, and other tax-related information from each other for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion.

Information exchange arrangements are typically established by concluding treaties.

Exchange of information arrangements has always been part of our double tax agreements, or DTAs as they are commonly known, with our trading and investment partners.

However, DTAs are not the most appropriate treaties for all jurisdictions.

They are also resource-intensive to negotiate, and building a DTA network is painfully slow.

Since 2003, New Zealand has been attempting to negotiate tax information exchange agreements with low-tax international finance centres.

These agreements are much easier and quicker to negotiate than DTAs, and can be concluded with any jurisdiction.

Until this year, however, we had signed only one, with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007.

However, international developments this year have resulted in a massive escalation of tax information exchange agreements worldwide.

New Zealand has been a major beneficiary of this development.

So far this year we have signed a further eight such agreements - with Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey.

A further four agreements are expected to be signed in November, and many more negotiations are in progress.

**Company tax**

These international developments will not, however, remove the threats to our ability to raise revenue.

Our company tax base, in particular, remains susceptible to international pressures.

In response, New Zealand has reduced its company tax rate from 33% to 30% and aligned it with the Australian rate.

But the international trend is for company tax rates to reduce still further as countries compete for capital and expertise.

As I mentioned earlier, it is a Government goal to align our top personal rate with the company tax rate.

Although we need to be ready to respond to future company tax rate pressure, if our company tax rate reduces further it will put added pressure on revenue sources.

That is an issue that the Tax Working Group will need to consider.

We need a tax system that works now and into the future.

**DTAs**

Withholding tax on cross-border income has been subject to similar international pressures.

Over the last few years, many other countries have been progressively reducing their withholding tax rates on cross-border income flows, which has put pressure on New Zealand to do the same.

When Australia lowered its rates with the United States a few years ago we were left in a difficult situation if we wanted to keep our companies in New Zealand.

Consequently, as part of the international tax review, in 2007 New Zealand developed a new double tax agreement strategy to reduce withholding tax rates with our major trading partners.

The strategy is designed to reduce tax barriers to New Zealand businesses investing offshore and to the repatriation of profits when that investment takes place.

We already had some mechanisms in domestic law to reduce the impact of withholding tax, such as the foreign investor tax credit and approved issuer levy.

However, it is preferable to agree to lower withholding tax in our double tax agreements so as to achieve reciprocal reductions.

Australia has been reducing withholding taxes in its major treaties over the last ten years.

We have now done that in new or updated DTAs with Australia and the United States, and we are looking forward to doing the same thing with our other major trading partners.

I am pleased to announce that, for the same purpose, re-negotiation of our DTA with Canada will begin in November, and re-negotiation of our DTA with the United Kingdom will begin in February.

### Other policy work

I would like to turn now to developments in a number of other projects on our work programme.

**Gift duty**

I noticed that your programme includes a session with the rather poignant title of "Gift duty - the forgotten tax".

I do not think that what I am about to say next will any way harm David McLay's carefully prepared presentation on gift duty - on the contrary, it may enrich the context of the discussion.

Gift duty has not been completely forgotten.

Indeed, the Government is soon to embark on a review of the scope of the tax.

Gift duty serves to protect against the use of so-called "gifts" for purposes of income tax avoidance, sheltering assets from creditors or spouses, and avoiding obligations such as paying child support.

Over the past year or so there have been repeated requests for the Estate and Gift Duties Act be amended to exempt certain gifts from gift duty.

In considering those requests, it became apparent that the current exemptions from gift duty that are set out in law are fairly ad hoc, and there appears to be no coherent framework to determining which exemptions should be granted.

This leads to some undesirable inconsistencies - for example, gifts to some central and local government entities, such as Te Papa, are exempt from gift duty, whereas gifts to others, such as the Auckland Art Gallery, are not.

Furthermore, the way the legislation is currently structured means that a gift attracts the tax unless it is specifically exempted.

Instead of continuing to determine exemptions on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis, it may be better to consider narrowing the ambit of gift duty so that it applies only to certain "gifts" - such as transfers of property to natural persons, family trusts and closely held companies.

That is only one of several options that will be the subject of consultation early next year.

In the meantime, given that the review will take some time, the taxation bill planned for introduction in November is likely to include a number of specific exemptions.

**Portability of retirement savings**

The November tax bill will also include legislation that allows transfers of retirement savings between certain Australian superannuation funds and New Zealand KiwiSaver funds.

You may recall that in July, Australia and New Zealand signed a memorandum of understanding that paved the way for portability of these savings.

It is good news for people who have retirement savings in both Australia and New Zealand, as many people have, because they will be able to consolidate them into one account in their current country of residence.

The bill is expected to be passed by the middle of next year.

The portability arrangement will take effect two months after both countries have enacted the necessary legislation.

**Binding rulings**

I will shortly be taking to Cabinet my proposals for changes to the binding rulings legislation to clarify certain key provisions and ensure they apply as intended.

Binding rulings were introduced in 1991 to provide taxpayers with greater certainty about the tax implications of entering into business transactions for which the interpretation of law is a key element.

The issues paper released for public consultation in July focused on suggested changes to the legislation, not the administration of the process.

One of the main issues explored in the paper was the need to clarify the ability of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to rule on section BG 2 of the Income Tax Act.

The other key issue raised in the paper concerned the Commissioner's discretion to decline to rule if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to an objection, challenge or appeal.

The paper also covered needed clarification of the law in relation to matters such as fee waivers, rulings on mass-marketed schemes and partially successful rulings.

Many of the submissions that were received commented on administrative problems such as the time it takes Inland Revenue to issue a binding ruling.

These are administrative matters, not legislative ones, and they are currently under discussion between Inland Revenue and representatives of the legal, accounting and business sectors.

I am advised by the Commissioner that good progress is being made in providing a speedier service in this area.

The proposed legislative amendments should cover most of the matters outlined in the issues paper.

**Disputes**

The smooth functioning of the process for resolving disputes between taxpayers and Inland Revenue is another area of great interest to your institute, as it is many others, the Government included.

Some of the concerns about the process that you have identified are clearly administrative matters and are best resolved by means of administrative measures.

Indeed, I am aware that Inland Revenue has reached agreement with your institute and the New Zealand Law Society on many of the administrative changes that you sought in your recent joint submission to me and to the department.

On the other hand, there remain a number of possible legislative matters still to be worked through - in particular, whether taxpayers should be allowed to opt out unilaterally from the full disputes process, whether new timeframes are needed, and whether the rules should be simplified for disputes involving small amounts.

The legislative aspects of your concerns can be dealt with through the normal tax policy process.

An issues paper planned for release in the first half of next year will set out the policy rationale for the current legislation in these areas, as well as possible options for change.

The paper will also cover a number of legislative issues on which there is agreement between Inland Revenue, the institute and the Law Society - such as the need to relax the evidence exclusion and exceptional circumstances provisions.

**Charitable giving  
**

As you know, Inland Revenue also manages a raft of important social policy programmes, including KiwiSaver, Working for Families tax credits, student loans and child support.

It also has a key role in the charity sector.

As Minister of Revenue, I have always taken a particular interest in this aspect of the Revenue portfolio and will continue to do so.

As you know, encouraging a culture of charitable giving in New Zealand has long been an important policy goal of mine.

Last year saw the lifting of the caps on the tax relief for donations given to charities and other philanthropic organisations.

The omnibus taxation bill that passed last month introduced a voluntary payroll giving scheme that will allow employees to make regular charitable donations directly from their pay, as part of an employer-initiated workplace giving scheme.

The scheme will be available to employers who wish to offer it to their employees from 7 January next year.

Looking to the future, work continues on other tax incentive options that other countries have used to encourage philanthropy and generosity.

For example, the Government is exploring the merits of a gift aid type scheme that enables the tax benefits of donations to go directly to the donee rather than the donor, and making it possible to claim tax relief on items of cultural significance to New Zealand.

This work will be carried out in the early part of next year.

**Child support**

Within a few weeks I hope to be able to release a discussion document setting out proposed changes to aspects of the government's child support scheme.

About one in five of the letters I receive as Minister of Revenue are from people who are unhappy about some aspect of the scheme.

The question of when the discussion document is coming out is frequently asked by correspondents, many of whom seem eager to have their say on what they see as the shortcomings of the present scheme.

It should be pointed out, however, that by its very nature, an externally imposed child support scheme will be less flexible than good private arrangements between parents.

Fortunately for them and their children, many separated parents are able to make private, relatively amicable child support arrangements.

The state scheme is there as a back-up for those parents who are on a benefit or who are unable to make satisfactory private arrangements.

Although there is always room for improvement, a state-provided child support scheme cannot satisfy all participants all the time.

A lot has changed - in patterns of raising children, in workforce participation, and in family law - since the scheme was introduced, in 1992.

It is now timely, therefore, to look at updating it in some key areas.

The discussion document will seek people's view on proposals to update the child support formula that determines how much child support a parent must pay.

The proposed changes will take into consideration levels of shared care, the costs of raising children today, and the income of both parents, leading to a revised formula that takes better account of modern parenting arrangements.

I expect to receive a great many submissions on the matters under discussion, and the Government will have to weigh up the pros and cons of any changes of this nature before deciding on the next steps.

People who do not wish to write a formal submission on the proposals set out in the discussion document will be able take part in an online consultation if they wish to do so.

If all goes well, it may be possible to legislate for resulting changes to the scheme sometime next year.

**Income splitting**

Income splitting, or allowing families with children to split their incomes for tax purposes, thereby reducing their overall tax liability, also remains an area of great interest to me.

Indeed, the post-election Confidence and Supply Agreement between my party, United Future, and National includes support to the first reading in Parliament for a bill giving effect to our income splitting policy.

The idea was first floated in a discussion document published in April last year, to which there was a good response.

That initial consultation is to be followed up by an officials' issues paper, planned for release by the end of this year, seeking submissions on the detailed design of the proposal.

**Legislation**

While on the topic of forthcoming legislative changes I would like to devote a few words to taxation bills generally.

It has been an extraordinarily busy year on the legislative front, and I suspect we are all suffering some degree of bill fatigue.

That "we" includes your institute and the many tax practitioners here today who regularly make detailed submissions on proposed legislation.

You play a hugely important role in helping to ensure that proposed legislation works effectively.

Last December, you may recall, saw the introduction and passage under urgency of tax changes announced in the lead-up to last year's general election.

Those changes included a three-year programme of personal tax cuts, introduction of an independent earner tax credit, repeal of the research and development tax credit, and changes to KiwiSaver.

In February of this year the Government announced a series of legislative changes aimed at making it easier for small and medium businesses to manage their cash flows and meet their tax obligations in what was a time of global financial crisis.

Those changes were in place by March.

This year's Budget announcements included the deferral of personal tax cuts that were to have taken effect over the next two years, to prevent further increases in government debt.

A taxation bill giving effect to those and other tax changes was introduced under urgency on Budget day, passing its final stages on the following day.

Throughout all this, the substantial taxation bill that had been introduced in July 2008 made its slow and stately progress through Parliament.

The bill introduced a number of major business reforms, including the first stage of the reform of New Zealand's international tax rules, reform of the taxation of the life insurance business, and changes to strengthen the definitions of "associated persons" in income tax law.

The progress of the bill was delayed in part by the election, since it was one of nearly 80 bills that lapsed when Parliament rose for the election.

It was reinstated by the new Parliament in December, when it resumed its place before a new select committee that had to come to grips with its formidable content.

The bill's slow progress was also due in part to its sheer size, complexity and scope.

At one point the bill was over 800 pages long.

Every activity connected with it - from drafting, to select committee consideration, to proof-reading - took much longer than it would have normally.

The situation was not helped by the unavoidable addition to the bill along the way of various new measures that had arisen in the meantime - and by the need to change the application dates as originally proposed because of the time that had passed since introduction.

It was a relief to everyone involved when the bill passed its final stages in Parliament last month, having slimmed down to a mere 630-odd pages along the way.

As I told Parliament at the bill's second reading, in July, I hope we will be able to keep future tax bills to a more manageable size and scope.

It was a promising start, therefore, when the tax bill introduced later in July weighed in at about 50 pages.

The focus of that bill is on new withholding tax rates on interest paid to individuals, to align them with personal income tax rates.

The bill will inevitably be added to and changed as it progresses through Parliament, but should definitely be much faster and easier to deal with, with passage expected before Christmas.

### Better value for money in the tax administration

The final big issue I want to address today is the need for a more efficient and effective public service as reflected in the Inland Revenue Department, my area of responsibility.

We cannot achieve a world-class, internationally competitive tax system by policy measures alone.

We also need a first-class tax administration that collects revenue and delivers services with speed and certainty.

In the time since I was chairman of the Finance and Expenditure Committee's Inquiry into Inland Revenue, in 1999, I have been impressed with the improvements the department has made.

There is, however, still room for improvement, especially at a time when the government is pushing to ensure that we get increasing value for money from the public service as a whole.

Greater efficiency will not be achieved by increased funding for the public service - there is simply no money for that.

The public service has to think and act smarter - just as the private sector has to do.

With that in mind, Inland Revenue is embarking upon a major transformation exercise.

It needs to move away from the technology and management style of the 1980s, when the FIRST computer system was built, to a model suited to this century.

That will mean making increasing use of e-business tools and the internet, tools that did not exist in the 1980s.

Let me illustrate this point with an example I have used on a number of occasions, because it is a very good example.

Each working day Inland Revenue posts, on average, over 100,000 envelopes containing various pieces of correspondence.

That is over half a million letters a week, and over 25 million letters a year.

It is an impressive amount of mail for a population of a little over four million people.

Inland Revenue is aware that it needs to cut that mail dramatically.

Streamlining the system will require some policy and legislative changes, which the government will back.

We need to if we want to have a 21st century tax administration.

**Student loans**

Cabinet has given the go-ahead to legislation that will dramatically simplify the administration of student loan repayments, as a first step in the modernisation process.

The idea is to move away from the time-consuming paper-based management of loan repayments to electronic management and communication.

A bill giving effect to the student loan changes will be introduced later this year.

The next step in the transformation process will be to look at what can be done with PAYE and the personal tax summary systems.

**PAYE**

The employer monthly schedule is the key vehicle for operating the PAYE process.

It helps to bring in about 41 percent of Crown revenue through the collection of PAYE, child support and student loan repayments.

When it was introduced, in 2000, the employer monthly schedule provided an efficient mechanism through which Inland Revenue could interact with employers in the collection of payments and information.

It also removed the need for employers to carry out an annual PAYE reconciliation and for employees to complete an annual income tax return.

However, over the years, pressure on the schedule has mounted.

As a result, the employer monthly schedule has now reached its limit in terms of the amount of information it can contain.

For example, the use of the schedule to collect KiwiSaver deductions since 2007 has added significantly to that amount of information that needs to be collected via the schedule, adding further complexity to it.

The schedule has become so complex that employers now make a lot of errors in completing it, requiring greater Inland Revenue intervention.

The systems are predominantly paper-based, labour- intensive, and at capacity.

Despite Inland Revenue's efforts to get employers to move from paper filing to electronic filing, only about 26 percent of the 180,000 schedules that Inland Revenue receives are sent electronically.

I have even been told of a group of about 20,000 employers who calculate their PAYE deductions electronically and then print them out, put them into an envelope and post them to Inland Revenue - instead of filing them electronically.

All this has led to the processing of employer monthly schedules becoming very expensive and less sustainable by the year.

The implementation of future tax and tax-related social policy changes, and there will inevitably be some, will be seriously compromised if the employer monthly schedule has to accommodate even more information.

The only answer is to go electronic and, as with student loans, get rid of the paper, the telephone contacts, and the manual interventions.

To that end, Inland Revenue has been giving serious consideration over recent months to what a future PAYE system might look like, one that is fast, efficient and gives greater certainty to all involved.

**Personal tax summary**

Any changes to the PAYE system will subsequently affect the personal tax summary system, which is also operating at capacity.

The personal tax summary replaced the requirement for individuals who earned income solely from salary and wages to file a tax return.

Instead, the idea was for Inland Revenue to issue an income statement showing gross income, tax deducted and refunds due only if an individual requested one or had a student loan or received family support.

In other words, the personal tax summary provided a means for individuals to reconcile their tax affairs if required.

There are now increasing pressures on the personal tax summary process, which was designed in a paper-based environment.

At the time it was envisaged that only a small minority of individual taxpayers, perhaps about 400,000 at most, would request one.

All that changed with the numerous changes over recent years to social policy programmes that interact with the tax system, such as Working for Families, and with the advent of personal tax summary intermediaries, who have stimulated great interest in personal tax summaries.

As a result of those changes, increasing numbers of individual taxpayers are requesting an end-of-year square-up, which means a growing number of interactions with Inland Revenue.

Therefore any consideration into how Inland Revenue can move towards a world-class tax administration will necessarily involve thinking about long-term measures that will not only deal with the symptoms but also with the system itself.

I have cited these examples in some detail to give you an idea of the detailed work that will be required if Inland Revenue is to be in a position to provide better value for money.

These are early days yet in planning the next stages in the modernisation of the tax administration.

Detailed proposals have yet to be developed, much less agreed to by Cabinet.

There will of course be a lot of consultation with affected taxpayers, tax advisors, and professional bodies such as your institute.

**Conclusion**

I will conclude today by thanking you once again for your continued contribution to tax policy and to an improved tax system, one that better meets the needs of the 21st century.

I wish you a very successful conference.

Finance Minister's speech to NZICA
==================================

In his speech to NZICA's 2009 tax conference on 17 October, Finance Minister Bill English explained the Government's economic plan, some of the challenges it faces, and the role that tax policy will play in the recovery. The Government would respond early next year to the options put forward by the Tax Working Group, which is expected to report in December, he said.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Equity and fairness key to tax considerations

Equity and fairness will guide the Government's consideration of the Tax Working Group's options for changes to the tax system, Finance Minister Bill English said today.

"The benefits must clearly outweigh any potential difficulties to warrant significant changes," he said in a speech to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Auckland. "Equity and fairness will be key considerations, alongside benefits for the economy and for households."

The Tax Working Group, led by Victoria University's Centre for Accounting, Governance and Taxation Research, is taking a first principles look at the tax system. It is also considering how tax can contribute to economic growth based on exports, investment and sustainable jobs.

"The group is looking at proposals that, when taken together, are fiscally neutral," Mr English said. "The Government has a strong preference not to increase taxes to close the budget deficit. We prefer more efficient taxes over higher taxes.

"And, unlike other many other countries, we have no desire to increase the tax take."

The Tax Working Group is due to report in December and its options will be considered by the Government early next year, Mr English said.

New Zealand would also need to be mindful of international developments – particularly the Henry tax review in Australia.

"Australia is our largest trading partner, the source of much of our foreign investment and a destination that lures large numbers of Kiwi workers abroad, so we are keeping a close eye on developments.

"If the Henry Review results in Australia moving to lower its taxes, our own review will leave us well placed to consider options that maintain our international competitiveness."

SPEECH

### Speech to New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants  
Tax Conference  
Rendezvous Hotel, Auckland  
Saturday, October 17, 2009

Good afternoon and thank you. It is a pleasure to be here.

It's great to have the opportunity to explain the Government's economic plan and lay out some of the challenges we face - along with the role tax policy will play.

The Government has a very clear plan to increase our productivity, grow our exports and start narrowing the income gap with our trading partners. We're focused on what matters: jobs and growth.

Since the election, the economy has been the Government's top priority.

One of the main effects of the recession has been a big fall in forecast tax, putting pressure on Government spending and limiting policy options.

We are not alone. Governments around the world are facing the same  
pressures.

Wrestling debt under control will be the fate of many Western countries as they emerge from the current crisis. They will end up with smaller public services, lower pensions or increased taxes as a result.

New Zealand is better placed than many countries in determining how it responds.

We don't want to go down the route of raising taxes. We are committed to a tax system that contributes to economic growth, is competitive internationally and helps New Zealand families get ahead.

As we emerge from the recession it is worth pausing to reflect on whether our tax system is as simple, fair, efficient and robust as it can be.

**The fiscal and economic challenge**

But first, it's important to understand the wider economic and fiscal environment in which we are considering our tax policy options.

Our current economic and fiscal challenges are more significant than we have seen for two or three generations.

The Government inherited a New Zealand economy that had gone into recession in early 2008 and was under considerable stress from imbalances built up over the past decade.

It's now clear that our economy started to get out of balance around 2003 - and it has since got progressively worse. Here's what I mean:

*   Bank credit and household debt started blowing out
*   Non-tradeables inflation took off and remained high at around 4 per cent
*   Government spending ballooned - increasing by 50 per cent in the past five years - double the rate of economic growth and government revenue
*   And since 2003, our productivity has sunk to a 25-year low.

Let me set out two indicators of our lopsided economy:

First the tradeables sector - that's exporters or industries competing with imports - has actually been in recession for five years, contracting by about 10 per cent in that time.

Even more staggering, there have been almost no net jobs created in the tradeables side of the economy for the past 10 years.

By contrast, the non-tradeables sector - domestic industries not competing with exports, including the Government - has grown by 15 per cent in the past five years.

The second symptom of New Zealand's unbalanced growth is the red ink in the Government's accounts - the result of fast-rising spending and falling revenue.

The Crown accounts for the year to June 30, 2009, released this week, illustrate the problems we face.

Revenue was $2 billion lower than in 2008, spending jumped by $7 billion and the operating deficit stretched to $10.5 billion - an almost $13 billion turnaround from the $2.4 billion surplus 2008.

We now face cash deficits of between $10 billion and $12 billion for each of the next four years. On current projections, we will not be back in budget surplus for a decade.

The recession has had a significant impact on the Government's books.

Over the four years from 2008, our total GDP will be permanently $50 billion lower than if the global financial crisis had not occurred. That means the Government will collect about $16 billion less tax revenue.

With expenses continuing to grow regardless, we will double government debt by 2014 - borrowing an average rate of $250 million every week for the next four years.

One of the consequences of issuing all of this debt is that the Government's finance costs will increase markedly.

In recent years, these costs have sat around $2.5 billion a year. Budget 2009 forecast finance costs to double to more than $5 billion a year by 2014 - roughly the combined amount spent on law and order and defence.

So these finance costs will compete directly with spending on more worthwhile public services.

It was entirely appropriate for the Government to increase its borrowing to cushion New Zealanders from the worst effects of the recession. We are doing this to maintain public services, preserve entitlements and prepare the economy for sustainable productive growth.

However, additional borrowing on this scale cannot continue indefinitely and the Government has taken steps to ensure the rising tide of debt is turned back.

Let me stress here that public finance cycles are long.

Net government debt rose steadily from the early 1970s and peaked at over 50 per cent of GDP in 1992. It then took another 16 years of near continuous growth to get it down and almost eliminate it by 2008.

So we can now expect it to take 20 to 30 years for the Government's finances to recover from the impact of this recession.

**The Government's economic programme**

Before I discuss our thinking about tax policy in more detail, I'd like to set out the Government's plan for dealing with these challenges and increasing New Zealand's economic performance.

It's important that tax policy is seen within this wider context.

We have identified six key drivers of our economic programme over the next three to five years:

_The first area is reforming the regulatory environment and cutting away red tape getting in the way of business and productive investment._

Regulatory Reform Minister Rodney Hide has been extremely busy working with the Government to get this significant two-year review programme underway.

It includes the Overseas Investment Act, the Resource Management Act, the Building Act, the Holidays Act, electricity and telecommunications rules, and the emissions trading legislation.

_The Government's second policy driver is significantly lifting the performance of the public sector, while reducing the rate of spending increases._

You will have heard a little about this from Revenue Minister Peter Dunne yesterday when he spoke about work being done to "Transform IR".

The public sector represents about 30 per cent of the economy, so it's ssential that it plays its part, particularly with the Government's finances under pressure.

We've made it clear that we will improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of spending, while limiting the negative impacts of public policies on private enterprise.

_The next area is investing in productive infrastructure._

The challenge here is quite simple. It is to ensure that the right level of investment is made in the right places by organisations with the knowledge and incentives to invest.

Earlier this year, we established the National Infrastructure Unit. One of its roles is producing the first National Infrastructure Plan by early next year - a stock take of current demands and investment programmes which will become the focal point for industry co-operation.

The impact of the Government's programme on infrastructure investment is already evident. We are investing $7.5 billion over the next five years to build and upgrade schools, roads, housing, hospitals and telecommunications.

_The Government's fourth policy driver is education and skills. There are several parts to the Government's focus in this important area._

The first is literacy and numeracy at primary schools, driven by National Standards, which will set clear expectations, measure children's progress against those expectations and report their progress to parents in plain English.

The second area is providing options for secondary-age students outside the traditional school system.

_The Government's fifth policy driver is innovation and business assistance. This covers government and business investment in research and development, in innovation, and in developing new markets and products._

Our considerable investment in this area will help firms connect with overseas markets and consumers; as well as help them develop new ideas to create new and higher value products and services.

Those goals will help drive productivity growth and investment in the tradeables sector, and improve our export performance.

_Finally, let me turn to taxation - the sixth focus of the Government's economic policy agenda for the next three to five years - and no doubt the area you are keen to hear about today._

Taxation is one of our six policy drivers because of the pervasive influence it has on both the economy at large and on decisions made by individuals.

As we have said, New Zealand needs to lift its economic growth.

That's all the more important with 60,000 people now on the unemployment benefit and with unemployment likely to continue rising well into next year.  
We also need to increase household incomes so they can save, repay debt and, from the Government's perspective, so it can get back to budget surpluses sooner.

This Government sees a simple, fair and efficient tax system that encourages New Zealand families to get ahead under their own steam as one of the key drivers of economic growth.

Ideally, the tax system should impose the minimum cost necessary to get the revenue needed for vital frontline services and to support the most vulnerable.  
That means it should be simple to administer, easy to comply with and not drive behaviour and investment decisions.

It should also provide the right incentives - allowing people to keep more of their own money encourages them to invest time and effort into improving their skills so they can earn more. This also has a productivity benefit for the economy.

In addition, the system should be fair - most forms of income should be covered and where possible loopholes that allow the sheltering of income to avoid tax should be closed.

Lastly, our tax system must be internationally competitive - New Zealand with its small population and capital markets needs to attract skilled workers and encourage people to invest here.

And if our economy is to thrive, we need to ensure our best and brightest have good reasons to stay.

It is no secret we have one of the most internationally mobile labour forces in the OECD, with huge numbers of Kiwis living overseas, the second highest proportion of expats after Ireland and strong migrant flows.

In short, we rely on high levels of inward migration and investment.

The tax system should help New Zealand attract and retain the people, businesses and investment it needs.

Until recently, the relative simplicity of the New Zealand tax system was one of its strengths. However, it has become increasingly complicated.

**Tax Working Group**

Earlier this year, the Minister of Revenue and I announced the establishment of a Tax Working Group, led by Victoria University's Centre for Accounting, Governance and Taxation Research to review our tax system.

The aim was to take a first principles look at the system and see how it could be improved - and in recent months the working group has set out some of its ideas in a series of public papers.

The working group is looking at proposals that, when taken together, are fiscally neutral. The Government has a strong preference not to increase taxes to close the deficit. We prefer more efficient taxes over higher taxes.

And, unlike many other countries, we have no desire to increase the tax take.

Some of the challenges the Tax Working Group is considering are:

*   Whether the efficiency and integrity of the tax system could be improved through changes to the tax mix. This will include consideration of the Government's 30/30/30 tax goal, and challenges associated with this in the current environment.
*   Whether the tax base could be broadened so we are less reliant on personal and corporate tax.
*   Whether changes to the tax mix could tilt the playing field away from borrowing and spending towards exports, investment and sustainable jobs.
*   How we could simplify the tax system to reduce compliance costs and make it as easy as possible to administer.

I'd like to take this opportunity to commend the Tax Working Group's work to date. The calibre of its experts - drawn from government, academia and the private sector - is extremely high. So far it has tackled its brief with clarity and rigour.

The group's work is also extremely timely. Across the Tasman the Australians are conducting a review of their own tax system, led by the Secretary to the Treasury, Ken Henry.

Australia is our largest trading partner, the source of much of our foreign investment and a destination that lures large numbers of Kiwi workers abroad, so we are keeping a close eye on developments.

If the Henry review results in Australia moving to lower its taxes, our own review will leave us well placed to consider options that maintain our international competitiveness.

So I look forward to receiving the Tax Working Group's report in December. We will consider its findings in the New Year and any changes will be signalled in Budget 2010.

The benefits must clearly outweigh any potential difficulties to warrant significant changes.

Let me be clear, equity and fairness will be key considerations, alongside benefits for the economy and for households.

The Tax Working Group's papers on property-related taxes have generated a lot of public debate.

And so too has the idea of increasing GST to provide revenue for personal tax cuts. The main issue here is fairness - low income earners, in particular, would have to be compensated for any increase in GST.

There are arguments for and against these ideas and I'm happy for the working group to consider them. As a Government, we welcome debate, but we must be practical and realistic.

As Prime Minister John Key and I have both stated previously: the Tax Working Group will have to come up with some fairly compelling reasons to convince us of the overall benefits of further property-related taxes or an increase in GST.

**High marginal tax rates**

The working group has raised a number of issues in its papers released so far. One of them is our internationally high marginal tax rates.

An average wage earner with children loses over half of every extra dollar they earn, once our high top tax rates and the abatement of Working for Families tax credits are taken into account.

This puts us in the bottom half of the 30 OECD countries on this measure. In the UK, France and Japan, the same worker would get to keep far more of every extra dollar earned.

Getting to keep less than half of what they earn is hardly an incentive for people to aspire to higher incomes.

In New Zealand the top rate of 38c starts at just $70,000 - about 1.5 times the average wage. This is much lower than the OECD average, which is about 2.4 times the average wage.

In Australia the top rate at 45c is higher but you need to earn over A$180,000 to pay it, while in the US the top rate is about 40 per cent, but you need to earn about NZ$340,000 before you pay it.

Differential tax rates and income support like Working for Families and student allowances create big incentives for people to minimise their "taxable income".

This is amply illustrated by the 9700 high-income families with rental properties, who last year claimed tax losses, enhancing their eligibility for Working for Families payments.

A case can also be made that a wide gap between the corporate and the top personal rates provides incentives to use the company structure to avoid the top personal rates.

A key issue here is the overall credibility of the system. Large scale legitimate avoidance behaviour by higher income earners undermines the goodwill of lower income earners.

It's quite telling that there has been virtually no growth in the number of people paying tax on $1 million of annual income since the 39 cent top personal tax rate was introduced 10 years ago.

We don't want people spending their time and resources trying to avoid tax. Equally we also don't want IRD devoting all its time to chasing tax and compliance issues.

As a country, we want families, businesses, accountants and lawyers looking at how to unlock greater income and productivity, not working out how to minimise their tax.

I'm pleased to see the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and Tax Management New Zealand proactively looking at how the tax system for small businesses could be simplified to reduce compliance costs.

They have set out two proposals:

One is for micro businesses earning under $60,000 a year and not registered for GST to pay a final tax of 15 per cent based on turnover.

The other proposal is for businesses with annual turnover of less than $1.2 million to have their income tax calculated on a cash basis, based on their GST return.

I understand that a final report will be submitted to the Government next year for our consideration, after consultation with the SME sector.

I believe these proposals have merit and they will not be dismissed out of hand. Tax policy officials will engage with the Institute on them.

**Examining the tax mix**

Another area the Tax Working Group is considering is the tax mix.

As a country, New Zealand relies heavily on the taxes that are most damaging to growth - income and corporate taxes. Nearly 60 per cent of our revenue comes from these two sources.

Here are some facts worth considering:

*   In 2000 around 5 per cent of wage earners paid the top personal tax rate. In 2009 this has climbed to 9 per cent and it is expected to reach 25 per cent in 10 years.
*   We collect the third highest ratio of corporate tax to GDP in the OECD.

At the same time, distortions are created by the things we do not tax.

Most people would see it as unfair, for example, that speculators can reap large tax-free gains while low and middle income workers are taxed on every dollar they earn.

Inland Revenue has published data showing that last year the losses claimed by people with rental properties were $575 million more than the income declared from residential rentals.

The net reduction in Government revenue was approximately $150 million, while the capital value of this asset class roughly doubled.

This is a recent trend. In 1999 rental properties generated over $600 million in taxable income.

Industries like farming, manufacturing and tourism, are vital to providing sustainable jobs as we come out of the recession.

However, in recent years, large increases in property values have contributed to high interest rates for these sectors.

Those higher interest rates, in turn, push up our dollar, reducing exporters' margins and making it more expensive for businesses to borrow. Again, this cycle harms our productive industries.

**Conclusion**

Can I finish by reiterating that the Government is clear about what needs to be done to turn this economy around. We have a balanced, targeted and effective plan to achieve that.

However we need to make sure we get the kind of recovery we want - one that will create sustainable jobs and growth.

Despite our considerable economic challenges, I'm confident about New Zealand's prospects because of the resilience demonstrated by many New Zealanders. We are seeing early signs of recovery, which I welcome.

By backing ourselves as a country, we have a real opportunity to emerge from the recession stronger and more competitive than other countries.

Thank you.

Revenue Minister's policy update
================================

In a speech today to the "Accountants in Practice" conference, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne updated the audience on developments in the Government's tax policy work. For more information see the [speech](/news/2009/2009-11-10-revenue-ministers-policy-update#speech)

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### Address to Conferenz 5th Annual One Stop Update  
Accountants in Practice Conference  
10am, Intercontinental Hotel, Wellington

I am very pleased to speak to your conference today on developments in tax policy.

The Government's tax policy work programme, which was announced in March this year, and updated in September, has four broad themes.

They are:

1.  Better positioning New Zealand in the world economy.
2.  Responding effectively to the changing economic and fiscal environment.
3.  Maintaining tax revenue.
4.  Improving tax administrative systems, so that they can operate more effectively and deliver greater value for money.

These four, very broad themes cover just about everything on the government's tax policy work programme.

But before I go into specific policy projects that may be of interest to you I will turn for a moment to the influence of the fiscal and economic climate on tax policy, because, whatever else may be the case, the fiscal and economic climate will always be critical in setting tax policy.

When it was elected, late last year, the new Government faced an immediate challenge from the worldwide economic crisis.

As a small, open economy with high levels of external debt, New Zealand was especially exposed to the economic downturn, which in late 2008 threatened a re-run of the depression of the 1930s.

However, several months down the track, there is now growing confidence that such a scenario has been averted by the actions of governments throughout the world, including New Zealand's.

The position now seems to have stabilised.

But although there are positive signs, the world economy is still not robust, with the hangover from the turbulence likely to be with us for some time.

Since 2008 the New Zealand Government has gone from budget surpluses to deficits.

And the Treasury's post-election, medium-term fiscal projections are for budget deficits to remain until the 2016/17 year.

Even then we will return to a sustainable fiscal position only by fiscal drag moving the average worker on to the top personal marginal tax rate of 38 percent.

That is why the Government is committed to moving to an alignment of the top personal tax rate, company rate and trustee rate at a maximum of 30 percent as a desirable medium-term goal.

It just so happens that alignment has long been UnitedFuture's policy, so obviously it has my full support.

But moving towards such alignment while also achieving a sound fiscal position requires us to look again at the tax system in fundamental ways.

This examination is being done in conjunction with the Tax Working Group, which is being co-ordinated by Victoria University.

The working group is leading a debate on the medium-term direction of New Zealand's tax system.

In doing so it is drawing on the experiences of other countries and their tax systems.

Some other countries have capital gains taxes and land taxes.

One question for the working group whether there is a place for such taxes in the New Zealand tax mix.

This is a discussion we should and need to have, but encouraging the debate is not without its political difficulties.

Despite what you may have heard from the media, the Government has made no decisions on the future tax mix.

What is more, the working group itself has not yet reached a final position on the many options, let alone presented it to the Government.

The Government is also closely monitoring the progress of Australia's comprehensive review of its tax system, which is chaired by Dr Ken Henry and is expected to report in December.

Tax developments in Australia, our closest economic partner, are of special importance to us, given our economic interaction and the fact that about 55 percent of foreign direct investment into New Zealand is from Australia.

New Zealand's submission to the Henry review, made in October last year at the invitation of the Australian Treasurer, presented the case for introducing trans-Tasman mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits.

I believe that mutual recognition is essential if we are to have a truly Single Economic Market, while retaining our respective imputation systems.

We have put our own review of aspects of our imputation system on hold until we know the outcome of the review.

Regardless of what results from the review, there will doubtless be important tax consequences for New Zealand.

All this is a reminder of how important it is to ensure our tax system remains competitive in a changing world.

It is also a key focus of the Tax Working Group.

In the meantime, we have made major progress in the reform of our international tax rules.

The taxation bill that passed its final stages in Parliament in September removed tax on active income earned through offshore subsidiaries and on foreign dividends received by New Zealand parent companies.

The idea behind this far-reaching reform is to help New Zealand grow its own internationally competitive businesses.

That will not happen if our businesses face tax disadvantages they would not face if they shifted to Australia or somewhere else.

We have now moved our rules into line with Australia's, removing a major disadvantage for our businesses.

The next stage in the reform will be to take the policies we have now legislated for and apply them as appropriate, not just to subsidiaries but also to branches, joint ventures and other significant offshore investments.

A discussion document with suggestions on how the active income exemption could apply to significant interests in foreign investment funds will be released within the next few months, while rules for branches and financial CFCs will be developed next year.

To turn briefly to our double tax agreements with other countries, withholding tax on cross-border income has been subject to increasing international pressures.

Over the last few years, many other countries have been progressively reducing their withholding tax rates on cross-border income flows, which has put pressure on New Zealand to do the same.

Australia has been reducing withholding taxes in its major treaties over the last ten years.

New Zealand has now developed a new double tax agreement strategy to reduce withholding tax rates with our major trading partners.

The idea is to reduce tax barriers to New Zealand businesses investing offshore and to the repatriation of profits when that investment takes place.

We have recently done that in new or updated DTAs with Australia and the United States, and we are looking forward to doing the same thing with our other major trading partners.

Re-negotiation of our DTA with Canada will begin in November, and re-negotiation of our DTA with the United Kingdom will begin in February.

I would like to turn now to developments in a number of other projects on our work programme that you may be interested in.

The Government is soon to embark on a review of the scope of gift duty.

Gift duty serves to protect against the use of so-called "gifts" for purposes of income tax avoidance, sheltering assets from creditors or spouses, and avoiding obligations such as paying child support.

Over the past year or so there have been repeated requests for the Estate and Gift Duties Act to be amended to exempt certain gifts from gift duty.

In considering those requests, it became apparent that the current exemptions from gift duty that are set out in law are fairly ad hoc, and there appears to be no coherent framework to determining which exemptions should be granted.

This leads to some undesirable inconsistencies – for example, gifts to some central and local government entities, such as Te Papa, are exempt from gift duty, whereas gifts to others, such as the Auckland Art Gallery, are not.

Clearly, the policy needs sorting out, and just how this could be done will be the subject of consultation early next year that will give interested parties the opportunity to have their say.

A tax bill to be introduced shortly will include legislation that allows transfers of retirement savings between certain Australian superannuation funds and New Zealand KiwiSaver funds.

That is good news for people who have retirement savings in both Australia and New Zealand, as many people have, because they will be able to consolidate them into one account in their current country of residence.

The bill is expected to be passed by the middle of next year.

The portability arrangement will take effect two months after both countries have enacted the necessary legislation.

Income splitting, or allowing families with children to split their incomes for tax purposes, thereby reducing their overall tax liability, also remains an area of interest for me.

Indeed, the post-election Confidence and Supply Agreement between my party, UnitedFuture, and National includes support to the first reading in Parliament for a bill giving effect to my party's income splitting policy.

The idea was first floated in a discussion document published in April last year, to which there was a good response.

That initial consultation is to be followed up by an officials' issues paper, planned for release by the end of this year, seeking submissions on the detailed design of the proposal.

The forthcoming tax bill will also introduce some refinements to the KiwiSaver scheme, including more coherent policy for savers under 18.

The KiwiSaver Act does not prescribe who can contract with a provider on behalf of people under 18.

It is at the discretion of the provider whether or not an application is accepted.

Consequently, there have been complaints from parents, guardians and children themselves.

To provide certainty and clarity, the bill will introduce a new set of rules to prescribe how young savers can enrol in KiwiSaver.

One of the main changes is that those under the age of 16 may not enrol themselves, but must be enrolled by their legal guardians.

The final big theme I want to address today is the need for a more efficient and effective public service as reflected in the Inland Revenue Department, my area of responsibility.

We cannot achieve a world-class, internationally competitive tax system by policy measures alone.

We also need a first-class tax administration that collects revenue and delivers services with speed and certainty.

In the time since I was chairman of the Finance and Expenditure Committee's Inquiry into Inland Revenue, back in 1999, I have been impressed with the improvements the department has made.

There is, however, still room for improvement, especially at a time when the government is pushing to ensure that we get increasing value for money from the public service as a whole.

Greater efficiency will not be achieved by increased funding for the public service – there is simply no money for that.

The public service has to think and act smarter – just as the private sector has to do.

With that in mind, Inland Revenue is embarking upon a major transformation exercise.

It needs to move away from the technology and management style of the 1980s, when its computer system, FIRST, system was built, to a model suited to this century.

That will mean making increasing use of e-business tools and the internet, tools that did not exist in the 1980s.

I will illustrate this point with an example I have used on a number of occasions, because it is a very good example.

Each working day Inland Revenue posts, on average, over 100,000 envelopes containing various pieces of correspondence.

That is over half a million letters a week, and over 25 million letters a year.

It is an impressive amount of mail for a population of a little over four million people.

Inland Revenue is aware that it needs to cut that mail dramatically.

Streamlining the system will require some policy and legislative changes, which the government will back.

We need to if we want to have a 21st century tax administration.

The first step in the modernisation process is to simplify the administration of student loan repayments.

The idea is to move away from the time-consuming paper-based management of loan repayments to electronic management and communication.

A bill giving effect to the student loan changes is planned for early next year.

The next step in the transformation process will be to look at what can be done with PAYE and the personal tax summary systems.

These are early days yet in planning the next stages in the modernisation of the tax administration, and detailed proposals have yet to be developed, much less agreed to by Cabinet.

There will of course be a lot of consultation with affected taxpayers, tax advisors, and professional bodies.

To conclude, I trust this brief update has given you a glimpse an idea of where the Government is in terms of tax policy, and where we are going over the next year or so.

Thank you and I wish you all the best for your conference.

Revenue Minister speech to payroll conference
=============================================

In a speech today, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne described policy developments in areas relevant to payroll professionals, including KiwiSaver, PAYE and payroll giving. For more information see his [speech](/news/2009/2009-11-12-revenue-minister-speech-payroll-conference#speech)

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### Address to New Zealand Payroll Practitioners Association Annual Conference  
Ellerslie Racecourse, Auckland

I am very pleased to be with you today at the opening of your second annual conference.

I am aware of how very important your profession is to the smooth operation of the tax system and, by extension, to New Zealand's economy, and I want to acknowledge the contribution you make.

The PAYE system, in which you play a key role, is crucial to the collection of tax revenue.

In the year to June, Inland Revenue collected over $22 billion in PAYE deductions, which account for 37 percent of all government tax revenue.

Then there is the raft of social policy programmes that operate via payroll systems – such as student loans, child support, and KiwiSaver, to name just a few.

If you did not perform your job with such competence, I suspect that much of the tax system, as well as a number of social policy programmes, would simply fall over.

In my speech today I would like to briefly update you on some of the tax policy and legislative developments that affect your area of expertise.

There have been a lot of tax changes, many of them with payroll implications, since the general election, just over a year ago.

December saw the introduction and passage under urgency of tax measures announced in the lead-up to the general election.

Those changes included a three-year programme of personal tax cuts, introduction of an independent earner tax credit, repeal of the research and development tax credit, and changes to KiwiSaver.

In February of this year the Government announced a series of legislative changes aimed at making it easier for small and medium businesses to manage their cash flows and meet their tax obligations in what was a time of global financial crisis.

Those changes were enacted by March.

This year's Budget announcements included the deferral of personal tax cuts that were to have taken effect over the next two years, to prevent further increases in government debt.

A taxation bill giving effect to those and other tax changes was introduced under urgency on Budget day, passing its final stages on the following day.

Throughout all this, the substantial taxation bill that had been introduced in July 2008 slowly progressed through Parliament, passing eventually in September.

It introduced a number of major business reforms, including the first stage of the reform of New Zealand’s international tax rules, reform of the taxation of the life insurance business, and the introduction of payroll giving.

Another omnibus tax bill was introduced in July of this year.

Its focus is on new withholding tax rates on interest paid to individuals, to align those rates with personal income tax rates.

That bill is expected to pass before Christmas.

Looking back on it all, this has been an extraordinarily busy year on the tax front, not only for the Parliament, policy-makers, law drafters and tax professionals, but also for the many unsung heroes who have to make all these changes work.

As Minister of Revenue, I have long had an interest in promoting the charitable sector and charitable activity, which makes an important contribution to our social, cultural, environmental and economic well-being.

New Zealanders are generous in giving money and time for charitable purposes.

An estimated one million Kiwis take part in voluntary activities of one kind or another and they donate millions of dollars to charities and other non-profit organisations.

I am very proud to be associated with a number of changes over the last three or four years that have progressively strengthened the culture of charitable giving in this country.

Those changes range from removing the caps on the dollar amounts of charitable donations which are eligible for tax relief, to removing tax barriers to people giving generously of their time, to the introduction of payroll giving.

The new payroll giving scheme, which comes into force on 7 January, will enable people to donate to charitable and philanthropic causes through voluntary work-based payroll deductions.

The scheme will be voluntary for employers as well.

It will operate through the PAYE system and will be available to employers who file their employer monthly schedules electronically.

The introduction of payroll giving was one of several options that were subjected to extensive consultation, and it received strong public support.

A number of other countries have introduced payroll giving to encourage greater giving to charities and other non-profit organisations.

Their experience shows that payroll giving can have a number of benefits.

For charities, payroll giving can be an efficient, low-cost way to raise funds, and it can help to deliver the regular income support they need.

For employees, payroll giving provides a convenient and simple way to donate to charities of their choice.

In particular, it eliminates the need to collect receipts or wait until the end of the year to obtain the tax benefit of donations.

For employers, payroll giving can provide a low-cost and administratively simple way to support employee engagement in the community, while building employee morale and mobilising significant funding and volunteer resources for community benefit.

Some have already introduced payroll giving.

Others have expressed an interest but say they want to be sure they would not encounter undue compliance costs by introducing payroll giving into their workplace.

And this is where payroll developers can help, by developing systems that make payroll giving low-cost and hassle-free for their clients or employers.

Now I want to turn briefly to KiwiSaver, another area in which your profession plays an important role.

Since it came into force in 2007, KiwiSaver has been a great success, exceeding most people’s expectations.

Membership at the end of October this year had reached 1.2 million, having grown by 54 percent in the second year of its existence.

That translates to about 32,000 new savers joining every month, which is very impressive.

In the same year, $2.1 billion in contributions from members, employers and the Crown were passed from Inland Revenue to providers for investment, more than double the amount for the first year of operation.

I think we can safely assume that all the big changes to KiwiSaver have now been made.

The future should bring only fine-tuning of the legislation.

For example, a tax bill to be introduced later this month will contain a number of refinements to the legislation.

They include a new set of rules governing the enrolment of people who are under 18 and amendments that provide greater consistency between the PAYE rules and KiwiSaver rules for school children.

The bill will also provide for trans-Tasman portability of savings between certain Australian superannuation funds and KiwiSaver funds.

That is good news for people who have retirement savings in both countries and want to consolidate their savings in New Zealand.

The final big issue I want to address today is the need to modernise Inland Revenue systems, including the critically important PAYE system.

This is especially important at a time when the government is pushing to ensure that we get increasing value for money from the public service as a whole, at a time when every tax dollar counts.

With that in mind, Inland Revenue is embarking upon a major transformation exercise.

It needs to move away from the technology and management style of the 1980s, when its FIRST computer system was built, to a model suited to the present century.

That will mean making increasing use of e-business tools and the internet, tools that did not exist in the 1980s.

Let me illustrate this point with an example I have used on several occasions, because it is a very good example.

Each working day Inland Revenue posts, on average, over 100,000 envelopes containing various pieces of correspondence.

That is over half a million letters a week, and over 25 million letters a year.

It is an impressive amount of mail for a population of a little over four million people.

Inland Revenue knows that it has to cut that mail dramatically.

Sreamlining the system will require some policy and legislative changes, which the government will back.

The first step in the modernisation process is to simplify the administration of student loan repayments.

The idea is to move away from the time-consuming paper-based management of loan repayments to electronic management and communication.

A bill giving effect to those changes will be introduced early next year.

The next step in the transformation process will be to look at what can be done with PAYE and the personal tax summary systems.

The employer monthly schedule is the key vehicle for operating the PAYE process.

When it was introduced, in 2000, the employer monthly schedule provided an efficient mechanism through which Inland Revenue could interact with employers in the collection of payments and information.

It also removed the need for employers to carry out an annual PAYE reconciliation and for employees to complete an annual income tax return.

However, over the years, pressure on the schedule has mounted, and it has now reached the limits of the amount of information it can contain.

The schedule has now become so complex that employers now make a lot of errors in completing it, requiring greater Inland Revenue intervention.

Despite Inland Revenue's efforts to get employers to move from paper filing to electronic filing, only about 28 percent of the 180,000 schedules that Inland Revenue receives are sent electronically.

I have even been told of a group of about 20,000 employers who calculate their PAYE deductions electronically and then print them out, put them into an envelope and post them to Inland Revenue.

All this has led to the processing of employer monthly schedules becoming very expensive and less sustainable by the year.

The implementation of future tax and tax-related social policy changes, and there will inevitably be some, will be seriously compromised if the employer monthly schedule has to accommodate even more information.

The only answer is to go electronic and, as with student loans, get rid of the paper, the telephone contacts, and the manual interventions.

With that in mind, Inland Revenue has been giving serious consideration over recent months to what a future PAYE system might look like, one that is fast, efficient and gives greater certainty to all involved.

Any changes to the PAYE system will subsequently affect the personal tax summary system, which is also operating at capacity.

The personal tax summary replaced the requirement for individuals who earned income solely from salary and wages to file a tax return.

When the personal tax summary was introduced, it was envisaged that only a small minority of individual taxpayers, perhaps about 400,000 at most, would request one.

All that changed with the addition over recent years of numerous social policy programmes that interact with the tax system, and the advent of personal tax summary intermediaries, who have stimulated great public interest in acquiring a personal tax summary.

Increasing numbers of individual taxpayers are requesting an end-of-year square-up, which means a growing number of interactions with Inland Revenue have to take place.

Inland Revenue has begun initial planning for moving the tax administration into the 21st century, work that includes much more than strengthening its technological capabilities.

It also includes coming up with new ways at looking at PAYE and improving the PAYE system for employers.

These are early days, however, in planning the next stages in the modernisation of the tax administration.

Detailed proposals have yet to be developed and presented to the Government for consideration.

Before any changes are made, there will, of course, be a lot of consultation with affected taxpayers, tax advisors, professional bodies and payroll professionals.

Thank you and I wish you a very successful conference.

Guidelines for Schedule 32 inclusion
====================================

The Government today released its guidelines for the use of Cabinet criteria for determining eligibility for inclusion in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act, as guidance for organisations seeking charitable donee status for their overseas activities. Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said the information was being made available to give organisations information about the kind of questions that are asked when they seek overseas donee status, and to promote self-evaluation before they ask the Government to amend the law on their behalf. For more information see the [media release](/news/2009/2009-12-09-guidelines-schedule-32-inclusion#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Dunne: Guidance for charitable bodies seeking overseas donee status

The Government is providing greater guidance to organisations seeking charitable donee status for their overseas activities, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"Help comes in the form of a set of guidelines for using Cabinet criteria for determining an organisation's eligibility to have 'overseas' donee status in the Income Tax Act, which I am making available today for the information of organisations that request that status," Mr Dunne said.

"Recent months have seen a flood of requests for donee status for charitable activities overseas, probably as a result of the recent lifting of the limits on the tax relief that is available for donors.

"It has become clear that many of these organisations need a lot more guidance about what is involved, and that many of them think sending a request to Inland Revenue for overseas donee status means automatic entry into law.

"Organisations should note that there is nothing automatic about the process, nor is there a fast track - a lot of research, consultation and consideration go into the Government's decision to add an organisation to the list of those who have official donee status for their charitable activities overseas.

"For example, many organisations seem unaware that the Government looks at the credibility, transparency and accountability of an organisation, and at questions like whether its activities are ones that the Government would want to support, being mindful that taxpayers' funds should not be applied where there is a risk of private benefit or other misuse.

"The guidelines that I am making available today are nothing new - they are intended to give organisations information about the kind of questions that are asked when they seek overseas donee status, and to promote self-evaluation before they ask the Government to amend the law on their behalf.

"Organisations that request overseas donee status must demonstrate to the Government that they are robust in terms of their internal management and potential longevity, have adequate checks and balances in place for their project management and financial systems, and that they comply with the relevant law in New Zealand and the recipient countries.

"All this is essential to ensure that the tax relief afforded by overseas donee status is appropriately targeted and the potential for misuse of public money is minimised.

"This release of guidelines is an interim measure that will be followed in the first half of next year by a review of the relevant Cabinet guidelines and of the process for adding organisations to Schedule 32", Mr Dunne said.

### Guidelines

The Government must ensure that any organisation seeking overseas donee status is credible, transparent and accountable and its activities are ones that the Government would want to support, being mindful that tax credits should not be available where donations are made to an organisation and there is a risk of private benefit or other misuse.

For these purposes, a number of questions are asked of these organisations. The responses to any of these questions may not necessarily be determinative.

**Types of organisations**

The following questions help to clarify the types of organisations that the Government may consider for inclusion in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Key questions include:

*   Is the organisation carried on for any private pecuniary profit of an individual?
*   In the event that the organisation winds up, does it distribute funds to charitable purposes (consistent with the Cabinet criteria) within New Zealand or to those organisations already listed in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007?
*   Is the organisation registered as a charity with the Charities Commission?
*   Does the organisation have an IRD number?
*   Is the organisation established in New Zealand or have a very strong connection to New Zealand?

**Credibility and sustainability of the organisation**

The following questions help to determine whether an organisation is credible and sustainable. Organisations should have robust internal management and potential longevity.

Key questions include:

*   How long has the organisation been operating?
*   What are its sources of funding (if any)?
*   What is the manner of operation? (for example, business plans and finances).
*   Who are the recipients of the funds raised in New Zealand?
*   Are the funds derived from donations in New Zealand held and used prudently? (For example, do the funds achieve the purpose that was the reason for the donation and, as much as is possible, are they used for this purpose?) Ideally, at all times, the organisation should account for funds received from donations and clearly evidence a commitment to ensuring that funds are used to support the purpose, and are not diverted into unnecessary administration and management.
*   Are its founding documents (such as a constitution or trust deed) and formal documents (such as annual plans and reports) and the activities of the organisation, consistent with the Cabinet criteria?

**Project management and financial systems**

The following questions help to verify the adequacy of an organisation's project management and financial systems. Organisations should be aware that there are a number of risks involved when charities are operating internationally. Examples of risks include political, personal, financial loss, and regulatory compliance risks. Adequate checks and balances for its project management and financial systems are necessary so that taxpayer funds are used appropriately.

Key questions include:

*   Does the decision-making body of the organisation have relevant knowledge and experience of the relevant field, and other project and financial management systems? For example, is there a process for assessing, and monitoring projects and selecting beneficiaries?
*   Does the organisation give funds to non-resident organisation(s)? If so, are the activities of the non-resident recipient(s) consistent with the Cabinet criteria?
*   If the organisation works with non-resident organisation(s), does it have access to regular and accurate information from these organisation(s)?
*   Does the organisation have a set of financial accounts that clearly identify receipts of donations and transfers of funds, on a regular basis, to its designated charitable purposes?
*   Can the organisation demonstrate that its activities are likely to be effective in the long term?

**Internal controls for regulatory compliance**

The following questions help to assess whether the tax relief afforded by overseas donee status is targeted appropriately, and that the associated tax benefits and entitlements are not abused.

Key questions include:

*   Does the organisation have procedures to prevent funds going directly, or indirectly, to individual(s) for private pecuniary benefit?
*   Does the organisation have procedures to prevent funds going directly, or indirectly, to individual(s) or organisation(s) associated with terrorism?
*   Does the organisation have procedures to ensure that no support is given to any individual(s) or organisation(s) that may carry out activities that could result in conviction in New Zealand under the law, such as the Crimes Act 1961, or similar laws in the relevant country?

**Ongoing requirements**

The Government has an expectation that organisations included in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will maintain adequate systems that can produce:

*   accurate information about project progress and activities;
*   adequate financial reports;
*   information about donations receipts that have been issued with correct details of funds received from its donors; and
*   other particulars as may be required by Inland Revenue in respect of the organisation's activities, funding and finances.

The portability arrangements will allow a person who has retirement savings in both Australia and New Zealand to consolidate them in one account in their current country of residence. The amendments remove an impediment to labour movement between the two countries, as retirement savings are currently unable to be transferred if a person permanently emigrates to the other country. Application date The portability arrangements will come into effect up to two months after New Zealand and Australia have exchanged notes informing each other that the necessary legislation has been enacted. This is expected to be during the second half of 2010. Key features The key features of the new portability arrangements are: • Participation will be voluntary for KiwiSaver members and scheme providers. • Retirement savings may only be transferred between a KiwiSaver scheme and an Australian complying superannuation fund regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. • A KiwiSaver member must permanently emigrate to Australia to be able to transfer his or her retirement savings. The requirements for proof of permanent emigration, to be supplied to the member’s provider before the savings can be transferred, will be the same as for permanent emigration to other countries. These requirements are contained in clause 14, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. • A KiwiSaver member will not be able to withdraw any retirement savings in cash after one year if the member permanently emigrates to Australia, as can be done if the person emigrates to a country other than Australia. • Any member tax credits may be transferred to Australia. Under the current rules, a person’s member tax credits are recovered by the Crown if the person withdraws his or her savings in cash after permanent emigration. • New section CW 29B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that an amount of Australian-sourced retirement savings transferred to a KiwiSaver scheme under the portability arrangements will be treated as exempt from tax at the point of entry. 4 • Some policy differences (for example, relating to withdrawals for retirement and purchasing a first home) will apply to Australian-sourced retirement savings that have been transferred to a KiwiSaver scheme. However, any New Zealand- sourced earnings on those retirement savings will be subject to normal KiwiSaver policies. • New rules will govern the treatment of KiwiSaver balances after a member permanently emigrates to Australia. For permanent emigration to any other country, the current rules in clause 14(1) and (2), schedule 1 will continue to apply. Background The retirement savings portability arrangements were developed by a working group established to investigate options for improving the portability of retirement savings between New Zealand and Australia. The trans-Tasman portability arrangements recognise the high degree of integration between New Zealand and Australia, and are intended to make it easier to transfer retirement savings across the Tasman to improve labour mobility between the two countries. The portability details are contained in an Arrangement between the governments of New Zealand and Australia which was signed by the Minister of Finance and the Australian Treasurer on 16 July 2009. The Arrangement is available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/ . Detailed analysis Tax treatment of transfers One of the principles of the portability arrangements is that transferring retirement savings across the Tasman should not lead to an unnecessary loss in value of those savings. To protect the value of retirement savings, such transfers between New Zealand and Australia will be exempt from entry or exit taxes. Generally, a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme to a registered superannuation scheme in New Zealand involves: • a distribution from the source superannuation scheme to the member; and • the member reinvesting the proceeds in the host country’s superannuation scheme. Consequently, a transfer of retirement savings from Australia to New Zealand may give rise to a taxable dividend. New section CW 29B of the Income Tax Act 2007 will ensure that an amount of Australian-sourced retirement savings transferred to a KiwiSaver scheme under the portability arrangements becomes exempt income at the point of entry. 5 For transfers from a KiwiSaver scheme to an Australian scheme, the only possible tax impost is non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), which is levied on dividends, interest and royalties paid to non-residents. Distributions from a KiwiSaver scheme to non- residents are not treated as dividends and so are not subject to NRWT. Therefore, no specific exemption for transfers of savings from a KiwiSaver scheme to an Australian scheme is necessary. Australia’s excess non-concessional contributions tax Australia imposes a tax-free limit (a “non-concessional contributions cap”) of A$150,000 on the amount of superannuation contributions that an individual can make from non-wage sources in a particular year. Contributions that exceed this cap are taxed at a rate of 46.5 percent. The tax is intended as a disincentive for people to accumulate excessive contributions in superannuation funds, as Australian superannuation funds are taxed on their earnings at concessional rates (15 percent) and pensions paid out of such funds are typically tax-free after 60. Transfers from KiwiSaver to an Australian superannuation scheme will be subject to the non-concessional contributions cap on initial entry into the Australian system. This is intended to maintain the integrity of the Australian superannuation system. The cap will not apply to New Zealand-sourced or Australian-sourced superannuation contributions re-entering Australia. An individual under 65 can bring forward the next two years’ worth of contributions, so can contribute up to A$450,000 in any particular year without breaching the contributions cap. The cap will be indexed to inflation from 2010–11. New rules for permanent emigration to Australia Under the current rules, clause 14, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 allows members who permanently emigrate overseas to withdraw their savings in cash one year after emigration. Any member tax credits that the person has accumulated cannot be withdrawn, and will be recovered by the Crown. The amendments contained in the bill replace these rules for KiwiSaver members who permanently emigrate to Australia. Under new clause 14B, schedule 1, a KiwiSaver member can transfer his or her retirement savings from their participating KiwiSaver scheme to an Australian complying superannuation fund regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Members can request the transfer of their savings at any time after they supply their provider with proof of their permanent emigration to Australia. The requirements for proof of permanent emigration to Australia will be the same as those contained in clause 14(3), schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. KiwiSaver members transferring their retirement savings to Australia will be able to take their accumulated member tax credits and $1,000 Crown contribution with them. Currently, member tax credits are recovered by the Crown if a member withdraws his or her savings following permanent emigration from New Zealand. Under Australian law, retirement savings transferred from KiwiSaver to Australia will remain locked in until the member reaches the age of entitlement to New Zealand Superannuation (currently 65). 6 Under Australian law, any New Zealand-sourced retirement savings that are transferred to Australia will not be able to be transferred from Australia to a third country. The portability arrangements will be the only way for KiwiSaver members to take their accumulated savings with them when they permanently emigrate to Australia. Consequently, KiwiSaver members who emigrate to Australia will not be able to withdraw their accumulated savings in cash. This reflects the policy intent of KiwiSaver, which is to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation. The portability arrangements will apply only to transfers of retirement savings between New Zealand KiwiSaver schemes and Australian complying superannuation funds. For KiwiSaver members who permanently emigrate to a country other than Australia, the current rules in clause 14, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act will continue to apply, except that the amount withdrawn will be reduced by the amount of Australian-sourced retirement savings (as well as any member tax credits), as provided by clause 14(1) and (2), schedule 1. Members of complying superannuation funds in New Zealand will not be eligible for the portability arrangements, but are covered by the existing rules after permanent emigration, described in clause 14, and amended by this bill. Policy differences for Australian-sourced retirement savings Differences between the Australian and New Zealand superannuation schemes mean that transferred savings will remain subject to a number of source-country rules. These rules will apply only to the principal amount of savings that is transferred to the host country. Once transferred, earnings on those savings and any subsequent contributions will be subject to the rules of the host country. Applying these policy differences will ensure that portability supports labour market mobility, rather than being used to take advantage of regulatory and policy differences between New Zealand and Australia. Members can completely withdraw their retirement savings on the later of five years of membership or on reaching the age of entitlement to New Zealand Superannuation (currently 65). Despite this, new clause 4B, schedule 1 will allow Australian-sourced retirement savings which are held in KiwiSaver to be withdrawn at age 60 if the member is retired. This is consistent with the Australian rules on the withdrawal of retirement savings, and ensures that an individual is not disadvantaged by moving from Australia to New Zealand. These individuals could otherwise have accessed the savings tax-free at 60 if they had remained in Australia. The government provides members of a KiwiSaver scheme with a member tax credit that matches their personal contributions at a rate of 100 percent, up to a maximum of $1,042.86 a year. To be eligible, members must reside mainly in New Zealand in the year for which the tax credit applies. As Australian savings relate to contributions made while the member was not residing in New Zealand, the member tax credit will not be paid on such savings after they are transferred to KiwiSaver. The definition of “member credit contribution” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to achieve this. 7 Australian-sourced savings held in KiwiSaver will not be able to be used for any of the KiwiSaver housing-related initiatives. The Arrangement between the two countries prescribes that transferred savings cannot be withdrawn to assist with the purchase of a first home, under clause 8, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. This is because Australia’s home ownership scheme is separate from its retirement savings scheme. However, any earnings on Australian-sourced savings may be withdrawn for the purchase a first home. The mortgage diversion facility is a feature of KiwiSaver which allows a member to divert up to half of their contributions to their mortgage repayments. It was closed to new applicants from 1 June 2009. To fulfil the intent behind the portability arrangements, and to ensure consistency between the first home withdrawal initiative and the mortgage diversion facility, Australian-sourced retirement savings will not be able to be diverted to a member’s mortgage repayments under new section 229(2)(jb) of the KiwiSaver Act. The KiwiSaver deposit subsidy provides a member with a lump sum payment of $1,000 for each year of contribution, up to a maximum of $5,000, to use for a deposit on the member’s first home. To be eligible for the subsidy, a member must contribute at least two percent of his or her salary or wages for at least three years. To align the deposit subsidy rules with the residence requirements for other benefits of KiwiSaver, contributions made to an Australian complying superannuation fund and subsequently transferred to New Zealand will not count towards eligibility for the subsidy. This will be contained in the deposit subsidy administrative rules which are administered by the Housing New Zealand Corporation. If a person’s membership in KiwiSaver is invalidated after retirement savings are transferred from Australia to New Zealand, the net value of any such savings will be returned to the member’s Australian superannuation account instead of being refunded in cash to the member. As previously noted, KiwiSaver members who permanently emigrate from New Zealand to a country other than Australia will not be able to withdraw any Australian- sourced retirement savings in cash after one year. 8 9 KiwiSaver 10 11 ENROLMENT OF UNDER 18-YEAR-OLDS (Clauses 72(2), 73 and 74) Summary of proposed amendments The bill amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to create a new set of rules governing the enrolment of under 18-year-olds in KiwiSaver. These rules will provide that children under 16 can only be enrolled by their legal guardian, and children aged 16 to 17 will be subject to a transitional rule which recognises their growing intellectual maturity. The proposed new rules will provide clarity and certainty around the enrolment of under 18-year-olds in KiwiSaver. Application date The new rules will apply from 1 July 2010 or the date of enactment of the legislation, whichever is later. Key features To provide certainty and clarity, the bill creates a new set of rules in section 35 of the KiwiSaver Act to prescribe how those aged under 18 can enrol in KiwiSaver. The proposed new rules are: • Children under 16 years old may only be enrolled by their legal guardian(s), and may not enrol themselves in KiwiSaver. • Children aged 16 to 17, with a legal guardian, must co-sign with their legal guardian(s) in order to enrol in KiwiSaver. They may not enrol themselves, and a legal guardian will not be able to enrol a child aged 16 to 17 in KiwiSaver without the child’s consent. • Children aged 16 to 17 without a legal guardian may opt into KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a scheme provider. This means that children aged 16 to 17 who are married, in a civil union, or living with a de facto partner, will not need to co-sign in order to opt into KiwiSaver. A contract properly entered into on behalf of an under 18-year-old will be treated as if the child is 18 – that is, the contract will be binding. The proposed amendments will mean that a purported enrolment will be invalid if, for example, an under 16-year-old is enrolled by someone other than their legal guardian, or if a 16 to 17-year-old with a legal guardian is not a co-signatory. If an under 18-year-old has more than one legal guardian, all guardians must act jointly in order to enrol the child in KiwiSaver. This is consistent with the rules around the exercise of guardianship in the Care of Children Act 2004. 12 Background The KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that children under 18 years old are not subject to automatic enrolment, and can only opt into KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a provider. The KiwiSaver Act does not prescribe who can contract with a scheme provider on behalf of a child under 18 years old. It is at the discretion of the provider whether an application is accepted. The lack of clarity about who can enrol children in KiwiSaver has led to complaints and disputes from parents and guardians, as well as from children who have been enrolled without their consent. Children and their parents can currently contest an enrolment on the grounds that the contract was non-binding. 13 CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE PAYE RULES AND KIWISAVER RULES FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN (Clause 77) Summary of proposed amendment The KiwiSaver rules are being amended to ensure that, if PAYE is not required to be deducted from a child’s salary or wage if they receive the tax credit for children, no KiwiSaver deductions are required to be made. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 July 2010 or the date of enactment of the legislation, whichever is later. Key features If a child has the tax credit for children under section LC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, Inland Revenue can reduce the amount of tax for a PAYE income payment. This can be done if the tax credit fully covers the child’s PAYE liability (if their annual earnings are less than $2,340). If a child has validly opted into KiwiSaver and is employed, the child is required to have KiwiSaver deductions made from his or her wages. It is the policy intent that, if no tax deduction is required to be made from the payment of salary or wages at the time the payment is made, in accordance with the PAYE rules, then there is no requirement for KiwiSaver contributions to be made. However, section 67 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 prevents this from happening. The proposed amendment will mean that a child does not need to make regular contributions to KiwiSaver from their salary or wages if PAYE is not required to be deducted. A child may still choose to contribute to KiwiSaver by giving his or her employer a deduction notice. 14 PROVISION OF ANNUAL REPORTS VIA HYPERLINK (Clause 78) Summary of proposed amendment A change to the KiwiSaver rules will allow scheme providers to send their members a copy of their annual report via hyperlink, if the member has agreed to this in writing. This will reduce compliance costs for providers. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 July 2010 or the date of enactment of the legislation, whichever is later. Key features Section 122 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 (which incorporates section 17 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989) requires the trustees of a KiwiSaver scheme to provide an annual report to all KiwiSaver members in their scheme. If an email address is provided, the annual report can be delivered in an electronic format through an email attachment. However, the annual report requirement cannot be satisfied by providing a hyperlink to the report in an email, as a hyperlink provides a “point of access” to the information rather than providing the information itself. If the provider is unable to deliver the report via email, for example, because of firewalls or a lack of capacity in the recipient’s email account, a hardcopy of the annual report must be supplied. This imposes additional compliance costs. An amendment to section 122 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will allow scheme providers to satisfy the requirements to provide an annual report by sending a hyperlink in an email which links to the annual report, if the member has agreed to this in writing. 15 “LEASEHOLD ESTATE” – FIRST HOME WITHDRAWAL AND DEPOSIT SUBSIDY (Clause 80(4)) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment to the KiwiSaver rules will ensure that members with an interest or past interest in a leasehold estate, such as a residential tenancy, will not be excluded from being eligible for the first home withdrawal or deposit subsidy provisions in KiwiSaver. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 July 2010. Key features Clause 8, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 allows members of KiwiSaver to withdraw their accumulated savings, less the one-off $1,000 Crown contribution and any member tax credits, to use for the purchase of a first home. A KiwiSaver member cannot withdraw his or her savings for a first home if they have previously held an estate in land, unless their financial position is what would be expected of a first home buyer. In clause 8, the definition of an estate includes a “leasehold estate”. A leasehold estate includes leasehold residential tenancies where a property owner rents the property to another party. Using that definition, if a member has ever been party to a rental lease agreement, the person may not be eligible for first home withdrawal. These people should not be excluded from meeting the eligibility requirements for this reason only. The amendment to clause 8, schedule 1 will ensure that individuals with an interest or past interest in a leasehold estate, such as a residential tenancy, will not be excluded from first home withdrawal. The amendment will also ensure that individuals with an interest in a leasehold estate may be eligible to receive the KiwiSaver deposit subsidy. The deposit subsidy is provided for in the administrative rules of the Housing New Zealand Corporation rather than legislation. The administrative rules for the deposit subsidy are aligned with the first home withdrawal rules in clause 8, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 16 17 Distributions to cooperative company members 18 19 DISTRIBUTIONS TO COOPERATIVE COMPANY MEMBERS (Clauses 6, 7, 12 and 32) Summary of proposed amendments The bill in effect extends the scope of sections DV 11 and CD 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which allow a cooperative company to deduct a distribution to a member if the distribution is in proportion to the sale and purchase of trading stock between the member and the cooperative. Amendments to section DV 11, and new section CD 34B, remove the requirement for strict proportionality by permitting a 20 percent differential. This flexibility is being introduced to reduce compliance costs for cooperative companies that pay dividends on a limited number of shares in excess of those held to match trading stock transactions. There will be a general review of the tax treatment of dividends paid by cooperatives within the next year. Application date The amendments will apply to distributions made on or after 1 April 2010. Key features • Section CD 34 will be repealed and replaced by section CD 34B, which is slightly broader in scope. • Section CD 34B provides that a distribution on certain types of shares by a cooperative company to a member is not a dividend. This applies to shares held in proportion to actual or expected trading stock transactions between the member and the cooperative, and also to a limited number (20 percent) of other shares. • Section CD 34B(9) provides an exception to section 125 of the Companies Act 1993 for cooperatives that elect deductible dividend treatment for tax purposes, and that provide a copy of the election to the Registrar of Companies. Subsection (9) gives such companies some flexibility in fixing the date of entitlement which establishes members’ right to receive dividends. • Section DV 11, which currently provides for a cooperative company to deduct distributions to which section CD 34 applies, now refers to section CD 34B. Background Cooperative companies can require members to hold shares in proportion to trading stock transactions between the member and the cooperative. Shares linked to supply in this way are described as “supply-backed shares”. Sections DV 11 and CD 34 provide that, subject to certain limitations, cooperatives with these types of shares may deduct distributions paid to members if the payments are in proportion to trading stock transactions. This would enable a cooperative to deduct a distribution paid on a supply- backed share. 20 A cooperative company with such a capital structure can make distributions in relation to non-transaction shares as well as supply-backed shares. Non-transaction shares are shares that enable the member to supply trading stock to the company in a season but in relation to which the member does not actually supply or expect to supply trading stock. The boundary between supply-backed and non-transaction shares is not clear during a trading season. To avoid increased compliance costs for these cooperatives, which would arise from treating these shares differently for income tax purposes, the government has decided in the shorter term to extend the existing treatment for distributions on supply-backed shares to distributions on a limited number of non- transaction shares. It is satisfied that, provided the number of non-transaction shares held by a member does not exceed 20 percent of the number of other shares, there is still a close enough link between a member’s overall shareholding and the member’s trading stock transactions with the cooperative to warrant the same treatment for distributions on both types of share. However, the government intends to review the tax treatment of distributions paid on shares held in cooperative companies within the next year as part of its general review of mutual transactions. Detailed analysis New section CD 34B will generally apply in the same circumstances as the existing section CD 34, which will be repealed. The new section describes four types of shares – transaction shares, projected transactions shareholding, limited non-transaction shares and other shares that entitle members to enter into trading stock transactions. The distinction exists only for the purposes of tax rules relating to deductibility and dividends – the shares may be of the same, or a different class, for company law purposes. Distributions in proportion to actual or estimated trading stock transactions Under new section CD 34B, transaction shares are those that are held in proportion to trading stock transactions in a season. Projected transactions shareholding are shares held in proportion to estimated trading stock transactions in a season. Under the proposed changes, distributions paid by a cooperative company on such shares will be deductible to the cooperative (section DV 11) and are not a dividend (new section CD 34B(2)(a) and (b)). Distributions on limited non-transaction shares Non-transaction shares are shares that are not held in proportion to actual or estimated trading stock transactions but that entitle the member to enter into trading transactions with the cooperative. 21 A distribution paid by a cooperative to a member on such a share is deductible to the cooperative, and is not a dividend, only if the member does not hold, and the constitution of the cooperative does not allow any other member to hold, more non- transaction shares than 20 percent of the greater of the number of their transaction shares or projected transactions shares. If the constitution allows any member to hold more non-transaction shares than the 20 percent level, only distributions on transaction and projected transactions shareholding will be deductible to the cooperative and will not be a dividend. Distributions to any member on other shares will not be eligible for this tax treatment. Example A is a member of a farmers’ meat cooperative company. The company requires a member to hold one share for each 10 kilograms of meat the member sells to the cooperative in a season. Members can also hold additional shares up to a maximum of 20 percent of shares held by the member to back their recent or estimated sale of meat to the cooperative. Shares held in excess of this are redeemed by the cooperative at the end of the season. A estimates that he will supply 1,000kg of meat in the 2010–11 season so he purchases 120 shares. He only supplies 800kg of meat in the season. After the end of the season, the cooperative company distributes $1 per share to members for that season so A receives $120. A holds 100 projected transactions shares (80 of which are transaction shares) and 20 limited non-transaction shares for the 2010–11 season. The distribution of $120 is not a dividend under new section CD 34B and is deductible to the cooperative under section DV 11. Variation The cooperative company changes its constitution so that an individual member may hold any number of non-transaction shares. A estimates that he will supply 1,000kg of meat in the current season, and actually supplies 900kg. He holds 200 shares. The company pays a $200 dividend on the shares. A holds 100 projected transactions shares and 100 other shares. The $100 paid on the projected transaction shares is deductible to the cooperative and excluded as a dividend. The remaining $100 is non-deductible and may be a dividend. In this case, section CD 34B(3)(b) applies so that distributions on shares other than transaction shares or projected transactions shareholding held by any member (not just A) are not deductible and may be a dividend. Review As noted earlier, the government proposes to review the tax treatment of distributions from cooperative companies to shareholders within the next year. This will enable full consultation on the appropriate treatment of such distributions. 22 Section 125(2) Companies Act 1993 A problem arises for cooperative companies with a particular capital structure that pay dividends to shareholders and have different financial years and trading seasons (for example, a trading year ending 31 March and a financial year ending 31 May). Under section 125 of the Companies Act 1993, there is a maximum 20 working-day period between the time shareholders’ entitlements to receive a dividend are determined (the “record date”) and the date the company’s board resolves to pay the dividend. This creates a problem for cooperative companies that require shares to be held in proportion to trading stock transactions, that pay dividends to shareholders and that have a different financial year and trading season. If such companies pay a dividend in respect of a trading season after the end of the equivalent financial year, the record date can be in the new trading season. The appropriate record date should be in the trading season for which the dividend is paid. Proposed subsection CD 34B(9) therefore provides an exception to the 20 working-day rule for cooperative companies that have elected the tax treatment in section CD 34B. However, the exception applies in relation to all shares of the cooperative that entitle a member to enter into trading stock transactions. That is, the 20 percent limitation that applies for tax purposes does not apply for the purposes of the exception to the Companies Act 1993. Example A Co is a cooperative company whose members hold 1 share for each $10kg of meat they supply to the cooperative. It has a trading season of 1 April to 31 March and a financial year of 1 June to 31 May. It intends to pay a dividend based on its 2010–11 trading season on 1 August 2011, after the end of its 2010–11 financial year. It wants to pay that dividend to members in relation to their shareholding in the 2010–11 trading season. It elects, under section CD 34B, to deduct the dividends paid on its shares and also gives a copy of the election notice to the Registrar of Companies. It resolves to fix a record date for all future distributions of 31 March, being the last day of its trading season. As this resolution was made before the end of the 2010–11 trading season, the board can resolve to pay a dividend on 1 August 2011, in respect of the 2010–11 trading season, based on shareholding on 31 March 2011. 23 Cancellation of BETA debits from conduit-relieved dividends 24 25 CANCELLATION OF BETA DEBITS FROM CONDUIT-RELIEVED DIVIDENDS (Clauses 29 and 30) Summary of proposed amendment Following reforms of the international tax rules, there are concerns that some companies may be able to use their branch equivalent tax accounts (BETA) debit balances to effectively continue conduit tax relief. This is contrary to the intention of the reforms. The proposed amendments therefore cancel those BETA debits that arose from conduit- relieved dividends. Cancellation of these BETA debits will not lead to double taxation because conduit-relieved dividends would not have been taxed in the first place. Application date The amendment applies from all income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Key features A new provision (section OE 11B) generates a BETA credit equal to any BETA debits generated in respect of foreign dividend payment (FDP) liabilities that have been reduced under section RG 7. The bill also removes subsection OE 7(1)(c)(iii). This is intended to clarify that section OE 7 (which allows companies to use BETA debits to satisfy an income tax liability in relation to attributed controlled foreign company (CFC) does not apply to BETA debits that have been generated on dividends that have been conduit-relieved under section RG 7. Background Recent reforms to the international tax rules included the repeal of conduit tax relief and a two-year phase-out period for companies with debit balances in their branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs). Repeal of conduit tax relief Conduit tax relief was a mechanism that relieved tax on income earned in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the New Zealand parent company was owned by non- residents. The new rules introduced an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies and an exemption for most foreign dividends received by companies, making conduit tax relief largely redundant. Consequently, conduit tax relief was repealed, with application from all income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 26 Phase-out of branch equivalent tax accounts Under the old international tax rules controlled foreign company (CFC) income was taxed twice: when the income was earned by the CFC and attributed back to its New Zealand shareholders and when the CFC paid a dividend to those shareholders. Branch equivalent tax accounts (BETA) were the mechanism for relieving the double taxation that could otherwise occur from having these two layers of tax. As part of the international tax reforms, an exemption has been introduced for most types of foreign dividends received by companies. This removes the potential for double taxation and makes it possible to phase out BETA accounts held by companies. In February 2008 the government announced that once the international tax changes took effect, companies would be able to carry forward and use any existing BETA debit balances for a further two years. This two-year transitional period for BETA debits was intended to relieve the double taxation that could occur when a dividend was taxed under the old rules ahead of the underlying income being taxed again under the new international tax rules. The problem Officials have since become aware of a small number of companies with very large BETA debit balances. There is a concern that these BETA debit balances could be used to effectively prolong conduit tax relief for a further two years. This is a particular concern in respect of dividends that have been conduit-relieved as such dividends generate a BETA debit even though no tax has been paid on the dividend. This means that these BETA debits are not needed to relieve double taxation, but can be used to offset tax on some other attributed foreign income. To address this concern, the proposed amendments cancel those BETA debits that arose from conduit-relieved dividends. Other BETA debits will still be available for use during the two-year transitional period. 27 Gift duty exemptions 28 29 GIFT DUTY EXEMPTIONS (Clause 82) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces a number of amendments to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 to exempt the following gifts from gift duty: • Transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local or central government. The change removes an impediment to donors who want to give property (monetary and non- monetary) to local or central government and will reduce the associated compliance costs for those donors. • Gifts made to donee organisations. 1 The change will align the gift duty treatment of gifts made to donee organisations with the policy for encouraging greater giving to charitable and philanthropic causes. • Distributions of property made in accordance with a Court order under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955. The change will ensure that the original policy intention that such distributions of property are exempt from gift duty is maintained. Application dates The exemption for distributions of property made in accordance with a Court order under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955 will apply retrospectively to 24 May 1999, the date when Part 1 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 was repealed. The other amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features New section 73(2)(aa) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 exempts any gift required by an order of a Court under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955 from gift duty. New sections 73(2)(jd) and 73(2)(kb) introduce exemptions from gift duty for gifts made to central government and local authorities, provided these organisations are not carried on for the private pecuniary benefit of any individual. New section 73(2)(o) introduces an exemption from gift duty for gifts made to donee organisations. 1 A donee organisation is an organisation that is approved by Inland Revenue and listed at www.ird.govt.nz/donee- organisations, or that is approved by Parliament and listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 30 Background Gift duty was introduced in New Zealand in 1885. 2 The original purpose of gift duty was to protect the estate duty base (by discouraging the gifting of assets before death) and to raise revenue. However, when estate duty was abolished in 1992, the government of the day decided to retain gift duty to protect against income tax avoidance, social assistance targeting and defeating creditors, until measures to restrict avoidance were considered and announced. The way the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 is currently structured means that gift duty has a wide ambit. This is because gift duty is imposed on any gift of property in New Zealand, or outside New Zealand if the donor’s permanent home is in New Zealand, or the donor is a company incorporated in New Zealand. A number of exemptions from gift duty are provided in section 73 of the Act. The exemptions are, however, ad hoc and there does not appear to be a coherent framework for determining whether exemptions should be granted. Consequently, the Minister of Revenue receives frequent requests for legislative change to exempt certain gifts. Instead of continuing to determine exemptions on a case-by-case basis, a review of gift duty, focusing on options for targeting the application of gift duty, will be undertaken in the coming year. The review will seek to ensure that the government’s intention for gift duty as a means of protecting against income tax avoidance, defeating creditors and social assistance targeting is met, and to ensure that the integrity of the tax system is maintained. Given that further work on reviewing gift duty is likely to take time, current requests for exemptions are being included in this bill. These relate to: transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local or central government agencies; gifts of money made to donee organisations; and distributions of property made by a Court order under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955. Detailed analysis Transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local or central government Requests for exemptions for transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local and central government fall into the following four categories: • Transfers of assets by local authorities – local authorities often transfer assets as part of local council restructurings which can give rise to gift duty. Restructuring transactions to deal with the actual or potential imposition of gift duty is inefficient for local authorities. • Gifts made to local authority trusts – the general characteristics of local authority trusts are that the sole trustee is a local authority and trust funds are held for charitable (or public) purposes benefiting all or a significant portion of the public within the territory of the local authority. Gifts made to these trusts may give rise to gift duty because of the legal uncertainty of such trusts registering with the Charities Commission. 2 The legislative provisions at that time were contained in the Deceased Persons’ Estates Duties Act 1885 and are now contained in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. 31 • Gifts made to local or central government – uncertainty arose for a donor who proposed to gift a number of parcels of land to both local and central government agencies, and wished to ensure that such gifts were not subject to gift duty. • Gifts made to district health boards (DHBs) – DHBs are Crown entities owned by the Crown. 3 For income tax purposes, Crown entities are treated as public authorities and are therefore exempt from income tax. 4 However, gifts to DHBs may be liable for gift duty. For example, a donor who wishes to gift a dialysis machine to a DHB may face potential gift duty. Granting specific legislative exemptions for transfers of assets by, and gifts made to, local or central government agencies can be justified on the grounds that the proposed exemptions would: • be consistent with the government’s intention in retaining gift duty for protecting against income tax avoidance, social assistance targeting or defeating creditors; • remove impediments to donors to give property (monetary and non-monetary) to local or central government. Currently, donors making such gifts are subject to gift duty. The Crown is therefore the recipient of both the gift and the duty; • be consistent with other exemptions contained in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. For example, of the 12 named organisations listed in section 73 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act, three are Crown entities (New Zealand Antarctic Institute, Te Papa and the Historic Places Trust); • reduce compliance costs for donors wishing to make gifts to local or central government as restructuring such gifts to ensure that they do not incur gift duty is currently resource-intensive and inefficient. To ensure that the proposed exemptions are properly targeted, there will be a requirement that no person should be able to derive a private pecuniary benefit from a local or central government agency, over and above what would normally be permitted, and no person should be able to influence the amount of any benefit they themselves would receive. Gifts made to donee organisations Individuals, companies and Māori authorities qualify for tax relief on gifts of money made for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand, or for certain purposes overseas. However, the exemption from gift duty applies only to gifts that are made to organisations registered with the Charities Commission. Consequently, donors may be entitled to a tax benefit for their gifts to donee organisations but are then subject to gift duty. This outcome has been criticised as being inconsistent with the policy for encouraging greater giving to charitable and philanthropic causes. To ensure that the proposed exemption is not subject to abuse, there will be a requirement that no person should be able to derive a private pecuniary benefit, over and above what would normally be permitted, and no person should be able to influence the amount of any benefit they would receive. 3 Crown Entities Act 2004, section 7. 4 Income Tax Act 2007, section CW 38. 32 Distributions of property made by a Court order under certain Acts In 1993, estate duty was abolished for deaths occurring after 17 December 1992. Legislation affecting this matter was passed under the Estate Duty Repeal Act 1999, which provided for the repeals of parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Under repealed section 7(2) of the Act, it was clear that the distribution of any property in accordance with a Court order under the Law Reform (Testamentary Promises) Act 1949 or the Family Protection Act 1955 was exempt from gift duty. Since the repeal of that section, the gift duty treatment of such distributions has become unclear. Since such distributions have previously been treated as exempt from gift duty, it was an unintended consequence of repealing section 7(2) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 that the treatment of such distributions has become unclear. Given that the original policy intention of the Act was that such distributions be exempt from gift duty, the amendment will be made retrospectively to 24 May 1999, the date when Part 1 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 was repealed. 33 Binding rulings 34 35 QUESTIONS OF FACT (Clauses 36(4), 52(2) and (4), 55, 56, 57, 58(2) and (3), 63, 64(1) and 66) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments to replace the current general prohibition on determinations of fact with a provision that the Commissioner can rule only on the basis of the facts as provided by the applicant. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that the Commissioner can rule on questions of tax avoidance and in doing so retain certainty for taxpayers. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The amendments introduce the following changes: • The rule that the Commissioner cannot rule on questions of fact (sections 91E(4)(a) and 91F(4)(a)) will be replaced with a rule that the Commissioner cannot rule on “proscribed questions” which include the existence or correctness of facts. • Specific exclusions from ruling in relation to the taxpayer’s intention, the value of anything and what constitutes “commercially acceptable practice” will also be included as proscribed questions on the basis that they are likely to require the Commissioner to rule on the existence or correctness of facts. • The Commissioner may make a ruling based on the facts provided by the applicant. The Commissioner may also inquire as to the correctness or existence of the facts provided by the applicant, but is not required to do so. Background An underlying principle of the binding rulings legislation is that the Commissioner should not have to determine whether facts provided by an applicant for a ruling are correct. Under sections 91E(4)(a) and 91F(4)(a) the Commissioner is therefore prohibited from ruling on questions of fact. On a literal interpretation of this provision it could be argued that the Commissioner is prohibited from making a ruling when doing so would expressly or implicitly require particular facts to be found to exist. In that case, the Commissioner may be unable to rule on fact-dependent issues such as the application of the general anti-avoidance provision or specific anti-avoidance provisions. Such a broad interpretation would, however, be inconsistent with the understanding and application of the binding rulings provisions by taxpayers, tax practitioners and Inland Revenue since the binding rulings regime was introduced in 1994. The inability to obtain a binding ruling on questions of avoidance would reduce certainty for businesses. 36 To ensure that the Commissioner can rule on tax avoidance, the relevant legislation is being replaced with a rule that the Commissioner cannot rule on proscribed questions, including the existence or correctness of facts. The Commissioner can, however, rule on the basis of facts that are assumed to exist from the application for the ruling. Proscribed questions also include the taxpayer’s intention, the value of anything and what constitutes commercially acceptable practice. To remove any inference that the Commissioner is unable to rule on tax avoidance (which would defeat the main purpose of the proposed change) the exclusion for commercially acceptable practice will be limited to where that term is used in the tax legislation. 37 ABILITY TO RULE WHEN THE MATTER IS SUBJECT TO A CASE BEFORE THE COURTS (Clauses 52(1) and 58(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The Commissioner’s discretion not to rule on matters before the courts is being clarified by limiting its application to cases involving substantially similar arrangements. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify when the Commissioner will exercise the discretion. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Sections 91E(3)(b) and 91F(3)(b) are being amended to clarify the Commissioner’s discretion not to rule on matters which are the subject of a dispute with the applicant or another person. The application of the discretion is being limited to an arrangement on which the ruling is sought, or a separately identifiable part of that arrangement, which is substantially the same as an arrangement which is before the courts. Background The Commissioner has a discretion under which he can decline to rule “if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to an objection, challenge or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or to any other person”. The provision is expressed in general terms and the scope of the provision, particularly the term “matter” is unclear. The provision does not allow for an unduly narrow interpretation such as requiring an identical transaction and the same or associated taxpayer. At the other extreme, it would be inappropriate to apply it to all instances where an issue arises that is commonly determined in a transaction – for example, the application of the general anti- avoidance provision – as that would allow the Commissioner to turn down any ruling application on that issue. This lack of clarity does not give businesses certainty. 38 MASS MARKETED AND PUBLICLY PROMOTED SCHEME RULINGS (Clauses 36(3), 58(1), 61, 62 and 70) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to allow promoters of arrangements, or those with an interest similar to that of a promoter, to apply for a product ruling for prospective arrangements. Currently a promoter cannot request a binding ruling on an arrangement if the promoter is not a party to the arrangement. Allowing promoters of schemes to apply for product rulings could enhance overall tax compliance if such applications became standard practice. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features New section 91FC(1A) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows promoters of arrangements to apply for product rulings for prospective arrangements. To deal with the possible incentive for promoters of arrangements to omit relevant information or misrepresent the arrangement to obtain a favourable binding ruling, the promoter of the scheme will be required to make a statutory declaration that the relevant facts and documents provided in the application are correct. The Commissioner is also being given a discretion not to rule if the promoter has previously applied for such a ruling and omitted relevant information or provided false information. Background A product ruling sets out Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how the tax law applies to an arrangement that is likely to be entered into with a number of people on identical terms. One of the conditions when applying for a product ruling is that the applicant must intend to be a party to the proposed arrangement (section 91FC(1A)). This means that the promoter of an arrangement may not be able to apply for a product ruling. This position followed a legislative clarification in 1999 intended, among other things, to ensure that rulings applications were limited to “seriously contemplated” arrangements. There are advantages to investors and promoters in Inland Revenue issuing binding rulings on schemes. Prospective investors could make their investment decision in full knowledge of the tax effects of the arrangement and this would assist with compliance with their tax obligations. The promoter of the scheme could use the binding ruling to market the scheme as a means of demonstrating that the scheme is sound from a tax perspective. For Inland Revenue there are also benefits in such rulings being made available. Inland Revenue will become aware of the arrangement at an early stage and administrative costs in auditing the scheme will be reduced or eliminated. 39 DECLINING TO RULE WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT IS THE SUBJECT OF A DISPUTE (Clauses 52(3) and (5)) Summary of proposed amendment Section 91E(4)(ga) is being clarified to allow the Commissioner to make a binding ruling if the arrangement is the subject of a dispute by way of notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) but the application for the ruling relates to a different tax type from that in the NOPA. Currently the Commissioner cannot make a ruling if the application relates to an arrangement that is the subject of a NOPA. Allowing the Commissioner to make a ruling that relates to a different tax type to that being disputed will give taxpayers greater certainty. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 91E(4)(ga) is being amended to provide an exception to the prohibition on ruling on disputed arrangements that are the subject of a NOPA. The exception will apply if the application for the ruling relates to a different tax type from that being disputed. Background Under section 91E(4)(ga) the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if the application relates to an arrangement that is being disputed by way of a NOPA. This criterion was added in 1999 to clarify the policy intent that there should be no overlap between the disputes resolution process and the binding rulings regime. This is necessary to ensure that certainty for the taxpayer about the Commissioner’s position is maintained. If a NOPA relates to only one aspect of the arrangement, the Commissioner cannot rule on other aspects which may not be related to the issue being disputed. This could occur, for example, if an arrangement has both income tax consequences and GST consequences. Even if the NOPA relates only to the GST aspects of the arrangement, the taxpayer cannot obtain a ruling in relation to the income tax aspects of the arrangement. A further qualification on the ability to rule would therefore be necessary to ensure that the matter in dispute, and that for which the ruling was sought, were sufficiently separate. 40 A RULING WHICH FAILS IN PART (Clauses 53, 54, 59 and 60) Summary of proposed amendment Amendment are being made to sections 91EB and 91FB so that a ruling can be made invalid in part rather that in full only. This is when not all tax types ought to be affected by the invalidity. The amendment is aimed at providing greater flexibility in the rulings process. Application date The amendments will apply to new rulings made on or after the date of enactment. Key features Sections 91EB and 91FB are being amended to provide that if a ruling is no longer valid but the reason for the invalidity applies only to a certain tax type or types involved in the ruling, the other parts of the ruling relating to other tax types should continue to apply. Background Currently under section 91EB(2) a binding ruling involving material differences with the arrangement actually undertaken is treated as fully invalid even if those differences are material only to certain aspects of the ruling. An example is when a ruling relates to both GST and income tax and the material differences relate only to the GST issues. 41 PUBLICATION OF NOTIFICATION OF BINDING RULINGS IN THE GAZETTE (Clauses 40 to 45, 47 to 51, 64(2) to (4) and 65) Summary of proposed amendments The requirement to publish the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette is being replaced with a requirement that the Commissioner publish the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in a publication chosen by the Commissioner such as the Tax Information Bulletin. Similar amendments are being made to the Commissioner’s determination-making powers. The amendments are aimed at streamlining the process for making and withdrawing rulings and determinations. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The amendments replace the requirements that the Commissioner publish the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette with requirements that the Commissioner publish this information in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. Similar amendments are being made to the Commissioner’s determination-making powers. Background The binding rulings legislation requires Inland Revenue to notify the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette. Public and product binding rulings are also published in full in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). The TIB is available on Inland Revenue’s website and a paper copy can be requested. The TIB will continue to be the main vehicle for publication. 42 UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION PENALTIES AND USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST (Clauses 36(2), 67, 68 and 69) Summary of proposed amendments New sections 120W and 141B(1D) are being added to ensure that taxpayers who rely on official Inland Revenue advice will not be subject to use-of-money interest or to the unacceptable tax position penalty. Application date The amendments will apply to new rulings made from the date of enactment. Key features New sections 120W and 141B(1D) and a definition of “Commissioner’s official opinion” are being introduced to ensure that taxpayers who rely on official Inland Revenue advice will not be subject to use-of-money interest or to the unacceptable tax position penalty. The advice relied on will be that provided orally or in writing by the Commissioner as the official position of Inland Revenue and applicable specifically to the taxpayer (with all the relevant facts having been provided by the taxpayer). The amendment will not apply to advice that is in the form of a private binding ruling. As the ruling is binding on the Commissioner, the taxpayer, in following the ruling, will not be subject to interest or the unacceptable tax position penalty. Background A shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position can be imposed when a taxpayer’s tax position fails to meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. The penalty applies when the tax position involves a significant amount of tax. Use-of-money interest imposed on a taxpayer is charged when tax is underpaid and compensates the Crown for not having the use of its money. It is possible that an unacceptable tax position penalty and/or use-of-money interest may apply if the taxpayer has underpaid their tax, even if this is as a result of having relied on advice provided by Inland Revenue. 43 CHARGING FOR BINDING RULINGS AND GST AND FEES FOR NON- RESIDENT APPLICATIONS (Clauses 88 and 89) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces a more flexible fee waiver provision and a reduction of 1/9th of the fee for zero-rated supplies of binding rulings by amending the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999. The amendments will allow such factors as the nature of the issue and the skill and experience applied by Inland Revenue staff in providing the rulings to be taken into account in charging for binding rulings. The amendments also bring the Regulations in line with existing GST policy. Application date The amendments will apply new rulings made from the date of enactment. Key features The Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 will be amended to provide for a more flexible fee-waiver provision based on what the Commissioner considers is fair and reasonable. The fees for zero-rated supplies of binding rulings will be reduced by the tax fraction of the fee. Background Private, product and status binding rulings all incur fees that are based on recovering the cost of providing the ruling. Currently, Inland Revenue may in exceptional circumstances, at the Commissioner’s discretion, waive in whole or in part any fee payable by an applicant. More flexibility is required for the exercise of the waiver. The Regulations will therefore change the requirement to one based on what is fair and reasonable having regard to such factors as the nature of the issue and the skill and experience applied by Inland Revenue staff. The fees for zero-rated supplies of binding rulings will be reduced by the tax fraction of the fee. Currently, the fees assume a GST rate of 12.5% and do not take into account the fact that binding rulings issued to non-residents outside New Zealand may be zero- rated under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Therefore, any binding ruling issued to a New Zealand resident is in effect cheaper than if that same ruling were supplied to a non-resident. This is because the New Zealand resident, if registered for GST, can generally claim an input tax credit for the GST cost of acquiring the binding ruling. The non-resident, on the other hand, is unlikely to meet the requirements for registration or input tax credit entitlement. 44 45 Other policy matters 46 47 INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2010–11 tax year. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2010–11 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2010–11 tax year will be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The rates in schedule 1 that apply for the 2010–11 year are those that applied for the 2009–10 year. 48 CONTINUING THE TAX EXEMPTION FOR NON-RESIDENT RIG OPERATORS FOR A FURTHER FIVE YEARS (Clause 9) Summary of proposed amendment Section CW 57 of the Act provides a tax exemption for income derived by a non- resident company from oil and gas exploration in an offshore permit area. The current exemption expires on 31 December 2009. The bill extends the exemption for a further five years, until 31 December 2014 to mitigate the additional costs and delays that could occur in the absence of the exemption and to provide companies with a degree of long- term certainty. Application date The amendment applies retrospectively. This means the tax exemption will apply to income derived from oil and gas exploration in an offshore permit area between the beginning of the non-resident company’s 2005–06 income year and the 31 December 2014. Background In May 2009 the Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Energy and Resources announced that as part of Budget 2009 the existing tax exemption for offshore oil and gas exploration due to expire on 31 December 2009 would be extended for five more years until 31 December 2014. The exemption was introduced in 2004 because the 183-day rule for having a permanent establishment was having a negative impact on longer-term exploration programmes in New Zealand waters. Before the exemption, non-resident offshore rig operators and seismic vessels had tended to stay in New Zealand for a period of less than 183 days (so as to not create a permanent establishment), even if further exploration had been desirable beyond the 183-day window. In some cases a different rig was mobilised to complete the exploration programme. This added to the costs of exploration and introduced delays to exploration drilling and any subsequent discovery of new oil or gas. Extending the exemption for a further five years will provide companies planning exploration programmes with the certainty they require to commit to further long-term exploration. 49 CHARITABLE DONEE ORGANISATION (Clause 34) Summary of proposed amendment Cure Kids is to be recognised as a charitable donee organisation by being added to the list of charitable donee organisations in schedule 32. This will enable donors to obtain tax relief on their donations to Cure Kids. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2010–11 tax year. Background For an overseas-focussed charitable organisation to be a charitable donee organisation, it must be added to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Individuals who donate to charitable donee organisations are entitled to a donations tax credit of 33⅓ percent of the amount they have donated up to the level of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities who donate to charitable donee organisations are entitled to a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. The decision to recognise an organisation as a charitable donee organisation is a specific policy decision by the government. This means the government’s decision to recognise an organisation as a donee organisation involves various considerations including wider government overseas aid objectives and fiscal implications, as well as the credibility and internal controls and management of the organisation. Cure Kids was established in 1971 to conduct, support and fund research into the health of children, and to make the best use of the knowledge so gained for the furtherance of health and the cure, prevention and treatment of disease in children. Cure Kids now wishes to extend its work initially to Fiji and later to other countries. The amendment will allow Cure Kids to be recognised as a charitable donee organisation and allow donors to claim tax relief on their donations to Cure Kids. 50 PERMANENT FOREST SINK INITIATIVE – EMISSIONS UNIT TRANSACTIONS (Clauses 5, 10, 11, 13, 20, 32(4) and (9)) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to align the income tax treatment of transactions in emissions units received under the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) with the income tax treatment of transactions in emissions units received in relation to post-1989 forestry under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The two schemes are very similar and the nature of emissions units transactions under the two schemes is virtually identical, so it makes sense for the tax treatment to be the same. Application date The amendments apply from 1 January 2009. Key features The subject of these amendments is the income tax treatment of the receipt of emissions units from government, and the surrender of emissions units to government, by PFSI participants. These amendments make the tax treatment of these transactions the same as the treatment of those transactions for post-1989 foresters under the ETS, which is that the receipt of emissions units gives rise to income and the surrender is deductible, both on a cash basis. Background Foresters who choose to participate under the ETS for post-1989 forests receive emissions units from government reflecting the carbon capture in their growing forests. If the forest is harvested or otherwise lost, an equivalent number of emissions units to those received must be repaid to government. The tax treatment of transactions in emissions units for post-1989 foresters was discussed in the issues paper, Emissions Trading Tax Issues, released in September 2007 and enacted as part of the Climate Change Response Act 2002. Those amendments recognise that transactions in emissions units are part of the ordinary business of post-1989 foresters under the ETS, and so are on revenue account. So, the receipt of emissions units gives rise to income, and the surrender of emissions units is deductible. The amendments also recognise that forestry is generally taxable on a cash basis, unlike other businesses which are generally taxable on an accruals basis. 51 Under PFSI, foresters may choose to enter into covenants with government. Those covenants limit their ability to harvest the forest, but entitle them to receive emissions units for the carbon captured in the growing forest. If the forest is harvested or otherwise lost, an equivalent number of emissions units to those received must be “repaid” to government. PFSI and post-1989 forestry under ETS have very similar transactions in emissions units, both in frequency and nature. Accordingly, it makes sense for their tax treatment to be the same, which is the effect of the amendments in this bill. 52 AMENDMENTS TO CURRENCY CONVERSION RULES – SECTION YF 1 (Clause 33) Summary of proposed amendment The drafting of section YF 1 in the 2007 Act incorporated the effect of the decision of the Privy Council in Payne v The Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation \[1936\] AC 497; \[1936\] 2 All ER 793. The effect of that decision is that, in calculating taxable income, amounts derived in a foreign currency should be converted at the rate of exchange applying at the time of the transaction, unless the legislation otherwise provided. The amendment to section YF 1 codifies the Commissioner’s practice of permitting alternative currency conversion methods and alternative rates to the actual exchange rates at the time a transaction occurs. This practice was adopted to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, given the Privy Council’s decision in Payne that currency conversions should be made at the actual exchange rate at the time of the transaction, unless otherwise provided by statute. Application date The amendment is to apply from the 2008–09 income year. Key features Under the 2004 Income Tax Act and earlier legislation, some provisions of the Act had explicit currency conversion rules (in particular the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules). However, apart from those specific rules, the Act was silent on methods of conversion. The common law approach adopted by the courts (Payne) requires conversion at the actual exchange rate applying at the date of the transaction, unless otherwise provided by statute. To reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, the Commissioner adopted an extra-statutory practice of permitting alternative rates or currency conversion methods to that stipulated in Payne. The currency conversion rules from the 2004 Act have been rewritten into section YF 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, the drafting of that section reflects the effect of the decision in Payne, and arguably prevents the Commissioner from continuing the extra-statutory practice of permitting alternative rates or currency conversion methods. The amendment legislates for the previous practice of the Commissioner, and now allows the Commissioner to approve taxpayer-specific methods or rates, as well as general methods or rates. 53 Remedial matters 54 55 GST INCURRED IN MAKING CERTAIN SUPPLIES OF FINANCIAL SERVICES (Clauses 2(2) and 81) Summary of proposed amendment A technical change is being made to section 20C of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The proposed change ensures that the formula in section 20C, which calculates a deduction for GST incurred in making certain supplies of financial services, produces the correct amount. The formula applies in connection with supplies of financial services between financial services providers. The current formula has the effect of diluting the value of supplies made to other financial services providers and correspondingly reduces the amount that should otherwise be deductible. This outcome is inconsistent with the policy intent. Application date The change applies from 1 January 2005, the date that section 20C first had effect. Key features Section 20C is being changed by defining element “c” of the formula so that it refers to exempt supplies of financial services, rather than to total supplies, made by the supplier. Background In 2005, changes were made to the GST Act which zero-rated certain business-to- business supplies of financial services by introducing new sections 11A(1)(q) and (r). The changes allowed suppliers of financial services to claim input tax deductions when previously such supplies were treated as exempt from GST (and no input tax deductions were allowed). The 2005 changes were designed to remove economic distortions such as “tax cascades”, a phenomenon that occurs when irrecoverable GST connected with making exempt supplies is passed on by a supplier to another GST-registered person who makes taxable supplies and so on. Financial services supplied between financial services providers (such as banks) cannot generally be zero-rated because most recipient financial services providers (“the direct supplier” in section 20C) will not satisfy the requirements under sections 11A(1)(q) and (r). Financial services providers are therefore unable to deduct input tax in connection with these transactions because they are exempt from GST. 56 The deduction calculated by the formula in section 20C replaces the denied input tax deduction, to the extent that the direct supplier makes supplies to taxable businesses. It therefore reduces the possibility of tax cascades arising if the financial services are on- supplied by the direct supplier to taxable businesses. The amount deductible is the product of the formula: e d c b a×× 5 The formula is based on two fractions which measure the mix of taxable and exempt supplies made by the supplier and the direct supplier in a taxable period. The product of the two fractions is applied to the amount of input tax that is unclaimed by the supplier for the taxable period. The proposed amendment to the formula ensures that it produces a result that is consistent with the original policy intent. The amendment changes the denominator in the first fraction (element “c”) so that it is defined by reference to the amount of total exempt supplies of financial services made by the supplier rather than its current reference to total supplies, which has the effect of reducing the amount that should otherwise be deducted. 5 Where: a is the total amount in respect of the taxable period that the registered person– (a) would not be able to deduct under section 20(3); and (b) would be able to deduct under section 20(3),other than under section 20(3)(h), if all supplies of financial services by the financial services provider were taxable supplies: b is the total value of exempt supplies of financial services made to the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period: c is the total value of supplies made in respect of the taxable period: d is the total value of taxable supplies made by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period as determined under section 20D: e is the total value of supplies made by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period as determined under section 20D 57 PORTFOLIO CLASS LAND LOSS (Clauses 19 and 20) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the definition of “portfolio class land loss”. This will clarify that portfolio investment entities (PIEs) that own land offshore can allocate tax losses arising from foreign exchange contracts to investors. Application date The amendment to section HL 32 will apply from 1 October 2007, the date the PIE rules were introduced. The amendment to section HM 65 will apply from 1 April 2010, the date the rewritten PIE rules apply from. Key features Amendments to section HL 32, and to rewritten section HM 65 of the Income Tax Act 2007 change the definition of “portfolio land class loss” to clarify that land-owning portfolio investment entities (PIEs) that invest offshore can allocate tax losses that arise from foreign exchange contracts to their investors. This is consistent with the policy intent of the PIE rules when they were enacted. Background At the end of the year, a PIE usually receives a cash rebate from Inland Revenue for any tax losses it has made, which it then allocates to its investors. However, PIEs that invest predominantly in land or land-owning companies (“land PIEs”) cannot receive a cash rebate for their tax losses at the end of the year. Instead, when a land PIE makes a tax loss on its investments it carries the loss forward to offset income in future years. This is to prevent excessive tax losses arising from heavily geared land investments. Under the current rules, a problem arises for land PIEs with portfolio investments in foreign land-owning companies. As these investments are often denominated in foreign currency, these PIEs typically enter into foreign exchange hedging contracts to remove or reduce the currency risk associated with the investment. These hedging contracts result in a loss if the foreign currency in which the investment is held appreciates against the New Zealand dollar. Under the current rules, the PIE must carry forward these losses that arise as a result of the hedging contract rather than allocate the losses to its investors. 58 The PIE’s investment in the foreign land-owning company is generally subject to fair dividend rate (FDR) taxation at 5% and always generates income for tax purposes. In some years, the land PIE’s FDR income will not be sufficient to offset the foreign exchange loss and an overall tax loss may arise. Under current legislation, a land PIE will be required to carry this loss forward. This is the wrong policy outcome because the loss arises from the foreign exchange hedging contract. The loss does not arise from the underlying land investment. The proposal provides that foreign exchange losses associated with portfolio investments in foreign land-owning companies are allocated to investors as they arise. 59 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 18, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32(10)-(11) 37, 38, 85 and 86) The following amendments reflect the recommendations of the Rewrite Advisory Panel’s consideration of submissions on the rewritten Income Tax Acts. The Panel monitors the working of the 2007 Income Tax Act and reviews submissions on what may be unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten. The Panel recommends legislative action, when necessary, to correct any problems. Definition of a “controlled foreign company” – sections EX 1(1)(b) of the Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007 (Clauses 18 and 85) The Rewrite Advisory Panel agreed with a submission that section EX 1(1)(b) of the 2004 and 2007 Acts did not correctly reflect the outcome given in section CG 4(2)(b) of the 1994 Act. Under the 1994 Act, a foreign company was not a controlled foreign company if a non-resident shareholders control interests were: • at least equal to or greater than 40 percent; and • there was no single New Zealand-resident shareholder having control interests greater than the control interests of the non-resident. The amendment restores the effect of section CG 4(2)(B) of the 1994 Act to section EX 1 in both the 2004 and 2007 Acts. As the provision is retrospective, it will have the effect of validating taxpayers who have continued to: • disclose their interests in a foreign company as an interest in a controlled foreign company; and • return their attributed CFC income from controlled foreign companies. In addition, retrospectivity potentially exposes taxpayers to penalties in relation to: • non-disclosure of interests in a controlled foreign company; or • non-inclusion of attributed CFC income in their return of income. Therefore, the amendment includes a savings provision to protect taxpayers from adverse affects of the retrospective amendment. The savings provision applies to a taxpayer who has taken a tax position in relation to whether the person has an interest in a controlled foreign company: • in a return of income filed before (the last date of the period to which the savings provision applies); or • for the purpose of a disclosure requirement occurring before (the last date of the period to which the savings provision applies). 60 The savings provision applies only if the tax position is based on the wording in section EX 1 of the 2004 or 2007 Acts (as appropriate) before this amendment. The amendments apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year with both the 2004 and 2007 Acts being amended to give effect to this application, subject to the savings provisions described above. Tax credits of trustees – section HC 24(2) (Clause 21) An amendment ensures that a trustee may use tax credits, such as imputation credits, to satisfy the trustee’s income tax liability in relation to trustee income. The amendment clarifies that the provision prevents a trustee from having a tax credit referred to in either subpart LC or subpart LD. In the 2007 Act, section HC 24(2) prevents a trustee from using any tax credits to satisfy its income tax obligations. The Rewrite Advisory Panel agreed with a submission that this was an unintended change in law, as the 2004 Act did not prevent a trustee from using imputation credits (or other credits under Part L of the 2004 Act) to satisfy its income tax liability in relation to trustee income. The restriction in the 2004 Act was to prevent the trustee from obtaining personal tax credits, such as the low income earner rebate and the rebate for charitable donations. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Formula for calculating the maximum amount for the total deduction of a supplementary dividend holding company – section LP 10(1) (Clause 27) The amendment corrects the formula in section LP 10(1) to restore the effect of the formula given in the corresponding provision of the 2004 Act (section LE 4(2)). This formula is used to calculate the annual total deduction for an income year of a supplementary dividend holding company. The Panel also noted that the outcome given by the formula in section LP 10(1) of the 2007 Act may give a total deduction greater than that given by the formula in section LE 4(2) of the 2004 Act. The Panel noted that the recommended retrospective amendment limiting the amount of the total deduction can adversely affect a taxpayer who has filed a 2008–09 return of income for the 2008–09 tax year, applying section LP 10(1) as drafted. Therefore, a savings provisions applies to protect a taxpayer from being adversely affected by the retrospective change, if the taxpayer has relied on the wording of the formula in section LP 10(1) of the 2007 Act in taking a tax position in a return of income filed before the last date of the period for which the savings provision applies. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. However, a savings provision applies, as described above. 61 Tax pooling – section OB 6 (Clause 28) An amendment to section OB 6 clarifies that an imputation credit arises for an imputation credit account (ICA) company that receives an entitlement to funds held in a tax pooling account by way of transfer of that entitlement from another ICA company. The amendment provides that the time of the credit occurs at the time of the transfer of the entitlement. The Rewrite Advisory Panel agreed with a submission that section OB 6 produced a different outcome from section ME 4(2)(ad) of the 2004 Act, in that a credit to the ICA does not arise for the transferee on the transfer of an amount that is an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Definition of “revenue account property” – section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (Clauses 32(10)-(11) and 86(1)) The amendment clarifies the definition of “revenue account property” in both the 2004 and 2007 Acts to ensure that that if “revenue account property” becomes valueless, it does not cease to be revenue account property. This amendment ensures that the cost of revenue account property that becomes valueless may still be deductible under the general permission and allocated to the appropriate income year under section EA 1 (Trading stock) or section EA 2 (Other revenue account property). The Rewrite Advisory Panel considered the drafting of the definition of “revenue account property” in the 2004 and 2007 Acts could be read as requiring a factual test to be applied. The consequence of that interpretation is that property that becomes valueless, despite initially coming within the meaning of “revenue account property”, would no longer be “revenue account property”. The Panel was concerned that the cost of the property might then not be deductible as a result of the property’s loss in value. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year (both the 2004 and 2007 Acts being amended to give effect to this application). Sections 24M(5) and 24N(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Clauses 37 and 38) The amendment corrects wording in section 24M(5), as recommended by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. The Panel’s concern was that section 24M(5) could be read as being in conflict with section 24M(1), effectively negating the use of an exemption certificate issued under section 24M(1). This exemption certificate relieves the payer of schedular payments to withhold tax from the payment. The same concern as raised in this submission to the Panel for sections 24M(5) also relates to section 24N(5) in relation to a special tax rate certificate issued under section 24N(1). 62 The amendments to both sections 24M and 24N therefore ensure that: • subsection (5) does not override the effect of subsection (1), to prevent a zero rate of withholding being applied to schedular payments; and • a person commits a knowledge offence, under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act, if the person alters an exemption certificate or special rate certificate issued by the Commissioner in relation to schedular payments; and • a person commits a knowledge offence, under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act, if the person uses or attempts to use an exemption certificate, that has expired or been cancelled by the Commissioner, to obtain a zero rate of withholding from schedular payments made to the person; and • a person commits a knowledge offence, under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act, if the person uses or attempts to use a special tax rate certificate, that has expired or been cancelled by the Commissioner, to obtain a rate of withholding for schedular payments less than the rate set out in Schedule 4, Part C, clause 1(b) of the 2007 Act. The amendments apply from the 2008–09 income year. Tax credits and a person who is an absentee – sections LC 3 and LC 6 (Clauses 25 and 26) Sections LC 3(1) and LC 6(1) are being amended to make clear, in the text of the provisions, that neither the child’s income tax credit (section LC 3) nor the housekeeping tax credit (LC 6) are available for a person who is an absentee for income tax purposes. The requirements to obtain the child income tax credit include attendance at school for the tax year, and so this tax credit is inherently not available for an absentee. Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act prevents an absentee from receiving the housekeeper tax credit. The amendments apply from the 2008–09 income year. 63 CROSS-REFERENCES FOR DEPRECIATION RULES (Clauses 14 and 46) Changes are being made to update cross-references to schedules for the tax depreciation rules that take into account the changes that came into effect from 1 April 2005. The reference to schedule 12 in section EE 30(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being replaced with schedule 11, which is the correct schedule for assets acquired after 1 April 2005. A reference to schedule 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being added to sections 91AAH(2)(a) and 91AAH(3)(ab) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These changes ensure that the Commissioner is able to select the appropriate banded rates schedule when considering a special or provisional depreciation rate application. These changes are consistent with the original policy intent of having different banded rates applying to assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005. Application date The change applies from the 2008–09 and later income years. 64 IFRS – FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS – ANTI-ARBITRAGE PROVISIONS (Clauses 15, 16, 17, 83 and 84) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the anti-arbitrage rules for IFRS taxpayers. Each of sections EW 15E, EW 15F and EW 15G of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections EW 15D and EW 15E of the Income Tax Act 2004 will have a new subparagraph added to ensure they fully implement the original policy for use of the relevant tax methods. Application date The changes are effective from 1 April 2008 for the Income Tax Act 2007 and 1 April 2007 for the Income Tax Act 2004. Key features The changes ensure that the relevant methods can be used for financial arrangements which are treated under IFRS as hedges of non-financial arrangements. Background The original anti-arbitrage rules in these sections did not achieve the intended effect and subsequent amendment in 2008 also did not remedy this aspect of the rules.

The bill introduces new resident withholding tax (RWT) rates on interest income to align them with the new tax rates. The default rate of RWT which applies when an individual does not choose an RWT rate with his or her financial institution will also be changed from 19.5% to 38%. The reason for changing the default RWT rate to the highest income tax rate is to encourage individuals to select the rate that is consistent with their marginal tax rate. Interest payers will be required at least once a year to remind recipients of interest to ensure that they are on the RWT rate that is consistent with their marginal tax rate. Application date Alignment of RWT rates with current tax rates generally applies from 1 April 2010. However, in relation to the default rate, the change to a 38% rate applies to accounts opened from 1 April 2010 and from 2011 for people with bank accounts as at 1 April 2010. As a transitional measure, individuals with bank accounts at 1 April 2010 who are on the current RWT rate of 19.5% will have their rate automatically shifted up to 21% for one year from 1 April 2010. If they do not confirm the 21% rate or choose another rate, their RWT default rate will rise to 38% from 1 April 2011. A 30% RWT rate on interest income paid to companies will be optional from 1 April 2010 and compulsory from 1 April 2011. Key features Schedule 1, part D of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains the new RWT rates for interest in relation to individuals and companies. The current and proposed rate structure for RWT on interest is shown in the table below: 4 Marginal income tax rates Present RWT rates Proposed RWT rates Proposed application date 12.5% 12.5% 1 April 2010 21% 19.5% 21% 1 April 2010 30% 30% 1 April 2011, but at payer’s option earlier from 1 April 2010 33% 33% 33% No change 38% 38% or 39% 38% 1 April 2010 Application of 12.5% rate The 12.5% rate will be available to recipients of interest who provide their tax file number and who have a reasonable expectation for the year of election that their income will be in the range of $0 to $14,000. This approach attempts to ensure that the 12.5% rate is applied correctly and that taxpayers who elect 12.5% actively consider whether their RWT rate is consistent with their personal tax rate. Default RWT rate Schedule 1, part D, table 2 and new section RE 12(6) contain the provisions relating to shifting the default rate to 38%. The default rate will be set at 38%, the highest personal tax rate. It will apply from 1 April 2010 for individuals who open new bank accounts from that date and who do not choose an RWT rate with their bank or other financial institution. As a transitional measure, individuals with bank accounts as at 1 April 2010 who are on the 19.5% tax rate, will have their rate changed to 21% from 1 April 2010. This is necessary to ensure consistency with the marginal tax rate structure in place since the recent personal tax changes, in which the 19.5% statutory tax rate was removed and a 21% rate was introduced. These individuals will have a year from 1 April 2010 to choose one of the other rates (12.5%, 33% or 38%) or confirm that 21% is the appropriate RWT rate with their bank. New section RE 12(6) specifies that any individuals remaining on the 21% rate after 31 March 2011 who have not chosen that rate with their financial institution will be moved to a 38% default rate after that date. Non-declaration rate The rate that applies when a recipient does not provide the interest payer with a tax file number will be lowered from 39% to 38% from 1 April 2010, to reflect the change in the highest tax rate. 5 Requirement that interest payers remind recipients to check their RWT rate New section 26B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that interest income payers must ask individual recipients their RWT rate, at least once a year as part of their normal correspondence, to ensure that their RWT rate is consistent with their personal tax rate. RWT rate on interest income earned by companies Section RE 12(5) provides for an optional 30% RWT rate to be available to payers of interest to companies for the 2010–11 income year. From 1 April 2011, that RWT rate will be mandatory. This will align the RWT rate on interest paid to companies with the company tax rate. Background RWT is a withholding tax based on the marginal tax rate of the recipient of interest income. Its purpose is to ensure that tax is paid at source on that income at a rate that closely approximates the recipient’s actual tax liability. Compliance and administrative costs are therefore minimised as recipients are less likely to request a personal tax summary or file a return if tax is withheld at the correct rate. Currently, if individual recipients of interest income provide a tax file number but do not choose an RWT rate, the default rate is 19.5% (formerly the lowest statutory tax rate). As a personal tax rate of 19.5% no longer exists, it is necessary to move these taxpayers to a new rate. The reason for setting the default rate at 38% is to encourage individuals to consider what rate they should be taxed at and to choose the rate that is correct for them. An individual’s compliance costs may be reduced if they choose a rate that is consistent with their personal tax rate, because they are less likely to be required to square up their tax obligations at the end of the year. Encouraging individuals to choose the correct rate also promotes the integrity of the tax system and reduces administrative costs for Inland Revenue, as fewer contacts with taxpayers are required. Continuing the current approach of having the lowest tax rate as the default for RWT is not recommended, as the minimum statutory rate of 12.5% is considerably lower than the previous 19.5%. The majority of people using the default rate would have too little tax withheld, which would increase compliance and administrative costs. Additionally, there would be significant revenue implications. 6 AMENDMENTS TO TAX RATES ON PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITIES (Clause 49) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces changes to the tax rates on portfolio investment entities (PIEs) so they align with the new personal tax rate structure that was enacted in 2008. Currently, PIE tax rates are as follows: Taxable income Taxable + PIE income PIE tax rate $0 – $38,000 $0 – $60,000 19.5% $38,001 + Any 30% Any $60,001 and over 30% These rates should be aligned with the new personal tax rates which are 12.5% for income $0 to $14,000, 21% for income $14,001 to $48,000, 33% for income $48,001 to $70,000, and 38% for income over $70,000. This is to ensure that investors are not disadvantaged if they invest in a PIE rather than investing directly. This is particularly important as the tax on PIEs is a final tax. The PIE rates are capped at 30% so they align with the company tax rate of 30%. This alignment was necessary so that an investment in a PIE was not disadvantaged compared with an investment in, for example, an investment company that was not a PIE. The proposed new rates from 1 April 2010 are as follows: Taxable income Taxable + PIE income PIE tax rate $0 – $14,000 $0 – $48,000 12.5% $0 – $14,000 $48,001 – $70,000 21% $14,001 – $48,000 $0 – $70,000 21% $48,001 and over Any 30% Any $70,001 and over 30% Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2010. 7 ALIGNMENT OF RETIREMENT SCHEME CONTRIBUTION TAX RATES (Clauses 49(9), 51(2) and 61) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to align the retirement scheme contribution tax (RSCT) rates with the new personal tax rate structure from 1 April 2010. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 2010. Key features The definition of “retirement scheme prescribed rate” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be replaced with the following: • 0% if the person is a non-resident at the time and the contribution is non-resident passive income; or • 12.5% if the person: – has, in either of the two income years immediately before the year in which the contribution is made, taxable income of $14,000 or less; – is a non-resident and the retirement scheme contributor is a Māori authority, and the distribution is $200 or less; – is a non-resident and the retirement scheme contributor is a Māori authority and the person supplies the Māori authority with a notice under section 28C of the Tax Administration Act 1994; or • 21% if the person has, in either of the two income years immediately before the year in which the contribution is made, taxable income of $14,001 or more and less than or equal to $48,000; or • 33% if the person has, in either of the two income years immediately before the year in which the contribution is made, taxable income of $48,001 or more and less than or equal to $70,000; or • 38% in any other case. The basic rates for RSCT in table 5 of schedule 1 will also be aligned with the new personal tax rate structure. Section 28C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 currently requires a person who gives notice of a retirement scheme prescribed rate of less than 39% to include their Inland Revenue number in that notice. The bill replaces the 39% reference with 38%. 8 NEW SECONDARY TAX CODE (Clauses 52(1), 58, 59 and 62(1)) Summary of proposed amendments The bill amends the PAYE withholding tax rules to introduce a new 12.5% secondary tax code. The new code will be available for employees with secondary income who expect to earn under $14,000 per year. This brings the withholding rates on secondary employment income into line with the recent lowering of personal tax rates. Application date The changes will apply from 1 April 2010. Key features New section 24B(3)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and schedule 2, part A, clause 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 introduces the 12.5% secondary tax code. Employees may choose the “SB” code for secondary employment earnings if their annual income is not more than $14,000. Section 24C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to ensure that people who receive income-tested benefits can choose the 12.5% tax code for any employment income if that is their correct code, and to clarify that employees who receive an income-tested benefit can choose their correct secondary tax code for their employment income. Background Employees who receive secondary employment income (or those receiving income- tested benefits or student allowances who are also in employment) must choose a secondary tax code for their secondary source of employment income, based on the marginal tax rate they expect to be on for that year. In 2008 the government introduced a new set of personal income tax rates. This new tax scale included a 12.5% rate for income of $14,000 and below. Currently, the lowest rate for withholding tax on secondary employment income is 21%. This means there is the potential for lower-income individuals to have excess tax withheld on their secondary income. A new 12.5% code will be introduced to more accurately withhold tax on secondary income. 9 PERSONAL TAX SUMMARIES AUTOMATICALLY ISSUED (Clauses 62(2), 63 and 64) Summary of proposed amendments The bill removes the current requirement for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue personal tax summaries (PTSs). This will give Inland Revenue flexibility in selecting who PTSs should be issued to. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2010. Key features Amendments to sections 33A(5), 80C and 80D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue discretion over which groups of taxpayers PTSs should be issued to. Background Currently, Inland Revenue is required to issue PTSs to several categories of individual taxpayers. Current categories of taxpayers who automatically receive PTSs include those with over $200 of employment income withheld using certain tax codes. However, issuing PTSs may not be necessary for all of these groups, particularly when the correct amount of tax is likely to have been withheld during the year. Because issuing PTSs imposes compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and Inland Revenue, legislative changes have been made to give Inland Revenue flexibility in selecting who PTSs should be issued to. Taxpayers will continue to be able to request a PTS from Inland Revenue. 10 TAX TREATMENT OF EXTRA PAYS (Clauses 42, 43 and 52(2)) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces a new 12.5% withholding tax rate for extra pays to align them with the new personal tax rate structure, and makes a remedial amendment to the extra pay rules to more accurately tax extra pays earned in a job where a secondary tax code is used. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2010. Key features An amendment to section RD 17(2) and schedule 2, part B, table 1 introduces a new bottom rate of 12.5% for extra pays, to align with the new personal tax rate structure. It ensures that if a low-income earner receives a lump sum payment and their total annual income is $14,000 or less, they will be taxed correctly. Extra pay in secondary jobs New section RD 17(3) and (4) will more accurately tax extra pays earned in a job where a secondary tax code is used. It will result in people who receive an extra pay for their secondary income being taxed on that income at a rate which reflects their extra pay income, their secondary income and a proxy for their primary income. Employee’s option to choose rate An amendment to section RD 10 allows an employee to choose a 21% rate for extra pays if they expect their taxable income to be no more than $48,000. Background Lump sum payments made to employees in relation to their employment are known as “extra pays”. These are payments that are not related to overtime worked and are not regularly included in a pay period. They include bonuses, gratuities, back-pay and profit shares, redundancy payments and retiring allowances. Tax on extra pays is currently withheld at a flat rate of 21%, 33% or 38%. These rates are intended to reflect the employee’s marginal tax rate. 11 In 2008 a new rate of 12.5% was introduced as the bottom personal tax rate. Before 1 April 2008, when the bottom personal tax rate was 15%, there was no corresponding rate for extra pays. Because the threshold at which the 21% rate applied was raised to $14,001 from 1 April 2009, a rate reflecting the lowest tax rate is necessary. Another problem is the tax treatment of extra pays earned in secondary jobs. The current treatment withholds tax on extra pays earned in relation to a secondary job on the basis that the income earned on the secondary job is the person’s total income. This can often result in insufficient tax being withheld. An amendment to section RD 17 addresses this problem by requiring the deducting employer to approximate the person’s primary income when calculating the deduction that is made on the extra pay. The approximation is equal to the income threshold at which the employee’s secondary tax code starts to apply. For example, if an employee has chosen a secondary code of 21% the secondary employer assumes that the person has primary employment income of $14,001. 12 ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS (Clause 57) Summary of proposed amendment The bill contains an amendment that ensures that Inland Revenue can issue notices and other information electronically in a broader range of circumstances, and makes the tax administration rules for sending information electronically more consistent with the rules for sending information via post. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The amendment to section 14(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 replaces the current requirement that a person must consent to Inland Revenue communicating electronically, with a requirement that Inland Revenue can provide information electronically if there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the communication will not be received by the person. Background Currently, Inland Revenue issues many of its notices and other information to taxpayers by post. As part of a long-term project, Inland Revenue intends to provide more information electronically. However, the current tax rules require a taxpayer’s consent for Inland Revenue to provide a communication electronically (the consent can be implied or inferred). The requirement for consent is impractical in some circumstances and inconsistent with the tax administration rules applicable to sending notices via post. 13 PERMANENT FOREST SINK INITIATIVE AND FORESTERS (Clauses 49, 54, 82 and 83) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to make it clear that expenses incurred by a person deriving Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PSFI) emissions units are treated as forestry business expenses. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2005–06 income year. Background The PFSI is a climate change initiative under which a person who owns land that has been reforested, or which the person intends to reforest, can enter into a covenant with the government, and in exchange for meeting certain conditions, receive emission units. The earning of these units may not always constitute a forestry business under the Income Tax Acts. Forestry businesses are entitled under the Act to more favourable tax treatment than other businesses. Since PFSI foresters should receive the same treatment as foresters who carry on a forestry business, the amendment defines “forestry business” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to include PFSI activities. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is also correspondingly amended. 14 TAX RECOVERY ARRANGEMENTS (Clause 56 and 68) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 so New Zealand can meet its treaty obligations to provide collection assistance to certain countries for amounts of unpaid tax before the time limit for objection rights has expired. This amendment will resolve an inconsistency between New Zealand’s treaty obligations and the wording of part 10A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which currently prohibits the Commissioner from providing collection assistance over unpaid tax until the time limit for objection rights has expired. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments repeal the definition of “contested tax” in part 10A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and replace it with a definition of “uncontested tax”. The new definition of “uncontested tax” under section 173B clarifies the circumstances in which New Zealand can provide collection assistance under a tax recovery arrangement. Background Part 10A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises entering into a collection assistance arrangement. It also sets limits on the collection assistance that New Zealand can provide. Specifically, part 10A prohibits the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from providing collection assistance in relation to an amount of unpaid tax if the time limit for objection rights has not expired. This is inconsistent with Article 4(2) of the Netherlands Tax Recovery Convention, which generally imposes an obligation on the requested State to collect unpaid taxes unless the tax assessment is actually subject to an objection. Part 10A was enacted with the specific purpose of authorising the entering into of the Netherlands Tax Recovery Convention. Part 10A was framed with a view to also contemplate future collection assistance arrangements with other countries. Similar arrangements have now also been concluded with Australia, Poland and the United Kingdom. 15 TIMING OF ALLOCATION OF BENEFICIARY INCOME (Clause 18) Summary of proposed amendment The bill removes a timing problem for tax agents who administer trusts, in particular, to allow them more time to allocate beneficiary income. Currently, beneficiary income must be allocated within an arbitrary six months of a trust’s balance date. This creates undue pressure for tax agents at a time when clients’ business tax requirements must also be met. Application date The amendment will apply for income derived in the 2009–10 income year. Background Under current tax law trustees must allocate beneficiary income within six months of the trust’s balance date. However, this does not fit well with tax agents’ work schedules as frequently they have to give priority to trust accounts to ensure the six-months rule is met. This can conflict with the more commercial requirements of tax agents’ clients. Section HC 6(1) is being amended to allow the income allocation to be made in the longer of the following periods: • six months after balance date; or • the shorter of: – the time in which the tax return is due; or – the time it is filed. Also, subsections HC 6(3) and (4) concerning which year the beneficiary returns the income have been combined and their application is clarified. 16 GST TREATMENT OF WASTE DISPOSAL LEVY PAYMENT (Clause 71) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to clarify the tax treatment of the waste disposal levy which was introduced on 1 July 2009, as part of the Waste Minimisation Act 2008. The amendment specifies the treatment of payments of this levy as consideration for a supply of services in furtherance of a taxable activity which are subject to goods and services tax (GST). Application date The amendment will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2009 to align with the date on which the levy applies. Key features The amendment made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 clarifies that the three central payments made in relation to the waste disposal levy are consideration for a supply of services made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity and those supplies are therefore subject to GST. These payments will give rise to input tax credits when they are made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The three payments are: • payment of the levy from the user of a waste disposal facility to the operator of that waste disposal facility; • payment of the levy from the waste disposal facility operator to the Secretary for the Ministry of the Environment, represented by the levy collector; and • payment made from the Secretary for the Ministry of the Environment to funding recipients or territorial authorities and for other payments described in section 30 of the Waste Minimisation Act 2008. Background The activities of public and local authorities are included within the scope of New Zealand’s GST rules to ensure that consumers of goods and services supplied by the public sector on a commercial basis (in competition with the private sector) are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by their choice of supplier. It also avoids the complexities experienced in other jurisdictions: • in determining whether the activities undertaken by the public sector are commercial or non-commercial; and 17 • provides a basis for apportioning GST charged and input tax deductions between the two activities. For these reasons most levies (for example, road user charges and fire service levies) are subject to GST. 18 CORRECTION OF MINOR ERRORS IN SUBSEQUENT RETURNS (Clause 66) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment clarifies the Commissioner’s discretion to allow taxpayers who have made minor errors in a return (involving $500 or less in tax) to correct them in a subsequent return. The amendment is aimed at reducing compliance costs and the taxpayer’s exposure to use-of-money interest and penalties. Application date The amendment will apply from the day after the bill receives Royal assent. Key features New section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the Commissioner the discretion to allow taxpayers to correct minor errors made in income tax, fringe benefit tax or goods and services tax returns in the next subsequent return after discovering the error(s). A minor error is defined as an error (or errors) that was caused by a clear mistake, simple oversight, or mistaken understanding on the taxpayer’s part, and for a single return, causes a total reduction in the resulting assessment of $500 or less. For this purpose, errors the taxpayer may have made for income tax, fringe benefit tax or goods and services tax are treated separately. In these circumstances the Commissioner may allow the person to correct the error(s) in the next income tax, fringe benefit tax or goods and services tax return that is due after discovery of the error. Background Taxpayers are required to correctly determine the amount of tax payable under tax laws. If an amount is not correctly calculated or not paid on time, penalties can apply. Use- of-money interest also generally applies if the correct amount of tax is not paid when due. Currently, for GST returns, registered persons are sometimes able to correct minor errors in a subsequent return-period. For other tax types, however, errors are generally required to be corrected in the returns in which they arose. This involves (in addition to the penalty and interest implications noted above) further compliance costs for the taxpayer. 19 By giving the Commissioner the discretion to allow taxpayers to correct minor errors in previous returns by including them in current returns, taxpayers and their agents will have a greater level of comfort in making changes. This will also reduce the number of interactions taxpayers need to have with Inland Revenue. The amendment is largely aimed at helping to reduce tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises and individuals, although it will apply to taxpayers generally. It was first outlined in the government discussion document, Reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, released in December 2007. 20 21 Remedial matters 22 23 COST OF TIMBER (Clauses 11, 49, 77 and 81) Summary of proposed amendment Changes are being introduced to part of the forestry rules consequent to the introduction of new generally accepted accounting principles (IFRS or International Financial Reporting Standards GAAP) which values growing trees at value rather than cost. Application date The amendment will apply from taxpayers’ 2007–08 income year, or an earlier year if they were an early adopter of GAAP. Background The main purpose of section DP 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section DP 10 of the Income Tax Act 2004) was to allow a deduction of certain forestry expenditure that might not otherwise be deductible. It also quantifies and times this deduction. Given the newer revenue account property rules, arguably its main purpose falls away. However, it still allows some amounts to be deducted that otherwise might not be deductible. Also it points into the relevant Part E timing rules when the amounts are deductible. However, it is linked to the accounting treatment of expenditure that should be capitalised as part of the “cost of bush” under GAAP. The section has been amended to reflect the introduction of IFRS GAAP which values biological assets, such as growing trees, at value, not cost. Thus GAAP is not now referred to. For clarity, section DP 11(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section DP 10(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004) makes it clear that if restoration expenditure is dealt with under section DB 46 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004), it is not deductible under this section. 24 ATTRIBUTION RULE AND COMPANY INTERMEDIARIES (Clause 16) Summary of proposed amendments Changes are being introduced to facilitate amendments enacted in 2007 regarding the attribution rule and the new 30% company tax rate. Application date The amendment will apply from the 2008–09 income year, the date of the company tax rate change. Background The attribution rule is an anti-avoidance rule that aims to prevent employees using an intermediary (usually a company or a trust) to avoid paying income tax at the top individual marginal rate. When the rule applies, the income of the intermediary is attributed to the individual who provided the services. To prevent double taxation where the company is an intermediary, it receives deemed imputation credits. The Income Tax Act 2007 allows certain companies which are not qualifying companies (QCs) to use the QC fully imputed/exempt qualifying company income distribution mechanism. This was to prevent double taxation that could arise with the attribution rule when the new 30% company tax rate was introduced. However, the deemed imputation credits were not cancelled at that time. New section GB 27(5) solves this problem by cancelling the deemed credits immediately before they are distributed. 25 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND TWO GAAPS (Clauses 8, 9, 49, 52, 74, 75, 78 and 79) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces changes to the research and development (R&D) rules to allow for the fact that New Zealand currently operates two forms of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Application date The amendments are backdated to the introduction of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) GAAP amendments – generally from the 2007–08 income year. Background Certain R&D deductions that are determined with reference to specific GAAP rules are allowed. In 2007 the Tax Acts were modified to allow for the introduction of IFRS GAAP. For R&D this involved changing the references into the specific GAAP R&D rules. At this stage it was thought that old GAAP would not continue to be used. However, for compliance cost reasons a decision was subsequently made that certain non-large or non-reporting entities could, at least temporarily, continue to use old GAAP. Therefore, the old GAAP R&D deductions need to be reinstated for taxation purposes. Amendments to clauses 8 (amending section DB 34, Income Tax Act 2007) and 74 (amending section DB 26, Income Tax Act 2004) allow for this. The other clauses amend “associated persons” definitions. 26 THE DEFINITION OF “ASSOCIATED PERSONS” IN THE GST ACT FOR CHARITABLE BODIES (Clause 70) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the definition of “associated persons” in the Goods and Services Act 1985 to ensure that donations made to and by charitable and non-profit bodies are not subject to GST if the donor or donee is associated with the charitable or non-profit body. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Two amendments to section 2A of the GST Act are proposed: • Section 2A(1)(f) associates a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust, unless the trustee is a charitable or non-profit body and the supply is made while carrying out the charitable purpose. The charitable and non-profit body exemption does not, however, extend to situations where the beneficiary is the charitable or non-profit body. The amendment will ensure that a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust are not associated persons if the beneficiary is a charitable or non-profit body. • Section 2A(1)(h) associates a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust if the same person is a settlor of both trusts. There is no exclusion for charitable and non-profit bodies. The amendment will ensure that two trustees with a common settlor are not associated when one of those trusts is a charitable or non-profit body. Background GST charged on a supply of goods and services is calculated on the value of that supply, which is normally the consideration paid for the goods and services in question. There is, therefore, a risk that two associated persons may agree to enter into a transaction with each other in order to reduce the GST charged on the transaction when the consideration charged for the goods or services is either reduced or is nil. To counter this the GST Act provides a special valuation rule so that the consideration for a supply is treated as being the open market value of the supply when the supply is made between associated persons. However, the special valuation rule applies to any supply made for nil value, including the donated goods and services made by or to a charitable or non-profit body. 27 Section 2A of the GST Act contains the definition of “associated persons”. A number of concerns have been identified with the current wording of the definition as it applies to charitable and non-profit bodies. The combined effect of the current wording of the “associated persons” definition and the special valuation rule noted above is that certain donations made to and by charitable and non-profit bodies could be subject to GST on the full open market value because they were made by or to an associated person. Activities of charitable and non-profit bodies do not involve the supply of goods and services in exchange for payment in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity but are performed in carrying out the principal purposes for which such bodies are established (such as collecting donations or making donations). As a result, these activities should be treated as being outside the GST base and should not be subject to GST, even if activities involve transacting with associated persons. The proposed amendments to the definition of “associated persons” are intended to achieve this policy outcome. 28 BINDING RULINGS ON THE INCOME TAX ACT 2004 (Clause 65) Summary of proposed amendment Currently Inland Revenue cannot make a binding ruling for the period before the Income Tax Act 2007 came into effect if the application for the ruling is received by Inland Revenue after the commencement of the 2008–09 income year. An amendment is being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to make binding rulings for this period. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. 29 MAKING THE REQUIREMENT TO PAY TAX IN DISPUTE A NON- DISPUTABLE DECISION (Clause 67) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces an amendment making the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion to require payment of all tax in dispute a non-disputable decision. Currently, a decision of the Commissioner to require full payment is a disputable decision. This was not intended. Therefore, section 138I(2B) will be added to section 138E, which sets out the provisions where there is no right of challenge, making the exercise of the discretion a non-disputable decision. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Background Section 138I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 concerns payment of tax in dispute. Since 2003 the Commissioner has been able to require that a disputant pay all of the tax in dispute if the Commissioner considers that there is a significant risk that the tax in dispute will not be paid should the disputant’s challenge not be successful (section 138I(2B)). This discretion is exercised in exceptional circumstances only, for example, where the Commissioner considers there is a flight risk. It was not intended that a decision of the Commissioner to require full payment should be a disputable decision. 30 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX AND INTERMEDIARIES OR AGENTS (Clauses 44, 48 and 81) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments clarify the application of the tax credit and RWT rules for intermediaries or agents acting on behalf of New Zealand residents with foreign investment fund (FIF) interests. Application date The amendment applies to distributions made via intermediaries or agents from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The amendment providing for a resident withholding tax credit to be available to a New Zealand resident applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year for the 2007 Act and from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year for the 2004 Act. Key features Sections RE 10B of the 2007 Income Tax Act and NF 2E of the 2004 Act apply if: • an intermediary or agent receives a distribution from a FIF on behalf of a New Zealand resident; and • section CD 36 applies to treat the distribution as not being a dividend; and • the intermediary has withheld an amount from the distribution under the resident withholding tax rules. Section RE 10B provides that for the purposes of the tax credit rules and for refunds of tax, the amount withheld is treated as resident withholding tax. This amendment is necessary because a consequence of section CD 36 applying to treat the distribution from the FIF as not being a dividend, is that a tax credit may not be available for the amount withheld. In addition, a minor amendment to section RM 8 clarifies that an intermediary or agent who has determined that the resident owning the FIF interest has exceeded the $50,000 threshold for FIF interests and has applied for a refund of the amount withheld may also request the Commissioner to apply the refund against other tax types. 31 Background A submission was made on the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2008 that no tax credit is available for a New Zealand resident when an intermediary or agent for the resident: • received distributions from attributing interests in foreign investment funds owned by the New Zealand resident, and • withheld an amount on account of resident withholding tax in the belief the resident was covered by the $50,000 threshold rule in section CQ 5(1)(d) or (e); and • subsequently on-paid the dividend to the New Zealand resident. Under the 2007 Act, provided the New Zealand resident owning the FIF interests falls within the threshold of $50,000, the dividend received by the intermediary or agent on behalf of the New Zealand resident is resident passive income of the resident. In these circumstances, the intermediary or agent is normally required to account for resident withholding tax on the dividend. However, if the New Zealand resident exceeds the threshold of $50,000, the resident is no longer exempt from most FIF income calculation methods. Consequently, section CD 36 provides that all distributions paid during the income year from the resident’s attributing interests are not dividends for income tax purposes. Instead, the resident must determine their income from all of the person’s FIF interests using one of the FIF income calculation methods. There are likely to be a number of cases where the intermediary or agent will not necessarily be aware of the change in circumstances of the New Zealand resident at the time the withholding is made. In these circumstances, the intermediary or agent will normally withhold an amount on account of resident withholding tax from the actual dividend on-paid to the New Zealand resident. These amendments clarify that, in these circumstances, if an intermediary withholds an amount on account of RWT, the amount withheld is treated as RWT for the purposes of the tax credit rules and the RWT rules. This amendment applies retrospectively to the beginning of both the 2007 Act and the 2004 Act. In addition, section RM 8 of the 2007 Act is amended to address a potential unintended change in law from the 2004 Act. Section NF 7(5) was intended to permit an intermediary or agent who applied for a refund of an amount withheld on account of RWT to also request that the Commissioner apply the refund against other tax obligations of the payer. This amendment to section RM 8 applies from the date the 2007 Act came into force. 32 GIFTS OF MONEY MADE BY COMPANIES (Clause 72) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment restores the position under the Income Tax Act 2004 in relation to deductions for gifts of money made by companies. The amendment ensures that the removal of the 5 percent limit on deductions for charitable donations made by companies applies from the 2008–09 income year. Application date The amendment applies from 19 December 2007. 33 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL ISSUES Rewrite Advisory Panel recommendations Consequential to the rewrite of income tax legislation, the following remedial amendments are being made to correct identified unintended changes in law or to clarify the law arising from recommendations made by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. Capital gain amounts (Clauses 5 and 73) The amendment ensures that a capital gain amount can be passed through a corporate chain and distributed to shareholders of a company (who are not associated persons) as a capital gain amount on the liquidation of the company. This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year (2007 Act) and the 2005–06 income year (2004 Act). Dividend under the dividend stripping rules (Clause 53) The amendment clarifies that section GB 1 contains an intended change in law. This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year (2007 Act). However, a savings provision applies to certain taxpayers so they are not adversely affected for decisions made on the basis of the unclarified view. Branch equivalent income of a CFC carrying on the business of life insurance (Clauses 14 and 78) The amendment restores the 1994 Act position that the branch equivalent income for a CFC carrying on the business of life insurance is the part of the accounting profit or loss that is actuarially determined to relate to the shareholders of CFC. This amendment applies from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. Meaning of settlor (Clauses 19, 20 and 53) The amendment clarifies that the rewrite of the definition of “settlor” contains an intended legislative change. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. However, a savings provision applies to certain taxpayers and to some binding rulings to ensure taxpayers are not aversely affected for decisions made on the basis of the unclarified view. 34 Date of debit for loss of continuity – imputation rules (Clauses 41 and 53) The amendment clarifies that an intended legislative change has been made in the imputation rules, FDP rules and the branch equivalent tax account rules in relation to a loss of shareholding continuity. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. However, a savings provision in section OZ 18 applies to certain taxpayers to ensure they are not adversely affected for decisions made on the basis of the unclarified view. Natural resources and non-resident withholding tax (Clause 47) The amendment provides that the non-resident withholding tax rules do not apply to income in the nature of rents derived from land to which both section CC 1(2)(a) to (d) and section CC 9 applies. The amendment does not apply to consideration derived from the exploitation of (including the right to exploit), or the removal of (including the right to remove), any plants or naturally occurring materials or minerals from the land. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Nominal settlements (Clause 50) This amendment clarifies that a person making a nominal settlement is treated as a nominee of the person in relation to the nominal settlement. The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Other remedial measures arising from the rewrite of income tax legislation Election to use simplified method for determining a person’s income interest in a FIF (Clauses 15 and 79) The amendment restores the requirement that a person must have held their income interest in a FIF for at least 12 months before they may elect to apply the simplified method for determining their income interest in the FIF. The amendment is retrospective to the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. However, a savings provision applies to certain taxpayers to ensure they are not adversely affected for decisions made on the basis of the unclarified view. Family scheme income (Clause 38) This amendment ensures that the Family Scheme Income is correctly adjusted for depreciation recovery income relating to depreciation deductions allowed in the 2002–03 or earlier income years.
Student Loan Scheme (Exemptions and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Bill Commentary on the Bill Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in August 2009 by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Student Loan Scheme (Exemptions and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Bill; Commentary on the Bill. ISBN 978-0-478-27172-0 CONTENTS Overview 1 Policy changes 3 Interest-free loans for residents of Realm countries 5 Overseas study 6 Miscellaneous minor and technical amendments 7 Increased deduction rate 9 Interest-free loans for borrowers returning to New Zealand 10 Other technical amendments 11 1 OVERVIEW The main changes in the Student Loan Scheme (Exemptions and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Bill introduce amendments to extend interest-free loans to certain borrowers who are overseas. To encourage borrowers who want to live in and make a contribution to a Realm country – Niue, the Cook Islands, Tokelau or the Ross Dependency – borrowers who are present in one of these countries for 183 or more days will be entitled to an interest-free loan. Interest-free loans will also be available to students engaged in full-time study overseas under a formal exchange programme approved by the New Zealand Government or a formal agreement between a New Zealand education provider and an overseas tertiary education provider. The bill also makes eight minor or technical amendments to: • Allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to increase the standard rate for repayment deductions from salary and wages from 10 cents in the dollar to up to 15 cents for borrowers who have failed to have the correct deductions made or pay any other amount when it was due. The increased deductions will apply until any shortfall, including any late payment penalties, has been fully repaid. • Allow the loans of borrowers who return to New Zealand to be interest-free for the time they are back in New Zealand if they fully repay the loan before they have been back in New Zealand for 183 days. • Remove the current limitation on the prior tax years for which borrowers may seek relief on hardship grounds from payment of a repayment obligation. At present relief is limited to the year immediately preceding the current tax year. • Insert a formula to determine the student loan interest rate. • Increase the period in which a loan may be fully repaid without incurring any additional interest from 15 to 30 days. • Include world-wide income in an income-contingent assessment only for the period that a borrower is entitled to an interest-free loan. • Clarify that a borrower may only obtain the benefit of the volunteer exemption if the organisation for which the borrower is working was a “named” organisation at the time the borrower did that work. • Change the reference to the countries that volunteers must work in from the “United Nations” to the “Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development”. 2 3 Policy changes 4 5 INTEREST-FREE LOANS FOR RESIDENTS OF REALM COUNTRIES (Clauses 10(2) to (5), 13 and 25(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces an exemption for borrowers in Realm countries from the requirement that they be present in New Zealand to qualify for an interest-free loan. The change reflects the special relationship that Realm countries have with New Zealand and aims to encourage borrowers who want to remain in and make a contribution to these countries to do so. Application date The change will apply from 1 April 2009. Key features Section 38AE of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 is being amended to allow a further exemption to the requirement that borrowers reside in New Zealand to qualify for an interest-free loan. New section 38AIA sets out the conditions of the exemption. Borrowers will qualify for an interest-free loan if they are present in a Realm country – Niue, the Cook Islands, Tokelau or the Ross Dependency – for 183 or more days. The purpose of the amendment is to encourage those who want to live in and make a contribution to these countries to do so. Their student loans will be interest-free, as if they were still living and working in New Zealand. Borrowers will need to provide Inland Revenue with whatever information is needed to establish their annual income and presence in one or more of these countries, and to pay their annual liability as it falls due. Consequential change is being made to section 65A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. Background Interest-free loans were introduced from 1 April 2006 to encourage borrowers to remain in, or return to, New Zealand. Niue, the Cook Islands and Tokelau have a special relationship with New Zealand, which gives their residents an automatic right to reside and work here. Extending interest-free loans to borrowers residing in these countries recognises that special relationship. 6 OVERSEAS STUDY (Clauses 8, 9, 12, 14, 15 and 25) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces an extension of the interest-free loan entitlement to students engaged in full-time study overseas under a formal exchange programme approved by the New Zealand government, or a formal agreement between a New Zealand education provider and an overseas tertiary education provider. The change corrects an oversight in earlier legislation that disadvantaged certain borrowers studying overseas. Application date The change will apply from 1 April 2007. Key features Section 38AA of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 is being amended to allow a further exemption to the requirement that borrowers reside in New Zealand to qualify for an interest-free loan. New section 38AJA sets out the conditions of the exemption. Borrowers will qualify for the exemption if they are engaged in full-time study overseas under a formal study exchange programme approved by the New Zealand government, or a formal agreement between a New Zealand education provider and an overseas tertiary education. The New Zealand provider must certify that the student is enrolled in full-time study. Providers must also certify that if the studies are successful, they will be credited to a qualification offered by the New Zealand provider that is at level seven or above on the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications. Consequential change is being made to sections 38AC, 38AJ, 38AK and 65A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. Background Provisions in effect from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2007 entitled borrowers who were resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes to a full interest write-off if they were engaged in full-time, full-year study. Part-time or part-year students could also qualify if their income was below a certain level. The student's New Zealand tertiary education provider was required to confirm the level of study. As this had the same effect as allowing a loan to be interest-free, when the extension of the exemption to under- graduate study was made, it was considered that these provisions were redundant and they were repealed. There is therefore a gap in interest-free loans for some students who are or were studying overseas from 1 April 2007. 7 Miscellaneous minor and technical amendments 8 9 INCREASED DEDUCTION RATE (Clauses 6 and 7) Summary of proposed amendment Changes are being introduced that will allow the amount deducted from certain borrowers’ salary and wages to be increased from 10 cents in the dollar to up to 15 cents. The amendment is aimed at borrowers who have failed to have the correct deductions made or have any other overdue amount. Application date The change will apply from the day after enactment. Key features Under new section 20A Inland Revenue can instruct a borrower’s employer to make increased repayment deductions of up to 15 cents in the dollar for borrowers who have failed to have the correct deductions made in any tax year or have any other amount payable which has become overdue. The higher rate will apply until any shortfall, including any late payment penalties, has been fully repaid. The higher rate may be reduced if payment would cause serious financial hardship. Consequential change is being made to section 19 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. Background Borrowers whose primary income exceeds the repayment threshold are required to advise their employer that repayment deductions should be made. Many borrowers fail to fulfil this obligation, which may result in large end-of-year liabilities. Other borrowers may fail to pay a liability, such as their end-of-year payment, when it falls due. The bill allows Inland Revenue to recoup any shortfall by increased future deductions from any salary and wages earned by the borrower. 10 INTEREST-FREE LOANS FOR BORROWERS RETURNING TO NEW ZEALAND (Clause 16) Summary of proposed amendment Borrowers who return to New Zealand will be allowed an interest-free loan if they fully repay their loan before they have been back in New Zealand for 183 days. The amendment corrects a technical error relating to the requirement to be in New Zealand for 183 days to qualify for an interest-free loan. Application date The change will apply from 1 April 2006. Key features New section 38AM will allow borrowers who return to New Zealand, and fully repay their loan before they have been back for 183 days, to be granted an interest-free loan from the date they return until the date of repayment. Background Borrowers who return to New Zealand and fully repay their loan before they have been back for 183 days technically cease to be borrowers and therefore cannot be allowed an interest-free loan from the date they returned to New Zealand to the date they repaid their loans. The bill corrects this technicality. 11 OTHER TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS The bill also makes six minor technical amendments to clarify the policy intent of interest-free loans, and an amendment to correct an unintended change made to the hardship provisions. Hardship relief (Clauses 19, 20, 21 and 22) Sections 54, 55, 55A and 55B of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 are being amended to correct an unintended change made by the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2007. That change limits the years for which relief from payment of a borrower’s repayment obligations may be granted to the current tax year and the years either side. This amendment restores the position that previously applied and allows hardship relief to be granted in respect of any earlier year. However, any amount paid in respect of an earlier year before the immediately prior tax year may not be refunded. The change will apply from the day after enactment. Interest rate formula (Clauses 4, 26(1) to (2), 27 and 28) The student loan interest rate – which only affects overseas-based borrowers – is currently set using the formula in the Student Loan Scheme (Interest Rates Formulas) Regulations 2006. The formula is to be moved to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. This will streamline the annual setting of the interest rate. Paragraphs (ab) and (ac) of section 87(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, the Student Loan Scheme (Interest Rates Formulas) Regulations 2006 and the Student Loan Scheme (Total Interest Rate) Regulations 2009 are consequentially repealed. The changes will apply from 1 April 2010. Grace period (Clause 24) Student loan borrowers who are advised of the amount of their outstanding loan balance and fully repay that amount within 15 days of receiving the advice have any interest charged in the intervening period cancelled. As student loans are interest-free for New Zealand-based borrowers, this provision now only affects overseas-based borrowers. It may take more than 15 days for the statement to reach the borrower and the transfer of funds to reach New Zealand. Section 60A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 is therefore being amended to increase the period in which borrowers may fully repay their loan without incurring any further interest from 15 to 30 days. The change will apply from the day after enactment. 12 Part-year assessments (Clause 5) Section 14 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 is being amended to ensure that only income derived during the period in which there is an entitlement to an interest-free loan is included in establishing borrowers’ income-contingent liabilities. Borrowers’ repayment obligations are aligned to their entitlement to an interest-free loan. Those entitled to an interest-free loan are assessed on an income-contingent basis, and those not entitled are assessed on the basis of the amount of their loan (subject to entitlement to the three-year repayment holiday available to overseas-based borrowers). Some borrowers may retain their residency for income tax purposes, which means that they must include their world-wide income in their tax return, but they will lose their entitlement to an interest-free loan during the year because they are out of New Zealand for 184 or more days. This amendment aligns the assessment basis with the period of entitlement to an interest-free loan. The change will apply from the day after enactment. Volunteer exemption – conditions (Clause 11) Section 38AEA of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 is being amended to change the reference to countries which the United Nations recognises as a developing country to countries that are listed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as receiving official development assistance. Borrowers who work overseas as volunteers, or for a token payment, for a charitable organisation that has been “named” by regulations may be granted an exemption to the requirement that they be present in New Zealand for 183 or more days to qualify for an interest-free loan. Changes that came into effect on 1 April 2007 require borrowers to be engaged in certain activities, two of which refer to work undertaken in countries which the United Nations recognises as a developing country. As the UN does not, in fact, do that, the requirement is being changed to countries that are listed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as receiving official development assistance. The change will apply from 1 April 2007. Volunteer exemption – clarification (Clause 10(1)) Section 38AE(1)(b) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 is being amended to clarify that a borrower may only obtain the benefit of the volunteer exemption if the organisation for which the borrower is working was a “named” organisation at the time the borrower did that work. The change will apply from the day after enactment.
GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets A government discussion document Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in November 2009 by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140.

This reduces the extent to which GST alters consumption and production decisions in New Zealand, thereby creating economic efficiency and reducing compliance and administrative costs. 1.2 Because GST is designed to tax consumption rather than production, one of the basic principles of the tax is that businesses should not be subject to GST when producing goods and services. 1 This is achieved through the credit-invoice mechanism, which ensures that the economic incidence of the tax is removed on most business purchases. The mechanism also prevents the tax from “cascading” as goods and services are supplied between businesses that are registered for GST. 1.3 Transactions between businesses should, therefore, be GST-neutral unless exemptions apply (for example, the supply of financial services in some cases). The terms “GST-neutral” and “business-to-business neutrality”, for the purposes of this document reflect the fact that GST paid by a business can be claimed against the GST payable on taxable supplies. A business is “neutral” about the purchase of goods and services if the GST it pays does not become a permanent business cost. Business neutrality is also an appropriate concept to apply to the revenue received by the government in the sense that input tax should generally be matched with a corresponding payment of output tax. 1.4 The goal of business-to-business neutrality has not, however, always been achieved. This is of most concern to both businesses and the government in transactions involving the supply of significant assets, such as land. For businesses, an example would be a transaction not qualifying under the legislation for zero-rating as a “going concern” or an invoicing error that results in a purchaser’s expected input tax entitlement (sometimes referred to as a GST “refund” or GST “credit”) being denied. Because the assets are significant, they are infrequently traded and can create GST consequences that businesses may not have expected or planned for. 1.5 For the government, because Inland Revenue regularly refunds GST-registered persons for excess input tax deductions, a substantial risk to the tax base can be created through the actions of a small minority of taxpayers. The risk arises from this group entering into tax-aggressive structures that involve no corresponding GST payments to Inland Revenue. By taking advantage of the GST system in this manner these taxpayers redirect revenue that could be used by government for public benefit to their personal benefit. 1 An obvious exception applies to purchases acquired for the purpose of making exempt supplies, such as financial services. 2 1.6 In considering these concerns, this document focuses predominantly on transactions involving land. It also considers a number of other issues aimed at clarifying and providing greater consistency for these transactions. Purpose of this discussion document 1.7 In June 2008, officials released an issues paper, Options for strengthening GST neutrality in business-to-business transactions, which suggested a number of options to help resolve GST neutrality concerns and improve the operation of GST in general. This discussion document draws upon the analysis in the issues paper and in the submissions that followed. 1.8 The officials’ paper discussed a number of options that the government will not be proceeding with. These include the proposals to widen Inland Revenue’s set-off powers, give Inland Revenue power to impose caveats on land, limit access to the invoice basis of accounting, extend the current treatment of associated persons for the purposes of second-hand goods deductions and place a cap on registering accommodation-based activities. While these options may have addressed the tax base risks, they have been rejected as being either too broadly targeted or because of their potential negative effect on normal business operations. 1.9 This discussion document proposes changes in the following areas: • the application of domestic reverse charges; • the application of section 19D of the GST Act; • timeframes for releasing refunds; • transactions involving nominations; • sale of property in satisfaction of debt; • input tax entitlements and adjustments for change-in-use; and • supplies of accommodation. 1.10 Because of the detailed nature of some matters covered in this discussion document, the government is interested in opinions on how these proposals could be presented in legislation. The Appendix to this discussion document contains indicative legislation for the more significant changes proposed. 3 Summary of proposals Domestic reverse charge Introducing a domestic reverse charge to transactions involving land, “going concerns” and assets with a value of $50 million or more. Strengthening the application of section 19D of the GST Act Amending section 19D by applying it to the timing of input tax deductions rather than payments. Timing of refunds Amending the legislation to specify that the 15 working-day rule refers to the issue of the notice by Inland Revenue rather than receipt by the taxpayer. Transactions involving nominations Clarifying the effect of nominations on taxpayers’ entitlement to input tax deductions. Sales in satisfaction of debt Extending the rules governing sales in satisfaction of debt to transactions that are “in substance” sales in satisfaction of debt. Input tax and adjustments for change-in-use Replacing the existing change-in-use adjustment rules with an approach that apportions input tax deductions according to the relative use of the goods and services. Accommodation Amending the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” to clarify the boundaries of those definitions.

Some submissions suggested that zero- rating should be considered as an alternative option to the DRC, arguing that zero-rating is more consistent with the current GST framework. This chapter analyses these two options and proposes introducing a DRC which would apply to land, going concerns and transactions with a GST-exclusive value exceeding $50 million. Current problems 2.4 The government is concerned that, in business-to-business transactions, GST neutrality for businesses and the government is not always occurring as it should. This is of particular concern in transactions involving land and high- value assets. For example: • Businesses can and do incur costs if GST has to be accounted for before payment is received from the customer. This can occur, for example, where the transaction occurs towards the end of the vendor’s return period. • Providing GST refunds can pose a risk to the government’s revenue base if the refund does not give rise to a payment of GST by the other party involved in the transaction. Of particular concern are phoenix-type fraud and deliberate accounting base mismatches. 6 • Zero-rating the supply of going concerns can lead to an expectation by the parties to the transaction that no further GST is payable on the transaction. This expectation can be unfounded if the facts do not support that the supply was a “going concern”. • Because the rules that apply to the supply of a going concern are in effect not mandatory, it is possible for a financially stricken supplier to sell its business as a standard-rated supply. This creates a revenue loss for the government if the GST is unpaid by the supplier but an input tax deduction is claimed by the recipient. 2.5 In situations involving a risk to the tax base, use of the general anti-avoidance provision or, in the case of fraud, prosecution action, may be available. Using litigation to resolve matters of avoidance is, however, expensive in terms of taxpayer, Inland Revenue and the courts’ resources and the outcome may not necessarily be consistent with good policy. Even if the outcome of litigation provides useful interpretive guidance and a level of certainty, it is often not timely. 2.6 The government therefore considers that additional legislation is needed to address the concerns outlined. Objectives of the domestic reverse charge 2.7 The government’s preferred option is the introduction of a DRC to apply to land and other high-value transactions between GST-registered persons. The main feature of the DRC would be to require the recipient of goods and services to self-assess GST on goods and services acquired from another registered person, and allow the recipient to deduct input tax if entitled to do so, in the same taxable period. 2.8 The specific objectives of the DRC would be to: • Remove the cashflow concerns for the parties to an affected transaction for the period between which the tax is paid and the input tax deduction is allowed. (This is because the recipient would be able to offset the GST payable and the input tax deduction in the same taxable period.) • Reduce the risk that the supplier faces an unexpected GST liability in the event that a transaction is incorrectly zero-rated, as could occur if a registered person sells a zero-rated going concern to an unregistered person that they believed was registered. • Limit the involvement of the supplier if the contract is varied, cancelled or otherwise does not proceed. • Reduce the revenue risk to the government arising from a genuine or structured business failure. (The recipient, having acquired the goods and services in all likelihood for an ongoing taxable activity, would be less likely than the supplier to exit the GST system.) 7 Application of the domestic reverse charge 2.9 The proposed DRC would apply to transactions between registered persons involving the supply of land, going concerns, and goods and services with a value of $50 million or more. 2.10 As outlined earlier, the recipient of a supply of goods and services, being a registered person, would be required to self-assess and return GST in the taxable period in which the supply was made. An input tax deduction would be available to the recipient in the same taxable period if the goods and services were acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 2.11 The DRC would apply irrespective of whether either GST-registered person made predominantly exempt supplies. The change-in-use adjustment rules or the apportionment rules (in the form proposed in chapter 7) would need to be applied if the goods and services were used for a mixture of making taxable and non-taxable supplies. Supplies to unregistered persons would continue to be subject to normal GST rules. 2.12 The supplier would not be liable for GST normally charged on the goods and services in question. However, the supplier would still be treated as making a “taxable supply” of goods and services to preserve existing input tax entitlements. Transactions to which the DRC applies would need to be expressed as “exclusive of GST”. 2.13 It is envisaged that the agreement for sale and purchase of property would be the main document to support suppliers’ and recipients’ obligations under the DRC. The agreement will be required to contain the core details about the supplier and the recipient, including their respective GST registration numbers, their respective names and addresses, and details about the transaction, including its value (excluding GST). 2.14 Inland Revenue would not have recourse to the supplier in the event that the recipient does not account for GST, provided the supplier has complied with and retained the prescribed information as outlined above. Scope 2.15 The DRC would apply to the identified group of transactions in the following way: • Land: The DRC would apply to all transactions involving the supply of land, including a freehold interest or an option to acquire land. In situations when land is supplied along with other goods and services such as livestock, and the transaction is not a going concern, a further rule may be needed. Separately identifying each asset supplied under the contract would create additional transaction costs and complexity, unless the supplier and recipient had entered into separate contracts for the separate assets. It is therefore proposed that, in circumstances when a bundle of goods and services is supplied and land and buildings are the predominant feature of the supply, the DRC will apply to the entire contract. 8 • Going concerns: The DRC would apply to the supply of a taxable activity or part thereof that is a “going concern”. The current zero-rating rules applicable to the supply of going concerns would be repealed. While the question of what constitutes a “going concern” would remain open to interpretation in some cases, the requirement that the taxable activity must be carried on until the time of transfer to the recipient, and the inherent difficulties that this sometimes causes, would be removed. (Australia is considering the introduction in 2010 of a domestic reverse charge which would similarly replace its going concern rules. 2 ) • Other high-value assets: the DRC would apply to supplies of goods and services with a value of $50 million or more, excluding GST. This limits the extension of the DRC in other cases to infrequently occurring transactions that could, if the GST treatment is not neutral, create significant tax risks for businesses and a revenue loss to the government. Time of supply 2.16 The current “time of supply” rules largely relate to activities carried on by the supplier – for example, when the supplier issues an invoice or when payment is received for the supply of goods and services. The current rules may not provide a recipient to whom the proposed DRC applied with enough certainty on when to self-assess and return GST. For example, the supplier might create an obligation to return GST without the recipient’s knowledge. If this resulted in GST not being returned in the correct taxable period, the recipient could be subject to shortfall penalties and use-of-money interest. 2.17 To prevent this from happening, it is proposed that, when the DRC applies, the time of supply would be the date when payment for the supply is required to be made to the supplier. The time of supply would be triggered when the supplier requires full payment to settle the contract, not payment by a deposit. 2.18 “Payment” will not be limited to the transfer of cash and will include other situations when contractual obligations are discharged, such as with a vendor mortgage. It may be that separate rules will need to apply to transactions between associated persons, where the parties have the ability to delay “payment”, however this is defined. Any separate rule would only need to apply in circumstances when the output tax from the transaction exceeds the input tax able to be claimed by the recipient (for example, when the registered recipient purchases the goods or services for the purpose of making exempt supplies). 2 See Australian Government Response to Board of Taxation Review of GST Administration, 12 May 2009. 9 When the contract provides for more than one recipient 2.19 Nominee transactions and other transactions involving more than two parties will give rise to the question of which party must apply the DRC. It is proposed that, for the purpose of the DRC, the liability for GST would be on the party named in the contract as being the recipient of the goods or services. If the contract provides for two or more recipients, the DRC obligation would fall on the recipient that physically receives the goods and services or has ownership or entitlement to them. Recipient deemed to be registered 2.20 The registration rules will also be amended to treat any recipient that purports to be registered for GST as registered on the day the supply is treated as made under the DRC. While the recipient will still have an obligation to self-assess and return GST, no input tax deduction will be allowed if they are unable to establish a taxable activity and that the purchase was used for making taxable supplies. Recipients that do not return the GST may be subject to use-of- money interest and shortfall penalties in these circumstances. The need for additional anti-avoidance provisions will be further considered. Post-sale adjustments 2.21 Subsequent changes to a supply that is subject to the DRC will not alter its operation. In all cases when there is an adjustment to the price of the goods and services supplied, the supplier would remain responsible for issuing a debit or credit note. The recipient will be required to reflect the GST consequences of the change in the taxable period in which the debit or credit note is received. 2.22 For example, if intellectual property is sold for an agreed price of $58 million and it is later agreed that the price should be adjusted down to $42 million, the transaction would remain subject to the DRC. The supplier would provide a credit note to reflect the $16 million adjustment to value and the recipient would reflect the GST effects of the adjustment in the taxable period in which the credit note is received. 2.23 If the reverse situation occurs – for example, the initial price for intellectual property, such as a trademark, is $48 million but is later adjusted upwards to $53 million – the DRC rules would not retroactively apply to the transaction. 2.24 Another situation involving adjustment is when views about the nature of the supply change. For example, assets supplied as a going concern would be taxed under the DRC. If it is later determined that the supply is not of a going concern, the GST treatment of the transaction would not need to be retroactively altered. 2.25 There may be other situations when the DRC should have applied but was not considered at the time the contract was entered into. An amendment to section 78E is proposed that would address these situations. 10 Exceptions Progressively supplied goods and services 2.26 An exception to the compulsory application of the DRC would apply when the contract provides for successive payments over a number of taxable periods. There are two reasons for excluding periodic payments from the scope of the DRC: • GST-registered persons whose businesses do not principally involve making taxable supplies could face large GST liabilities without the ability to fully offset the payment with a matching input tax deduction. This is because the DRC will require the payment of GST at an earlier time than would occur under the current rules. The periodic consumption of the relevant goods and services as contemplated by the contract would not be properly recognised by the GST Act in this case. • In situations when the contract makes provision for periodic payments, the revenue risk is perceived by the government to be lower. It is less likely that the transaction would be one-sided as there is an intention between the supplier and the recipient to maintain an on-going relationship over the contract period. 2.27 Changes are therefore proposed that would switch off the DRC and allow goods and services to be treated as progressively and periodically supplied when the contract provides that payment is to be in instalments. Supplies covered by the exception would continue to be taxed under the ordinary GST rules. The exception will not apply to progressive supplies between associated persons which are the subject of a separate “time of supply” rule. The DRC and sales in satisfaction of debt 2.28 The DRC would not apply to taxable supplies made when goods are sold in satisfaction of a debt under section 5(2). 2.29 The rules dealing with sales in satisfaction of debt shift the obligation to account for GST on a mortgagee sale from the mortgagor to the mortgagee. The rules ensure that goods owned by registered persons cannot exit the GST base without GST being accounted for. 2.30 The rules apply independently from the rest of the GST Act. Persons selling goods to repay a debt are required to complete a special GST return. These sales are unable to be zero-rated as “going concerns”. 2.31 The government considers that sellers of goods to which section 5(2) of the GST Act applies should not be able to use the DRC because it would confuse the differing purposes of the two sets of rules. The DRC requires that both the supplier and the recipient are registered for GST and is therefore limited to business-to-business transactions. On the other hand, section 5(2) is concerned with whether a supply of the goods would be a taxable supply if sold by the borrower. The rules do not require the seller to be registered for GST. 11 Alternative option: zero-rating 2.32 The government has also considered an alternative option, recommended in some submissions, to zero-rate certain supplies instead of proceeding with the DRC. 2.33 Currently, supplies of going concerns between registered businesses are zero- rated in order to meet similar objectives to those outlined earlier in this chapter, including: • eliminating the cashflow cost to purchasers when financing the GST for the period between making payment and receipt of the GST refund; and • reducing the risk of fraud if a vendor charges GST on the sale of a business but retains the GST component. 2.34 Submissions argued that zero-rating business-to-business supplies is a preferable option for a number of reasons, including: • it is widely understood by GST-registered persons; • it effectively results in a zero-liability for GST and preserves the supplier’s right to deduct input tax; and • it is consistent with the general operation of GST and would require less legislative change. How would zero-rating work? 2.35 If zero-rating were to apply to the supplies of goods and services proposed for inclusion in the DRC, suppliers would need to confirm (and hold evidence) that the recipient of the goods and services is registered for GST. Beyond that, no additional compliance obligations would arise. Like the DRC, zero-rating creates a GST-neutral position between the supplier and the recipient. Arguments for not zero-rating 2.36 Zero-rating has the effect of deferring the immediate collection of GST on a supply of goods and services. This deferral could be a problem for Inland Revenue if there are a significant number of instances when, at a later point, it turns out that the supply should not have been zero-rated. For example, the goods and services may have been provided to a final consumer, but the supplier has since deregistered or no longer exists. Seeking payment of GST from the recipient, as proposed under the DRC could, on the other hand, address this concern. 2.37 In other situations, the supplier may agree to a GST-inclusive price for a supply of goods and services on the understanding that the supply is zero-rated. In these situations, Inland Revenue may become involved in a dispute with either or both parties if the correct treatment becomes unclear and the recipient has claimed an input tax deduction but the supplier has not paid GST because of the earlier understanding. 12 2.38 For these reasons, the government considers that business-to-business neutrality is best achieved using rules that shift the obligation to charge and return GST onto the recipient. 13 CHAPTER 3 Preventing timing mismatches – strengthening the application of section 19D Proposed change Section 19D requires invoice-basis accounting for certain transactions. The proposal is that this would be changed so that input tax deductions from these transactions would only be able to be claimed at the time when payment is made by the recipient. 3.1 Because of differences in the accounting practices of different businesses, the GST Act allows differing accounting bases and filing frequencies. Since parties to a transaction may not be using the same accounting basis, a GST- registered person accounting for GST using the payments basis may make a supply to a GST-registered person who accounts for GST using the invoice basis. In these situations, the payments-basis supplier must account for GST only when payment is received, while the purchaser may claim an input tax deduction following receipt of the tax invoice. These differences in accounting basis may be deliberately used in a small number of cases to obtain a tax benefit by deferring the payment of output tax for a significant period of time or even indefinitely. 3.2 The aim of section 19D is to limit the taxpayer’s choice of accounting basis when the application of the GST accounting principles could give rise to such tax-base risks. Specifically, section 19D requires GST-registered persons accounting for GST using the payments basis to use the invoice basis when high-value transactions are involved. These are prescribed as being when the consideration payable for a supply of goods and services is $225,000 or more (including GST) and payment by the customer is deferred under the agreement for more than one year. 3.3 The government proposes better targeting section 19D by having it apply to the recognition of input tax deductions instead of the recognition of output tax. Under the proposal, input tax deductions would be limited to one-ninth of the payments made by the recipient. Section 19D will still apply to transactions that exceed $225,000 and will continue to be limited to situations when the contract defers payment for more than one year. 3.4 The amended provision would not require recipients to change their current accounting basis but, as with the current provision, would simply alter the basis on which recipients may claim input tax in relation to a supply that is subject to the provision. Section 19D would not apply in the event that the supply was subject to the domestic reverse charge. 14 Example Sharon agrees to sell machinery to Bruce for $300,000. Under the contract, Bruce must pay a $30,000 deposit on signing the contract and will pay the balance on settlement in 14 months. Bruce accounts for GST on the invoice basis. In the taxable period when the contract is signed, Bruce can claim an input tax deduction of one- ninth of the deposit ($3,333). He will be able to claim the rest of the input tax deduction when he makes the subsequent payment of the purchase price on settlement. 15 CHAPTER 4 Timing of refunds Proposed change It is proposed that Inland Revenue would have 15 working days to issue a notice of any investigation to a GST-registered person. This changes the current position which requires the notice to be delivered to the registered person within 15 days. 4.1 An important feature of the way GST applies to business-to-business transactions is the purchaser’s ability to obtain refunds when input tax deductions exceed the output tax charged in a given taxable period. 4.2 When the calculation of tax payable results in a refund of GST – that is, when input tax deductions exceed output tax – Inland Revenue is required to pay that refund within 15 working days from the day following Inland Revenue’s receipt of the relevant return. 3 The GST-registered person must be notified within 15 working days if Inland Revenue intends to investigate the return and withhold payment. Subject to the four-year time bar, Inland Revenue is not precluded from investigating a return after the 15-working day period. 4.3 Following the Seahunter cases, notice must be received by the GST-registered person within 15 working days. 4 A timeframe based on receipt by the taxpayer rather than notification by Inland Revenue may in certain cases give Inland Revenue insufficient time to respond to transactions that could affect the integrity of the tax base. The officials’ paper suggested extending the period of giving notices of the investigation and the withholding of payment to 20 working days. 4.4 Having reviewed the issue in the light of submissions, and given the cashflow difficulties which the government recognises many businesses are currently facing, the option to increase the notice period to 20 working days will no longer be pursued. Instead, it is proposed to amend the legislation to specify that the 15 working days rule will be satisfied if Inland Revenue issues a notice of any investigation to a registered person within 15 days of receipt of the return, irrespective of whether the notice has been received by the person within that period. This would bring the legislation in line with practice as it was intended and understood before the Seahunter cases. 3 It is at the Commissioner’s discretion whether refunds may be used to offset other tax debts. 4 See Seahunter Fishing Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2001) 20 NZTC 17,206 and Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Seahunter Fishing Limited (2002) 20 NZTC 17,478. 16 4.5 The proposed amendment would allow Inland Revenue more time to analyse borderline applications, thus improving the protection of the GST base. Since the vast majority of refund applications do not give Inland Revenue cause for concern, they should not be affected by this change and Inland Revenue will continue to consider ways in which refunds can for the most part be expedited. 17 CHAPTER 5 Transactions involving nominations Proposed change This chapter discusses proposed new rules for nominee transactions that would look at the economic substance rather than the form of the transactions. 5.1 The question of the imposition of GST on transactions involving nominations has been subject to uncertainty for some time. Depending on the interpretation adopted, a standard transaction involving a nominee may involve either one or two supplies for GST purposes. 5.2 Submissions on the officials’ paper indicated different views about the approach that should be adopted. Given the uncertainty expressed, the government believes legislative clarification of the issue is warranted. 5.3 Proposals in chapter 2 on the introduction of a domestic reverse charge (DRC) would affect how tax is to be paid and deductions claimed. To ensure that the DRC rules operate as intended, separate rules are proposed for nominee transactions affected by the DRC. The proposals in this chapter would only apply in situations when the DRC rules did not apply. They are predominantly concerned with input tax entitlement. Nominee transactions when the domestic reverse charge does not apply 5.4 The term “nominee transaction” is used to describe the situation where a vendor agrees to sell property to a purchaser and the title to the property is transferred not to the purchaser but to a third party nominated by the purchaser. The nominee does not in this situation pay a fee to the purchaser for the right to be nominated. 5.5 The GST consequences of a nominee transaction depend on the form which the nomination takes. In “bare” nominations, the purchaser settles the transaction and, therefore, there is only one transaction for GST purposes – between the vendor and the purchaser. In other situations, the nominee may settle the transaction by paying the purchase price to the vendor. In this case, it is arguable that there are two transactions for GST purposes – between the vendor and the purchaser, and between the purchaser and the nominee. 5.6 The latter type of transaction can result in GST being charged twice, giving rise to corresponding input tax deductions in most cases, for what is essentially a direct transfer of property from the vendor to the nominee. 18 The proposal 5.7 For transactions involving nominations, the GST treatment should be determined on the basis of the economic substance of the transaction. Under the proposed changes, one payment of GST would be made and input tax deductions that might arise would be limited to the entity that economically acquires the supply as outlined below. “Bare” nominations 5.8 In a transaction involving a “bare” nomination, the transaction is settled by the purchaser. Therefore, there will be only one supply which will be to the purchaser. The purchaser will be the only party entitled to an input tax deduction. Nominee pays the purchase price and settles the transaction 5.9 In transactions where the nominee settles the transaction by paying the purchase price, the proposed legislative change would consider a single transaction to take place between the vendor and the nominee. This would involve a single payment of output tax by the vendor with the nominee entitled to claim any input tax deduction. The contractual purchaser would essentially be treated as acting as an agent for the nominee and “ignored” for GST purposes. Nominee settles the transaction, but the purchaser pays the deposit or contributes to the purchase price 5.10 In some transactions, a purchaser may pay a deposit, but not the balance of the payment, to the vendor. This may arise, for example, when the purchaser has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with the vendor and the identity of the nominee is not yet known. 5.11 Alternatively, the purchaser may contribute to the purchase price on settlement. 5.12 In these circumstances, it is proposed to again treat the transaction as involving a single supply between the vendor and the purchaser, with the purchaser being entitled to the input tax deduction. However, the purchaser and the nominee would be able to override this default rule by explicitly agreeing that the supply of the property be treated as a supply by the vendor to the nominee. This would allow the nominee to claim any input tax deduction. Tax invoice requirements 5.13 In normal circumstances, a taxpayer must have a tax invoice in order to claim an input tax deduction. In transactions involving nominations, a nominee may not have the tax invoice as it may have been issued to the purchaser. Under the proposed changes, the absence of a tax invoice should not prevent the nominee from being able to claim a deduction as long as there is sufficient other documentation to establish the nominee’s claim, based on the agreement between the purchaser and the nominee. 19 CHAPTER 6 Sales in satisfaction of debt under section 5(2) Proposed change The existing rules in section 5(2) governing sales in satisfaction of debt would be supplemented to ensure that they apply to transactions that purport to be outside the scope of the section but that are, in substance, sales in satisfaction of debt. 6.1 Under normal commercial practice, when a borrower (usually a mortgagor) is in financial difficulty and unable to make repayments on a loan, the lender, usually a mortgagee, may use its statutory or legal powers to take possession of the mortgagor’s property and sell it to recover the debt. If the property has been used in a taxable activity, section 5(2) of the GST Act regards this as a sale in satisfaction of debt and the mortgagee is required to furnish a special return to account directly to Inland Revenue for the output tax on the property. GST does not apply if the mortgagee sale is of the mortgagor’s private dwelling. 6.2 Sales in satisfaction of debt are usually easy to identify because of the legal process the mortgagee must follow to force the sale of the mortgagor’s property. Recently, however, there has been an increase in sales in satisfaction of debt that are being presented as “ordinary” sales by mortgagors in the course of their taxable activities. The sale may be organised by the mortgagee by, for example, engaging the estate agent, paying the auctioneer’s fees or signing the sale and purchase agreement. Once sold, the mortgagee may receive the sale proceeds directly and use them to pay off as much of the debt owed to it as possible. 6.3 Unlike a normal sale in satisfaction of debt, under these arrangements, which are sometimes described as “de facto mortgagee sales”, the mortgagee never officially takes possession of the property. As a result, it can be argued that section 5(2) does not apply and that the GST component of the property sale must be returned by the mortgagor, who is usually unable to pay. 6.4 The rules for sales in satisfaction of debt are intended to ensure that the liability to account for GST rests on a person who is likely to be solvent rather than a person who might be insolvent. In doing so, the government does not seek to assert a priority in the distribution of the assets of the mortgagor as Inland Revenue’s claim under section 5(2) lies directly against the mortgagee rather than against the proceeds of sale. 20 6.5 The government recognises that there have been increased sales in satisfaction of debt because of the difficult economic times. However, differential tax treatment based on whether there is an open or a covert sale by a mortgagee is distortionary and inconsistent with the policy intent of section 5(2). 6.6 Although Inland Revenue may use a number of measures, such as anti- avoidance provisions in the event of a de facto sale, these remedies are an inadequate long-term solution as they are only available when Inland Revenue becomes aware of the sale. Even then, these approaches may have an uncertain outcome. A legislative solution is proposed to ensure that all sales in satisfaction of debt are taxed in the same manner. The proposal 6.7 It is proposed to supplement the current rules on sales in satisfaction of debt by treating a sale as covered by section 5(2) if certain additional criteria apply. The aim of the criteria is to identify whether a mortgagee initiated and/or controlled the sale. 6.8 The indicators would include one or more of the following: • a mortgagee taking control of, or inducing the sale of, the property by exercising a power under a contract with a mortgagor; • a mortgagee signing the sale and purchase agreement, or requesting the mortgagor to sign the sale and purchase agreement as already negotiated by the mortgagee; • a mortgagee organising services related to selling the property, such as building, conveyancing, auctioning or advertising services; • a mortgagee paying directly for the services related to selling the property; • a mortgagor’s solicitor also being the mortgagee’s solicitor; • a purchaser being associated with the mortgagee. 6.9 A sale would be considered to be a mortgagor sale rather than a mortgagee sale only if it was initiated and controlled by the mortgagor, with no undue encouragement by the mortgagee. If any of the above indicators were present in the transaction, the sale would in the first instance be treated as a sale in satisfaction of debt under section 5(2) and the mortgagee would be required to account for the GST. The Commissioner would, however, have the discretion to review individual cases and determine that, notwithstanding the criteria, a sale should not be treated as a mortgagee sale if it was more in the nature of a genuine mortgagor sale. 6.10 The proposal to introduce a domestic reverse charge affects how tax is to be paid and deductions claimed for certain goods sold in the normal course of business. As noted in chapter 2, the DRC would not apply to transactions to which section 5(2) applies. 21 CHAPTER 7 Input tax and adjustments for change-in-use Proposed change The existing change-in-use adjustment approach would be replaced by an approach that would apportion input tax deductions in line with the actual use of goods and services. It is proposed that: • On acquisition, unless an exclusion applies, the portion of a deduction that a GST- registered person can claim must correspond with the portion of the asset that is intended to be used for taxable purposes. • In subsequent years, the person may be required to adjust the deduction claimed if the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. • A maximum number of adjustments that a person may be required to make will apply for all goods and services other than land and will vary according to the asset’s value or estimated useful life of the asset. • A special rule will apply to the sale of goods and services for which full deductions have not been claimed. 7.1 New Zealand’s current approach to accounting for the taxable and non-taxable use of assets on which GST is paid has been described by commentators and some submissions on the officials’ issues paper as being complex and confusing. Other issues concerning the approach have been raised by the Court of Appeal decision in the Lundy 5 case, which involved land being used concurrently for taxable and non-taxable purposes. The concepts behind imposing GST on mixed use and change-in-use assets may not be sufficiently transparent for many taxpayers, and the fact that adjustments may be required for an indefinite period may result in tax and compliance costs. 7.2 Currently, GST-registered persons may claim a full input tax deduction for GST paid on goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Any non-taxable use of those goods and services that takes place is treated as a taxable supply by the registered person, and output tax is charged accordingly. In this way, goods and services that are, in effect, self- supplied are treated in the same manner as other supplies. 7.3 Conversely, GST-registered persons cannot claim a deduction if goods and services were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. If the goods or services are used for a taxable purpose, the goods and services are deemed to be supplied to the person to the extent of that use, and input tax is deductible accordingly. 5 (2005) 22 NZTC 19, 637. 22 7.4 The approach in an apportionment system, on the other hand, seeks to apportion the initial input tax deduction received by GST-registered persons in relation to goods and services according to their actual use. This is a commonly used approach in other countries, including Australia. The aim of apportionment rules is not to charge GST on any non-taxable use of goods and services, but simply to provide a mechanism to ensure that the deduction claimed by a taxpayer corresponds with the actual taxable use of the goods and services. 7.5 The officials’ paper did not recommend introducing an apportionment approach to New Zealand because of: • the need to accurately ascertain a taxable use on acquisition; • the possibility that the adjustment calculations may be too complicated; and • the need to keep continuous records of change-in-use. 7.6 Instead, the paper suggested a modified change-in-use adjustments approach. 7.7 The majority of submissions on the officials’ paper considered that the changes suggested in the paper would not simplify the change-in-use adjustment rules, but in fact would complicate them further. Many submissions advocated rules similar to the apportionment rules used in Australia, the perception being that the Australian approach is simpler. Submissions commented that calculations using this approach would be no more complicated that those under the current system. 7.8 The apportionment approach may be conceptually simpler than the current adjustment approach as it uses a single valuation measure when making any adjustment. The underlying concept used in the apportionment approach – that a person should be able to claim only as much input tax as reflects relative use – is easy to understand. If the number of adjustments that a taxpayer would have to make is limited, some of the concerns outlined in the officials’ paper would be removed. 7.9 On the basis of the feedback, the government proposes replacing the change-in- use adjustment rules with the cost-based apportionment approach. 7.10 The wholesale shift to an apportionment approach will provide transparency in the objective of making adjustments by putting taxpayers in the position they would be in if they could correctly predict the actual taxable use of their assets at the outset. 7.11 The rest of this chapter discusses the shape that the apportionment rules would take. It is envisaged that, if they are introduced, the rules would apply to assets acquired after the date of enactment. 7.12 This chapter does not explicitly outline the effect of the changes on the application of the reverse charge for imported services but submissions on this are welcome. 23 The apportionment of input tax deductions on acquisition 7.13 Under the proposed apportionment approach, the portion of a deduction that a person should be entitled to must correspond with the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes. 7.14 Taxpayers must estimate the extent of the intended taxable use of an asset at the time of claiming an input tax deduction and claim the deduction only to that extent. If the estimate subsequently proves to be correct and the person on an ongoing basis indeed uses the asset for the taxable purpose to the extent stipulated, the person will not be required to make any further adjustments. 7.15 The proposed rules seek to achieve as much “first instance” accuracy as possible by requiring recipients to make fair and reasonable estimates on the intended taxable and non-taxable uses of acquired goods and services. The estimates could be made on the basis of any records that are available, previous experience, business plans or other suitable methods. The exact method of working out the extent of an intended taxable use of goods and services will largely depend on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, if an acquired asset is a car which is intended to replace an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of stipulating the intended use of the purchased car. Example 1 John purchases a car. The total amount of GST paid on the car is $1,000. John intends to use it partly for business and partly for private purposes. Logbooks kept by John in relation to his use of his previous car indicate that the car was used 60% for his business and 40% for his private purposes. As a result, John can estimate that he will use the new car 60% for taxable purposes and claim 60% of the input tax deduction – $600. 7.16 The situation may arise when different parts of a supply have different uses. For example, a person may buy property consisting of land and a few buildings with GST having been charged by the vendor on the whole supply. Although most of the purchased assets are to be used for the taxable purpose of running a farm, one of the buildings may be intended to be used exclusively as residential accommodation, which is a non-taxable purpose. Under the proposed changes the purchaser will be required to apportion the GST deduction on the acquisition by reference to the intended taxable use of the purchased supply. They would need to ensure that they do not claim the part of the deduction that relates to the building that is intended to be used as private accommodation. This would be done by comparing the value of the building with the total value of the purchased supply. 24 7.17 By requiring a registered person to make an apportionment in this manner on acquisition, the proposed rules would affect situations similar to those considered by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Coveney, 6 which are currently dealt with under the GST Act by treating a dwelling as a separate supply. Example 2 A person purchases land and buildings for $1 million exclusive of GST to be used as a farm. The person intends to use one of the buildings as private accommodation. The value of the building on acquisition is $100,000. Therefore, the person may claim only 90% of the GST paid on acquisition ($112,500). Example 3 A bank purchases a new office building for $5 million including GST of $555,556. The bank estimates that 30% of supplies made by the bank are taxable supplies. The bank claims 30% of the available input tax deduction ($166,667). When apportionment of input tax on acquisition not required 7.18 In keeping with the existing rules, it is proposed that a GST-registered person will not be required to apportion input tax if, on the date of acquisition, the registered person has reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of all exempt supplies the person will make in the 12 months after the acquisition will not be more than the lesser of: • $90,000; or • 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies to be made in the 12-month period. 7.19 Therefore, if a GST-registered person acquires goods and services that are, to a minimal extent, used for making exempt supplies, and the above conditions are satisfied, the person will generally be able to claim the full input tax deduction. Subsequent adjustments of input tax deductions When adjustments are not required 7.20 In periods following the initial input tax deduction claim on acquisition, taxpayers will be required to make further adjustments if the actual taxable use of an asset is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. 6 CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193. 25 7.21 Taxpayers will not, however, be required to make further adjustments in three important circumstances: • the actual use of goods and services differs from the use estimated on acquisition by 5% or less. Once the 5% threshold is exceeded, the taxpayer will not be able to rely on this exemption in subsequent years; • the goods and services are purchased for a value that does not exceed $1,000; or • if the total value of all exempt supplies the person made were not more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies in the 12-month period to which the adjustment relates, the person will not need to make adjustments to the extent the goods and services are applied for the purpose of making exempt supplies. Example 4 On acquisition, John predicted that he would use a car 60% for taxable purposes and thus claimed 60% of the input tax. However, John’s business records show that he actually uses the car 64% for the taxable purpose. As the 5% threshold has not been exceeded, John is not required to make a subsequent adjustment of the input tax. When further adjustments must be made 7.22 Under the apportionment model, a GST-registered person will have to track the extent to which the asset is actually used for taxable purposes. Unless the stipulated exclusions apply, the person will be required to make an adjustment, at the end of the taxable period closest to their next balance date, when the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. 7.23 To provide certainty to taxpayers and increase the simplicity of the proposed rules, the maximum number of adjustment periods during which adjustments may be required to be made will be limited. The taxpayer can choose a method to identify the maximum number of adjustment periods for an asset by reference to either the estimated useful life of the asset, as specified in the depreciation rates tables in the Income Tax Act Determinations, or by reference to the following GST-exclusive value bands of goods and services: • $1,000 or less – none; • $1,001 to $5,000 – two adjustments; • $5,001 to $499,999 – five adjustments; • $500,000 or more – ten adjustments. 26 7.24 Each adjustment will be required to be made annually to coincide with the taxpayer’s taxable period which is closest to the taxpayer’s balance date. 7.25 The proposed limitations on the maximum number of adjustment periods will not extend to land and the requirement to make adjustments for any change of use of land will run indefinitely. This is because land does not depreciate and can be held for long periods of time. Calculating adjustments 7.26 Under the proposal, adjustments will have to be made for an asset where there is a difference between the actual use of the asset for taxable purposes (“actual taxable use”) and its intended use for taxable purposes (“intended taxable use”). 7.27 The “actual taxable use” of goods and services is the extent to which they were applied for a taxable purpose during the period starting at the time the goods and services were acquired, and ending at the conclusion of the relevant adjustment period. 7.28 The “intended taxable use” of goods and services will be either: • the intended application for a taxable purpose, as predicted at the time of acquisition and on the basis of which the deduction was claimed; or • if an adjustment has already been made, the actual taxable use of the goods and services as calculated for the purposes of the previous adjustment. 7.29 Both the actual and intended taxable uses of goods and services must be expressed as percentages. 7.30 If the actual and intended taxable uses of goods and services differ, and none of the exemptions apply, then a taxpayer will have to perform calculations to identify the effect of the difference on the input tax deduction. Thus, if the taxpayer’s actual taxable use of an asset is higher than the intended taxable use of the asset, the taxpayer will be able to claim the outstanding part of the input tax deduction under the formula: full input tax deduction x (actual taxable use LESS intended taxable use) 7.31 Conversely, if the actual taxable use is less than the intended taxable use, then the taxpayer will have to return some of the input tax deduction using the formula: full input tax deduction x (intended taxable use LESS actual taxable use) 27 Example 5 Graeme buys a computer and software for $3,600 (with a GST component of $400) that he intends using in his business 90% of the time. In reality, in the first year, Graeme uses the computer for taxable purposes 70% of the time for the first eight months and 80% of time for the remaining four months. In the second year, he stops using the computer in his business altogether and only uses it for private purposes. Apportioning input tax on acquisition As the intended use of the computer as predicted on acquisition is 90% for taxable purposes, Graeme claims 90% of the full input tax deduction. $400 x 90% = $360 First adjustment – after one year The actual use of the computer for business purposes in the first year was 70% for the first eight months and 80% for the remaining four months. Therefore, the actual taxable use of the computer in the first year was: (70% x 8/12) + (80% x 4/12) = 46.6% + 26.6% = 73.2% The intended taxable use of the computer as predicted by Graeme was 90%, while the actual taxable use of the computer in the first adjustment period was 73.2%. To calculate the amount of the adjustment to take account of the difference, Graeme must take the amount of the full input tax deduction available on acquisition and multiply it by the difference between the intended and actual taxable use of the asset for taxable purposes: $400 x (90% – 73.2%) = $67.2 Graeme needs to include $67.2 in his GST return as output tax. Second adjustment – after two years In the second year, Graeme did not use the computer for taxable purposes. He has to calculate the extent of the actual taxable use of the computer during the period, starting at the time the computer was acquired and finishing at the end of the relevant adjustment period – that is, the end of the second year. The actual use of the computer for taxable purposes during that time is: (73.2% x 12/24) + (0% x 12/24) = 36.6% + 0% = 36.6% – the actual use of the computer from the time of acquisition to the end of the second adjustment period. For the purposes of calculating adjustments in the second adjustment period, the actual taxable use of the asset in the first two adjustment periods is compared with the previous actual use from the first adjustment period. In this example, as the actual use of the computer for taxable purposes (36.6%) is lower than the previous actual use (73.2%), Graeme will have to return some of the input tax deduction: $400 x (73.2% – 36.6%) = $146.4 Subsequent adjustments for change-in-use As the GST-exclusive value of the computer was $5,000, or less, Graeme does not need to make any adjustments for changes in use of the computer beyond the first two adjustment periods. 28 Finding the extent to which an asset is used for taxable purposes 7.32 In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one point in time. For example, a person may purchase a motor vehicle both to deliver goods as part of the person’s business and for private purposes. When the person uses the vehicle to deliver goods, the vehicle is being used exclusively for the taxable purpose. When the person uses the vehicle to drive on weekends, the vehicle is used exclusively for the non- taxable purpose. By keeping a logbook, the person may record and identify the total taxable use of the vehicle during the relevant adjustment period. 7.33 In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non- taxable purposes at the same point in time. These situations are most common in the property sector. For example, new residential premises may be advertised for sale and, in that way, used for a taxable purpose. Pending an offer, the advertised premises may be simultaneously leased as a residential dwelling and used for an exempt purpose. The question arises to what extent the premises are being used for the taxable purpose. 7.34 To reduce uncertainty on how apportionments between taxable and non-taxable uses should be made where there is a concurrent application of land as described above, specific rules are proposed to deal with these situations. These would be similar to a method of determining the extent of a taxable purpose in circumstances when newly constructed premises that are held for sale are leased before sale, as stated by the Australian Taxation Office in its ruling (GSTR 2009/4). Calculating concurrent taxable/non-taxable use 7.35 The suggested method for apportioning concurrent taxable and non-taxable uses of assets such as land is to compare the values of the taxable and non- taxable uses. This can be achieved by using the formula: Consideration for the taxable supply \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Consideration for the taxable supply plus consideration for the non-taxable supply 7.36 The “consideration for the taxable supply” is the sale price of the asset, unless the sale was to an associated person, in which case the consideration for the taxable supply would be the market value of the asset at the time of the sale. If the asset has not been sold, the “consideration for the taxable supply” is the market value of the asset at the time of the adjustment. 7.37 The “consideration for the non-taxable supply” is the extent to which the value of the asset is attributable to the non-taxable purpose. In relation to land, the “consideration for the non-taxable supply” is either the rent received during the relevant period or, if the land was applied for private purposes or to an associated person, the market rent that could be received if the land was rented out. 29 Example 6 Jane is registered for GST and has constructed new residential premises for sale. She was entitled to a full input tax deduction on acquisition. However, because the market for new premises was slow, Jane rented out the premises for eight months within the first year before the premises were sold. Jane received $15,000 in rent over the eight months. Jane sells the premises for $500,000. In the taxable period in which the sale occurs, Jane calculates the extent of the taxable purpose using the formula: $500,000 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $500,000 + $15,000 = 97.09% As Jane claimed 100% rather than 97.09% of the available deduction on acquisition, she has to account for output tax of 2.91% of the original purchase price in the period in which the sale occurs. 7.38 If, at any point in an adjustment period, an asset is not used for taxable purposes at all, a taxpayer would have to make further calculations to identify the taxable use of the land in the adjustment period. Example 7 Assume that facts are similar to those in the previous example but, instead of selling the property, Jane stops advertising it for sale and holds it exclusively for the purpose of leasing. This results in the land being used exclusively for a non-taxable purpose. The taxable use of the land during the annual adjustment period is: (97.09% x 8/12) + (0% x 4/12) = 64.72% Again, as the initial deduction exceeds the deduction she is entitled to, Jane would have to return this difference as output tax. The sale of goods and services for which full deductions were not claimed 7.39 On the disposal, or deemed disposal, of an asset that has been subject to the apportionment rules, output tax based on the full consideration for the supply would still need to be accounted for. However, under the proposed rules, a registered person may be able to claim an additional deduction if they have not claimed all of the input tax incurred on the acquisition of the asset. 30 7.40 Any additional input tax (when added to the deductions already taken) will not be able to exceed the full deduction that would have been available on acquisition if the goods and services had been acquired exclusively for taxable purposes. 7.41 The formula for calculating the adjustment will be: tax fraction x consideration x (1 – (actual input tax deduction claimed/ full input tax on acquisition)) 7.42 The “actual input tax deduction” will include any subsequent adjustments for change-in-use up to the last adjustment made before the sale. 7.43 “Consideration” is the consideration received. In circumstances where the sale is to an associated person, or on deregistration, the “consideration” will be the open market value of the asset. 7.44 If an asset appreciates in value, a person will be able to recover the full deduction that the person could have obtained on acquisition. If an asset depreciates in value, the person will be able to recover less than the difference between the full deduction and the claimed deduction, as the person’s non- taxable use of the asset will have been partly responsible for the depreciation of the asset. 7.45 The sale adjustment will not arise if the asset is not sold in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Example 8 Sarah, a registered sole trader, buys a computer for $3,600 (including $400 GST at 12.5%) which she uses 75% of the time for business and 25% for private purposes. She claims an input tax deduction of $300 (75% of $400). In the first year, Sarah uses the computer in the intended manner. In year two, she sells the computer for $540 (including $60 GST). As the GST-exclusive value of the computer was more than $1,000 but less than $5,000, Sarah must make adjustments over the maximum of two adjustment periods. Year one adjustment In year one Sarah’s actual use of the computer corresponded with the intended use of the computer, so she is not required to make any adjustments. 31 Adjustment on sale Sarah has to make an adjustment on sale, which is the lesser of: 1. The difference between the potential input tax deduction and the actual input tax deduction claimed ($100); or 2. Using the formula: 1/9 x $540 x (1 – (300/400)) = $15 where: – 1/9 is the tax fraction; – $540 is the sale price including GST; – $300 is the amount of deduction claimed; – $400 is the full deduction available on acquisition. Sarah can claim input tax of $15 in the second period. 7.46 It should be noted that by allowing the recovery of the deduction in the manner described, the final sale adjustment does not take into account that the taxpayer’s non-taxable use of an asset may have negatively affected the sale price of the asset and, therefore, may have reduced the output tax that will be returned to the government. It is not, however, proposed to require taxpayers to calculate the value of the asset lost to non-taxable uses, as doing so would introduce a further layer of complexity to the rules. Second-hand goods input tax adjustments 7.47 GST-registered persons can deduct input tax on the purchase of second-hand goods from unregistered persons, even though GST is not directly charged on that supply. The deduction is intended to recognise the GST paid when the unregistered supplier acquired the goods. 7.48 Currently, two separate methods for calculating input tax deductions for second-hand goods exist, depending on whether the second-hand goods purchaser is associated with the supplier of the goods. A GST-registered person buying second-hand goods from an unassociated person receives an input tax deduction based on the lesser of one-ninth of the amount paid to acquire the goods or the market value of the goods. On the other hand, the input tax entitlement of a GST-registered person buying second-hand goods from an associated unregistered person is limited to the lesser of the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier, one-ninth of the purchase price, or one-ninth of the open market value. The latter method was introduced in 2000 to prevent, among other things, the second-hand goods deduction from being claimed when GST had not previously been paid in relation to the asset. 32 7.49 The officials’ paper discussed the tax-base risks arising from a small minority of taxpayers attempting to use the change-in-use adjustments provisions (which provide both the cost and market value options) to effectively circumvent the second-hand goods restriction for transactions between associated persons. 7.50 This concern will be removed if the apportionment approach proposed in this chapter is adopted. Under the proposed apportionment rules, a taxpayer making adjustments will not be able to claim more input tax deductions than he or she would be entitled to on acquisition. Therefore, if the taxpayer is not entitled to an input tax deduction on acquisition of a second-hand asset, or is limited to a deduction based on the GST cost, the taxpayer will be similarly limited in relation to any deductions under the proposed adjustment provisions. 33 CHAPTER 8 Accommodation Proposed change A number of amendments are proposed to clarify the boundaries of the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”. 8.1 Accommodation provided by registered persons is taxable for GST purposes unless it is supplied in a residential “dwelling”. In such cases the supply is an exempt supply. 8.2 The term “dwelling” excludes a “commercial dwelling”. Thus, the supply of a “commercial dwelling” by a GST-registered person is normally subject to GST. 8.3 Although a draft interpretation statement released by Inland Revenue in October 2006 attempted to clarify the scope of the two definitions, most submissions received on the interpretation statement commented that, in certain areas, the legislation does not give taxpayers sufficient certainty about when the supply of accommodation should be treated as a taxable or exempt supply. 7 8.4 To resolve the uncertainty, the officials’ issues paper suggested two options: • The first option would involve making relatively minor changes to the current terms “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”, to provide a clearer indication of the boundary between taxable and exempt accommodation. • The second option would involve replacing the current legislative terms with terms that are more descriptive of the normal use of the premises. 8.5 The majority of submissions preferred the first option. Submissions generally considered that a revised framework, as the second option proposed, would replace the current uncertainty with a new layer of ambiguity. 8.6 Several submissions noted specifically that the legislation needs to clarify explicitly the tax treatment of supplies of serviced apartments as there is uncertainty about whether they are taxable or exempt supplies. There was general support for the proposal in the officials’ paper that serviced apartments should be treated as commercial dwellings. 7 GST Exempt Supply: Supply of accommodation in a dwelling, released by Inland Revenue on 19 October 2006. 34 Is the exemption for supplies of accommodation necessary? 8.7 The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants questioned whether the supply of accommodation in a dwelling should be outside the tax base. It submitted that if all accommodation were subject to GST, the boundary issues between exempt and taxable housing would disappear. 8.8 Economically, there is little difference between having rental income in or out of the GST base. Taxing the purchase price of a dwelling (through input tax credit denial) and exempting the rental income derived from it broadly equates to charging GST on the present value of the future rental income and deducting input tax on purchase. 8.9 Bringing rental income into the GST base would, however, cause a new set of problems. The change would increase the compliance costs for owners of rental accommodation who are currently unregistered as many of them would be required to register for GST and comply with GST obligations. The change would also increase Inland Revenue’s administration costs resulting from a sudden and substantial increase in the number of GST-registered persons. (Data indicates that such a reform could introduce about 130,000 new GST- registered persons into the system.) 8.10 Bringing rental income into the tax base would also have a short-term negative effect on the government’s revenue. This would happen because owners of rental accommodation who had not claimed input tax deductions on the purchase of their rental accommodation under the current rules would be able to use the change-in-use adjustment (or apportionment) rules to claim deductions. Considering the large number of taxpayers affected by such a change and the substantial value of land and buildings in the rental market, this revenue cost would be significant. 8.11 Removing the boundary between taxable and exempt supplies of accommodation is therefore not proposed. Instead, a clearer boundary between taxable and exempt accommodation by amending the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” is proposed. Definition of “dwelling” 8.12 The definition of “dwelling” is intended to include any accommodation that is normally used as a place of residence or the home of a person. 8.13 The reason given in the White Paper, Proposals for the Administration of the Goods and Services Tax, published in March 1985 for leaving residential rentals outside the tax base was to ensure that owner-occupiers of residential dwellings are not placed in an advantageous position compared with those who rent. For this reason, the definition should apply only to situations where there is a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a home. This substitutability is more appropriately based on the use of the accommodation rather than the functional nature of the premises as the current definition may imply. 35 8.14 The current definition refers to a building that is used predominantly as “a place of residence or abode of any individual”. According to the draft interpretation, which adopted a wide interpretation of “dwelling”, any house can potentially be covered by this definition. The interpretation is concerned with the functional aspects of the building (that is, whether the building’s structure means that it is predominantly suitable as a place of residence or abode) and there is no requirement for any degree of permanency of occupation in order for the building to be held to be a dwelling. 8.15 So, for example, if a person rents out their second home (which might normally be used by the person to reside during summer months) for a few weeks, the supply to the recipient could potentially be treated as a supply of accommodation in a dwelling. This is because the current legislation is concerned with the premises’ predominant function (that is, a place of residence of the person during summer) rather than the purpose for which the premises have been rented out. This outcome is at odds with the policy intent of the definition. 8.16 To overcome this problem, the definition should focus on the use of the accommodation. It is proposed that the definition be amended to apply to supplies of accommodation in dwellings where the person renting the accommodation occupies the building as his or her habitual or principal place of residence. This definition would imply that the nature of a person’s occupation of the premises must be similar to the occupation of what is commonly understood as their “home”. 8.17 To provide further guidance, the definition would also require that the person renting the accommodation must have exclusive possession of the premises. This will ensure that the recipient’s rights to the accommodation closely resemble the rights of owner-occupiers in relation to their homes. 8.18 Under the proposed rule, the supply of the holiday home would not be treated as a supply of accommodation in a dwelling because the house would not be habitually occupied by those renting it as their main residence. 8.19 Defining the term “dwelling” more narrowly is more in line with the broad- based nature of the GST rules and will improve the equivalence of the GST treatment for owner-occupiers and those who rent their homes. Definition of “commercial dwelling” 8.20 Supplies of accommodation by GST-registered persons are generally taxable unless they are an exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling. The definition of “commercial dwelling” is however important for a number of reasons. First, it indicates what types of accommodation are potentially eligible for the reduced value attribution rules in section 10(6) under which the value of a commercial dwelling on which GST must be charged may be reduced if the accommodation is supplied along with other goods and services on a long-term basis. Secondly, by describing establishments that are commercial dwellings, the definition removes the establishments from the definition of “dwelling”. 36 8.21 Submissions on the officials’ paper indicated that there is some uncertainty about whether certain supplies are within the definition of a “commercial dwelling”. To address the concerns, it is proposed to expand the list of types of accommodation that are explicitly included in the definition. These will include homestays, farmstays and bed and breakfast establishments. The suggested additions to the list of types of commercial dwelling should resolve the current uncertainty with the tax treatment of these specific types of accommodation. 8.22 Since it is difficult to identify and specifically mention in the legislation all possible current and future types of accommodation that should be treated as commercial dwellings, it is necessary to have a comprehensive catch-all provision. The current catch-all provision in paragraph (d) of the definition covers any establishment “similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c)”. Questions have arisen about whether this definition is clear enough to indicate what additional types of accommodation could be covered. 8.23 Supplies by GST-registered persons of accommodation that is not accommodation in a “dwelling” should generally be taxable. Therefore, it is proposed to supplement paragraph (d) of the “commercial dwelling” definition with a specific additional catch-all provision that would cover any supplies of accommodation that are not supplies of accommodation in a “dwelling”. Serviced apartments 8.24 One of the issues raised in submissions was the tax treatment of supplies of accommodation in serviced apartments and units in serviced apartments. It is proposed that, in addition to the supplies mentioned above, supplies of accommodation in serviced apartments in certain cases be treated as supplies in a commercial dwelling and subject to GST if provided by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Supplies of accommodation in an apartment may have a variety of accompanying features and characteristics, such as the nature of services provided and the degree of management control exercised. It is necessary to identify what combination of features would indicate that the apartment should be regarded as a serviced apartment and therefore a “commercial dwelling”. 8.25 Generally, the type of apartments that should be regarded as “serviced apartments” are those that are managed as part of a wider business of supplying accommodation. Often, these businesses will not own the individual apartments under their management, but will have control over the business decisions relating to the apartments. The proposed legislation would ensure that apartments under a unified management are included in the same definition. 37 8.26 The factors indicative of a serviced apartment would be that: • the apartment is managed by a third-party operator as part of a wider accommodation operation with the operator having control over the management and operational decisions; • some degree of service other than just accommodation is provided; and • residents do not have the right to exclusive possession of the apartment. 8.27 A supply of accommodation in an apartment that does not meet all of the criteria for being a serviced apartment (because, for example, it is managed directly by the owner) may still be a supply of an accommodation in “commercial dwelling” if it does not meet the definition of “dwelling” as proposed in this chapter. The supply would be subject to GST if it is made by the registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. 38 APPENDIX Indicative GST legislation 39 A definition of “domestic reverse charge” is introduced. An amendment to the “taxable supplies” definition ensures that a domestic reverse charge supply is a “taxable supply” for GST purposes. 40 The three types of transaction that are subject to the domestic reverse charge are going concerns, land interest and goods or services valued higher than $50m. Affected supplies are treated as being made by the recipient for the purposes of the “output tax” definition and the imposition of tax section. Specific exclusions apply for sales in satisfaction of debt and progressive or periodic supplies (unless these progressive supplies are between associates). The rules related to progressively or periodically supplied goods are expanded to also cover progressively or periodically supplied services. For the domestic reverse charge, this is relevant to supplies of services exceeding $50 million. The time of supply for domestic reverse charge transactions will be the date on which payment is made. 41 The existing zero-rating of going concern supplies is repealed, as these supplies will now be subject to the domestic reverse charge. A recipient can claim input tax on a domestic reverse charge supply, provided output tax in respect of that supply is or has been accounted for. Updated cross-references are required to the “calculation of tax payable” section to incorporate the changes in this draft into the registered person’s calculation. The supplier is not also liable for output tax, provided sufficient records are maintained. There are specific record- keeping requirements for both the supplier and the recipient of a domestic reverse charge supply. 42 There are separate rules for debit/credit notes related to domestic reverse charge supplies. The supplier must still provide a debit/credit note, and the recipient must account for the variation in output and input tax. However, the recipient’s adjustment will result in a net zero position for GST (i.e. changes to output tax will be balanced by changes to input tax). 43 In the debit/credit note, the supplier must provide certain information. A previously unregistered person will be deemed to be registered if they represent that they are registered and receive a domestic reverse charge supply. Such a person will be liable to pay output tax on the domestic reverse charge supply. Where a supply has mistakenly been treated as a domestic reverse charge supply, and the output tax has been accounted for by the recipient, the supplier is not liable for the output tax. 44 If the recipient has not accounted for the output tax, the recipient is responsible for it if the supplier has complied with its record keeping requirements. If the required records have not been kept by the supplier, the supplier will be responsible for the output tax as if they were the recipient. The domestic reverse charge rules will not apply to transactions that occur before the new rules come into force. 45 New definitions are necessary for the apportionment rules. These definitions are largely set out in full in clause 18 (draft section 21F). The definition of input tax is being amended to remove the current principal purpose test, as this will be superceded by the apportionment rules. 46 A deduction for input tax is only available to the extent that the goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, unless a de minimis threshold in relation to exempt supplies is met. The threshold is that exempt supplies must not be more than the lower of $90,000 or 5% of consideration received for all supplies. A taxable person must, at the time of acquisition, estimate the percentage for which goods or services will be used in making taxable supplies. They are then allowed an input tax deduction for this percentage. 47 Non-profit organisations will continue to have the same treatment for claiming of input tax as at present. Where an adjustment is made at a later date, the adjustment must be accounted for in the relevant taxable period. If the estimated taxable use on acquisition is incorrect, an adjustment is required on an annual basis. This does not apply to goods or services with a value of less than $1,000 or where the variation from the initial estimate is less than 5%. This 5% “change in use” de minimis can only be used once. If there is an adjustment, it must be accounted for on the last day of the adjustment period At the end of each adjustment period, a registered person must work out the percentage for which a good or service has been used in making taxable supplies during that period. 48 This percentage use is then compared with the percentage use for the previous period, or, on the first adjustment date, with the estimated use at the time of acquisition. Where the de minimis rules do not apply and there is a change in use, adjustment is necessary. The registered person is either required to pay further tax (in the case of a negative adjustment) or is entitled to further input tax (in the case of a positive adjustment). 49 Special rules apply to the concurrent use of land for both taxable and non- taxable supplies. A formula sets out what percentage of the land can be treated as being used for taxable supplies. The formula compares the taxable use with the non-taxable use by comparing the value of the non-taxable supply (the actual or deemed rental income) with the total consideration (which is the rental income plus the value of the land itself). A further formula must be used where the property has, for whole months, been used solely for non-taxable supplies. This formula reduces the taxable use by discounting any month for which the property has only been used for non-taxable purposes. 50 When an apportioned asset is disposed of, a final wash- up calculation is performed. The effect of this is that the registered person may get further input tax credits up to a maximum of the full deduction that would have been available on the original acquisition. The deduction available will reflect the taxable use of the good or service over the period of ownership. Definitions of “percentage actual use”, “percentage intended use”, “percentage difference” and “adjustment period” are used throughout the apportionment rules. 51 A registered person who acquired goods or services that are subject to adjustments can choose one of two methods for making the adjustments: either the estimated use for depreciation purposes or an alternative based on the value of the good or service in question. The method chosen will set the number of adjustments required. 52 The exception is land, for which ongoing adjustments are required for the period for which the land is held. Once a method for determining the number of adjustments has been elected, it cannot be changed. A final adjustment must be carried out on disposal even if annual adjustments are no longer necessary. The definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” are being amended to clarify the boundary between taxable and exempt accommodation. The definition of “commercial dwelling” includes a serviced apartment managed by a third party. The definition also includes premises that are not a “dwelling”. 53 The definition of a “dwelling” refers to premises that are occupied as a principal place of residence and to which the occupant has an exclusive right of possession.
Making it easier for borrowers to repay their student loans A government discussion document Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in June 2009 by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Making it easier for borrowers to repay their student loans: a government discussion document.

The aim is to make it easier for borrowers to manage their loans, pay back what they owe, and to encourage earlier repayment. 1.2 The focus is on removing the current end-of-year assessment and square-up, earlier detection of PAYE errors, reducing penalties, and improving online services to make it easier for borrowers to manage their accounts. These measures, coupled with new online technology will allow Inland Revenue to provide a more responsive and flexible service to borrowers. 1.3 To reduce the time borrowers must spend on managing their loan accounts, and to improve the overall service to borrowers, only large overpayments will be refunded. Consequently, some borrowers may pay back their loans earlier than they would otherwise. 1.4 We seek your views on the ideas set out in this discussion document. Chapter 2 sets out the background to the changes, while the following chapters outline the impact on borrowers who are employees, self-employed, or based overseas. The final chapter outlines the enhancements and new services proposed for student loan online services. 1.5 This work is not intended as a wider review of student loan scheme policy. 1.6 This discussion document has been prepared as part of a consultation process. Consultation will also take place through an online forum. If the Government decides to proceed, submissions on the ideas explored in this paper will be taken into account in designing policy proposals that could be included in legislation introduced into Parliament later this year. Changes could apply from 1 April 2011 at the earliest, depending on the nature of the changes. To meet these tight timelines, written submissions or those made via the online forum, must be received by 17 July 2009. 1.7 The online forum is available at www.ird.govt.nz/studentloanforum so you can comment on the ideas raised and we encourage you to do so. You can also let us know your views by making a written submission. Written submissions should be addressed to: Student Loan Proposals C/ - Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON 6140 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Student Loan Proposals” in the subject line. 2 1.8 Feedback made through the online forum and written submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular written submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making written submissions who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under that Act should clearly indicate this. Summary of proposed changes Employees • The repayment threshold would be set on a pay-period basis – weekly, fortnightly, four-weekly or monthly – rather than an annual basis. • Borrowers and students who only work for part of the year may be required to make repayments during the time they work. • Major PAYE errors would be identified and corrected earlier than they are now. • If an employer under-deducts loan repayments, future deductions could be adjusted to correct the error. A lump sum payment would not be due, and late payment penalties would not apply. • Most overpayments would be used to reduce the loan rather than be refunded. • Borrowers could seek a refund of overpayments only if the amount was significant and caused by an employer error. Self-employed • The late payment penalty (currently 19.56 percent a year) for non-payment of a borrower’s repayment would be replaced with interest on the outstanding amount. • Under-payments resulting from the year-end square-up would be collected over the next three interim instalments. Overseas borrowers • The late payment penalty imposed on overseas-based borrowers who fail to pay their repayment obligations on time would be replaced with a higher rate of interest on the outstanding amount. New online services for all borrowers • Online services would be similar to those that are used to manage bank accounts. 3 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 More than half a million people have student loans, and this number grows each year. Most borrowers are people who have finished their studies and are paying off their loans. The repayment system they experience is complex and requires a yearly assessment and square-up of how much they paid and how much they borrowed over the year. This administrative requirement can be a burden for some borrowers. Many borrowers receive statements and letters from Inland Revenue several times a year, and may have to contact the Department by phone if they have questions about their loan balance or repayment levels. Borrowers may also experience delays in getting a response from the Department since Inland Revenue has to perform many of these tasks manually, which consumes significant administrative time and resources. These resources could be devoted to more front-line support for borrowers and taxpayers generally. The Government considers that there is room to improve the administration of the scheme. Reasons for change 2.2 The student loan scheme is a major Crown asset and it is essential that it be well managed. Each year approximately 60,000 new borrowers join the scheme. The nominal value of loans totalled $9.573 billion in June 2008. 2.3 The existing student loan scheme is difficult to administer and potentially confusing to borrowers. This is largely because the systems are modelled on tax principles, which place an emphasis on absolute accuracy over simplicity. This stress on accuracy results in high compliance costs. For example, borrowers have to square-up their loan payments each year which often results in unforeseen debt, or little change in outcome compared with the time and resources invested by borrowers and Inland Revenue. The current rules carry with them the risk of significant late payment penalties, a deterrent which is essentially an income tax concept, and which is of questionable suitability in administering student loans. 2.4 The majority of borrowers are likely to be comfortable with the use of online services so there is scope to move from the current inefficient paper-based system to one which is primarily online. An electronic environment would improve the services available online which will give borrowers, especially those based overseas, greater access to information about their loans whenever it suits them. Expanding online services will also free up Inland Revenue resources to focus on proactive services and better support for borrowers. 4 Necessary trade-offs 2.5 For borrowers, these ideas, if implemented, would improve services, reduce compliance costs and allow a high degree of self-management. Other benefits include protecting the value of the Crown’s asset, and enabling administrative resources to be used more effectively to focus on higher value activities. 2.6 However, the gains, which largely arise from moving employed borrowers to a pay-period based assessment, are likely to result in higher costs for some borrowers and some employers. For example, the pay-period assessment will mean that borrowers who work part of the year are likely to be paying more towards their loan during that time than under the current annual assessment system. Similarly, there will be some increase in compliance costs for non- compliant employers. For example, an employer will be contacted by Inland Revenue if he or she continues to make incorrect repayment deductions. 5 CHAPTER 3 Borrowers who are employees Current rules 3.1 Borrowers are required to advise employers that they have a student loan so that employers make deductions from borrowers’ salary and wages during the year via the PAYE system. Inland Revenue monitors the correct use of codes and contacts employers if there is a problem. The student loan deduction rate is 10 percent of a salary or wage when, for the pay-period, a borrower earns more (on an annual basis) than the student loan repayment threshold. This annual repayment threshold is currently $19,084 (which equates to $367 per week). Borrowers who earn an annual income below this threshold do not have to make repayments towards their loan. 3.2 Repayments deducted during the year are squared-up at year-end through the personal tax summary process if requested by borrowers. If too little has been paid through the PAYE system during the year, the shortfall is due on 7 February of the year following (or 7 April if the borrower has a tax agent). Penalties are imposed if this is not paid on time. If the borrower is due a refund it is issued upon request up to six months after the assessment. 3.3 Finally, borrowers in hardship can apply to Inland Revenue to have their repayment obligation reduced. Proposed changes 3.4 Under the proposed changes, repayment deductions would continue to be deducted by employers each payday through the PAYE system. However, the repayment obligation would be set on a weekly, fortnightly, four-weekly or monthly basis, instead of an annual basis. As noted above, the current annual repayment threshold of $19,084 equates to a repayment threshold of $367 per week for those paid weekly. If the borrower earned over this amount in a week the employer would start making a student loan deduction. One implication of this change is that those with fluctuating incomes may pay more than is required under the current rules. Example: Working while studying Lisa is a university student and works during the Christmas break. She earns $900 a week for the eight weeks she works, and has an annual income of $7,200. Under the current system, Lisa won't have to make repayments as her annual income does not exceed the $19,084 annual repayment threshold. Under the new proposals, Lisa's weekly income for the period she works will be above the repayment threshold. Over the Christmas break, Lisa will have $53.30 deducted from her pay each week for her student loan repayments. This is 10 percent of $533, which is her weekly gross income of $900 less the repayment threshold of $367. 6 3.5 Inland Revenue will check the amounts of student loan repayments deducted using information currently provided by employers to identify non-deduction and other errors, and contact employers to correct these when spotted. If a minor error in deduction occurs – either an under-deduction or an over- deduction because the employer makes a calculation error, the error will be ignored. Small overpayments would be put towards reducing the balance of the student loan, resulting in the loan being paid off earlier than otherwise. Example: Repayment error Underpayment Arjun has finished studying. He now works full-time for a small employer who has a manual payroll system. He is paid weekly. When Arjun started his job his employer miscalculated his student loan repayments for the first month and he now owes $500 in repayment deductions. The employer did not spot the error when preparing the PAYE return. Under the current system, Arjun would be sent a bill for $500 after the end of the tax year. Under the proposed changes, the error may be spotted by Inland Revenue through its ongoing monitoring, or Arjun might notice it when checking his account online. Once identified by Inland Revenue, it would contact Arjun’s employer to correct the deduction amount for the future. Inland Revenue would consider the problem corrected and take no further action. Overpayment Had Arjun overpaid by $500, the new proposals mean that Inland Revenue would contact Arjun’s employer to correct the deduction amount for the future, and would apply the overpayment to his student loan balance. Arjun’s student loan would then be paid off a bit faster. Under the current system, if Arjun notices the overpayment and requests a summary of earnings and a personal tax summary from Inland Revenue, he could get the overpayment refunded to him at the end of the year. Otherwise, it would be applied to his loan balance. 3.6 A major overpayment, as a result of an employer error, would be refunded if requested by the borrower. If there is a major underpayment, it would be collected from the borrower over following pay-periods through a higher rate of deductions. For example, the deduction rate for that borrower would increase to 12 percent, rather than the standard 10 percent. 3.7 Some borrowers may have a job which pays less than the current repayment threshold of $19,084 a year. Under the proposed changes, if they take a second job, there would be an option to apply the “unused” threshold left from their first job (the difference between their income from the first job and the repayment threshold) to their second job. If the borrower does not make use of this option, loan repayments would be made from the first dollar of income from that second job. 7 Example: Income from a second job Peter has two jobs. He receives $326 a week from his main job and $77 a week from his second job. Under the new proposals, the weekly repayment threshold is $367. Peter has $41 of “unused” repayment threshold per week from his main job ($367 minus $326 = $41). He applies this unused repayment threshold to his second job. He pays $3.60, or 10% of $36 ($36 being his secondary income in excess of the repayment threshold), each week, rather than $7.70, or 10% of $77 ($77 being his total secondary weekly salary). If he didn’t apply his unused repayment threshold from his main job to his second job, the extra $4.10 ($7.70 minus $3.60) would be applied to his loan balance each week. 3.8 If the borrower receives interest and dividend income below a combined threshold (say $1,500 a year), that income would be ignored when calculating repayments. This will allow wage and salary earners to remain with the simpler system of pay-period deductions rather than being required to complete a return of income. Currently, any amount of such income is counted towards the income used to calculate repayment obligations. 3.9 Borrowers in hardship would continue to be able to apply to Inland Revenue to have their repayment obligation capitalised or reduced. 3.10 The 10 percent voluntary repayment discount would continue to apply to any repayments of $500 or more above the compulsory repayment obligation, if there were no arrears. We welcome submissions on: • The idea of disregarding minor overpayments and underpayments during the year and making corrections against future repayments only. In effect this means that Inland Revenue would not worry too much about small errors. • The impact on students who work in their holidays or borrowers who work part of the year having to make repayments. • Doing away with the year-end square-up to free-up resources for other things, like better online services. • Overpayments being applied to the balance of the loan. This would mean that the loan could be paid off quicker. A refund would be allowed if an employer error leads to a major overpayment. 8 • The idea that major underpayments are recovered through increased deductions each pay-period. Currently overpayments are paid back in a lump sum after an end-of-year square-up. • Do you think that $1,500 (of combined interest and dividends) is an appropriate threshold for making extra payments? • Any other changes you think we should consider. 9 CHAPTER 4 Self-employed borrowers or those with other income Current rules 4.1 If a borrower has income other than from salary and wages they are required to file a return at the end of the year and square-up their income tax and student loan repayment obligations. This is because there is no accurate proxy for measuring their income during the year, as there is for those paid by salary or wages. 4.2 If the student loan residual repayment obligation is $1,000 or more the borrower is required to make three interim repayments during the year. Late payment penalties apply from the third and final instalment date if payments have been missed. Currently, no late payment penalty applies to the earlier two payment dates. 4.3 If too little has been paid during the year through interim instalments the shortfall is due on 7 February of the year following (or 7 April if you have a tax agent). Penalties are imposed if the shortfall is not paid on time. 4.4 The annual repayment threshold for repayments (currently $19,084) applies and is the same as that for wage and salary earners. Proposed changes 4.5 Under the proposed changes, the system would generally remain the same. Borrowers would be required to file a return at the end of the year and square- up their student loan repayment obligations. All interest and dividend income would continue to be part of the end-of-year student loan repayment calculation. The annual repayment threshold for repayments (currently $19,084) would continue to apply. 4.6 Borrowers would be required to pay one-third of their liability on the three interim repayment dates if their annual student loan residual repayment obligation is $1,000 or more. 4.7 If the borrower does not pay their three interim instalments by the due date it will attract interest at, say 6.8 percent, from the due date. The interest rate would be the same as that for overseas-based borrowers, which at present is 6.8 percent. However, it would not attract a late payment penalty, as is currently the case. This approach would give borrowers an incentive to pay during the year but does not result in the application of much more significant late payment penalties (currently 1.5 percent a month or 19.56 percent a year). 10 Example: Missing a payment Anjii is self-employed and is required to make three student loan payments of $4,000 each throughout the year. Anjii misses his first payment, which was due on 28 August. He makes the payment at the end of September. Under the current system, he is not charged interest until the third instalment date which is 7 May of the following year. Under the new proposals, interest is charged from the date of the instalment that he missed. Anjii will be charged one month’s interest (currently 6.8% per annum) on the $4,000. The interest charged will be $22. 4.8 Under the proposed changes, if a borrower overpays during the year, at the end of the year they will be able to get a refund or they can apply the overpayment towards their loan balance. 4.9 If at year-end a borrower has underpaid their liability, the underpayment will be collected over the next three interim instalments. Example: Interim instalments William is self-employed. Last year he underpaid his student loan repayments by $900. Under the current system he would have to pay this all at once on 7 February of the following year (or 7 April if he had a tax agent). Under the proposals, instead of paying the whole amount on the following 7 February (or 7 April), his following year's instalments will each be increased by $300 to recoup the underpayment. By the end of the year he will have made up the shortfall. 4.10 The 10 percent voluntary repayment discount would apply to any repayments of $500 or more above the compulsory repayment obligation, as long as there are no arrears. 4.11 Inland Revenue will still be able to set a due date and undertake debt collection if a borrower fails to meet their obligations. 4.12 If a borrower does not make their first and second loan instalments on time, they will be charged interest on the amount due from the date the payments were due, rather than a late payment penalty from the final of the three due dates. 4.13 This change is to encourage borrowers to make regular payments rather than wait until the final due date to make a lump sum payment. 4.14 It means that if a borrower is late with their first and second payments, they will pay interest under the proposals. 11 4.15 If a borrower overpays, they can get a refund or can apply the overpayment to the loan balance. 4.16 If the borrower underpays, they would pay off the debt in three instalments added to their regular loan payments, rather than paying it in one lump sum on 7 February (or 7 April if they have a tax agent). There would be no interest as long as interim payments were made on time. We welcome submissions on: • Interest being charged from the first repayment date if repayments are late, instead of late payment penalties from the final payment date. • Repaying an underpayment at year-end by increasing the following year’s interim instalments, instead of one lump sum at year-end. • Any other changes you think we should consider. 12 CHAPTER 5 Borrowers who are based overseas Current rules 5.1 Overseas-based borrowers are entitled to a three-year repayment holiday when they go overseas. Interest is still applied to the residual repayment obligation when a borrower takes a repayment holiday. 5.2 Overseas-based borrowers who are not on a repayment holiday have to pay between $1,000 and $3,000 each year, depending on their loan balance. Interest is also applied to the loan balances of overseas-based borrowers. Currently, this is 6.8 percent. 5.3 Late payment penalties of 1.5 percent per month (or 19.56 percent a year) are applied when borrowers fail to meet their repayment obligations. Proposed changes 5.4 Under the proposed changes, overseas-based borrowers will still be entitled to a three-year repayment holiday. Interest would still apply to their loan while on a repayment holiday. 5.5 The current obligation to pay between $1,000 and $3,000 would remain. 5.6 A higher rate of interest, rather than the late payment penalties, would apply in the event of non-payment. Borrowers who do not meet their repayment obligations would be subject to interest on the shortfall. This interest rate would be, say, the interest rate on student loans plus a margin of 4 percent. This is in lieu of the much more significant 1.5 percent per month (19.56 percent a year) late payment penalty which currently applies. The replacement of penalties with interest for non-payment will reduce the rate at which student loan debt grows. Example: Non-payment of loan while overseas Peggy graduated and went on her OE three years ago. The three-year repayment holiday Peggy arranged before she left has recently ended, and she now has a repayment obligation. She does not make payment. Rather than the late payment penalties of 1.5% per month that currently apply (which add up to 19.56% per annum), Peggy is charged a higher interest rate on the missed payment. The higher interest rate will continue until she has paid the outstanding amount. 13 5.7 The 10 percent voluntary repayment discount would apply to any repayments of $500 or more that are above the compulsory repayment obligation, if there are no arrears. 5.8 One of the key features of expanding online services is the option for overseas- based borrowers to deal with Inland Revenue by email. Currently it is difficult for Inland Revenue to provide services to overseas-based borrowers. For example, it is difficult to maintain a current address for many overseas-based borrowers and for borrowers to call during office hours because of international time differences. We welcome submissions on: • Doing away with late payment penalties, and replacing them with an extra rate of interest that would be less than the current penalty rate. • Any other changes you think we should consider. 14 CHAPTER 6 New online services Current process 6.1 Interactions between borrowers and Inland Revenue are mainly by phone and paper. At a minimum, borrowers receive statements twice-yearly. Any changes made to loan accounts during the year, for example, when a penalty is applied, automatically trigger a further paper statement. 6.2 Students who are still studying may have to contact both StudyLink and Inland Revenue to obtain a consolidated loan balance. This happens because StudyLink administers the current borrowings which are only transferred to Inland Revenue once a year. Once they are transferred, the loan balance is consolidated. Online services for the future 6.3 Because it is likely that most borrowers are comfortable using electronic technology, Inland Revenue is looking toward expanding online services to enable borrowers to self-manage their loan accounts online to a greater extent than is currently possible. 6.4 When it’s convenient for borrowers to do so, they would be able to access a number of services through a secure online service, including: • viewing an up-to-date loan balance and transaction history; • managing their loan account at any time, and from anywhere; • applying for special tax or repayment codes to change deduction rates; • increasing student loan deductions and viewing the impact of this change on their loan balance; • requesting a refund of overpaid deductions; and • contacting Inland Revenue by email. 6.5 Phone contact would be the exception and limited to complex cases that cannot be handled via online services. Paper contact would be kept to a minimum. 6.6 Loan balances would be transferred more frequently from StudyLink to Inland Revenue, allowing borrowers to have access to a consolidated loan balance without the need to contact two agencies. 15 We welcome submissions on: • Whether you would like to be able to get in touch with Inland Revenue through other electronic channels such as email or text message. If you could access all your student loan information securely online, would you be happy for Inland Revenue to stop sending you this on paper? • What services would you like to have available online to help you manage your loan account? • Are there any other changes to online services that you think we should consider? 16 APPENDIX Glossary of terms Borrower: Any person with a student loan. Interest rate: The rate at which interest is charged on your loan balance if you’re an overseas-based borrower. The interest rate is adjusted every year. The interest rate for the 2009–10 tax income year is 6.8 percent. Late payment penalties: Penalties incurred when you fail to meet your student loan repayment obligations. Official Information Act 1982: The Act that regulates the release of government information to the public. Online services: A system of providing services through the internet. A key feature of these proposals is to move student loan services to a web- based system. Over-deductions (overpayments): When a borrower’s student loan repayments made through the PAYE system have been too large and therefore the deductions have exceeded the compulsory repayment obligation. Overseas-based borrowers: Any borrower who doesn’t qualify for an interest-free student loan because they’ve been overseas for 184 or more consecutive days (and doesn’t qualify for one of the exemptions). PAYE system: This stands for “pay as you earn” and is a system where taxpayers make payments towards their tax liability and student loans through deductions from their salary and wages each pay period. Taxpayers select a tax code based on their yearly salary or wage and their employer uses this to determine the amount of deductions for income tax and student loan repayments. Personal tax summary: A summary of your income for the year that indicates any income tax to pay or be refunded. Repayment holiday: A period during which a borrower is not required to make payments towards their loan, although interest continues to accrue. A repayment holiday applies only to overseas-based borrowers. Repayment obligation: The assessment of the amount owed on your student loan for a tax year. For New Zealand-based student loan borrowers, the obligation is equal to 10 percent of your income over the repayment threshold (any repayments you have already made are deducted from this to establish your year-end payments). Repayment threshold: The amount you can earn in a tax year before you must start paying back your loan. For the tax year 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010, the repayment threshold is $19,084. Salary and wage earner: A person whose main source of income is from salary or wages paid by an employer. Secondary income: Income from a job that is separate from and in addition to a taxpayer’s main job. Self-employed: A person who earns income from their own business activities rather than an employer. StudyLink: A service of the Ministry of Social Development that helps students access financial support and other entitlements while they complete their studies. Tax codes: Codes used by the PAYE system to determine the correct deductions. Taxpayers select a tax code by filling out the flow chart on the IR330 form when they start a job. The codes indicate whether a job is the taxpayer’s main or secondary employment and whether they have a student loan. If a taxpayer’s circumstances change, they may have to change their tax code. Under-deductions (underpayments): When a borrower’s student loan repayments made through the PAYE system have been too small and the repayments are less than the compulsory repayment obligation. Voluntary repayment bonus: The proposed Government policy whereby borrowers who make voluntary repayments over a threshold of $500 in a tax year get a repayment bonus of 10 percent of the extra amount repaid applied to their student loan. Voluntary repayments: A payment above your compulsory repayment obligation. You can make voluntary repayments even if you earn less than the repayment threshold. A voluntary repayment will reduce the term of your student loan. You can choose to pay off some, or all, of your student loan at any time. Year-end square-up: An assessment process at the end of the tax year (31 March) to determine if a taxpayer has paid the right amount of income tax or made the right student loan repayments.

The term also includes naturally-occurring forests and fish. 3. As regards the application of the Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the laws of that State concerning the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. 4. For the purposes of Articles 10, 11 and 12, dividends, interest or royalties arising in a Contracting State and derived by or through a trust shall be deemed to be beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State where such income is subject to tax in that other State in the hands of a trustee of that trust. 6 Article 4 RESIDENT 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax as a resident of that State, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority of that State. This term however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then their status shall be determined as follows: a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to that individual; but if a permanent home is available in both States, or in neither of them, that individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual's personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); b) if the State in which the centre of vital interests is situated cannot be determined, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which that individual has an habitual abode; c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which that individual is a national. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. If the State in which the place of effective management is situated cannot be determined, or the place of effective management is in neither State, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement in accordance with Article 25 the Contracting State of which the person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Convention, having regard to its places of management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Convention. 7 4. Where an item of income, profits or gains derived by an individual is exempt from tax in New Zealand by reason only of the status of that individual as a transitional resident under the laws of New Zealand, no relief or exemption from tax shall be available under this Convention in Australia in respect of that item of income, profits or gains. 5. Notwithstanding paragraph 3 of this Article, where by reason of paragraph 1 of this Article a company, which is a participant in a dual listed company arrangement, is a resident of both Contracting States then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State in which it is incorporated, provided it has its primary stock exchange listing in that State. 6. The term "dual listed company arrangement" as used in this Article means an arrangement pursuant to which two companies that are listed on a stock exchange specified in subsubparagraphs 1l)(i) and (ii) of Article 3 respectively, while maintaining their separate legal entity status, shareholdings and listings, align their strategic directions and the economic interests of their respective shareholders through: a) the appointment of common (or almost identical) boards of directors, except where the effect of the relevant regulatory requirements prevents this; b) management of the operations of the two companies on a unified basis; c) equalised distributions to shareholders in accordance with an equalisation ratio applying between the two companies, including in the event of a winding up of one or both of the companies; d) the shareholders of both companies voting in effect as a single decision-making body on substantial issues affecting their combined interests; and e) cross-guarantees as to, or similar financial support for, each other's material obligations or operations, except where the effect of the relevant regulatory requirements prevents such guarantees or financial support. 7. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a managed investment trust which receives income (including profits and gains) arising in New Zealand shall be treated, for the purposes of applying the Convention to such income, as an individual resident of Australia and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives, but only to the extent that residents of Australia are the owners of the beneficial interests in the managed investment trust. However, if: a) the managed investment trust has its principal class of units listed on a stock exchange specified in subsubparagraph 1 l)(i) of Article 3 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges; or 8 b) at least 80 per cent of the value of the beneficial interests in the managed investment trust is owned by residents of Australia, the managed investment trust shall be treated as an individual resident of Australia and as the beneficial owner of all the income it receives. Article 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term "permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term "permanent establishment" includes especially: a) a place of management; b) a branch; c) an office; d) a factory; e) a workshop; f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources; and g) an agricultural, pastoral or forestry property. 3. A building site or a construction, installation or assembly project shall constitute a permanent establishment but only if it lasts more than 6 months. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State: a) performs services in the other Contracting State (i) through an individual who is present in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and more than 50 per cent of the gross revenues attributable to active business activities of the enterprise during this period or periods are derived from the services performed in 9 that other State through that individual, or (ii) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and these services are performed for the same project or for connected projects through one or more individuals who are present and performing such services in that other State; b) carries on activities (including the operation of substantial equipment) in the other State in the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources or standing timber situated in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 90 days in any twelve month period; or c) operates substantial equipment in the other State (including as provided in subparagraph b)) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, such activities shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, unless the activities are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 5. For the purposes of subsubparagraph a)(ii) of paragraph 4, services performed by an individual on behalf of one enterprise shall not be considered to be performed by another enterprise through that individual unless that other enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which these services are performed by the individual. Furthermore, services performed through an individual who is present and performing such services in a State for any period not exceeding 5 days shall be disregarded for the purposes of subsubparagraph a)(ii) of paragraph 4, unless such services are performed by that individual in that State on a regular or frequent basis. 6. a) The duration of activities under paragraphs 3 and 4 will be determined by aggregating the periods during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by associated enterprises provided that the activities of the enterprise in that State are connected with the activities carried on in that State by its associate. b) The period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities will be counted only once for the purpose of determining the duration of activities. c) Under this Article, an enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if: 10 (i) one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other; or (ii) both are controlled directly or indirectly by the same person or persons. 7. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term "permanent establishment" shall be deemed not to include: a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e) of this paragraph, provided that such activities are, in relation to the enterprise, of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person—other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 9 applies—is acting on behalf of an enterprise and: a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to substantially negotiate or conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 11 9. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a person who is a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business as such a broker or agent. 10. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. 11. The principles set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall be applied in determining for the purposes of paragraph 7 of Article 11 and paragraph 5 of Article 12 whether there is a permanent establishment outside both Contracting States, and whether an enterprise, not being an enterprise of a Contracting State, has a permanent establishment in a Contracting State. CHAPTER III TAXATION OF INCOME AND FRINGE BENEFITS Article 6 INCOME FROM REAL PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from real property (including profits of an enterprise from agriculture, forestry or fishing) may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the real property is situated. 2. The term "real property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated and includes: a) any natural resources, property accessory to real property, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting real property apply, and rights to standing timber; b) a lease of land and any other interest in or over land, whether improved or not, including a right to explore for natural resources, and a right to exploit those resources; and 12 c) a right to receive variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or for the right to explore for or exploit, natural resources. Ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as real property. 3. Any interest or right referred to in paragraph 2 shall be regarded as situated where the land, natural resources or standing timber, as the case may be, are situated or where the exploration may take place. 4. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of real property. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 shall also apply to the income from real property of an enterprise. The profits of the enterprise shall be determined in accordance with the principles of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 7 as if such income were attributable to a permanent establishment in the Contracting State in which the real property is situated. Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses of the enterprise, being expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether 13 incurred in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article. 5. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 6. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to tax imposed on income from insurance with non-resident insurers. 7. Where: a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident's share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 8. No adjustments to the profits attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise for a year of income shall be made by a Contracting State after the expiration of 7 years from the date on which the enterprise has completed the tax filing requirements of that State for that year of income. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default or where, within that period of 7 years, an audit into the profits of the enterprise has been initiated by either State. Article 8 14 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, amounts paid or payable to an enterprise of a Contracting State for carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The profits to which the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 apply include profits from the operation of ships or aircraft derived through participation in a pooling arrangement or other profit sharing arrangement. 4. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic include profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used in the transport of goods or merchandise, provided that such use, maintenance or rental is directly connected or ancillary to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic. Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions operate between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then any profits which, but for those conditions, might have been expected to accrue to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 15 2. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits accruing to an enterprise, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistently with the principles of this Article. 3. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions operative between the enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have operated between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 4. No adjustments to the profits of an enterprise for a year of income shall be made by a Contracting State in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 after the expiration of 7 years from the date on which the enterprise has completed the tax filing requirements of that State for that year of income. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud, gross negligence or wilful default or where, within that period of 7 years, an audit into the profits of an enterprise has been initiated by that State. Article 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State, being dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed: a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner of those dividends is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. 16 This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned, directly or indirectly through one or more residents of either Contracting State, shares representing 80 per cent or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for a 12 month period ending on the date the dividend is declared and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends: a) has its principal class of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subsubparagraph 1 l)(i) or (ii) of Article 3 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges; b) is owned directly or indirectly by one or more companies: (i) whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subsubparagraph 1 l)(i) or (ii) of Article 3 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges; or (ii) which, if that company or each of those companies owned directly the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid, would be entitled to equivalent benefits in respect of such dividends under a tax treaty between the State of which that company is a resident and the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident; or c) does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs a) or b) of this paragraph but the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State determines that the first sentence of paragraph 9 of this Article does not apply. The competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State shall consult the competent authority of the other Contracting State before refusing to grant benefits of this Convention under this subparagraph. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends holds directly no more than 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends, and the beneficial owner is a Contracting State, or political subdivision or a local authority thereof (including a government investment fund). 5. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights 17 participating in profits, as well as other amounts which are subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purposes of its tax. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 7. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company—being dividends beneficially owned by a person who is not a resident of the other Contracting State—except insofar as the holding in respect of which such dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 8. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of Australia for the purposes of Australian tax and which is also a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax may be taxed in a Contracting State to the extent that the dividends are paid out of profits or income arising in that State. Where such dividends are beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall apply as if the company paying the dividends were a resident only of the first-mentioned State. 9. No relief shall be available under this Article if it is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the dividends, or with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. Article 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other 18 Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if: a) the interest is derived by a Contracting State or by a political sub-division or a local authority thereof (including a government investment fund), or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State; or b) the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer. For the purposes of this Article, the term "financial institution" means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance. 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph b) of that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if: a) in the case of interest arising in New Zealand, it is paid by a person that has not paid approved issuer levy in respect of the interest. This subparagraph a) shall not apply if New Zealand does not have an approved issuer levy, or the payer of the interest is not eligible to elect to pay the approved issuer levy, or if the rate of the approved issuer levy payable in respect of such interest exceeds two percent of the gross amount of the interest. For the purposes of this Article, "approved issuer levy" includes any identical or substantially similar charge payable by the payer of interest arising in New Zealand enacted after the date of this Convention in place of approved issuer levy; or b) it is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans. 5. The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, 19 as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, subparagraph b) of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 7. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt- claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 9. No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the assignment of the interest, the creation or assignment of the debt-claim or other rights in respect of which the interest is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the person which is the beneficial owner of the interest or the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. Article 12 ROYALTIES 20 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments or credits, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for: a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; b) the supply of information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific experience; c) the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph a) or any such information as is mentioned in subparagraph b); d) the use of, or the right to use: (i) motion picture films; (ii) films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio or other broadcasting; e) the use of, or the right to use, some or all of the part of the radiofrequency spectrum as specified in a spectrum licence of a Contracting State, where the payment or credit arises in that State; or f) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 21 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State or outside both Contracting States a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid or credited, having regard to what they are paid or credited for, exceeds the amount which might have been expected to have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments or credits shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 7. No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the royalties, or with the creation or assignment of the rights in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited, to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. Article 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY 1. Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of real property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income, profits or gains from the alienation of property (other than real property) forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including income, profits or gains from the alienation of that permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State. 3. Income, profits or gains of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated by that enterprise in international traffic, or of property (other than real 22 property) pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of any shares or comparable interests deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from real property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 5. Gains of a capital nature from the alienation of any property, other than that referred to in the preceding paragraphs, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. 6. Where an individual who upon ceasing to be a resident of a Contracting State, is treated under the taxation law of that State as having alienated any property and is taxed in that State by reason thereof, the individual may elect to be treated for the purposes of taxation in the other Contracting State as if the individual had, immediately before ceasing to be a resident of the first- mentioned State, alienated and reacquired the property for an amount equal to its fair market value at that time. 7. The provisions of this Article shall not affect the right of Australia to tax, in accordance with its laws, income, profits or gains from the alienation of any property derived by a person who is a resident of Australia at any time during the year of income in which the property is alienated, or has been so resident at any time during the 6 years immediately preceding that year. Article 14 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the year of income of that other State, and 23 b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, or is borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in the first-mentioned State, and c) the remuneration is neither borne by nor deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of a secondment to the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State where the individual is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 90 days in any twelve month period. 5. For the purposes of paragraph 4, "secondment to the other Contracting State" means an arrangement pursuant to which an employee of an enterprise of a Contracting State, being the enterprise with which the employee has a formal contract of employment, temporarily performs employment services in the other State for a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, or for an associated enterprise (as referred to in subparagraph c) of paragraph 6 of Article 5), where such employment services are of a similar nature to those ordinarily performed by that employee for the first-mentioned enterprise. However, it does not include an arrangement that has as one of its main purposes the obtaining of benefits under paragraph 4. Article 15 FRINGE BENEFITS 1. Where, except for the application of this Article, a fringe benefit is taxable in both Contracting States the benefit will be taxable only in the Contracting State that has the sole or primary taxing right in accordance with the Convention in respect of salary or wages from the employment to which the benefit relates. 2. For the purposes of this Article: a) "fringe benefit" includes a benefit provided to an employee or to an associate of an 24 employee by: (i) an employer; (ii) an associate of an employer; or (iii) a person under an arrangement between that person and the employer, associate of an employer or another person in respect of the employment of that employee, and includes an accommodation allowance or housing benefit so provided but does not include a benefit arising from the acquisition of an option over shares under an employee share scheme; b) a Contracting State has a "primary taxing right" to the extent that a taxing right in respect of salary or wages from the relevant employment is allocated to that State in accordance with this Convention and the other Contracting State is required to provide relief for the tax imposed in respect of such remuneration by the first-mentioned State. Article 16 DIRECTORS' FEES Directors' fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person's capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. Article 17 ENTERTAINERS AND SPORTSPERSONS 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person's personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person's capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 25 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the income derived in respect of personal activities exercised by a sportsperson as a member of a recognised team regularly playing in a league competition organised and conducted in both Contracting States, except in respect of performance as a member of a national representative team of either Contracting State. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or 14, as the case may be, shall apply. Article 18 PENSIONS 1. Pensions (including government pensions) and other similar periodic remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State. However, such income arising in the other Contracting State (other than payments of portable New Zealand superannuation or portable veteran's pension or equivalent portable payments arising in New Zealand) shall not be taxed in the first-mentioned State to the extent that such income would not be subject to tax in the other State if the recipient were a resident of that other State. 2. Lump sums arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State under a retirement benefit scheme, or in consequence of retirement, invalidity, disability or death, or by way of compensation for injuries, shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State. 3. Any alimony or other maintenance payment arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State. Article 19 GOVERNMENT SERVICE 1. a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration (other than a pension) paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State. b) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) is a national of that State; or 26 (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of Articles 14, 16 and 17 shall apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration paid in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof. Article 20 STUDENTS Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is temporarily present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of their education or training receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. Article 21 OTHER INCOME 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from real property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, derived by a resident of a Contracting State who carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of the Convention and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the other Contracting State. Article 22 SOURCE OF INCOME 27 Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State which, under any one or more of Articles 6 to 8 and 10 to 19 may be taxed in the other Contracting State shall for the purposes of the law of that other Contracting State relating to its tax be deemed to arise from sources in that other Contracting State. CHAPTER IV ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION Article 23 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. Subject to the provisions of the laws of Australia which relate to the allowance of a credit against Australian tax of tax paid in a country outside Australia (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), New Zealand tax paid under the laws of New Zealand and in accordance with this Convention, in respect of income derived by a resident of Australia shall be allowed as a credit against Australian tax payable in respect of that income. 2. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand income tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Australian tax paid under the laws of Australia and in accordance with this Convention, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. 3. Where, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 1, an item of income is taxed in a Contracting State in the hands of a person that is fiscally transparent under the laws of the other State, and is also taxed in the hands of a resident of that other State as a participant in such person, that other State shall provide relief in respect of taxes imposed in the first-mentioned State on that item of income in accordance with the provisions of this Article. CHAPTER V 28 SPECIAL PROVISIONS Article 24 NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to individuals who are residents of the other Contracting State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to its own residents. 3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 8 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected. 5. This Article shall not apply to any provision of the laws of a Contracting State which: a) is designed to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes; b) does not permit the deferral of tax arising on the transfer of an asset where the subsequent transfer of the asset by the transferee would be beyond the taxing jurisdiction of the Contracting State under its laws; 29 c) provides for consolidation of group entities for treatment as a single entity for tax purposes provided that a company, being a resident of that State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, may access such consolidation treatment on the same terms and conditions as other companies that are residents of the first-mentioned State; d) provides for the transfer of losses within a group of companies; e) does not allow tax rebates, credits or an exemption in relation to dividends paid by a company that is a resident of that State for purposes of its tax; f) provides deductions to eligible taxpayers for expenditure on research and development; or g) is otherwise agreed to be unaffected by this Article in an Exchange of Notes between the Contracting States. 6. In this Article, provisions of the laws of a Contracting State which are designed to prevent avoidance or evasion of taxes include: a) measures designed to address thin capitalisation, dividend stripping and transfer pricing; b) controlled foreign company, transferor trusts and foreign investment fund rules; and c) measures designed to ensure that taxes can be effectively collected and recovered, including conservancy measures. 7. The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or their political subdivisions. Article 25 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for the person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, the person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if the case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which the person is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action 30 resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. 5. For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States. Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of this Article or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States. 6. Where, a) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and b) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the presentation of the case to the competent authority of the other Contracting State, any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been reserved or rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and 31 shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph. 7. The issues to which the provisions of paragraph 6 apply are: a) issues of fact; and b) issues which the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand agree, in an Exchange of Notes, shall be covered by the provisions of paragraph 6. Article 26 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is forseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed, in the case of Australia, under the federal tax laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, and in the case of New Zealand, under its tax laws, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of 32 the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. Article 27 ASSISTANCE IN THE COLLECTION OF TAXES 1. The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article. 2. The term "revenue claim" as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description imposed, in the case of Australia, under the federal tax laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation, and in the case of New Zealand, under its tax laws, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount. 3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of 33 that other State. 4. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State. 6. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State. 7. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be a) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or b) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request. 8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting 34 State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public); c) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice; d) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State; e) to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles. Article 28 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special international agreements. CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 29 MISCELLANEOUS 1. The Contracting States shall consult each other at intervals of not more than five years regarding the terms, operation and application of the Convention with a view to ensuring that it continues to serve the purposes of avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion. The first such consultation shall take place no later than the end of the fifth year after the entry into force of 35 the Convention. 2. With reference to Article 11, if in any future tax treaty with any other State, New Zealand should provide for more favourable treatment of interest derived by financial institutions, New Zealand shall without undue delay inform Australia and shall enter into negotiations with Australia with a view to providing the same treatment. Article 30 ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. The Contracting States shall notify each other in writing through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their domestic requirements for the entry into force of this Convention. The Convention shall enter into force on the date of the last notification, and thereupon the Convention shall have effect: a) in the case of Australia: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the Convention enters into force; (ii) in respect of fringe benefits tax, in relation to fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Convention enters into force; (iii) in respect of other Australian tax, in relation to income, profits or gains of any year of income beginning on or after 1 July next following the date on which the Convention enters into force; b) in the case of New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the Convention enters into force; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Convention enters into force. 2.

The 1995 Agreement shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this paragraph. Article 31 TERMINATION This Convention shall continue in effect indefinitely, but either Contracting State may terminate the Convention by giving written notice of termination, through the diplomatic channel, to the other State at least six months before the end of any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force and, in that event, the Convention shall cease to be effective: a) in the case of Australia: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the notice of termination is given; (ii) in respect of fringe benefits tax, in relation to fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April next following the date on which the notice of termination is given; (iii) in respect of other Australian tax, in relation to income, profits or gains of any year of income beginning on or after 1 July next following the date on which the notice of termination is given; b) in the case of New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non- resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the notice of termination is given; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the notice of termination is given.

Profits from ship or aircraft operations derived by a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph 1, such profits may be taxed in the other Contracting State where they are profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that other State. Those profits shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 7. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from ship or aircraft operations derived by a resident of a Contracting State through participation in a pool service, in a joint business or operating organisation or in an international operating agency. 4. For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a Contracting State for discharge at a place in that State shall be treated as profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that State.� ARTICLE IV Article 9 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : �Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1.

Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.� ARTICLE V Paragraph 3 of Article 10 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : �3. The term �dividends� as used in this Article means income from shares and other income (even paid in the form of interest) treated as income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.� ARTICLE VI The following new paragraph 3 shall be inserted in Article 11 of the Convention and paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall be renumbered respectively as paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 : �3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest shall be exempted from tax in the Contracting State in which it arises if it is interest which is : (a) derived from the investment of funds by the Government of a Contracting State; (b) paid to a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State; or (c) paid to and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured or a credit extented, guaranteed or insured by public entities the objective of which is to promote the export and which are agreed upon by the competent authorities of both Contracting States.� ARTICLE VII Article 16 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : �Article 16 COMPANY MANAGERS 1. Directors' fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person�s capacity as a member of the board of directors or a similar organ of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Remuneration : (a) derived by a person referred to in paragraph 1 from the company in respect of the discharge of day-to-day functions of a managerial or technical nature; or (b) received by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of personal activities as a partner of a company, other than a company with share capital, which is a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, as if such remuneration were remuneration derived by an employee in respect of an employment and as if references to the �employer� were references to the company.� ARTICLE VIII Paragraph 2 of Article 23 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : �2. In the case of Belgium, double taxation shall be avoided as follows : (a) Where a resident of Belgium derives income which has been taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and which is not subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) below, Belgium shall exempt such income from tax but may, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of that resident, apply the rate of tax which would have been applicable if such income had not been exempted. (b) Subject to the provisions of Belgian law regarding the deduction from Belgian tax of taxes paid abroad, where a resident of Belgium derives items of such resident�s aggregate income for Belgian tax purposes which are dividends not exempt from Belgian tax according to sub-paragraph (d) hereinafter, interest or royalties, the New Zealand tax levied on that income shall be allowed as a credit against Belgian tax relating to such income. (c) Where a resident of Belgium derives income which has been taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the provisions of Article 22, the amount of Belgian tax relating to such income shall not exceed the amount which would be charged according to Belgian law if such income were taxed as earned income derived from sources outside Belgium and subject to foreign tax. (d) Dividends derived by a company which is a resident of Belgium from a company which is a resident of New Zealand, shall be exempt from the corporate income tax in Belgium under the conditions and within the limits provided for in Belgian law. (e) Where, in accordance with Belgian law, losses incurred by an enterprise carried on by a resident of Belgium in a permanent establishment situated in New Zealand, have been effectively deducted from the profits of that enterprise for its taxation in Belgium, the exemption provided for in sub-paragraph (a) shall not apply in Belgium to the profits of other taxable periods attributable to that establishment to the extent that those profits have also been exempted from tax in New Zealand by reason of compensation for the said losses.� ARTICLE IX In Chapter V of the Convention, under the title �Special Provisions�, the following Article 23A shall be inserted before Article 24 : � Article 23A NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a third State has in that other State. 3. The taxation on profits from ship or aircraft operations by a resident of a Contracting State to which paragraph 2 of Article 8 applies shall not be less favourably levied in the other State than the taxation levied on profits of enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This paragraph shall not apply to any provisions of the taxation law of a Contracting State which are reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including thin capitalisation legislation. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which enterprises of the first-mentioned State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected. 5. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. This paragraph shall not apply to any provisions of the taxation law of a Contracting State which are reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes. 6. The provisions of this Article shall only apply to the taxes which are the subject of this Convention. 7. If one of the Contracting States considers that taxation measures of the other Contracting State infringe the principles set forth in this Article, the competent authorities shall consult each other in an endeavour to resolve the matter.� ARTICLE X Paragraph 2 of Article 24 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : �2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.� ARTICLE XI Paragraph (d) of the Protocol to the Convention is deleted and replaced by the following : �(d) If, at any time after the date of signature of the Second Protocol, the competent authorities of both Contracting States agree that juridical or economic double taxation of fringe benefits is occurring, the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Belgium shall without undue delay enter into negotiations with a view to amending the present Convention to resolve the matter.� ARTICLE XII In case of divergence between the English, French and Dutch texts of the Convention (including the Protocol and this Second Protocol), the English text shall prevail. ARTICLE XIII Each Contracting State shall notify the other Contracting State of the completion of the procedures required by its laws for the bringing into force of this Second Protocol, which shall form an integral part of the Convention and the Protocol. The Second Protocol shall enter into force on the fifteenth day after the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall be effective : (a) in New Zealand : (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Second Protocol enters into force; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Second Protocol enters into force; (b) in Belgium : (i) in respect of all taxes due at source, on income credited or payable on or after 1 January in the calendar year immediately following that in which the Second Protocol enters into force; (ii) in respect of all taxes other than taxes due at source, on income of taxable periods ending on or after 31 December in the calendar year immediately following that in which the Second Protocol enters into force. ARTICLE XIV This Second Protocol shall remain in force as long as the Convention and the Protocol are applicable. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Second Protocol.   #2% & ?

The existing taxes to which the Convention shall apply are in particular : (a) in the case of New Zealand : the income tax, (hereinafter referred to as “New Zealand tax”); (b) in the case of Belgium : (i) the individual income tax; (ii) the corporate income tax; (iii) the income tax on legal entities; (iv) the income tax on non-residents; (v) the supplementary crisis contribution, including the prepayments, the surcharges on these taxes and prepayments, and the supplements to the individual income tax, (hereinafter referred to as “Belgian tax”).” ARTICLE II Sub-paragraph (h) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : “(h) the term “competent authority” means : (i) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; (ii) in the case of Belgium, the Minister of Finance or an authorised representative.” ARTICLE III Article 8 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : “Article 8 SHIP AND AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS 1. Profits from ship or aircraft operations derived by a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph 1, such profits may be taxed in the other Contracting State where they are profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that other State. Those profits shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 7. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply in relation to the share of the profits from ship or aircraft operations derived by a resident of a Contracting State through participation in a pool service, in a joint business or operating organisation or in an international operating agency. 4. For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a Contracting State for discharge at a place in that State shall be treated as profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that State.” ARTICLE IV Article 9 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : “Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.” ARTICLE V Paragraph 3 of Article 10 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : “3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares and other income (even paid in the form of interest) treated as income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.” ARTICLE VI The following new paragraph 3 shall be inserted in Article 11 of the Convention and paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall be renumbered respectively as paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 : “3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest shall be exempted from tax in the Contracting State in which it arises if it is interest which is : (a) derived from the investment of funds by the Government of a Contracting State; (b) paid to a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State; or (c) paid to and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured or a credit extented, guaranteed or insured by public entities the objective of which is to promote the export and which are agreed upon by the competent authorities of both Contracting States.” ARTICLE VII Article 16 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : “Article 16 COMPANY MANAGERS 1. Directors' fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors or a similar organ of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Remuneration : (a) derived by a person referred to in paragraph 1 from the company in respect of the discharge of day-to-day functions of a managerial or technical nature; or (b) received by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of personal activities as a partner of a company, other than a company with share capital, which is a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, as if such remuneration were remuneration derived by an employee in respect of an employment and as if references to the “employer” were references to the company.” ARTICLE VIII Paragraph 2 of Article 23 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : “2. In the case of Belgium, double taxation shall be avoided as follows : (a) Where a resident of Belgium derives income which has been taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and which is not subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) below, Belgium shall exempt such income from tax but may, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of that resident, apply the rate of tax which would have been applicable if such income had not been exempted. (b) Subject to the provisions of Belgian law regarding the deduction from Belgian tax of taxes paid abroad, where a resident of Belgium derives items of such resident’s aggregate income for Belgian tax purposes which are dividends not exempt from Belgian tax according to sub-paragraph (d) hereinafter, interest or royalties, the New Zealand tax levied on that income shall be allowed as a credit against Belgian tax relating to such income. (c) Where a resident of Belgium derives income which has been taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the provisions of Article 22, the amount of Belgian tax relating to such income shall not exceed the amount which would be charged according to Belgian law if such income were taxed as earned income derived from sources outside Belgium and subject to foreign tax. (d) Dividends derived by a company which is a resident of Belgium from a company which is a resident of New Zealand, shall be exempt from the corporate income tax in Belgium under the conditions and within the limits provided for in Belgian law. (e) Where, in accordance with Belgian law, losses incurred by an enterprise carried on by a resident of Belgium in a permanent establishment situated in New Zealand, have been effectively deducted from the profits of that enterprise for its taxation in Belgium, the exemption provided for in sub-paragraph (a) shall not apply in Belgium to the profits of other taxable periods attributable to that establishment to the extent that those profits have also been exempted from tax in New Zealand by reason of compensation for the said losses.” ARTICLE IX In Chapter V of the Convention, under the title “Special Provisions”, the following Article 23A shall be inserted before Article 24 : “ Article 23A NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a third State has in that other State. 3. The taxation on profits from ship or aircraft operations by a resident of a Contracting State to which paragraph 2 of Article 8 applies shall not be less favourably levied in the other State than the taxation levied on profits of enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This paragraph shall not apply to any provisions of the taxation law of a Contracting State which are reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including thin capitalisation legislation. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which enterprises of the first-mentioned State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected. 5. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. This paragraph shall not apply to any provisions of the taxation law of a Contracting State which are reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes. 6. The provisions of this Article shall only apply to the taxes which are the subject of this Convention. 7. If one of the Contracting States considers that taxation measures of the other Contracting State infringe the principles set forth in this Article, the competent authorities shall consult each other in an endeavour to resolve the matter.” ARTICLE X Paragraph 2 of Article 24 of the Convention shall be deleted and replaced by the following : “2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.” ARTICLE XI Paragraph (d) of the Protocol to the Convention is deleted and replaced by the following : “(d) If, at any time after the date of signature of the Second Protocol, the competent authorities of both Contracting States agree that juridical or economic double taxation of fringe benefits is occurring, the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Belgium shall without undue delay enter into negotiations with a view to amending the present Convention to resolve the matter.” ARTICLE XII In case of divergence between the English, French and Dutch texts of the Convention (including the Protocol and this Second Protocol), the English text shall prevail. ARTICLE XIII Each Contracting State shall notify the other Contracting State of the completion of the procedures required by its laws for the bringing into force of this Second Protocol, which shall form an integral part of the Convention and the Protocol. The Second Protocol shall enter into force on the fifteenth day after the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall be effective : (a) in New Zealand : (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Second Protocol enters into force; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Second Protocol enters into force; (b) in Belgium : (i) in respect of all taxes due at source, on income credited or payable on or after 1 January in the calendar year immediately following that in which the Second Protocol enters into force; (ii) in respect of all taxes other than taxes due at source, on income of taxable periods ending on or after 31 December in the calendar year immediately following that in which the Second Protocol enters into force. ARTICLE XIV This Second Protocol shall remain in force as long as the Convention and the Protocol are applicable. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Second Protocol.

NRWT applies at a different rate depending on whether the payment is a dividend, interest or royalty. 1.2 As shown in table 1, NRWT rates are generally reduced if New Zealand has a double tax agreement with the non-resident’s country. There are also arrangements under domestic law that reduce the impact of NRWT in certain circumstances. Table 1: NRWT rates in domestic law and double tax agreements Dividends Interest Royalties Domestic law rate 30% if unimputed; 15% if imputed. 15% generally, but: 0% if the non-resident is not associated with the interest payer and the 2% approved issuer levy is paid. 15% Typical NZ DTA rate (some treaties include higher rates). 15% 10% 10% Protocol to NZ-US DTA (not yet in force). 15% generally, but: 5% for dividends if a company investor has a 10% or higher stake in the company paying the dividend; and 0% for dividends if a company investor has an 80% or higher stake. 10% generally, but: 0% for interest received by a lending or finance business unrelated to the interest payer, provided (in the case of New Zealand-sourced interest), the 2% approved issuer levy is paid. 5% 1.3 Along with company tax, NRWT helps to ensure that non-residents are taxed on the income they earn from New Zealand. It raises revenue by taxing dividend, interest and royalty payments made by New Zealanders to foreign investors. It provides a backstop to the company tax base by limiting the extent to which these payments can be used to shift New Zealand income offshore. 2 1.4 In some countries, NRWT can be used to reduce taxes in the non-resident’s home country on the dividend, interest or royalty payment. Notwithstanding this, NRWT can still add to the cost of funds for New Zealand businesses in certain circumstances. For example, lenders will often contractually require the borrower to bear the cost of the NRWT in the loan agreement. 1.5 New Zealand has some existing measures, such as the approved issuer levy (for interest paid to an unrelated party) and supplementary dividend tax credits (for imputed dividends), which help to reduce the impact of NRWT on inbound financing and investment, without undermining the role that it plays in sustaining company tax revenues. 1.6 Concerns have been raised that the current approved issuer levy (AIL) and NRWT rules may be one factor hindering the development of New Zealand’s corporate bond market. This paper examines the question of whether the approved issuer levy should apply at a zero rate (rather than the usual rate of 2 percent) on interest paid on corporate bonds which meet certain criteria. 1.7 Because of the fiscal costs and risks of removing NRWT and AIL on interest, it would be useful to receive submissions on the extent to which AIL affects bond issuance and the way that businesses raise funds, relative to other factors. 1.8 To manage the fiscal risks posed by related party and closely held debt we suggest in this paper that certain criteria would be used to limit the zero rate of AIL to widely held debt. Submissions are sought on the suggested changes outlined below. Summary of suggested changes AIL would apply at a rate of zero for interest paid on qualifying bonds. A “qualifying bond” would be a debt security that belonged to a group of identical debt securities that satisfied the widely held test or the stock exchange test. The widely held test would require: • the debt securities to be held by at least 100 investors (who are not associated or who could not reasonably be expected by the issuer to be associated); and • no person (or group of persons that the issuer could reasonably expect to be associated with each other) holds more than 10 percent of the debt securities (disregarding an underwriter for the first year). The issuer would be required to apply the test annually to check that the thresholds were still satisfied. 3 The stock exchange test would require the debt securities to be listed on a recognised stock exchange. Exclusions A debt security would not be a qualifying bond if: • it has been issued through a private placement that is limited to a select group of investors; or • it has not been openly advertised to the target market during the book-build process; or • it is an asset-backed security – that is, any security where the interest payments are financed by cashflows from a pool of financial assets. How to make a submission 1.9 Submissions should be made by 30 October 2009 and be addressed to: NRWT and the bond market C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or e-mail: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “AIL, NRWT and the bond market” in the subject line. 1.10 Submissions should include a brief summary of their major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.11 Submissions may be the source of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who feel there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 4 Chapter 2 ZERO-RATING AIL ON BONDS Non-resident withholding tax and the approved issuer levy 2.1 New Zealand subjects interest payments to non-residents that arise within New Zealand to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) at rates of 10 1 or 15 2 percent. 2.2 If the non-resident lender is not associated (that is, unrelated) with the New Zealand borrower, the New Zealand borrower can elect to pay a 2 percent approved issuer levy (AIL). In these cases NRWT on the interest payment is reduced to zero. 2.3 However, under the NRWT rules, a higher tax is applied to related-party lending to reduce incentives for companies to use tax-deductible interest payments to shift New Zealand profits into related offshore companies and out of the New Zealand tax base. 2.4 In some countries, NRWT can be used to reduce home taxes on interest income received from New Zealand. However, it is common practice for the tax costs to be added to the standard interest rate. Often lenders will contractually require the borrower to bear the cost of the NRWT in the loan agreement. In these cases, the New Zealand borrower would be better off paying AIL at 2 percent, rather than grossing up the interest payment by 10 or 15 percent for NRWT. Status quo and problem 2.5 New Zealand’s corporate bond market is a minor part of our financial system, but has experienced strong recent growth. Since 2005 the total value of corporate bonds on issue has increased from $12 billion dollars to $23 billion dollars. 3 As at December 2008 the domestic bond market was the source of about 4 percent of all debt for non-financial businesses. The bulk of business debt was raised through domestic financial institutions (61 percent) and from offshore (26 percent from significant stakeholders and 9 percent from others). 4 The following graph illustrates this growth. 1 If New Zealand has a tax treaty with the non-resident’s country. 2 If a non-treaty country or Japan. 3 Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Financial Stability Report, May 2009. 4 Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Financial Stability Report, May 2009. 5 NZ Corporate Bond Market: value of corporate bonds outstanding ($bn) 0.00 5.00 10.00 15.00 20.00 25.00 Jan-95 Jul-95 Jan-96 Jul-96 Jan-97 Jul-97 Jan-98 Jul-98 Jan-99 Jul-99 Jan-00 Jul-00 Jan-01 Jul-01 Jan-02 Jul-02 Jan-03 Jul-03 Jan-04 Jul-04 Jan-05 Jul-05 Jan-06 Jul-06 Jan-07 Jul-07 Jan-08 Jul-08 Jan-09 Source: RBNZ, Financial Stability Report, May 2009 -2.50 -2.00 -1.50 -1.00 -0.50 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 Jan-95Jan-96Jan-97Jan-98Jan-99Jan-00Jan-01Jan-02Jan-03Jan-04Jan-05Jan-06Jan-07Jan-08Jan-09Jan-10Jan-11Jan-12 Issues $ bn Maturities $ bn NZ Corporate Bond Market: issues and maturities Source: RBNZ, Financial Stability Report, May 2009 6 2.6 A well-functioning bond market has a number of important signalling and support roles which affect the performance of the wider financial system. For example: • Bond markets provide an observable benchmark for pricing derivatives and equities. • Bond markets make financial investment more attractive by providing a broader range of options (and risk/return profiles) for savers. This may result in more savings becoming available to fund investment. • Bonds can reduce the effective cost of funds and provide longer-term financing options for firms (especially those with long-term growth potential such as infrastructure firms). • A strong bond market can make the economy less vulnerable to a banking crisis, through diversification of lending instruments. 2.7 Concerns have been raised that the current AIL/NRWT rules may be one factor hindering the further development of New Zealand’s corporate bond market. This is because AIL/NRWT increases the cost of issuing bonds to non-residents. For example, a non-resident investor who requires a 10 percent return to buy bonds from a New Zealand company would require the company to pay an interest rate of 10.2 percent to ensure that the investor gets the required return after AIL is deducted. 2.8 The impact of AIL on the domestic bond market could be exacerbated by the fact that it is possible for companies to establish foreign branches and borrow through these branches without paying AIL or (as an alternative) NRWT. On the other hand, interest payments on bonds issued in the domestic market are subject to either AIL or NRWT. This means that issuing bonds on the domestic market may be discouraged relative to issuing bonds through an offshore branch or borrowing directly through domestic banks. Zero-rating AIL on bonds 2.9 The impediment could be removed by having AIL apply at a rate of zero (rather than the usual rate of 2 percent) on interest paid on corporate bonds, subject to certain criteria discussed below. 2.10 A zero rate of AIL on bonds would make it marginally cheaper to issue bonds to non-residents. This could lead to further growth in issuance and a better-functioning New Zealand bond market as it would reduce the cost of foreign funds and increase the pool of potential investors. 7 2.11 It is difficult to gauge the extent to which a zero rate on AIL would lead to increased bond issuance. Many factors influence bond issuing decisions besides interest costs. These include a desire to secure larger or longer-term finance, maintain a good credit rating, or gaining access to a larger pool or different set of investors. 2.12 Because of the fiscal costs and risks of removing NRWT and AIL on interest, it would be useful to receive submissions on the extent to which AIL affects bond issuance and the way that businesses raise funds, relative to other factors. Maintaining the corporate tax base 2.13 As well as raising revenue directly, AIL/NRWT plays a critical role in supporting the domestic tax base. It does this in two ways. In related party debt transactions, it reduces the incentive for corporate groups to shift income offshore by paying interest to a related company in another country. In closely held debt arrangements, it can provide an incentive to maintain banking activity in New Zealand. If either tax base were compromised, New Zealand would lose significant amounts of revenue. The remainder of this paper will consider whether it is possible to develop rules and criteria that would allow AIL and NRWT to be relieved on widely held bonds, while ensuring that related party transactions and closely held debt arrangements are still subject to the existing rates of AIL or NRWT. Related party debt 2.14 The risk from related party debt transactions could be managed through the existing AIL/NRWT settings. These settings ensure that NRWT only applies at a zero rate if the following conditions are satisfied: • the interest payer (borrower) must register as an approved issuer and pay the approved issuer levy (approved issuer status can be revoked if taxpayers fail to meet their tax obligations); • the interest must be paid to a non-resident who is not associated with the approved issuer; and • the interest payment cannot be jointly derived with a New Zealand resident. 2.15 A zero rate of AIL for qualifying bonds would not alter these requirements. This means that NRWT would continue to apply at 10 percent or 15 percent for any interest paid to a non-resident who was associated with the interest payer, regardless of whether the interest was paid on qualifying bonds. Likewise, a 2 percent rate of AIL would continue to apply to unrelated debt that did not meet the requirements of a qualifying bond issue. 8 Closely held debt 2.16 If the government were to introduce a zero rate of AIL on bonds, it would have to be confident that it could not be used to remove NRWT and AIL on interest paid on closely held debt. Otherwise, there could be an increased incentive for loans to be made directly from offshore (for example, by a foreign bank). In such cases, the margin earned on the loan would no longer be subject to New Zealand tax. This could pose a significant fiscal risk to New Zealand because of the importance of the banking sector to our corporate tax base. Some key differences between closely held debt and bonds Closely held debt Bonds Not typically bought and sold (unless securitised). Usually bought and sold on financial markets. Typically a single lender or a small number of syndicated banks. Can be widely held by a large number of retail investors or by a smaller (or larger) number of professional investors. Range of different loan sizes and maturities. Typically used for larger, multi-million dollar deals with longer-term debt available in sophisticated markets. Not generally registered on an exchange. Retail bonds more often registered on exchanges in regulated markets such as NYSE or LSE. 2.17 It may be possible to manage this risk by developing some specific criteria that could be used to exclude closely held debt. Under this approach, AIL would apply at a zero rate on interest paid on a qualifying bond that satisfied the criteria. AIL would continue to apply at the usual rate of 2 percent on debt which did not qualify. 2.18 Suggested criteria for a zero rate of AIL on bonds are discussed below. Australia’s public offer test 2.19 Australia’s “public offer test” exemption provides some examples of the types of criteria that could be applied. 2.20 Australia provides an exemption from withholding tax on interest paid on bonds (or syndicated loans) issued by an Australian company (or an intermediary that issues the bonds on an Australian company’s behalf) which satisfies one of the four public offer tests. The test is satisfied if the bonds are offered to 10 financiers (who are unrelated to the Australian company and each other) or 100 other potential investors, or are listed on a stock exchange or are quoted in a published source that is monitored by investors. However, if the bonds are issued to an associated person, the interest payments remain subject to withholding tax. (See appendix I for a more detailed description of Australia’s public offer tests.) 9 2.21 Australia’s public offer test exemption can apply to syndicated loans 5 and closely held bonds. New Zealand would require tighter criteria, given our objective for AIL to continue to apply at a rate of 2 percent on closely held debt. 2.22 We suggest that a zero rate of AIL would typically apply if either of two tests were satisfied: • the widely held test; or • the stock exchange test. The widely held test 2.23 The widely held test would require: • the bonds to be held by at least 100 investors (who are not associated or who could not reasonably be expected by the issuer to be associated); and • no person (or group of persons that the issuer could reasonably expect to be associated with each other) holds more than 10 percent of the bonds. 2.24 The issuer would be required to apply the test annually to check that the thresholds were still satisfied. 2.25 One drawback with the 10 percent limit is that it could deny the zero rate if an underwriter is required to purchase a significant proportion of the remaining bonds that it had failed to sell during the initial offering. For this reason it would make sense to disregard bonds initially held by an underwriter for the purposes of the maximum number of bonds test so long as the bonds were subsequently sold to third parties within one year after the initial issue date. The stock exchange test 2.26 Another way in which bonds differ from closely held debt is that they can be publicly traded. One of Australia’s public offer tests is that bonds which are “listed on a stock exchange” qualify for the exemption. 2.27 We suggest that New Zealand could adopt a similar stock exchange qualification. In many cases a stock exchange’s listing requirements could help ensure that the bonds were publicly traded and priced at an arm’s-length rate. 5 A syndicated loan is a loan offered by a group of lenders (called a syndicate) who work together to provide funds for a single borrower. 10 2.28 As a stand-alone qualification, a stock exchange test would be easier to verify than a widely held test, but may not offer as much protection. This is because a company could emulate a closely held loan by listing bonds on a stock exchange but then issue them to just one or a few parties. For this reason bonds issued through a private placement would need to be specifically excluded from the concessionary rate of AIL. Safeguards 2.29 As a further safeguard, the widely held, and stock exchange tests would need to be supported by specific exclusions to make it more difficult to reclassify closely held debt in order to qualify for the exemption. The zero rate of AIL would be denied if: • The bonds are issued through a private placement that is limited to a select group of investors as opposed to a public offering that is open to all investors. The concern is that such bonds could be used in place of a loan or a syndicated loan. • The bonds are not openly advertised to the target market during the book-build process. • The bonds are an “asset-backed” security – that is, any security where the interest payments are financed by cashflows from a pool of financial assets, such as mortgages. The concern with these securities is that they can be used to package together a group of closely held loans and effectively shift the margin earned on these outside the New Zealand tax base. Note that this measure is not intended to exclude bonds that are simply “secured” against a collateral asset which the bond holder can claim in the case of default. Questions for submissions We would be interested to receive feedback on questions such as: • Should AIL apply at a rate of zero on qualifying bonds? • To what extent would this affect bond issuance and the way that businesses raise funds? • Would this affect the decision to issue bonds offshore (as opposed to in New Zealand)? • Which companies would make use of a zero rate of AIL for qualifying bonds? • How can the proposed tests and safeguards be improved? 11 Appendix I AUSTRALIA’S PUBLIC OFFER TEST EXEMPTION (Adapted from Chapter 5 of the Australian Tax Office “Explanatory Memorandum on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997”) There are four public offer tests. An Australian company (or an intermediary issuing bonds on an Australian company’s behalf) needs to satisfy one of the tests to qualify for the withholding tax exemption. 1. Approach 10 financiers Under the first public offer test, the debentures must be offered for issue to at least 10 persons who were each carrying on the business of providing finance, or investing or dealing in securities, as participants in financial markets. For example, if the Australian company offers its debentures to 10 banks or pensions funds operating in a financial market, the public offer test will be satisfied. It is a requirement of this test that the persons approached must not be known or suspected by the issuing company to be associates of each other. The company offering the debentures for sale does not need to undertake a detailed examination of the parties to whom the debentures are offered. It cannot, however, ignore companies that are generally known to be associates. 2. Offering debentures for issue to 100 potential investors The second public offer test will be satisfied if at least 100 investors receive an offer of debentures for issue. This test is to accommodate financing operations undertaken in retail capital markets that are directed at individual investors and businesses. For example, this test may be satisfied by an issuer of debentures sending letters to persons who it may reasonably regard as having acquired debentures from time to time. Similarly, if offers are made to 100 customers of a stock broker who have previously purchased debentures this test will clearly be satisfied. Offers made to persons who have not previously purchased debentures from a stock broker but whom the broker has reason to believe may be interested in acquiring debentures or other securities will be counted for the purposes of the second public offer test. It will also be satisfied where an agent acting on behalf of the company approaches customers with an offer of the debentures for issue. The second test will not be satisfied where 100 persons receive an offer of debentures for issue who have not previously acquired debentures and in respect of whom the issuer has no reasonable basis for believing that they may be interested in acquiring debentures. 3. Listed on a stock exchange The third public offer test will be satisfied if the company offers debentures for issue where the debentures have been accepted for listing by a stock exchange and the company has agreed with its dealers, managers or underwriters to have the debentures listed on the stock exchange following issue. 12 4. Quoted in a published source The fourth public offer test will be satisfied if the debentures are offered for issue as a result of negotiations beginning with the company announcing in an electronic source or other sources, information monitored by capital markets, its intention to raise funds by issuing debentures. For example, the public offer test will be met if negotiations between an investor and the issuing company began because the investor became aware of the company's intention to raise funds after seeing an electronic information source or offering circular. In relation to electronic quotation, the public offer test will be satisfied if the Australian company's offer of debentures for issue is quoted on an electronic financial information source such as Reuter financial services or Bloomberg. The details required to be in the electronic quotation are the name of the company issuing the debentures and the name of the programme. The quotation may include the names of the dealers or managers. In relation to hardcopy publications, the debenture offer must be published in a publication monitored by financial markets as a source of information. For example, publication of an offer of debentures for issue in a leading financial newspaper in London or New York will satisfy this test. The test, however, will not be satisfied if the debenture offer is published in a source not used by financial markets for dealing in debentures. A prospectus or offering circular that is publicly available in capital markets will also meet this test. Issues of debentures to associated persons always fail the public offer test A company will fail the public offer test if it was aware (or had reasonable grounds to suspect), at the time of issue, that the debentures would be acquired by an associate of the company issuing the debentures. 13 Appendix II DRAFT REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT In accordance with the Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements for discussion documents, a draft regulatory impact statement has been prepared. Executive summary Approved issuers are required to pay a 2 percent levy on interest paid to non-residents on certain securities. 6 This approved issuer levy (AIL) has been identified as a possible impediment to the development of New Zealand’s corporate bond market. This impediment could be reduced by modifying AIL so that a zero percent rate (as opposed to the usual 2 percent rate) applies on interest paid in respect of certain qualifying bonds. An issues paper has been prepared to consult on this option. A zero rate of AIL on qualifying bonds would be preferred to the status quo if the benefits of increased bond market development outweigh the costs of increased fiscal risk and the compliance costs associated with the legislative change. The issues paper aims to gather sufficient information to assess whether the suggested changes will meet this test. Adequacy statement An adequacy statement will be provided on the final regulatory impact statement. Status quo and problem Well-developed domestic capital markets have an important role in relation to economic growth, as they provide increased access to finance for New Zealand firms, capture the benefits of finance arrangements in New Zealand, and encourage firms to remain in or move to New Zealand. Bond markets have a part to play in well developed capital markets, as a well-functioning bond market has a number of important signalling and support roles which affect the performance of the capital markets, and the wider financial system. New Zealand’s overall financial system is patchy; a large, efficient and sound banking system sits alongside equity, venture capital and debt markets that in size, depth, liquidity and skill base are relatively underdeveloped. As at December 2008 the domestic bond market was the source of about 4 percent of all debt for non-financial businesses. The bulk of business debt was raised through domestic financial institutions (61 percent) and from offshore (26 percent from significant stakeholders and 9 percent from others). New Zealand’s corporate bond market is a minor part of our financial system, but has experienced strong recent growth. Since 2005 the total value of corporate bonds on issue has increased from $12 billion dollars to $23 billion dollars. 6 If you pay interest to a non-resident lender and do not wish to deduct non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) from the interest payments, you have to apply to Inland Revenue to become an approved issuer. Instead of deducting NRWT, approved issuers must pay a 2% levy on the interest for those securities they register with Inland Revenue. 14 The approved issuer levy (AIL) has been identified in forums such as the Jobs Summit as a possible tax impediment to the development of New Zealand’s corporate bond market. This is because AIL increases the cost of issuing bonds to non-residents. For example, a non- resident investor who requires a 10 percent return to buy bonds from a New Zealand company would require the company to pay an interest rate of 10.2 percent to ensure that the investor gets the required return after AIL is deducted. The impact of AIL on the domestic bond market could be exacerbated by the fact that it is possible for companies to establish foreign branches and borrow through these branches without paying AIL or (as an alternative) non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). On the other hand, interest payments on bonds issued in the domestic market are subject to either AIL or NRWT. This means that issuing bonds on the domestic market may be discouraged relative to issuing bonds through an offshore branch or borrowing directly through domestic banks. Objectives The issues paper is focused on investigating the extent to which AIL and NRWT may hinder bond market development and how this impediment could be removed without undermining New Zealand’s ability to tax closely held debt (such as bank loans). This tax focus is deliberate, as non-tax issues associated with the bond market are best considered through the Capital Market Development Taskforce, which is to produce a blueprint and action plan to develop New Zealand’s capital markets more generally. Should submissions contribute non-tax suggestions for how to improve the performance of domestic capital markets we will advise Ministers on these and pass them on to the Capital Market Development Taskforce. Alternative options The simplest solution that would enhance the domestic bond market would be to have a zero rate of AIL apply on all debt instruments between unrelated persons. However this is likely to have a very large fiscal cost, both directly in terms of lost AIL revenues and indirectly in terms of lost corporate tax revenues to the extent that it may encourage domestic lending activity (particularly from banks) to shift offshore. Another option of attempting to remove all the existing exemptions to NRWT was, for technical reasons, not considered feasible. Preferred option The impediment could be reduced by modifying AIL so that a zero percent rate (as opposed to the usual 2 percent rate) applies on interest paid in respect of certain qualifying bonds. This is preferred to the alternative options outlined above because it is better targeted at reducing the cost of issuing bonds in New Zealand and would involve less fiscal cost and risk. An issues paper has been prepared to consult on this option. We are interested in feedback on the following points: Should AIL apply at a rate of zero on qualifying bonds? A zero rate of AIL on qualifying bonds would be preferred to the status quo if the benefits of increased bond market development outweigh the costs of increased fiscal risk and compliance costs associated with the legislative change. The issues paper aims to gather sufficient information to assess whether the suggested changes will meet this test. 15 To what extent would this affect bond issuance and the way that businesses raise funds? A zero rate of AIL on qualifying bonds would make it marginally cheaper to issue bonds to non-residents. This could lead to further growth in issuance and a better-functioning New Zealand bond market as it would reduce the cost of foreign funds and increase the pool of potential investors. It is difficult to gauge the extent to which a zero rate of AIL would lead to increased bond issuance. Many factors influence bond issuing decisions besides interest costs. These include a desire to secure larger or longer-term finance, maintain a good credit rating, or gain access to a larger pool or different set of investors. Similarly, in many cases it may remain suitable to lend from a single party (or syndicate), issue new equity, or fund the investment out of retained earnings, for reasons other than the relative cost of funds. Would this effect the decision to issue bonds offshore (as opposed to in New Zealand)? It may be cheaper for firms to issue debt in offshore markets, regardless of the impact of AIL. Compared with the New Zealand bond market, offshore markets can sometimes provide access to more favourable exchange and interest rates, and to a larger pool of investors. This means that some corporates may continue to raise much of their debt offshore if AIL were zero-rated, rather than issue new bonds into the New Zealand market. Which companies would make use of a zero rate of AIL for qualifying bonds? It is anticipated that a zero rate of AIL could lead to large corporates and existing bond issuers issuing additional bonds in New Zealand. It would be less likely to prompt smaller corporates to issue bonds for the first-time, because of the high set-up costs of becoming a bond issuer. How can the proposed tests and safeguards be improved? The amount that a zero rate of AIL increases fiscal risk and compliance costs depends on the design of the suggested changes. Designing the zero rate of AIL is not a straightforward exercise. To keep fiscal risks at a manageable level it needs to ensure that the full rate of NRWT or AIL still applies to interest paid on closely held debt. Otherwise, there could be an increased incentive for loans to be made directly from offshore (for example, by a foreign bank). In such cases, the margin earned on the loan would no longer be subject to New Zealand tax. This could pose a significant fiscal risk to New Zealand because of the importance of the banking sector to our corporate tax base. Rather than requiring those making submissions to anticipate what level of risk is acceptable and how this risk can be managed, the issues paper outlines a specific suggestion for them to respond to. Submissions can then focus on how the suggested tests and safeguards could be improved to increase uptake and reduce uncertainty and compliance costs. Implementation and review The preferred option could be implemented in the next available tax bill. Administration of the new rate of AIL could be carried out by Inland Revenue in accordance with existing practices for administering the approved issuer levy and non-resident withholding tax. 16 If the preferred option is implemented, officials plan to monitor changes in bond market activity and discuss with market participants how well the new rules are working. Any necessary corrections or improvements could be included in a subsequent tax bill. Consultation Consultation will be conducted through public submissions and meetings with interested parties in accordance with the generic tax policy process. We expect to receive submissions from banks, large corporates, market participants and tax practitioners. We would be interested to receive feedback on questions such as: Should AIL apply at a rate of zero on qualifying bonds? To what extent would this affect bond issuance and the way that businesses raise funds? Would this affect the decision to issue bonds offshore (as opposed to in New Zealand)? Which companies would make use of a zero rate of AIL for qualifying bonds? How can the suggested tests and safeguards be improved?
