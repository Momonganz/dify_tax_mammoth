It is intended that Pillar One will replace unilateral digital services taxes.  Pillar Two aims to limit the ‘race to the bottom’ for large MNEs, where countries compete to attract mobile income (for example, interest, dividends and royalties) through offering low tax rates and tax incentives. It is also known as the global minimum tax. The Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules are the main component of Pillar Two. The rules are designed so that MNEs with annual revenues above €750 million pay a minimum 15% effective tax rate on their mobile income in every country where that income is earned. The GloBE rules are intended to apply to every in-scope MNE in the world, no matter where it has its headquarters, operations or sales. The design of the rules means this intention can be achieved even if many, or indeed most, countries do not adopt the rules, provided a critical mass of countries implement the GloBE rules (that is, enough adopt the rules that domestic MNEs cannot escape the tax by earning income only in countries that do not adopt them). The rules do this by allowing countries that adopt them to tax mobile income arising in other countries if that income is not subject to a 15% effective tax rate. This creates an incentive for countries to adopt the rules or increase their taxes on mobile income. The Bill gives legislative effect in New Zealand to the GloBE rules. The proposals in this Bill were subject to public consultation in May 2022. The term used in the Bill to describe New Zealand’s GloBE rules is the ‘Applied GloBE rules’, and the term used in the Bill for tax imposed under New Zealand’s Applied GloBE rules is the ‘Multinational Top-Up Tax’. The Applied GloBE rules consist of an Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and an Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR). Together they will ensure that if a critical mass of other countries adopt the GloBE rules, such that New Zealand MNEs will need to comply with and pay GloBE tax whether New Zealand adopts the rules or not:  New Zealand will not lose GloBE tax revenue it is entitled to collect to other countries if it enacts the rules, and Date: May 2023 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  administration and compliance costs for in-scope New Zealand MNEs and the Government will be reduced. The application date for the Applied GloBE rules will be set by Order in Council once the Government determines that a critical mass of countries has adopted the GloBE rules. Such adoption seems very likely, though is not certain. This application date will not be earlier than 1 January 2024 for the IIR and 1 January 2025 for the UTPR.

Whether an MNE has obligations for Applied GloBE rules filing and (potentially) paying Multinational Top-Up Tax is determined by applying the OECD published Model Rules 1 as modified by schedule 25B to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), the Commentary, 2 and the Agreed Administrative Guidance, 3 which define what type of MNEs are in scope and what are the operative rules. The OECD, through the Inclusive Framework, will continue to publish Agreed Administrative Guidance, which will become part of New Zealand law. The proposed Applied GloBE rules have implications for both MNEs headquartered inside New Zealand and those outside New Zealand. For an MNE headquartered in New Zealand, or with a constituent entity (including a branch) located in New Zealand, t he proposed Applied GloBE rules require the MNE to:  Determine whether it is in scope for the GloBE rules, i.e. if it has an international presence and over €750 million in consolidated revenues in any two of the preceding four years (see proposed section HP 1(1) of the ITA and Chapter 1 of the Model Rules).  Determine whether any de minimis or safe harbour applies in each country where it operates (see Chapters 5 and 8 of the Model Rules and the OECD document “Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief” for the transitional safe harbours that apply to fiscal years ending on or before 30 June 2028).  Calculate its effective tax rate (ETR) in each country where it operates and a safe harbour does not apply (see Chapters 3 to 7 and 9 of the Model Rules). 1 OECD (2021), Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two), available at www.oecd.org 2 OECD (2022), Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – Commentary to the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two), First Edition, available at www.oecd.org 3 OECD (2023), Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – Administrative Guidance on the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two), available at www.oecd.org Date: May 2023 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Calculate mobile income by calculating the GloBE income in each country and reducing it by the substance-based income exclusion (SBIE). The SBIE is a carve-out based on tangible assets and payroll costs in a country (see Chapter 5 of the Model Rules).  Calculate the top-up tax if the ETR in a country is less than 15%. The top-up tax will bring the ETR on the MNE’s mobile income in that country up to 15% (see Chapter 5 of the Model Rules).  Pay Multinational Top-Up Tax to Inland Revenue for: o Foreign operations under the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR), 4 which applies when a New Zealand MNE earns the undertaxed income in another country (see Chapter 2 of the Model Rules). o New Zealand operations under the Domestic Income Inclusion Rule (DIIR), which applies when a New Zealand-headquartered MNE has undertaxed mobile income in New Zealand (see proposed schedule 25B of the ITA and Chapter 2 of the Model Rules). MNEs headquartered outside New Zealand could also be subject to a Multinational Top- Up Tax liability if they have an intermediate parent located in New Zealand or a liability under the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR) 5 (see proposed schedule 25B of the ITA and Chapter 2 of the Model Rules). The Bill includes consequential amendments to deal with how the GloBE rules would interact with New Zealand tax law. These amendments propose that:  the Applied GloBE rules would apply, notwithstanding the terms of a tax treaty, unless those terms expressly refer to the GloBE rules (see proposed section BH 1(4C))  imputation credits would not be available for top-up taxes paid under the IIR and UTPR but would be available for taxes paid under the New Zealand Domestic Income Inclusion Rule (DIIR) (see proposed sections OB 7BB and OP 11BA), and  foreign tax credits would be available under subparts LJ and LK for top-up taxes paid under a foreign Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) but not for top-up taxes paid under an IIR or UTPR (see proposed section LJ 3). 4 The IIR applies on a top-down basis, giving the ultimate parent entity country, or an intermediate parent entity country, the right to collect GloBE top-up tax for underlying foreign operations, unless the tax is collected in the foreign country under a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax. 5 The UTPR is a back-up rule that applies when no parent is subject to the IIR. It allocates top-up tax to countries in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each country that adopts the GloBE rules. This ensures that if the country where an MNE has its headquarters does not implement GloBE rules, the MNE will still have to pay top-up tax.

They were released in December 2021 as the Model Rules and provide a template that jurisdictions can translate into domestic law. The release of the Model Rules was followed by the release of detailed commentary (the Commentary) to the rules in March 2022 and the first tranche of Agreed Administrative Guidance in February 2023. In some instances, the Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance modify provisions in the Model Rules. Further tranches of agreed administrative guidance will be periodically issued by the IF to supplement the Commentary by providing additional guidance on the interpretation and operationalisation of the Model Rules (including safe harbours). The further tranches of agreed administrative guidance may also effectively modify the Model Rules. If a country adopts the GloBE rules, it must adopt the Model Rules, Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance. Where a country’s legislation departs from the Model Rules, there is a risk its GloBE rules will not be “qualifying”, and other participating jurisdictions will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under the UTPR. To mitigate this risk in New Zealand, the GloBE rules will be incorporated into New Zealand legislation by reference to the Model Rules, Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance. In the limited areas where the rules need to be adapted, for example, to reflect concepts in New Zealand law like imputation credits and foreign tax credits, the adaptation will respect the intended outcomes agreed in the IF. Key features The key features of the proposed Applied GloBE tax rules include:  Incorporating the Model Rules, Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance developed by the OECD-sponsored Inclusive Framework into the ITA. This is done by reference to the rules, rather than by repeating or translating them in New Zealand law.  Changes to the ITA necessary to support the interpretation and implementation of the GloBE rules in New Zealand.  Consequential changes to the ITA necessary to ensure the Applied GloBE rules are “qualifying”.  A regulation-making power enabling the Governor-General to make Orders in Council providing for the GloBE rules to come into effect in New Zealand and to make regulations providing for the cancellation, reversal, or non-application of the Commentary or Agreed Administrative Guidance (including future tranches of agreed administrative guidance).

The application date for the Applied GloBE rules would be set by Order in Council once the Government determines that a critical mass of countries has adopted the GloBE rules. This would not be earlier than 1 January 2024 for the IIR and 1 January 2025 for the UTPR. Detailed analysis The proposals in the Bill would affect:  New Zealand-headquartered MNEs and their constituent entities (including branches) with over €750 million in global consolidated revenues, and  Foreign-headquartered MNEs with over €750 million in global consolidated revenues that have New Zealand operations or a New Zealand intermediate parent entity if a top-up tax is due to New Zealand under the UTPR or IIR in accordance with the GloBE rules. Multinational Top-Up Tax will be an ancillary tax Proposed section BF 1(b) provides that Multinational Top-Up Tax will be an “ancillary tax”, not income tax. As such, a separate administrative regime is proposed to deal with Multinational Top-Up Tax (see Item: “Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994” below for further detail). This also means it will not fall in scope of the provisional tax regime. Multinational Top-Up Tax will override our double tax agreements The OECD has stated that the IIR and UTPR are both compatible with OECD model-based tax treaties, such as New Zealand’s. To avoid any uncertainty on this point, proposed section BH 1(4) provides that the GloBE rules adopted by New Zealand will apply notwithstanding the terms of a tax treaty, unless those terms expressly refer to the GloBE rules. Multinational Top-Up Tax will be payable by in-scope MNE Proposed section HP 1 is the charging provision for the Multinational Top-Up Tax. Proposed section HP 2 provides that top-up tax would be payable 20 months after the end of the first fiscal year in which the MNE becomes in-scope of the New Zealand rules. Thereafter, top-up tax will be payable 16 months after the end of an MNE’s fiscal year.

Section HP 3 is modified by schedule 25B. The Applied GloBE rules are treated as applying at a time consistently with the most recent commentary and guidance on the interpretation or administration of the GloBE rules published by the OECD before the start of the fiscal year in which the time falls. The Model Rules (Article 8.3.1) provide that the tax administration of an implementing jurisdiction shall, subject to any requirements of domestic law, apply the GloBE rules in accordance with any Agreed Administrative Guidance. This provision has been removed in schedule 25B to the ITA because proposed section HP 3 requires the Model Rules to be applied consistently with the Commentary and the Agreed Administrative Guidance. Consequently, where there is an inconsistency between the Model Rules and the Commentary or Agreed Administrative Guidance, it is the Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance that take precedence. For example, the Model Rules provide that Article 7.4.1 only applies to investment entities. The Commentary provides that Article 7.4.1 applies to investment entities and insurance investment entities. The correct outcome is that Article 7.4.1 applies to investment entities and insurance investment entities. Proposed section 226G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Governor- General, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, shall make regulations providing for the cancellation, reversal, or non-application of a change to the Commentary or the Agreed Administrative Guidance (including future tranches). Although it is unlikely that this power will be used, it makes explicit the power of the New Zealand Parliament in the future to reject, in whole or in part, changes to the rules occurring at the level of the OECD. The Model Rules This Guidance Material item provides an overview of the Model Rules and how they would be implemented in New Zealand. Further detail on the Model Rules, Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance is available at the OECD website. 6 6 https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/tax-challenges-arising-from-the-digitalisation-of-the-economy- global-anti-base-erosion-model-rules-pillar-two.htm Date: May 2023 19 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Chapter 1: Scope This Chapter discusses which types of entities are in scope for the Model Rules. The GloBE rules apply to MNEs that have consolidated annual revenues of at least €750 million in at least two of the last four fiscal years. The fiscal year is the period covered by the MNE group’s consolidated financial statements. Special rules exist to address situations when:  an MNE does not prepare consolidated financial statements  an MNE does not have four years of consolidated financial statements  one of the four preceding fiscal years is for a period other than 12 months, or  an MNE has undergone a merger or demerger. MNE groups The Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) of an MNE group is the entity that owns – directly or indirectly – a controlling interest in any other entity but is not controlled – directly or indirectly – by another entity. The UPE is important because the IIR is applied at the UPE level in the first instance (if the UPE’s jurisdiction has a qualified IIR), and the UPE’s consolidated financial statements determine what entities are within the group. An ‘MNE group’ is a group with at least one entity or permanent establishment (PE) that is not located in the jurisdiction of the UPE. Regardless of size, a group that is located entirely within one jurisdiction with no offshore subsidiaries or PEs is therefore outside the scope of the GloBE rules. A member of an MNE group is referred to as a ‘Constituent Entity’ of the group. Excluded entities The following entities are excluded from the GloBE rules:  Governmental entities.  International organisations.  Non-profit organisations.  Pension funds.  Investment funds that are UPEs.  Real estate investment vehicles that are UPEs. An entity owned by an excluded entity can also qualify as an excluded entity if it meets certain criteria relating to its ownership, assets and income.

The key operative rules cover the steps required to determine whether top-up tax is payable and where this would be paid. The first step is to determine the profit in a jurisdiction. This is calculated by simply adding together the GloBE income and GloBE losses of all the Constituent Entities in the jurisdiction. If the result is positive, the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) will need to be calculated for that jurisdiction. The only exceptions to this are when the jurisdiction qualifies for a GloBE safe harbour (in Chapter 8 of the Model Rules) or the de minimis exclusion (in Article 5.5 of the Model Rules). The latter will be when the average GloBE revenue (that is, gross income before expenses) and GloBE income (that is, net income) in the jurisdiction for the current and two prior years are below €10 million and €1 million respectively. The Effective Tax Rate This section explains the different components of the ETR calculation in Chapters 3 to 5 of the Model Rules. It sets out the main features of the rules and notes special rules that apply in particular circumstances. The ETR for a jurisdiction is the total tax divided by the total profit in that jurisdiction. There are detailed rules prescribing what taxes can be included in this calculation, which are referred to as ‘covered taxes’, and how to calculate the profit in the jurisdiction, which is referred to as ‘GloBE income’. In-scope MNEs must calculate their ETRs for each jurisdiction annually. Calculating the ETR for a jurisdiction broadly involves four steps:  First, the MNE must identify its constituent entities in the jurisdiction. The Model Rules set out how to work out which jurisdiction an entity is located in.  Second, the MNE must work out the ‘GloBE income’ or profit of each constituent entity in the jurisdiction. This starts with an entity’s accounting profit. Adjustments are then made to the accounting profit to reflect the agreed GloBE base. Some adjustments are mandatory, while others are elective. There are also rules for allocating profit between jurisdictions.  Third, the MNE must determine the covered taxes of the constituent entities in the jurisdiction. This requires consideration of the types of taxes that count as ‘covered taxes’ and which year those taxes are allocated to. The starting point for calculating covered taxes is the accounting current tax expense. Adjustments are then made to the current tax expense, including an adjustment based on deferred tax, to address timing differences between accounting and tax. There are also rules for allocating covered taxes between jurisdictions.

The total taxes are divided by the total net GloBE income to get the ETR for the jurisdiction. These steps are discussed in more detail below. Step 1: Identify the constituent entities in a jurisdiction The GloBE rules calculate the ETR for a jurisdiction as a whole. This ensures that an MNE with a high ETR in a jurisdiction does not become liable for a top-up tax because of an isolated low-tax entity whose low level of taxation could be a function of its relationship with other entities in the jurisdiction. Chapter 10 of the Model Rules determines where an entity is located. Most constituent entities will be located in the jurisdiction where they are tax resident. Where a constituent entity is not tax resident in a jurisdiction, it will be located in the jurisdiction where it was created, for example, where it was incorporated. Specific rules locate tax transparent entities, like partnerships and permanent establishments (PEs), for the ETR calculations and charging provisions. Step 2: Calculate the GloBE income for each constituent entity The starting point is the entity’s financial accounting profit. This is then subject to adjustments that IF countries agreed are desirable to reconcile the most important and common differences between accounting and tax definitions of profit. These adjustments are intended to bring the GloBE base more into line with a measure of taxable profit so that the ETR provides a reasonable measure of the level of effective taxation in that jurisdiction. There are also rules to appropriately allocate certain types of income between jurisdictions. Accounting profit The calculation of a constituent entity’s GloBE income starts from its financial accounting income. The general rule is that this income should be calculated according to the accounting standard of its UPE and therefore reflects the amount that feeds into the UPE’s consolidated financial statements before consolidation adjustments. This is subject to a requirement that the UPE prepares its accounts under an acceptable accounting standard, or that it adjusts any material differences in its accounting treatment of an item that could result in the MNE obtaining an unfair competitive advantage when compared with the IFRS treatment. NZ IFRS is an acceptable accounting standard for the GloBE rules. The Model Rules recognise there are situations when it may not be practicable to accurately calculate the entity’s accounting profit under the UPE’s accounting standard.

These adjustments generally reflect significant differences between accounting and tax measures of profit that do not reverse out over time. Separate rules address timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for accounting and tax, which are covered further below. Certain elective adjustments are also available to the MNE group. These include an election to o ffset a net realised gain on local tangible assets against a net realised loss on local tangible assets in the four preceding years and spread any remaining net realised gain equally over the current year and four preceding years. The election to spread back a net realised gain on local tangible assets should be useful in a jurisdiction, such as New Zealand, that does not tax some capital gains (though gains on sales of shares in companies more than 10 percent owned are already excluded from the GloBE base). The election will allow untaxed gains to be matched against prior year untaxed losses. It will also allow tax to be imposed at greater than the 15% rate in the spread-back years to reduce or eliminate any GloBE liability that would otherwise arise from the untaxed gain. Special rule for incentive tax credits A special rule prescribes the treatment of government incentives delivered as credits via the tax system. This rule is intended to apply to incentives to engage in certain activities, such as research and development. When an incentive tax credit is designed so that it must be paid in cash or cash equivalents within four years, it can be treated as GloBE income for the GloBE rules instead of as a reduction to covered taxes. New Zealand’s research and development tax credit is designed so that it must be partially refunded within four years. The portion that must be refunded within four years is the amount calculated under section LA 5(4B)(a) of the ITA and referred to as the ‘maximum limit of the person’s refundability cap’ for the year in which the associated research and development expenditure is incurred. Officials’ view is that under the Model Rules this amount can be treated as GloBE income and any remaining credit must be treated as a reduction to covered taxes (even if it gives rise to a tax reduction or other benefit within the four-year period). The mandatory adjustments and remaining elective adjustments are described in Chapter 3 of the Model Rules.

Special rules for Ultimate Parent Entities that are subject to a tax neutrality regime There are also special rules in Chapter 7 of the Model Rules for calculating the GloBE income of a UPE that is subject to a tax neutrality regime, that is, a regime that achieves a single level of taxation on business income. Article 7.2 applies to a UPE that is subject to a deductible distribution tax regime. This Article will be relevant to a New Zealand co-operative UPE. It allows such a UPE to reduce its GloBE income (but not below zero) by the amount that is distributed as a deductible dividend within 12 months of the end of a fiscal year if the dividend recipient is:  subject to tax on the dividend at a nominal rate that equals or exceeds 15% within 12 months of the end of the group’s fiscal year  a natural person who is a tax resident in the UPE country, or has a fixed establishment in the UPE country, and holds an ownership interest in the UPE of 5 percent or less, or  resident in the UPE country and is a governmental entity, international organisation, non-profit organisation or pension fund that is not a pension services entity. Allocating income between jurisdictions The GloBE rules are designed to ensure that MNEs pay tax at a rate of 15% on their profits in each jurisdiction (after taking into account a substance- based carve-out). This means tax imposed at a high rate on profits in one jurisdiction cannot be used to credit low-taxed profits in another jurisdiction. Consequently, allocating profits appropriately between jurisdictions is integral to the GloBE rules. The Model Rules achieve this through:  valuing cross-border intragroup transactions in accordance with the arm’s length principle, when this is different to the transfer price used for accounting  requiring financial accounting profits to be allocated between a PE and its head office entity based on the attribution of income and expenses to the PE for tax purposes (special allocation rules apply to PEs of entities subject to a worldwide tax system, such as New Zealand’s), and  allocating the income of a tax transparent constituent entity (when not attributable to a PE) to its owners to the extent the owners also treat the entity as tax transparent (that is, tax the income) or are not members of the MNE group.

This limitation reflects that the GloBE rules are intended to ensure a minimum level of tax is paid on the profit in each jurisdiction. It follows taxes should only be included in covered taxes when they are levied on a measure of income. This means corporate income taxes will generally be covered taxes. However, when an income tax is refundable or creditable to the beneficial owner of a dividend distributed by a constituent entity (for example, by way of imputation), it will only qualify as a covered tax if the credit is provided:  under a foreign tax credit regime by a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction that imposed the income tax  to a beneficial owner of the dividend that is subject to tax on the dividend, at a rate that equals or exceeds the minimum rate, in the jurisdiction that imposed the corporate income tax  to an individual beneficial owner of the dividend who is tax resident in the jurisdiction that imposed the income tax and who is subject to tax on the dividend, or  to a governmental entity, international organisation, resident non-profit organisation, resident pension fund, resident investment entity that is not a group entity, or a resident life insurance company to the extent the dividends are received in connection with a pension fund business and subject to tax in a similar manner as a dividend received by a pension fund. The Model Rules refer to an income tax that is charged under a qualifying imputation system as a Qualified Imputation Tax. New Zealand’s corporate income tax meets the definition of a Qualified Imputation Tax and is therefore a covered tax. Australia’s corporate income tax is similarly a covered tax. Withholding taxes and other taxes that are imposed in lieu of a corporate income tax are also covered taxes. Taxes on payroll or sales will not be counted. New Zealand’s goods and services tax is not a covered tax, as it is not charged on a measure of income. Calculating covered taxes for the relevant year Having established which taxes qualify, the next step is to determine the amount of those taxes in the relevant year. The Model Rules look first to the current tax expense recorded in the financial statements to determine the amount of covered taxes that have been paid.

An adjustment is also required when an amount of covered tax is refunded or credited to a group entity and the refund or credit is not treated as a reduction to the current tax expense in the financial accounts. An example of this in a New Zealand context is a tax credit for a supplementary dividend, which is typically accounted for directly in equity instead of as a reduction to the current tax expense. An adjustment would be required for GloBE purposes to reduce the current tax expense by the amount of this credit. The remaining adjustments are described in Chapter 4 of the Model Rules. Refundable tax credits As discussed above, the treatment of incentive tax credits in the Model Rules depends on their refundability. Tax credits designed in such a way that they must be refunded within four years are referred to as Qualified Refundable Tax Credits and are treated as GloBE income. Refundable tax credits that do not satisfy this refundability requirement are referred to as Non-Qualified Refundable Tax Credits and are treated as a reduction to covered taxes. This means an adjustment must be made to increase covered taxes when a Qualified Refundable Tax Credit is accounted for as a tax credit or to reduce covered taxes when a Non-Qualified Refundable Tax Credit is accounted for as income. Timing differences The Model Rules also include rules designed to address circumstances when the period in which profits are taxed is different to the period in which they are recognised in GloBE income. This difference typically arises from differences between when income and expenses are recognised for accounting and tax purposes. For example, capital assets are often depreciated at different rates. Without rules to address these differences, an MNE could suffer a top-up tax because it appears to be low-taxed, when in fact the income has been taxed in a different period from the one in which it has been recognised for the ETR calculation. While this deferral can be of significant benefit if it is long term, the Model Rules have been designed generally (but not always) so that timing benefits do not give rise to the imposition of tax. At least in part, this was to avoid the need to provide refunds of GloBE tax. The Model Rules address this issue using an approach based on deferred tax accounting. Deferred tax accounting is an accounting concept that seeks to match taxes to the period in which the income or expenses are recognised for accounting purposes. It does this by shifting the tax expense from the year the tax is paid to the years in which the income or expenditure is recognised in the financial statements.

Example 1: Timing differences A constituent entity accrues a current tax expense of $10 for fiscal year 1 and a deferred tax expense of $5 due to a temporary difference between accounting and tax. The deferred tax expense of $5 is added to the current tax expense of $10 to give $15 of covered taxes for Fiscal Year 1. The temporary difference reverses in Fiscal Year 2, resulting in an increase to the current expense for that year of $5 and a decrease to the deferred tax expense of $5, that is, the deferred tax liability of $5 unwinds. The decrease in the deferred tax expense in Fiscal Year 2 offsets the increase in the current tax expense. So, if there was a current tax expense for Fiscal Year 2 of $10, the decrease in the deferred tax expense in that year would be deducted from this to give covered taxes of $5. Recognising the deferred tax expense in each year effectively brings forward the $5 of tax relating to the temporary difference to the year when the deferred tax liability is first recognised (rather than the year when the tax is actually paid). Some modifications to an entity’s deferred tax accounting used in its financial statements ensure the outcomes are appropriate for the GloBE rules. Revaluing deferred taxes The Model Rules require the deferred tax expense for financial reporting purposes to be valued at the lower of the minimum rate and the applicable tax rate. This ensures there is no top-up for the timing difference when the local tax rate is above the minimum rate without enabling additional upfront credits for deferred tax liabilities to shelter other exempt income in that year. Example 2: Revaluing deferred taxes A constituent entity has a temporary difference between accounting and tax of $100 for the Fiscal Year due to immediately expensing an asset under the local tax rules where it is resident. The local tax rate is 28%. Therefore, the constituent entity recognises a deferred tax liability of $28 for accounting purposes, which increases the deferred tax expense by $28. This deferred tax expense must be recast to the minimum rate for GloBE purposes ($100 temporary difference x 15% = $15), which means covered taxes can only be increased by $15 due to deferred tax.

These include deferred tax movements for income or expenses excluded from GloBE income and deferred tax from uncertain tax positions. The recapture A recapture rule applies for deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) when a DTL has not unwound within five years of the Fiscal Year in which the DTL was originally recognised. Under this rule, the MNE group is required to recompute its ETR in the year the DTL was originally recognised. This ETR is recalculated without the DTL. If the revised ETR results in a top-up, this top-up is added to the top-up in the current year. Some types of timing difference are exempt from the recapture rule. These include those for:  Accelerated depreciation on tangible assets.  Fair value accounting.  Research and development expenses. These timing differences do not need to be recaptured even if it takes longer than five years for the DTL to unwind. Losses The timing difference rules also address tax losses. These rules are also based on deferred tax accounting, which means covered taxes are reduced (potentially to a negative number) in the year the local tax loss arises and a deferred tax asset (DTA) is recognised. Covered taxes are then increased in the year the loss is used and the DTA unwinds. This is done by taking account of the deferred tax expense accrued in the financial accounts, which could be a positive or negative figure. Example 3: Losses A constituent entity has a tax loss and GloBE loss of $100 in Fiscal Year 1. The local tax rate is 15% so the constituent entity recognises a loss deferred tax asset in this year of $15 ($100 tax loss x 15%). In Fiscal Year 2, the constituent entity earns $100 of net income for local tax purposes (before tax losses brought forward) and $100 of GloBE income. For accounting purposes, there is no current tax expense in Fiscal Year 2 because the tax loss brought forward of $100 reduces taxable income to zero, but a deferred tax expense of $15 is recognised because the loss deferred tax asset is written off when the tax loss is used. The deferred tax expense increases covered taxes by $15 in Fiscal Year 2. As a result, there would be no top-up tax in Fiscal Year 2 (or Fiscal Year 1).

For example, the DTA could be based on an economic loss that would also be recognised in the GloBE income or loss. These losses are recognised in the Model Rules to prevent top-up taxes being applied in a later (profit) year when the MNE has not made an economic profit over time. The loss could also be created by a timing difference between the accounts and the local tax system, in which case the accounting will recognise both a DTA and a DTL. However, the local tax loss could also be caused by certain features of that jurisdiction’s tax rules – for instance, if the jurisdiction exempted certain types of income from tax or provided tax deductions in excess of the cost incurred (‘super deductions’). These local tax concessions are not intended to be recognised in the GloBE base and should ordinarily reduce the ETR when there is net GloBE income in the jurisdiction. However, without further rules, they would be incorporated in the GloBE base if they produced a local tax loss and the related DTA could be used for GloBE purposes. Consequently, a special rule identifies the amount of loss relief that would have been available in the jurisdiction if the DTA was based on the GloBE base rather than the local tax rules. Any excess losses are deemed to be losses arising from permanent differences and give rise to an additional top-up for that year under Article 4.1.5 of the Model Rules. This ensures that MNEs receive appropriate relief in the GloBE rules for economic losses and for those created through timing differences, while preventing excessive relief when the loss arises from a permanent difference. Example 4: Losses and permanent differences An MNE has one constituent entity in a jurisdiction that has a tax rate of 15%. This constituent entity has a GloBE loss for the fiscal year of $100 but a local tax loss of $200 because $100 of income earned is exempt for local tax purposes. The constituent entity recognises a DTA of $30 ($200 tax loss x 15% tax rate) in the fiscal year. Absent an adjustment, this DTA would increase covered taxes by $30 for GloBE purposes (when the tax loss is used in the future), sheltering $200 of GloBE income. This would not be appropriate because the constituent entity has only suffered an economic loss of $100. The Model Rules address this issue by charging additional top- up tax of $15 in the fiscal year (that is, in the year there is $100 of exempt income for local tax purposes). Where additional top-up tax arises under Article 4.1.5, an MNE can elect to apply the Carry- forward of Excess Negative Tax Expense administrative procedure. Under this procedure, the MNE avoids the immediate cash impost by carrying forward the Excess Negative Tax Date: May 2023 29 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Expenses to future periods. Further guidance on this procedure is available in the Agreed Administrative Guidance. An election also allows an MNE to create a DTA for the GloBE rules based on the GloBE loss in the jurisdiction multiplied by the minimum rate. This may be useful for MNEs with operations in zero tax countries, where the MNE would get no benefit under a system based on deferred tax. Assigning taxes to a jurisdiction As with the rules allocating income between jurisdictions, the Model Rules contain similar rules allocating certain covered taxes. These generally seek to assign the tax to the jurisdiction to which the income is allocated so that all the taxes paid on this income are taken into account. For example, taxes paid by a (head office) entity on the profits of its permanent establishments are assigned to the jurisdiction where the permanent establishment is located. Similarly, controlled foreign company ( CFC) charges are ‘pushed down’ to the CFC so that the tax and income are aligned. There are similar rules to assign taxes for transparent entities, hybrid entities and reverse hybrids. There is a limit on the extent to which CFC tax charges and taxes on hybrid entities can be pushed down when the tax is charged for passive income. In these cases, the tax can only be pushed down to achieve the minimum rate on that income. Any tax that is not pushed down is included in the covered tax calculation for the owner that was subject to the tax charge. Withholding taxes are generally assigned to the constituent entity that recognises the income in its financial accounts rather than the entity that deducts the tax on payment. An exception exists for withholding taxes on dividends paid to other constituent entities, and this also applies to net basis taxes on dividend income. Both these taxes are assigned to the entity that paid the taxable distribution. The logic is that these taxes can be seen as an additional tax on the profit of the distributing entity. Step 4: Calculate the ETR Finally, the ETR for a jurisdiction is calculated by dividing the total covered taxes for a jurisdiction (the aggregate of covered taxes in Step 3 for each constituent entity) by the total GloBE income in that jurisdiction (the aggregate of the GloBE income or loss in Step 2 for each constituent entity). Example 5: The ETR calculation An MNE has two constituent entities in Jurisdiction A. Constituent Entity 1 has covered taxes of $6 million and GloBE income of $80 million for the current fiscal year, and Date: May 2023 30 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Constituent Entity 2 has covered taxes of $4 million and GloBE income of $20 million. The MNE’s ETR for Jurisdiction A is 10% (covered taxes of $10 million/GloBE income of $100 million). On a standalone basis, Constituent Entity 1’s ETR is 7.5% ($6 million/$80 million) and Constituent Entity 2’s ETR is 20% ($4 million/$2 0 million). Constituent Entity 1’s low ETR is due to tax concessions in Jurisdiction A that apply to its business activity. The GloBE rules permit outcomes within a jurisdiction to be blended, which means Constituent Entity 2’s excess taxes (that is, taxes in excess of 15%) are used to increase the ETR for Jurisdiction A. When an MNE has GloBE income and negative covered taxes (that is, prima facie, a negative ETR), the Carry-forward of Excess Negative Tax Expense administrative procedure must be applied. Under this procedure, the MNE must ca rry forward the Excess Negative Tax Expenses to future periods, resulting in an ETR for the current year of 0%. Further guidance on this procedure is available in the Agreed Administrative Guidance. Further special rules for calculating ETRs Special rules exist for calculating the ETR of stateless entities, joint ventures and minority- owned constituent entities. Calculating the top-up tax When the ETR in a country is below the 15% minimum rate, the next step is to determine how much top-up tax is owed for each entity in the country. To do this, MNEs must work out the top-up tax percentage, which is the difference between the minimum rate and the ETR in the jurisdiction. That top-up tax percentage is applied to the MNE’s GloBE income in the jurisdiction, after deducting a substance-based income exclusion, to calculate the jurisdictional top-up tax. Finally, the jurisdictional top-up tax is allocated between the constituent entities located in the jurisdiction. This section explains these rules for calculating the top-up tax and allocating it between low tax constituent entities. They are in Chapter 5 of the Model Rules. The steps There are several steps in the top-up tax calculation in the Model Rules:  Compute the top-up tax percentage.  Calculate the substance-based income exclusion.  Deduct the substance-based income exclusion from the net GloBE income in the jurisdiction to determine the excess income.

These steps are explained in more detail in the remainder of this section. Compute the top-up tax percentage The top-up tax percentage must be calculated when the ETR is below the 15% minimum rate. It is calculated simply by subtracting the ETR from the minimum rate and represents the additional tax rate that needs to be charged on the low-taxed profits to bring the tax on those profits up to the minimum. Example 6: The top-up tax percentage Assume the same facts as in example 5 above. The MNE has two constituent entities in Jurisdiction A and its ETR for Jurisdiction A is 10% (covered taxes of $10 million / GloBE income of $100 million). The top-up tax percentage for Jurisdiction A is calculated by subtracting the ETR of 10% from the GloBE tax rate of 15%. This results in a top-up tax percentage for Jurisdiction A of 5%. Calculate the substance-based income exclusion The top-up tax percentage is applied to the net GloBE income in the jurisdiction that exceeds the substance-based income exclusion. This approach ensures the substance-based income exclusion does not inappropriately increase the ETR in the jurisdiction. The substance-based income exclusion is a formulaic carve-out that excludes a reasonable return to the level of substance in the jurisdiction from top-up tax. This is based on a percentage of the MNE’s payroll costs and tangible assets in the jurisdiction, on the grounds that employment costs and tangible assets tend to be relatively immobile factors of production and are therefore reasonable proxies for substantive economic activities. The percentage The substance-based income exclusion, or “carve-out”, will be 5 percent of the carrying value of the payroll costs and tangible assets in the jurisdiction. An increased amount applies in the transition period, which begins on 1 January 2023 and lasts for 10 years.

The carve-out for tangible assets is 8 percent in the fir st year, and then it is reduced by 0.2 percent per year for the next five fiscal years and 0.4 percent per year for the remaining four fiscal years. Payroll costs The payroll carve-out for a jurisdiction is based on payroll costs for a constituent entity located in the jurisdiction for employees and independent contractors that perform activities for the MNE in that jurisdiction. For this purpose, independent contractors include only natural persons and may include natural persons who are employed by a staffing or employment company but whose daily activities are performed under the direction and control of the MNE. Independent contractors do not include employees of a corporate contractor providing goods or services to constituent entities in the jurisdiction. The payroll costs include employee benefits that provide a direct personal benefit to the employee, like health insurance and pension contributions, as well as wages and salary costs. Payroll taxes and social security contributions borne by the employer are also included. Tangible assets The tangible asset carve-out is based on the average of the opening and closing carrying value (net of accumulated depreciation) of tangible assets in the financial statements. The tangible assets that qualify include property, plant and equipment, natural resources (including land not held for sale, lease or investment), as well as licences for the use of immovable property or exploitation of natural resources. The asset must be located in the jurisdiction of the constituent entity that owns it. Assets that are leased also qualify for the lessee, which provides consistency between owned and leased assets. Where an asset is leased from another group member, the asset will only be included in the jurisdiction of the lessee. Special rules to determine how the carve-out is allocated for permanent establishments and for transparent entities are included in Article 5.3.6 and Article 7.4.6 respectively.

Constituent Entity 1’s payroll costs for activities performed in Jurisdiction A is $30 million for the current fiscal year, and its tangible assets located in Jurisdiction A have an average accounting carrying value for the current fiscal year of $170 million. Constituent Entity 2 has no payroll costs or tangible assets. The substance-based income exclusion for Jurisdiction A is calculated as follows\* ((payroll costs of $30 million x 5 percent) + (tangible assets of $170 million x 5 percent)) = $10 million. Therefore $10 million would be deducted from the MNE’s GloBE income for Jurisdiction A when calculating the income subject to top-up tax. \* Assume the carve-out percentages have reduced to 5 percent in the year of the example. Compute the top-up tax in the jurisdiction The top-up tax for the jurisdiction is calculated by deducting the substance-based income exclusion from the net GloBE income in the jurisdiction and then multiplying the result by the top-up tax percentage. Example 8: Computing the top-up tax Assuming the same facts as in example 7 above, the MNE’s top-up tax for Jurisdiction A for the current fiscal year equals $4.5 million: (net GloBE income of $100 million – the substance-based income exclusion of $10 million) x the top-up tax percentage of 5% If an adjustment is made that results in a decrease to the liability for covered taxes in a prior year (for example, when a tax return is reassessed resulting in a reduction to the tax liability for a prior year), the GloBE rules require the ETR in the earlier year to be recalculated unless the decrease is less than €1 million, in which case it can be included in the current year. This includes when the recapture rule is applied to deferred tax liabilities that have not unwound within five years. When these recalculations result in an ETR falling below the minimum rate, the additional top-up tax for that year is added to the current year’s top-up tax and charged in the current fiscal year.

Constituent Entity 2’s Jurisdiction A income tax return for a prior year has been reassessed, resulting in a reduction in its local tax liability for that prior year of $1.2 million but no change in its GloBE income for that year. The Jurisdiction A ETR and top-up tax is recalculated for this prior year resulting in additional GloBE top-up tax for the year of $1 million.\* This additional top-up tax of $1 million is added to the $4.5 million top-up tax for the current fiscal year, resulting in total top-up tax for the current fiscal year of $5.5 million. The GloBE return for the prior fiscal year is not reassessed. \* The reduction in the prior year local tax liability doesn’t result in a Dollar-for-Dollar increase in top-up tax because of the impact of the substance-based income exclusion in the prior year. Allocation of a jurisdiction’s top-up tax to constituent entities The final step in calculating the top-up tax is to allocate the jurisdictional top-up tax to the individual constituent entities in the low tax jurisdiction. This paves the way for the final step in the GloBE tax process, which is for the tax allocated to the low tax entities to then be allocated under Article 2 of the Model Rules to the entities required to pay tax under the IIR and UTPR. This allocation between the low-taxed constituent entities is necessary to deal with situations when some of the top-up tax is charged to an entity that is not the UPE. For example, if the UPE is not subject to a qualified IIR, the top-up tax may be collected through a combination of the IIR applied at different levels of the group structure, the UTPR (as described in the next section) and the QDMTT. Allocating the top-up tax to individual constituent entities ensures the different charging rules can be coordinated. It is also necessary because the IIR is intended to collect top-up tax from a parent entity based on its interest in a low-taxed constituent entity. This means that where a parent applying the IIR does not wholly own a low-taxed constituent entity, it will only bear the cost of its proportional share of top-up tax. Allocating top-up tax to low-taxed constituent entities is an important step in achieving this outcome. The GloBE rules generally allocate the top-up tax for a jurisdiction between the constituent entities located in the jurisdiction based on their proportion of the jurisdictional GloBE income.

Constituent Entity 1 is allocated $4.4 million ((Constituent Entity 1 GloBE income of $80 million / jurisdictional GloBE income of $100 million) x top-up tax of $5.5 million). Constituent Entity 2 is allocated $1.1 million ((Constituent Entity 2 GloBE income of $20 million / jurisdictional GloBE income of $100 million) x top-up tax of $5.5 million). Special rules deal with situations when top-up taxes are payable and there is no GloBE income in the jurisdiction, for example, when all the top-up tax for the year relates to a recalculation of the ETR from an earlier year. Imposition of top-up tax As outlined above, the IIR and the UTPR both allocate the liability to pay top-up tax on foreign constituent entities between the MNE’s entities. The QDMTT (Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax) can be contrasted with the IIR and UTPR, as a QDMTT applies exclusively to domestic constituent entities. The IIR and the UTPR are designed to work together and are also coordinated to ensure the right amount of top-up tax is collected when multiple IIRs or UTPRs are applied at the same time in different jurisdictions. Therefore, both rules start from the same top-up tax calculation explained above, which allocates top-up tax amongst constituent entities in a low tax jurisdiction. This part of the Guidance Material sets out the ordering rules that prescribe how the QDMTT, IIR and UTPR operate together and how top-up tax is imposed on an MNE’s entities. The rules are in Chapter 2 of the Model Rules. QDMTT If the country where the income is earned has enacted a QDMTT, the top-up tax will be paid first to that country. A QDMTT is a minimum tax implemented and administered in a way that is consistent with the outcomes provided for under the GloBE Rules and Commentary such that it increases the MNE group’s domestic liability on domestic excess profits to the minimum rate. The definition also prohibits the provision of benefits to the MNE group related to the GloBE rules.

In some situations, imposing the whole amount of the jurisdictional top-up tax under a QDMTT will result in a greater tax charge than the tax charge that would otherwise have been imposed under the IIR, as the IIR takes into account minority ownership interests. A QDMTT excludes from the covered tax calculation:  taxes paid or incurred by a constituent entity owner under a CFC tax regime allocable to a domestic constituent entity, and  taxes paid or incurred by a main entity allocable to a permanent establishment located in the jurisdiction. This means taxes paid under the New Zealand CFC regime or by New Zealand h ead offices for their permanent establishments will not be creditable against a foreign QDMTT. However, taxes paid under a foreign QDMTT will give rise to a foreign tax credit in New Zealand under subparts LJ and LK of the Income Tax Act 2007. IIR ordering rules The IIR takes the top-up tax calculated for a low-taxed constituent entity (LTCE) and then imposes this tax on a parent entity in the LTCE’s group. When a parent applies the IIR, the amount of top-up tax it is charged is based on the amount of top-up tax calculated for the relevant LTCE multiplied by the parent’s allocable share of the LTCE’s income. The allocable share is a measure of the parent’s rights to the profit of the LTCE and is calculated based on accounting principles. The test works by determining the proportion of the LTCE’s GloBE income attributable to the parent (that is, after adjustment for interests held by other owners). The top-down approach There will often be MNE structures where more than one group entity has an interest in the LTCE. The GloBE rules establish:  which entities in the group apply the IIR, and  if more than one group entity applies the IIR for the same LTCE, what adjustments are made to avoid over-taxation. Which entities apply the IIR The GloBE rules include a priority order for applying the IIR.

This means the UPE jurisdiction will usually have the first right to charge the top-up tax for low tax jurisdictions (other than the UPE jurisdiction itself, unless it is in a country that has adopted a domestic IIR). If the UPE is not subject to a qualified IIR, intermediate parent entities located in other jurisdictions and held directly by it (second tier entities) will apply the IIR to LTCEs in other jurisdictions to the extent of their direct and indirect interest in those LTCEs. To the extent that the above steps do not result in the imposition of the full amount of top- up tax calculated under chapter 5 of the GloBE rules, third tier intermediate parent entities may have an IIR liability, and so on. Intermediate parent entities are entities that are controlled by the UPE and have an ownership interest in the LTCE, but investment entities are excluded. Unless the split ownership rules apply (see below), an intermediate parent entity (lower IPE) will not apply its IIR if:  the UPE is subject to a qualified IIR, 7 or  another intermediate parent entity (higher IPE) that owns, directly or indirectly, a ‘controlling interest’ 8 in the lower IPE is subject to a qualified IIR. If the higher IPE does not have a controlling interest in the lower IPE, the lower IPE’s IIR will not be switched off. As explained below, the lower IPE will charge its IIR, but the higher IPE must reduce its share of the top-up tax by the tax charged by the lower IPE. Adjustments if more than one group entity applies the IIR If more than one parent entity in a group applies the IIR for an LTCE, parent entities applying the IIR must reduce their own top-up tax liability by any top-up tax allocated to a parent entity further down the group structure. This prevents double allocation of the same top-up tax amount. 7 The exception to this is when there is a partially owned parent entity (POPE) lower down the group structure. A POPE is a parent entity where at least 20% of its shares are held by minority shareholders. 8 ‘Controlling interest’ is defined in the GloBE rules. Broadly, the GloBE definition means an ownership interest such that the parent is required to consolidate the subsidiary’s financials on a line-by -line basis in accordance with an acceptable financial accounting standard (or would have been required to, had it prepared consolidated financial statements). It does not mean an ownership interest over 50%.

The LTCE is 100 percent directly owned by Parent B. Parent A owns 20 percent of Parent B – it does not have a controlling interest. Both Parent A and Parent B are in jurisdictions with a qualified IIR. The UPE of the group is not in a jurisdiction with a qualified IIR. Since Parent A does not have a controlling interest in Parent B, both parents apply the IIR. However, since Parent B’s IIR will charge the full $100 of top-up tax, Parent A’s share of the top-up tax is reduced from $20 to nil. The full amount of top-up tax is charged to Parent B under the IIR. Exception: the split ownership rules The split ownership rules are an exception to the IIR’s general top-down approach. Under the GloBE rules, an intermediate parent entity that is more than 20 percent owned by minority investors outside the MNE group is called a partially owned parent entity (POPE). The POPE definition is satisfied even if minority investors indirectly own more than 20 percent of the ownership interests in the parent entity. A parent entity owned by a POPE will therefore usually also be a POPE. POPEs have priority rights to apply the IIR, notwithstanding the general top-down approach. The reason for this is that when there are substantial minority interests, some amount of the top-up tax would not be collected at all if the IIR were only applied by parent entities higher up the ownership structure. Example 12: Partially owned parent entities (POPEs) The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through A Co. The UPE owns 60 percent of A Co, and A Co owns 100 percent of the LTCE. Under the GloBE rules, A Co (and not the UPE) would apply the IIR and pay $100 of top-up tax. By charging all the top-up tax to A Co, the top-up tax is effectively borne 60 percent by the UPE and 40 percent by the minority shareholders. If this were not the case and only the UPE applied the IIR, the UPE would only be charged $60 of the top-up tax based on its allocable share. The remaining $40 would not be collected under either the UTPR or the IIR.

Example 13: POPE rules and corresponding tax reductions The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through a chain of POPEs. The UPE directly owns 75 percent of POPE A, with the remaining 25 percent held by minority investors outside the MNE group. POPE A directly owns POPE B (ownership percentage varies under the two examples below). POPE B directly owns 100 percent of the LTCE. POPE A owns 100 percent of POPE B If POPE B is 100 percent owned by POPE A, POPE A would apply the IIR and be charged $100 of top-up tax. POPE B would not be required to apply the IIR. UPE POPE A POPE B LT CE 100% Top-up tax = $100 75% ownership (25% minority owned) 100% POPE A owns 90 percent of POPE B, with the remaining 10 percent owned by outside investors If POPE B is only 90 percent owned by POPE A, both POPEs would apply the IIR. POPE B would be charged $100 of top-up tax. POPE A would also apply the IIR, but its top-up tax liability would be reduced to zero by the amount of tax charged to POPE B. As noted above, if a parent entity further down the group structure has applied the IIR, the liability of any parent further up the group applying the IIR must be reduced. The amount of the reduction is the top-up tax paid by the lower parent under an IIR multiplied by the higher parent’s ownership interests in the low-taxed entity held indirectly through that lower parent.

Example 14: Reduction for top-up tax charged to lower parent The amount of top-up tax calculated for an MNE’s LTCE is $100. The UPE indirectly owns the LTCE through a POPE Assume the POPE directly owns 100 percent of the LTCE, and the UPE directly owns 60 percent of the POPE, with the remaining 40 percent held by minority investors outside the group. UPE POPE LT CE Top-up tax = $100 60% ownership (40% minority owned) 100% Both the UPE and the POPE apply the IIR:  The POPE’s allocable share of the top-up tax is $100.  The UPE’s allocable share is initially $60, but this is reduced by the top-up tax paid by the POPE multiplied by the UPE’s ownership interest in the LTCE held indirectly through the POPE. This reduction equals $60 ($100 x 60% = $60), meaning the UPE has zero allocable share. This is appropriate because the top- up tax has already been fully charged to the POPE. The UPE owns the LTCE both directly and indirectly through a POPE Assume the POPE owns 50 percent of the LTCE, and the UPE owns the other 50 percent. As above, the UPE also directly owns 60 percent of the POPE with the remaining 40 percent held by minority investors outside the group.

The UPE reduces its top-up tax liability by $30 to $50, as the $30 from its indirect interest through the POPE has already been charged to the POPE.  The result is that the full $100 of top-up tax is collected. The UTPR Like the IIR, the UTPR allocates top-up tax. The UTPR primarily functions as a backstop to the IIR. 9 It aims to ensure that top-up tax for an LTCE is paid even if its parent entities are located in jurisdictions without a qualified IIR. This eliminates the incentive for an MNE to headquarter in a country without an IIR. As the UTPR is a backstop, the GloBE rules give the IIR priority over the UTPR in charging tax on low-taxed profits outside of the UPE jurisdiction. The UTPR therefore does not apply when all the interests in the LTCE are held by parent entities subject to a qualified IIR. The UTPR applies if some of the interests in an LTCE are not held by parent entities that are subject to a qualified IIR. However, any top-up tax collected under the UTPR is reduced by the amount that is charged under an IIR. This ensures the IIR takes priority. 9 It also ensures that any LTCEs in the UPE’s jurisdiction are subject to top-up taxation.

The MNE’s UPE indirectly owns 100 percent of the LTCE through two companies – A Co (which owns 60 percent) and B Co (which owns 40 percent). A Co is in a jurisdiction with a qualified IIR. B Co and the UPE are not. Applying the IIR, A Co’s allocable share of the top-up tax is $60. The remaining $40 of top-up tax is allocated to the MNE’s constituent entities under the UTPR. How the UTPR allocates top-up tax to different jurisdictions Unlike the IIR, which allocates top-up tax to entities by allocable share or ownership, the UTPR allocates top-up tax to jurisdictions based on where the group’s tangible assets and employees are located. The UTPR uses an allocation key to allocate the top-up tax between the different jurisdictions in which the MNE has constituent entities. The top-up tax is only allocated to jurisdictions that have implemented a qualified UTPR (a ‘UTPR jurisdiction’). The allocation is calculated at a jurisdictional level. The top-up tax is allocated based on the proportion of the tangible assets and number of employees in each UTPR jurisdiction. There are equal weights for the asset and employee factors. Example 16: UTPR allocation An MNE consists of one company in Jurisdiction P with permanent establishments in Jurisdictions A, B, C, D and E. The value of tangible assets and number of employees owned by the MNE located in each jurisdiction are:  Jurisdiction A: $400 million tangible assets, 500 employees  Jurisdiction B: $400 million tangible assets, 300 employees  Jurisdiction C: $100 million tangible assets, 200 employees  Jurisdiction D: $100 million tangible assets, no employees  Jurisdiction E: No tangible assets or employees. The MNE’s total value of tangible assets in all UTPR jurisdictions is $1 billion, and the total number of employees in all UTPR jurisdictions is 1,000.

Jurisdictions A, B, C, D and E have all adopted the GloBE rules and implemented the UTPR. The PE in Jurisdiction A is low tax, having a top-up tax amount under Article 5 of $100,000. The share of Jurisdiction A’s top-up tax allocated to Jurisdictions A, B, C and D under the UTPR is calculated as follows:  Jurisdiction A: 50% x (400m/1b) + 50% x (500/1,000) = 45%  Jurisdiction B: 50% x (400m/1b) + 50% x (300/1,000) = 35%  Jurisdiction C: 50% x (100m/1b) + 50% x (200/1,000) = 15%  Jurisdiction D: 50% x (100m/1b) + 50% x 0 = 5%  Jurisdiction E will not be allocated any top-up tax, even though it is a UTPR jurisdiction, as it has no tangible assets or employees. The data for this allocation can be taken from the MNE’s Country-by-Country report, provided the report is prepared in accordance with the GloBE rules’ definitions for Number of Employees and Tangible Assets. This will minimise the additional compliance burdens on MNEs and improve coordination by basing the calculation on existing, readily available and objective data.

The transitional Country-by-Country (CbC) Report safe harbour is designed as a short-term measure that would effectively exclude an MNE’s operations in certain lower-risk jurisdictions from the scope of the GloBE rules in the initial years. The safe harbour would allow an MNE to avoid undertaking full GloBE calculations in a jurisdiction where it can demonstrate, using a Qualified CbC Report and Qualified Financial Statement, that it meets one of the following tests. De minimis test The de minimis test applies where the MNE group reports total revenue of less than €10 million and profit (loss) before income tax of less than €1 million in the jurisdiction in its Qualified CbC Report for the fiscal year. A Qualified CbC Report is a CbC Report prepared and filed using Qualified Financial Statements. Qualified Financial Statements include:  the accounts used to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the UPE, or  financial statements of each constituent entity, provided they are prepared in accordance with either an acceptable financial accounting standard or, in some cases, an authorised financial accounting standard. 10 OECD, 2022, Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief: Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (Pillar Two), available at www.oecd.org Date: May 2023 45 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Simplified ETR test The simplified ETR test applies where the MNE group has a simplified ETR that is equal to or greater than the transition rate in the jurisdiction for the fiscal year. The simplified ETR is calculated by dividing the jurisdiction’s simplified covered taxes by its profit (loss) before income tax as reported on the MNE group’s Qualified CbC Report. The simplified covered taxes is a jurisdiction’s income tax expense as reported on the MNE group’s Qualified Financial Statements, after eliminating any taxes that are not covered taxes and uncertain tax positions reported in the MNE group’s Qualified CbC Report. The transition rate is 15% for fiscal years beginning in 2023 or 2024, 16% for fiscal years beginning in 2025 and 17% for those beginning in 2026. Routine profits test The routine profits test applies where the MNE group’s profit (loss) before income tax in the jurisdiction under the CbC Report is equal to or less than the substance-based income exclusion amount for constituent entities located in that jurisdiction, as calculated under the GloBE rules. Note: the routine profits test uses revenue and profit (loss) before income tax from an MNE’s Qualified CbC Report, but MNEs would be required to perform a full substance-based income exclusion calculation to meet the routine profits test. Rules for using the transitional safe harbour If an MNE group has not applied the transitional CbC Report safe harbour in a jurisdiction in a fiscal year in which the MNE group is subject to the GloBE Rules, the MNE group cannot qualify for this safe harbour for the jurisdiction in a subsequent year. This is the “once out, always out” rule. An MNE that qualifies for the transitional CbC Report safe harbour on a jurisdictional basis is still subject to the GloBE Rules and the safe harbour does not discharge the MNE group from complying with group-wide requirements. For example, an MNE group would still need to prepare and file its GloBE Information Return during the transitional period. Special rules apply to certain entities and groups, including UPEs subject to deductible dividend regimes. If the conditions of the transitional CbC Report safe harbour are not met, then the general rules apply, and any potential liability to top-up tax must be computed under the ordinary GloBE Rules.

Some of these rules apply to all MNEs as they address transition issues arising because the GloBE rules are new. Other transitional rules apply to entities and groups when they first come within the scope of the GloBE rules (for example, through organic growth or a merger), even if that occurs after the GloBE rules have been in place for some time. An MNE’s transition year is determined on a jurisdictional basis. For a jurisdiction, the first fiscal year that the MNE comes within the scope of the GloBE rules is a “transition year” unless the MNE qualifies for a transitional safe harbour, in which case it would be the first fis cal year in which the relevant tested jurisdiction no longer qualifies for or applies the transitional safe harbour. An MNE may therefore have different transition years for different jurisdictions. The transitional rules described in this chapter of the Model Rules:  Allow higher percentages to be used in calculating the substance-based income exclusion in the first 10 years of the GloBE rules.  Allow for a longer filing deadline in an MNE’s transition year.  Address the treatment of losses and other timing differences.  Provide temporary relief from the UTPR for MNEs in the initial phase of international activity. Substance-based income exclusion As described above, the percentages used in the substance-based income exclusion are higher for the first 10 years of the GloBE rules. Longer filing deadline in transition year An MNE is normally required to file its GloBE return and other notifications within 15 months after the end of its accounting period. In an MNE’s transition year, this deadline is extended to 18 months. Losses and timing differences Once an MNE becomes subject to the GloBE rules, it will have to calculate its ETR in each jurisdiction where it operates. Losses and accounting-tax timing differences may occur before an MNE’s transition year that affect its ETR calculation in its transition year and later years. For example, if an MNE’s pre-transition year losses were not taken into account at all, the MNE could have an inappropriately low ETR in a year when those losses are used to reduce local taxable income.

This is done by taking into account existing deferred tax accounting attributes (including deferred tax assets from earlier losses) in the ETR calculation described in Chapter 5. Consistent with that treatment, the amount of deferred tax assets (DTA) recorded for the purpose of Article 9.1.1 shall be equal to the DTA accrued in the financial accounts if the tax rate used to determine the DTA is below the minimum rate. In any other case, such DTA shall be determined in accordance with the following formula: Deferred tax assets reflected in the financial accounts Applicable domestic tax rate The applicable domestic tax rate is the tax rate in the fiscal year preceding the transition year. More detail is available on this in the Agreed Administrative Guidance. The treatment of losses under the GloBE rules is described on page 15 and in Chapter 5 of the Model Rules. Deferred tax assets generated after 30 November 2021 from items that are excluded from the GloBE base must be disregarded for GloBE purposes. In addition, the GloBE tax basis in assets acquired in an intragroup transaction after 30 November 2021 must be based on historical carrying values, and related deferred tax assets and liabilities must similarly be determined based on historical carrying values. This is to prevent inappropriate tax planning transactions. MNEs in the initial phase of international activity There is temporary relief from the UTPR for MNEs in the initial phase of international activity. An MNE is in its “initial phase of international activity” if it has constituent entities in no more than six jurisdictions and has less than €50 million of tangible assets (by book value) outside of the jurisdiction in which it has the most tangible assets (again, by book value). The relief applies on an annual basis. Because it does not apply for the IIR, this relief is only relevant for groups that are headquartered in a country that does not have an IIR, and even then, the relief will be somewhat undercut if the group has a lower tier parent company in a country with an IIR. The temporary relief expires after the MNE has been within the scope of the GloBE rules for five years. This five-year period is not suspended if, for example, the MNE’s revenues decline so that it falls outside the scope of the rules during those five years.

Its consolidated annual revenues for the following four fiscal years are as follows:  2031: €780 million  2032: €600 million  2033: €640 million  2034: €720 million As explained above, the GloBE rules apply to MNEs that have consolidated annual revenues of at least €750 million in at least two of the last four fiscal years. The first year in which the GloBE rules apply to NewGroup is therefore 2032. Assuming NewGroup meets the other requirements for the initial phase relief from the UTPR, it will qualify for the relief in 2032, and the last year for which it can obtain the relief is the 2036 year. It does not matter that NewGroup’s annual revenues fell below the €750 million threshold from 2032 to 2034. Chapter 10: Definitions Chapter 10 of the Model Rules sets out the key definitions and the rules for determining where an entity is located for applying the key operative rules. Consequential amendments to the ITA Foreign tax credit rules Proposed new section LJ 3 would work in conjunction with section LJ 1(1) to provide that GloBE top-up tax paid under the IIR or UTPR would not be creditable for non-GloBE income tax purposes. This is because the top-up tax is determined after taking into account income tax imposed on the income attributable to a country, whether that tax is imposed by the country itself or another country (for example, under a worldwide or CFC tax regime). Similarly, proposed new section DB 1(1)(cb) would deny a deduction for these taxes. Foreign tax credits would be available for GloBE top-up tax paid under a QDMTT. This credit would be available against a New Zealand CFC tax liability and a head-office tax liability for a New Zealand MNE’s permanent establishments.

This is because the Model Rules state that if the payment of GloBE top-up tax under a country’s IIR or UTPR gives rise to a benefit, the IIR or UTPR will not be qualifying, and other participating countries will continue to apply top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under their UTPR. A payment of tax under a country’s DIIR that gives rise to an imputation credit will not result in a DIIR being non-qualifying. Schedule to the ITA adapting the OECD Model Rules to New Zealand tax law New Zealand’s Domestic Income Inclusion Rule (DIIR) The GloBE rules contemplate that countries may introduce a DIIR, which would use the same tax base as the GloBE rules but would apply to domestic LTCEs on domestic untaxed profits. Proposed Article 2.1.7 will be included in schedule 25B to introduce a New Zealand DIIR that would be imposed on New Zealand-headquartered in-scope MNEs. For these MNEs, top-up tax on undertaxed New Zealand profits would ordinarily be collected under a UTPR (including New Zealand’s). The UTPR allocation mechanism (based on tangible assets and number of employees in each UTPR country) means that, in many cases, much of this tax would be allocated to New Zealand, but this would depend on the level of overseas assets and employees. A DIIR would avoid New Zealand-headquartered MNEs having to pay any part of the GloBE top-up tax on undertaxed New Zealand income to other countries under the UTPR. There would also be no additional tax cost for these taxpayers, just a change in the country they paid the tax to. This is unlike a QDMTT. If a New Zealand UPE has a direct subsidiary that is low taxed when there is also a minority interest, the DIIR will only apply to the portion of the low-tax profits attributable to the New Zealand MNE’s ownership. Under a QDMTT, the top-up tax would need to be paid on the basis of 100% ownership. Proposed Article 2.1.8 will also be included to provide for initial phase relief, that is, if an MNE group is headquartered in New Zealand, a DIIR would not apply to it during the initial phase under the transitional rules in Chapter 9. That is because any undertaxed New Zealand profits would not be subject to any other country’s UTPR or IIR during the period.

For the UTPR, this charge would be capped by reference to taxable deductions and available tax losses for the fiscal year to meet the “equivalent adjustment” requirements in the Model Rules. However, it would be capped by the total deductions and available tax losses claimed by all New Zealand constituent entities. When the UTPR liability exceeds these amounts, it would be carried forward to the next fiscal year. The UTPR top-up tax liability would be a joint and several liability of all New Zealand entities in an MNE group.

As the Multinational Top-Up Tax is an “ancillary tax” under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), it does not fall within the scope of income tax. This means a specific administration regime is required, which nevertheless generally follows income tax procedures. Its features include:  All in-scope MNEs must register with Inland Revenue within six months of the end of the first income year they are in-scope of the Applied GloBE rules.  New Zealand-headquartered in-scope MNEs must submit a GloBE Information Return (GIR) to Inland Revenue in the prescribed electronic format. A GIR may also need to be submitted to Inland Revenue by in-scope MNEs that are headquartered in a foreign country.  All in-scope MNEs must file an annual top-up tax return. This is a separate tax return that will state the amount of Multinational Top-Up Tax payable. The first top-up tax return would be due to Inland Revenue two months after the GIR is due (in subsequent years, this will be one month).  In-scope MNEs must pay Multinational Top-Up Tax to the Commissioner by the due date. The due date is the same as the due date for the annual top-up tax return. The proposed amendments also introduce new penalties for late registration and incomplete and/or late filing of the GIR. The GloBE rules are closely linked to the Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting rules – in particular, the same taxpayers are in scope and the GloBE transitional safe harbours rely on CbC Reports. As a result, proposed amendments would require CbC Reports to be submitted in the required electronic format, and new penalties would be introduced for incomplete and/or late filing. This Guidance Material also provides a summary of the Transitional Safe Harbours published by the OECD in December 2022. 11 11 OECD (2022), Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief: Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (Pillar Two), available at www.oecd.org Date: May 2023 52 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Background Chapter 8 of the Model Rules provides for a coordinated and standardised approach to reporting that is designed to reduce the compliance burden for in-scope MNEs and facilitate the effective administration of the GloBE rules. It also provides for the design of safe harbours that deem a GloBE top-up tax liability for a jurisdiction to be zero when the conditions provided under the GloBE Implementation Framework are met for the relevant fiscal year. The Model Rules place an obligation on each constituent entity to file a GIR. The GIR will need to be provided in a global standardised format, which will be developed during 2023 as part of the GloBE Implementation Framework. The GIR provides information on the tax calculations made by an MNE group and contains the information a tax administration needs to evaluate the correctness of a constituent entity’s self-assessed GloBE tax liability and to perform an appropriate risk assessment. A constituent entity’s obligation to file a GIR will be relieved if its ultimate parent entity, or a designated filing entity in the group, files the GIR with a tax administration, and the Competent Authority in the filing jurisdiction has an agreement in effect to automatically exchange the GIR with the Competent Authority of the jurisdiction of the constituent entity. Chapter 9 of the Model Rules provides transitional timeframes for filing the GIR. For the first year an in-scope MNE has a GIR filing obligation, its GIR will be due 18 months after the end of its fiscal year instead of 15 months. Local tax return filing and penalty rules are left to the determination of the implementing jurisdiction. In New Zealand, the compliance regime for the GIR and the Multinational Top- Up Tax return are in the TAA. The GloBE Implementation Framework includes the provision of safe harbours. Permanent safe harbours are still being designed. However, transitional safe harbours have been published that apply for fiscal years beginning on or before 31 December 2026 but not including a fiscal year that ends after 30 June 2028. These safe harbours provide transitional relief for MNE groups in the initial years during which the GloBE rules come into effect. Key features The key features of the proposed amendments are:  All in-scope MNEs must register with Inland Revenue within six months of the end of the first income year they are in-scope of the Applied GloBE rules.  New Zealand-headquartered MNEs are required to submit a GIR to Inland Revenue.

Detailed analysis Registration Proposed new section 78H provides that MNEs would be required to notify Inland Revenue that they are within the scope of the GloBE rules. It is proposed that MNEs will be given six months from the end of the first fiscal year they are in scope of the rules to complete this registration. This process would apply to both New Zealand-headquartered MNEs and foreign MNEs with constituent entities located in New Zealand (including branches). As part of this registration process, MNEs would inform Inland Revenue of the identity and location of the entity that would be filing the GIR. This will provide Inland Revenue with notice of where the GIR will be received from (whether that is directly or through information exchange channels) and a point of contact if the forms are not received for some reason. If MNEs cease to be in scope of the Applied GloBE rules, they must notify the Commissioner within six months of the end of the first fiscal year that the rules do not apply. The GloBE information return Proposed new section 78I of the TAA provides that a constituent entity located in New Zealand must provide to the Commissioner, in the prescribed electronic format, the information set out in Articles 8.1.4(a) to (d) of the Model Rules (that is, the GIR). This does not apply where the GIR is submitted on time by the ultimate parent entity (UPE) of the constituent entity, or a designated filing entity of the constituent entity’s MNE group, to a foreign competent authority that is obliged to exchange that information with the Commissioner. However, where the UPE is located in New Zealand, the GIR must be filed locally. Foreign-headquartered MNEs proposing to file the GIR in another country must notify the Commissioner about this.

The Multinational Top-Up T ax return would include a constituent entity’s self- assessment of any top-up tax in a form prescribed by the Commissioner. The due date for the Multinational Top-Up Tax return would be one month after the GIR due date. This would allow foreign groups to arrange filing of the Multinational Top-Up Tax return. In the first year, this would be extended to two months. Paying the tax As the Multinational Top-Up Tax liability would be a separate tax type, payment of the tax would be due separately from any income tax liability of the MNE and would have its own payment date. Payment of Multinational Top-Up Tax would be due on the same day that the Multinational Top-Up Tax return is due with Inland Revenue. Payments under the GloBE rules would not be subject to provisional tax. The standard rules in Parts 7 (Interest) and 9 (Penalties) of the TAA would apply to GloBE payments that are paid after the due date. Example 18: Reporting dates World is my Oyster Limited (WOL) is the New Zealand-resident UPE of an MNE that produces specialist oyster fishing equipment. It has operations in 15 countries and meets the requirements to be subject to the GloBE rules. WOL has a June balance date, and the first fiscal year it will be required to report under the GloBE rules will be the year ended 30 June 2025. WOL has a New Zealand tax agent and an extension of time to file its New Zealand income tax return. WOL’s reporting and payment dates for the initial 30 June 2025 year will be as follows:  New Zealand income tax return – due 31 March 2026.  GloBE information return – due 31 December 2026 (18 months after balance date – normally this will be due 15 months after balance date on 30 September).  New Zealand Multinational Top-Up Tax return and payment – due 28 February 2027 (20 months after balance date – normally this will be due 16 months after balance date on 31 October).

New penalties The Model Rules provide that penalties or sanctions for non-compliance with the GIR be set by implementing jurisdictions. These should be commensurate with penalties or sanctions in respect of other information return filing obligations in the jurisdiction (for example, section 139AB of the TAA in New Zealand). Late and/or incomplete GloBE Information Return For information to be exchanged with other tax authorities on a timely basis, it is important that Inland Revenue receives a complete GloBE Information Return (GIR) on time and in the correct format. This will give time for the information to be checked before it is provided to other jurisdictions. Documents not filed electronically in the XML format would not be treated as filed for this purpose. Proposed new section 139ABB provides for a penalty for failing to comply with the GIR requirements under proposed new section 78I. The penalty will apply to:  New Zealand-headquartered MNEs.  Foreign-headquartered MNEs with operations in New Zealand that do not file a GIR in a country with which New Zealand has an exchange of information agreement.  MNEs that do not file their GIR on time in their UPE or designated filing entity country. The amount of the penalty would be an amount specified by the Commissioner that would not exceed $100,000. Late and/or incomplete New Zealand Multinational Top-Up Tax Return Proposed new section 139ABB also provides for a penalty if a constituent entity fails to comply with the requirement to provide an annual Multinational Top-Up Tax return to the Commissioner under proposed new section 78J.

Proposed new section 139AAB would introduce a penalty for a large multinational group with a New Zealand resident ultimate owner that fails to comply with the requirements under section 78G. The amount of the penalty would be an amount specified by the Commissioner that would not exceed $100,000. Late registration Under proposed new section 78H of the TAA, New Zealand-headquartered and foreign- headquartered MNEs will be required to notify Inland Revenue that they are in scope of the Applied GloBE rules within six months from the end of the first fiscal year they are in scope of the rules. If the MNE fails to comply with the requirements of proposed new section 78H of the TAA, the taxpayer would be liable to pay a penalty under proposed new section 139ABB for an amount specified by the Commissioner that would not exceed $100,000. Shortfall penalties: Unacceptable tax position The Inclusive Framework has agreed transitional penalty relief that reflects a common understanding amongst implementing jurisdictions in relation to shortfall penalties to provide MNEs with a “soft landing” during the initial years in which the rules are being introduced. The common understanding on shortfall penalties means no penalties or sanctions should apply in connection with the filing of a GIR during a transition period when a tax administration considers that an MNE has taken “reasonable measures” to ensure the correct application of the Model Rules. A tax administration may consider that an MNE has taken reasonable measures when the MNE can demonstrate it has acted in good faith to understand and comply with the relevant domestic application of the GloBE rules and the Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax. Inland Revenue will administer the Multinational Top-Up Tax rules on this basis. Consequently, during the transition period, the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in section 141B of the TAA will not apply to Multinational Top-Up Tax. Proposed changes to section 141B would result in this shortfall penalty applying to Multinational Top-Up Tax for fiscal years starting on or after 1 January 2027. All other shortfall penalties would apply from commencement.

It also proposes special rules to buttress that rate and help prevent over-taxing estates (which are taxed as trusts) and trusts settled for disabled people (disabled beneficiary trusts). Current law Unless otherwise specified, the focus of this chapter of the Bill Commentary is on complying trusts. The annual income of a trust is taxed as it is derived, either to the trustees or to the beneficiaries of the trust. Trustees of a trust are treated as a single taxable unit and their trustee income is calculated separately from their personal income. 12 Beneficiary income Beneficiary income is all income earned by a trust in an income year that is paid or allocated to the beneficiaries before the trust has filed its tax return. 13 Income does not need to be paid to a beneficiary to be beneficiary income; the income can be allocated to a beneficiary. Provided the trustees cannot change their mind about the allocation (that is, the income is vested absolutely in the beneficiary), the income is considered beneficiary income and is taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rate unless it is subject to the minor beneficiary rule. The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived by a minor (a New Zealand resident natural person under 16 years old) from property settled on a trust by a relative or legal guardian, or an associated person of the relative or legal guardian. If the total beneficiary income derived by the minor is greater than $1,000 in an income year, the income is taxed at the trustee tax rate to prevent parents, other relatives, or guardians from splitting their income with children. 14 12 Sections HC 2 and YA 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 13 Section HC 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 Sections HC 35 to HC 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Income allocated to a beneficiary that is credited to the beneficiary’s current account The income is available to be called upon at any time by the beneficiary, although in practice it is usually paid to the beneficiary at the discretion of the trustee or settlor. Allocated amounts are available in a bank account for the beneficiary to draw upon at any time. Income that is allocated to a beneficiary for them to possess at a future date or event (future possession beneficiary income) This could include where income is allocated to a beneficiary for them to possess when they reach a certain age. Provided the income will go to the beneficiary’s estate if the beneficiary dies before the future date or event, the income is considered beneficiary income in the year it is derived by the trust and is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. Unlike beneficiary income credited to a beneficiary’s current account, future possession beneficiary income is not available to be called upon by the beneficiary until they become entitled to possess the income (either once the future date or event has occurred or when the income goes to their estate on their death). Allocated amounts are held in a bank account the beneficiary cannot access until they reach the age of 21. Trustee income Trustee income is all taxable income derived by a trust in an income year that is not beneficiary income. 15 Trustee income is taxed at a flat rate of 33%. Once income has been taxed as trustee income, subsequent distributions of that income to the beneficiaries are tax free. That is, trustee income is subject to a final tax imposed in the year the income is derived by the trust. 15 Section HC 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Distributions of any amounts other than beneficiary income, including corpus, capital gains, or trustee income from prior years, are exempt from tax to the receiving beneficiary. 17 Social policy implications unchanged Under existing law, distributions of beneficiary or trustee income to a beneficiary of a trust are generally considered income for social policy purposes. 18 As a result, if Government support is means-tested (such as the Working for Families tax credit) or is otherwise calculated by reference to a person’s income (such as child support and student loan obligations), distributions of trust income can impact upon that Government support. Beneficiary income is generally considered “income” for social policy purposes in the year the income is allocated to the beneficiary, which is the year in which that income is derived by the trust. On the other hand, trustee income is normally only taken into account once it has been distributed to the beneficiary, which could be some time after the income was first derived (and tax was paid) on the income. The Bill does not propose to change when distributions from trusts are considered income for social policy purposes. Background and policy rationale The trustee tax rate of 33% has been in place since 1989 and was intentionally chosen to align with the (then) top personal tax rate. In 2020, a new top personal tax rate of 39% for income over $180,000 was introduced. The trustee tax rate was not increased at that time. Since the trustee tax rate is a final tax, it is possible for individuals to obtain a tax advantage by earning income through a trust, thus circumventing the 39% top personal tax rate. Previous rate misalignment resulted in behavioural change From 2000 to 2010, the top personal tax rate was 39%, which was higher than the trustee tax rate. During this period, significant amounts of income were diverted into trusts and taxed as trustee income. Much of the growth of trustee income was in the form of dividends.

Figure 1: Income reported on trust tax returns 1997-2021 After the top personal tax rate was reduced to 33% in 2010, there was no longer misalignment between the trustee tax rate and the top personal tax rate. This meant there was no longer a tax advantage in passing dividends through trusts, although existing structures often remained in place. From 2022, the top personal tax rate has again been higher than the trustee tax rate. In advance of this taking effect, there were larger than usual dividend flows in the 2020–21 income year, resulting in a spike in trustee income. Policy rationale for addressing misalignment Aligning the trustee and top personal tax rates at 39% would help ensure that trusts cannot be used to circumvent the top personal tax rate. This would improve the fairness and progressivity of the tax system, protect the revenue base from erosion, and improve the Government’s ability to raise revenue. This will also help achieve one of the Government’s long-term revenue objectives, which is to “ensure a progressive taxation system that is fair, balanced and promotes the long-term sustainability of the economy, consistent with the debt and operating balance objectives”. 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 18,000 1997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021 $m Income year Dividend IncomeBeneficiary IncomeTrustee Income Date: May 2023 65 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Proposals to address under-taxation To ensure trusts cannot be used to circumvent the top 39% personal tax rate, the Bill proposes to align the trustee tax rate and top personal tax rate at 39% for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). To buttress that rate, beneficiary income derived by certain companies would be taxed as trustee income. This integrity rule is targeted towards family trusts and would not affect the commercial use of trusts in large corporate groups. Proposals to mitigate over-taxation In making the proposed changes, it is important to balance preventing high-income earners circumventing the top 39% tax rate with not over-taxing trusts with lower-rate beneficiaries. Trusts with lower-rate beneficiaries would be able to continue to use existing rules to mitigate over-taxation, as outlined above. The Bill also proposes targeted measures to help prevent the over-taxation of trusts in certain situations, such as deceased estates and disabled beneficiary trusts. Current law provides for lower-rate settlors and beneficiaries to mitigate over-taxation. Income of a trust can be taxed at a beneficiary’s personal tax rate if the income is paid or allocated to the beneficiary as “beneficiary income”, but this may not always be feasible. To help address this, two sets of special rules are proposed:  Deceased estates: When a deceased person’s affairs are still being settled, an estate (which is taxed as a trust) may be unable to allocate income to beneficiaries. The proposed special rules for estates would allow income received by an estate to be taxed as though it were the deceased’s income for 12 months after the deceased’s date of death.  Disabled beneficiary trusts: Special rules are also proposed for certain trusts settled for disabled people. These rules would allow trustee income to be taxed as though it were the disabled beneficiary’s income, as beneficiary income is currently taxed, even though the income would still retain its character as trustee income. While the rate applied to trustee income of estates or trusts settled for disabled people may differ to the rate applied to other trustee income, the income would still retain its character as trustee income.

Effective date The proposed amendment would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background Due to the trustee tax rate being lower than the top personal tax rate, and trustee income being subject to a final tax in the year it is derived (and not subject to tax when it is eventually distributed to a beneficiary, if it is), trusts can be used to shelter income from higher personal tax rates. If a trust has a 39% tax rate beneficiary (who could also be a settlor), income may be accumulated in the trust and taxed at the 33% trustee tax rate. T here is then no further tax when the tax-paid trustee income is later distributed to the beneficiary. Detailed analysis Addressing under-taxation of trustee income Increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% to align with the top personal tax rate will ensure that trusts cannot be used to shelter income from the top personal tax rate. Example 19: Sheltering income from the 39% personal tax rate Amena has personal income of $180,000 per annum and is a beneficiary of a trust. 33% trustee tax rate In the 2023–24 income year, $50,000 has been retained in the trust as trustee income (with a tax liability of $16,500 at the 33% trustee tax rate). In the following year, the tax-paid trustee income ($50,000 less $16,500 tax = $33,500) is distributed to Amena. This distribution is not subject to tax.

Beneficiary income allocations may therefore be used to mitigate over-taxation that could arise from the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Example 20: Mitigating over-taxation Amy (an air traffic controller) and Anthony (a builder with his own company) have settled some income-generating assets on a discretionary family trust for the benefit of themselves, their children (both minors under the age of 16) and future grandchildren. Amy, Anthony and their accountant are the trustees. 2024–25 income year Anthony has personal income of $70,000 and Amy has personal income of $180,000. Their trust has income of $40,000. If the income is retained as trustee income, it will be taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Any income allocated to their children as beneficiary income will also be taxed at 39% under the minor beneficiary rule. However, by allocating the income to Anthony as beneficiary income, it can be taxed at his personal tax rate. To meet the definition of beneficiary income, the trustees cannot change their mind about the allocation, so he has an absolute right to withdraw the has only been subject to a 33% tax rate, and Amena does not need to pay the 6% difference between the 33% trustee tax rate and the 39% personal tax rate, despite earning over $180,000. If the $50,000 income was earned directly by Amena as personal income, the tax liability would be $19,500. 39% trustee tax rate The amendment to increase the trustee tax rate to 39% is proposed to apply for the 2024–25 and later income years. In the 2024–25 income year, $50,000 has again been retained in the trust as trustee income (with a tax liability of $19,500 at the 39% trustee tax rate). Amena no longer receives a tax advantage from earning income through the trust.

If Anthony does not want to withdraw the money, it can be credited to his current account, available to be called upon at any time. 19 2025–26 income year Bary, the older of Amy and Anthony’s children, has turned 16, so he is no longer a minor. Bary has no personal income. Anthony again has personal income of $70,000, and Amy has personal income of $180,000, while the trust has income of $50,000. Since Bary is no longer a minor, he is not subject to the minor beneficiary rule. Income can be allocated to Bary as beneficiary income and taxed at his personal tax rate (for example, up to $14,000 at 10.5%, over $14,000 and up to $48,000 at 17.5%). If the trustees do not want to distribute this income to Bary, it can be credited to his current account, available to be called upon at any time, or a sub-trust arrangement can be set up so that Bary’s interest in a portion of the trust assets is recognised and protected. 19 The previous version of this commentary included an example of Anthony settling the beneficiary income back on the trust. This has been removed as there is some uncertainty under existing law about the tax treatment of such a settlement. This matter will be subject to further consultation.

Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background A company can be a beneficiary of a trust. Beneficiary income paid to a corporate beneficiary is taxed at 28%. The real beneficiary of such an allocation of income is the ultimate natural person shareholder in the company. The beneficiary income allocation should be taxed at the marginal tax rate of that person or persons. There is no reason for taxing the income earned by a trust and allocated to a company in the same way as income earned directly by the company. If the shareholder of the corporate beneficiary is the trust that is making the allocation, the income allocation achieves nothing. The income effectively remains within the trust. The principal, or in many cases the only, effect of the allocation is to ensure that the income is taxed at 28% rather than the trustee tax rate. While a subsequent distribution of the income by the company to the trust will be taxable as a dividend (with imputation credits attached), such a distribution may never be made. Detailed analysis To buttress the 39% trustee tax rate, amendments are proposed to ensure that beneficiary income derived by corporate beneficiaries is treated as trustee income for the purposes of determining the rate of tax that applies, who pays the relevant tax, and who provides the return of income, if: Date: May 2023 70 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  the company is a “close company” (that is, five or fewer natural persons or trustees hold more than 50% of the voting interests in the company, when treating associated persons as one person)  the company is not a Māori authority or a tax charity 20 , and  a settlor of the trust has “natural love and affection” for a direct or indirect shareholder of the company under sections YC 2 to YC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). Proposed new section HC 38 of the ITA would ensure that trustees cannot allocate beneficiary income to such companies to circumvent a 39% trustee tax rate. Natural love and affection “Natural love and affection” is an existing concept in tax law. It is used to describe the motive of a person for an action driven not by a promise of something in return, but by the natural love and affection the person has for another. Natural love and affection is generally considered to exist between relatives, whether by blood, marriage, a non-spousal domestic relationship, or adoption. It can be present between close friends as well, although not ordinary acquaintances or colleagues. Limiting this rule to close companies where a settlor of the trust has natural love and affection for a (direct or indirect) shareholder of the company will help ensure that the proposal is targeted towards family trusts and would not affect the commercial use of trusts in large corporate groups. Mitigating over-taxation of trust income Taxing beneficiary income derived by certain close companies as trustee income will prevent the under-taxation that would otherwise arise if the income were taxed at the corporate tax rate. This should not give rise to over-taxation. A family trust will not make a beneficiary income allocation to a corporate beneficiary unless the company is owned by one or more of the other beneficiaries (or the trust itself). If one or more of those shareholder beneficiaries is on a lower personal tax rate, the trustees can allocate the income directly to that person as beneficiary income to mitigate over-taxation. If the corporate beneficiary has a real need for funds, either the shareholder beneficiary, or the trust on their behalf, can invest the money in the company, either by way of debt or some form of capital contribution. 20 “Tax charity” is defined in section CW 41(5) of the ITA and includes charitable entities registered under the Charities Act 2005.

This treatment would mirror the existing provision in section LE 4 of the ITA for income subject to the minor beneficiary rule in sections HC 35 to 37 of the ITA. Example 21: Sheltering income in a corporate beneficiary Meriope is the beneficiary of a trust. She has a personal tax rate of 39%. The trust has derived $100 of income (this is (1) in the diagram). To prevent the $100 being taxed at the 39% rate, the trustees of the trust allocate the income to a corporate beneficiary as beneficiary income (this is (2a)). The income is taxed at the 28% corporate tax rate. The trust then loans $100 to Meriope (this is (2b)). The $100 is not taxable income of Meriope. Overall, only $28 of tax has been paid on the income. However, $39 of tax should have been paid, since the $100 has actually gone to Meriope, a 39% tax rate individual (via the loan from the trust). Under the proposed amendments, the $100 allocated to the company would be taxed at the 39% trustee tax rate. $39 of tax would be paid on the income.

Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background Deceased estates are taxed as trusts, which means income they derive is taxed at the trustee tax rate to the extent it is not beneficiary income. 21 Income derived by some deceased estates is already over-taxed at the current 33% trustee tax rate when the deceased person (when alive) and/or the beneficiaries of the deceased estate are on lower tax rates. Any over-taxation already present at the 33% rate would be exacerbated by the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. As noted in the Overview section, most trusts can use existing rules to pay or allocate income as beneficiary income to mitigate over-taxation. This is because beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rates. However, deceased estates cannot use beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation if the beneficiaries of the deceased estate are not yet known, which may be the case for larger or more complex deceased estates. Trustee income of a deceased estate would not be over-taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate if the deceased was on the 39% personal tax rate and/or the deceased estate’s beneficiaries are on the 39% rate. 21 For more information on the taxation of estates, refer to IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax from \[9.25\].

The Bill proposes applying the following formula in section HC 8B(2) to calculate the rate of tax that applies to trustee income subject to the modification: (combined tax – pre-death tax) ÷ post-death income Combined tax is the total amount of tax that would be payable for an income year, applying the personal income tax scale, if the following amounts were combined and then taxed under the personal income tax scale:  trustee income derived by the trustees of the estate within 12 months after the deceased person’s date of death, and  the personal income that the deceased person derived before their death in that income year. Pre-death tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the income of the deceased person in the income year. This amount would be zero in the income year following a person’s death. Post-death income is the total of amount of trustee income derived by the trustee of the deceased estate in the income year and within 12 months of the deceased person’s date of death. Applying the proposed formula in section HC 8B(2) means that, effectively, income derived by the trustee of a deceased estate that chooses to apply the modification would be taxed as follows:  In the income year in which the person died, income derived by the trustee of the deceased estate would be taxed at the deceased’s marginal tax rate(s).  In the following income year, income derived by the trustee of the deceased estate within 12 months of the person’s death would be taxed under the personal income tax scale. Apart from the rate of tax, the income would remain trustee income for all other purposes and would continue to be returned by the trustee of the deceased estate as trustee income. Any income derived by the trustee of the deceased estate after this 12-month period would be taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate.

In the two income years after Petunia’s death, the trustee of her deceased estate derives the following amounts of trustee income:  2024–25 income year: $30,000.  2025–26 income year (within 12 months of death): $10,000.  2025–26 income year (more than 12 months after death): $10,000. The trustee decides to apply the deceased estates modification in proposed new section HC 8B (the application of the individual components of the formula is covered in more detail in the further examples below). Income year Trustee income Does the modification apply? Income tax liability 2024–25 $30,000 Yes $11,020 2025–26 (within 12 months of death) $10,000 Yes $1,050 2025–26 (more than 12 months after death) $10,000 No $3,900 In the 2024–25 income year, the net outcome is the same as if the trustee income had been earned by the deceased directly while they were alive. The trustee has an income tax liability of $11,020 for this income. The trustee income derived in the 2025–26 income year, but within 12 months of Petunia’s death, has an income tax liability of $1,050. This is the amount of tax that would have been payable had Petunia been alive and received this income directly in the 2025–26 income year. The remaining trustee income derived in the 2025–26 income year, but more than 12 months after Petunia’s death, is taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate because the modification only applies to income derived by the trustee within 12 months of Petunia’s date of death.

If they do not, trustee income would be taxed under ordinary rules at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Modification applies to trustee income derived within 12 months of death (section HC 8B(1)) The modification would only apply to trustee income derived by a trustee of a deceased estate within 12 months of the deceased person’s date of death. This helps ensure that income derived by a trustee of a deceased estate is not over-taxed while the affairs of the deceased person are being worked through, particularly when the trustee is still determining who the beneficiaries of the deceased estate are (so beneficiary income allocations cannot yet be made). The proposed modification would apply for a limited time so that it does not incentivise trustees to retain income rather than distributing amounts to the beneficiaries of the estate. Modification taxes income using personal income tax rates (section HC 8B(2)) If a trustee of a deceased estate chooses to apply the modification, trustee income derived within 12 months of the deceased person’s death would be taxed at the rate calculated using the formula in proposed new section HC 8B(2): (combined tax – pre-death tax) ÷ post-death income Combined tax (section HC 8B(2) and (3)(a)) “Combined tax” is defined as the total tax calculated under schedule 1, part A, clause 1, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) (that is, applying the personal tax scale) for each dollar of taxable income derived in the income year by the deceased person or the trustee within 12 months of the person’s date of death.

Example 26: Calculating the basic tax rate on trustee income (continuation of previous example) The basic tax rate that applies to trustee income subject to the deceased estates modification is: (combined tax – pre-death tax) ÷ post-death income The relevant amounts for Petunia’s deceased estate are: Income year Combined tax Pre-death tax Post-death income 2024–25 $20,620 $11,020 $30,000 2025–26 $1,050 $0 $10,000 Applying the formula, the basic tax rate in the 2024–25 income year is 32% (($20,620 - $11,020) ÷ $30,000). The basic tax rate in the 2025–26 income year for trustee income derived within 12 months of Petunia’s death is 10.5% (($1,050 - $0) ÷ $10,000). The further $10,000 derived in the 2025–26 income year and more than 12 months after Petunia’s death is not subject to the modification. It is therefore taxed at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate.

Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background To ensure the proposed 39% trustee tax rate does not result in over-taxation for trusts settled for disabled people, a modification is proposed for these trusts. Special regimes for disability trusts are a common feature of overseas regimes (such as in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US). Key features To help ensure the proposed 39% trustee tax rate does not result in over-taxation, proposed new section HC 39 would enable trustee income derived by a trust settled for a disabled person (disabled beneficiary trust) to be taxed at the disabled beneficiary’s personal tax rate if the trust meets certain criteria. Table 3: Qualifying criteria for disabled beneficiary trust Qualifying criteria Further explanation Trust must have only one beneficiary, ignoring any residual beneficiaries. The disabled beneficiary must be the only person to whom distributions can be made, unless the disabled beneficiary has died and distributions are made on the dissolution of the trust. The trust deed must not allow any further beneficiaries, apart from residual beneficiaries, to be added.

A disabled beneficiary is a person who, for some, or all, of the income year, receives the supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity or had the child disability allowance paid. Trustee income of a disabled beneficiary trust would be taxed at the disabled beneficiary’s personal tax rate. This is achieved through applying the formula in proposed new section HC 39(2): (combined tax − tax on beneficiary’s income) ÷ trustee income Combined tax is the total amount of tax that would be payable if the trustee income were combined with the income derived by the disabled beneficiary in the income year, applying the personal income tax scale. Tax on beneficiary’s income is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the income derived by the disabled beneficiary in the income year (for example, tax on the supported living payment or child disability allowance, and employment or investment income). Trustee income is the total amount of trustee income derived by the trustee of the disabled beneficiary trust in the income year. Trustee income subject to the disabled beneficiary trust modification would remain trustee income for all other purposes. This means tax paid on the income would continue to be a final tax, with no further tax payable when funds are later distributed to the disabled beneficiary (or to another person, if the disabled beneficiary dies and funds are later distributed to residual beneficiaries on the dissolution of the trust). A trust may qualify for the disabled beneficiary trust modification in an income year, then cease to qualify for the modification in a subsequent income year (for example, because the disabled beneficiary ceases to receive the supported living payment in that year), and then requalify for the modification in a later income year. However, if a trust ceases to qualify for the modification because further beneficiaries are added to the trust (whether in replacement of, or supplementary to, the disabled beneficiary), the trust cannot qualify for the modification again in a later income year. This is to ensure that only the disabled beneficiary can benefit from the modification. If other beneficiaries were added to the trust, they might receive distributions of tax-paid trustee income that had been taxed at the disabled beneficiary’s personal tax rate, which would be inappropriate.

At current payment rates for a single person aged 18 years or over, Matilda receives $21,440 of taxable income each year. Matilda’s parents are retired and want to ensure Matilda will continue to receive a similar level of care once they have passed away. They decide to settle property on a disabled beneficiary trust for Matilda. They arrange for Matilda’s siblings, their lawyer, and their accountant to be trustees of the trust. Matilda is the only beneficiary of the trust. The trust satisfies the requirements of the disabled beneficiary trust modification for the 2024–25 income year. The trustees of the trust derive $50,000 of trustee income in the 2024–25 income year. Applying the formula in proposed new section HC 39(2) achieves the same net outcome as if the trustee income had been earned directly by Matilda. A 23% tax rate applies to the trustee income. This is because after taking into account the income Matilda receives because of the supported living payment, the trustee income is taxed at a combination of the 17.5%, 30% and 33% personal tax rates. Type of income Amount of income Tax rate Income tax liability Matilda’s personal income $21,440 13% (combination of the 10.5% and 17.5% rates) $2,772 Trustee income $50,000 23% (combination of the 17.5%, 30% and 33% rates) $11,723 The application of the individual components of the formula in section HC 39(2) is covered in more detail in the further examples below. Despite a different rate applying, the income to which the modification applies is still considered trustee income. The obligation to return and pay tax on the trustee income lies with the trustees of the trust. When the trustee income is later distributed to Matilda, no further tax will be payable.

The trust deed names Matilda’s siblings as residual beneficiaries of the trust, so when the trust is dissolved upon Matilda’s death, any remaining property in the trust is distributed to her siblings. When it is dissolved, the trust has $200,000 of trustee income that was taxed at Matilda’s personal rate in previous income years. When that income is distributed to Matilda’s siblings, no further tax is payable because tax paid on trustee income is a final tax. It does not matter if Matilda’s siblings are on different personal tax rates. Any other income derived between Matilda’s date of death and the date the trust is wound up is distributed to her siblings, the residual beneficiaries, as beneficiary income. This income is taxed as though it were her siblings’ personal income (in accordance with existing rules regarding the taxation of beneficiary income). Detailed analysis Definition of “disabled beneficiary trust” (section HC 39(4)) The Bill proposes defining “disabled beneficiary trust” to mean a trust with one beneficiary who, during each income year for which the modification applies, meets the definition of “disabled beneficiary” (proposed section HC 39(4)(a)). In addition, during each income year for which the modification applies, as well as all subsequent income years (regardless of whether the modification applies), the beneficiary:  must be the only person entitled to receive distributions from the trust (unless the distributions are made when the trust is dissolved and the disabled beneficiary has died) (proposed section HC 39(4)(b)(i) and (ii)), and  cannot be replaced, or supplemented, as the beneficiary of the trust (proposed section HC 39(4)(b)(iii)). Beneficiary must be “disabled beneficiary” (section HC 39(4)(a) and (5)) For a trust to qualify for the modification, the beneficiary of the trust would need to satisfy the definition of “disabled beneficiary” in proposed new section HC 39(5). This means the beneficiary must receive either of two Government support payments: the supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity, or the child disability allowance.

Supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity The supported living payment may be made to people who meet certain criteria, including disabled people. One ground for receipt of the supported living payment is “restricted work capacity”. This is essentially where a significant health condition, injury or disability is expected to impact upon a person’s ability to work for a period, or the person’s condition is terminal. People aged under 16 cannot receive the supported living payment but may receive the child disability allowance instead. Child disability allowance The child disability allowance is generally paid to the main carer of a child with a serious disability who is under 18 years of age. To qualify, the child must be a dependent child and must have a disability that requires constant care and attention, either permanently or for a period exceeding 12 months. The allowance is not means tested. However, it cannot be paid concurrently with the supported living payment (even though a person over 16 and under 18 could qualify for either the child disability allowance or the supported living payment). The existing exclusion for disabled minors from the minor beneficiary rule is also tied to receipt of the child disability allowance. Basing eligibility for the proposed modification on a minor beneficiary’s receipt of the child disability allowance is therefore consistent with the existing exclusion for disabled minors from the minor beneficiary rule. Support payments can be made for some, or all, of the relevant income year To qualify, a beneficiary would be required to have received either the supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity or the child disability allowance for at least part of the relevant income year. This means a trust settled for the care of a person who becomes disabled and commences receiving Government support part way through an income year could qualify for the modification for that year.

After the accident, Sam’s mum (his main carer) receives the child disability allowance. Sam’s accident occurred in December 2024, and his mum starts receiving the child disability allowance soon after. Sam’s grandparents decide to settle property on a trust for Sam so that there are extra funds available to help pay for his ongoing care. The trust meets the eligibility criteria for the modification. Some income derived by the trust is applied for Sam’s benefit, so it is considered (and taxed as) beneficiary income. The minor beneficiary rule does not apply because Sam qualifies for the exclusion for disabled minors. Therefore, Sam’s beneficiary income is taxed at his personal tax rate. The trust’s remaining income is retained as trustee income. The trustee income is also taxed at Sam’s personal tax rate because the modification applies. Trust must have only one beneficiary (ignoring residual beneficiaries) (section HC 39(4)) The modification would only apply to trusts with one beneficiary (ignoring any residual beneficiaries). Limiting this proposal to trusts with only one beneficiary minimises complexity by avoiding the need for rules regarding how trustee income should be taxed or apportioned if a trust has multiple beneficiaries. Further beneficiaries cannot be added (section HC 39(4)(b)(iii)) To ensure the requirement that disabled beneficiary trusts only have one beneficiary is adhered to, further beneficiaries (except residual beneficiaries) cannot be added to the trust once the modification begins to apply to a trust. Example 29: Trust not eligible because further beneficiaries can be added Charlie and Violet settle property on a trust for their son, Danny, who has a serious disability. The child disability allowance is paid for Danny for the income year. While Danny is the sole beneficiary of the trust, the trust deed allows further beneficiaries to be added. As a result, the modification would not apply.

Once a disabled beneficiary has passed away, no restrictions apply to whom the trust property can be distributed to. This means it would not matter if the residual beneficiaries were not disabled and/or were on higher personal tax rates. Example 30: Trust deed only allows residual beneficiaries to be added Same facts as example 29, except the trust deed only allows residual beneficiaries to be added to the trust. The deed specifies that any residual beneficiaries of the trust are only to receive trust property after Danny’s death. The trust would qualify for the disability trust modification. Modification taxes trustee income at the marginal rate(s) of the beneficiary (section HC 39(2) and (3)) Proposed new section HC 39(2) provides a formula for determining the tax rate that applies to trustee income derived by the trustee of a disabled beneficiary trust. (combined tax − tax on beneficiary’s income) ÷ trustee income Combined tax (section HC 39(2) and (3)(a)) “Combined tax” is defined as the total tax calculated under schedule 1, part A, clause 1, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (that is, applying the personal tax scale) for each dollar of taxable income derived in the income year by the disabled beneficiary or the trustee.

Example 31: Combined tax (continuation of example 27 above) In the 2024–25 income year, Matilda derives $21,440 of taxable income.

Effective date The proposed amendment would have effect for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts). Background “Corpus” for a trust means the settlement value of property settled on the trust, subject to certain exclusions. 22 Distributions of amounts of corpus to beneficiaries of the trust are exempt from tax. 23 A settlement by a trustee of a trust (Trust A) on another trust (Trust B) is excluded from corpus of Trust B to the extent to which, if it were distributed to a New Zealand-resident beneficiary of Trust A, it would be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to that beneficiary. 24 This rule is intended to ensure that trustees cannot avoid paying tax on distributions of amounts accumulated in trusts simply by settling those amounts on other trusts and then distributing them as tax-free corpus. Detailed analysis Trustees can make resettlements on behalf of beneficiaries. This involves:  a payment made by the trustee to the beneficiary for the purposes of the definitions of “beneficiary income” 25 and “distribution” 26 , and 22 Section HC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 23 Sections CW 53 and HC 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 24 Section HC 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 25 Section HC 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 26 Section HC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Effective date The proposed amendments would have effect for payments made on or after 1 April 2024. Background A lump sum backdated payment to a person of their ACC or MSD entitlements could result in that person having to pay a higher amount of tax. This is because, for most individual taxpayers, income is taxed in the year it is received. This can be seen as unfair when the person was entitled to receive the payment in earlier years. Receipt of the lump sum can artificially push people into a higher tax bracket for a single year. This compounds the disadvantage suffered by the affected person who, in addition to having had a delay in receiving their entitlement, also receives a smaller net amount than if the amount had been paid over multiple years (that is, when it should have been paid). A fairness issue arises when all the following occur:  the amount is significant enough to move the taxpayer into a higher tax bracket  if spread over the relevant tax years, the taxpayer would have had a lower tax liability in relation to that amount  a backdated (or remedial) lump sum payment (BLSP) is made relating to two or more tax years, and  the delay or error has been caused by an action or inaction by the Crown. This issue has been raised repeatedly over several years for ACC and MSD payments in complaints to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Ministerial correspondence, media articles and Select Committee submissions.

In some cases, whether a person is entitled to ACC compensation may be the subject of dispute or delay in awarding compensation and making payment to the person. Example 35: Taxation of Scotty’s ACC payment Montgomery Scott (Scotty) was a forklift operator for one of the major ports in New Zealand. In 2019, he was involved in a workplace accident that saw him suffer long- term damage to his leg. For a time, Scotty received weekly compensation under the Accident Compensation Act 2001 for loss of earnings. However, ACC stopped paying him weekly compensation in 2019 when it considered he was able to return to paid employment. Scotty disputed this decision, but it took some years to resolve this dispute as several investigations needed to be completed before final eligibility was established. In 2023, Scotty was awarded a payment of $50,000 per year. This was paid in a lump sum of $200,000 in March 2023. If Scotty had received this amount in the relevant years, his tax liability for the payments would have been as follows: 2020 2021 2022 2023 Total Income $50,000 $50,000 $50,000 $50,000 $200,000 Tax liability $8,020 $8,020 $8,020 $8,020 $32,080 However, for tax purposes the payment is only taxed on receipt of the full amount in 2023. This will result in income in the 2023 year of $200,000, and a tax liability for Scotty of $58,120. The difference between the two treatments is an additional tax liability for Scotty of $26,040. MSD backdated entitlements Backdated payments of MSD entitlements may also give rise to an increased tax liability if they are paid in a subsequent tax year. BLSPs are paid by MSD, for example, when there has been a past system error, or when incorrect or incomplete information was provided at the time of an assessment. They tend to be for smaller amounts (under $1,000) than ACC BLSPs.

MSD determine how much the recipient is entitled to in their hand and then gross up that amount for the tax payable. MSD calculate the tax to withhold as if the payments had been made on time (by reference to previous years). Since Inland Revenue taxes the BLSP in the year of receipt, this may result in a higher amount of tax payable for the recipient. For some recipients of MSD entitlements, a tax write-off is available for the difference in tax (between what was deducted and the tax owing). However, for those who receive Working for Families or those who are no longer on a benefit, this tax difference is payable. Example 36: Taxation of Sammy’s backdated MSD entitlement Sammy worked as a shepherd on a high-country farm in North Canterbury. In 2013, Sammy had to stop work after suffering extreme dizziness and fatigue over a prolonged period. Sammy was originally diagnosed with depression and was granted a sickness benefit when they left work. Years later, Sammy applied for a supported-living payment (also known as an invalid benefit) but their claim was denied. After years of trying to treat their illness, in 2022 they were diagnosed with a rare genetic condition. Following this new information, MSD granted Sammy the supported living payment and Sammy appealed to have this backdated to 2013. Sammy was awarded $10,000 in backdated benefits and $2,000 in ex-gratia payments for their pain and suffering. When calculating the tax owed on the payment, MSD wants to ensure that Sammy will get $10,000 by adding an extra amount (grossing up the payment) to account for Sammy’s tax liability. To do that, MSD work out the amount of the tax payable on the payments as if those payments had been taxed in the correct year, which works out to be $2,500. 27 MSD pays Sammy $12,500 gross and withholds and pays PAYE of $2,500 to Inland Revenue. Sammy receives $10,000 in the hand. However, when information about the payment comes through into Sammy’s annual income tax calculation at Inland Revenue, additional tax is owing on the BLSP. This is because it is taxed in the year of receipt and not as MSD has calculated the tax liability. This has flow-on effects to their social policy obligations. 27 This amount of tax deducted is for illustrative purposes.

The proposed tax treatment for each payment differs due to the way in which tax is calculated by MSD and ACC. Detailed analysis ACC compensation payments Proposed new section RD 20B of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) provides the method to calculate an alternative tax rate for ACC BLSPs (a multi-year compensation payment). A multi-year compensation payment is defined as an accident compensation earnings-related payment consisting of a lump sum and relating to more than one income year for a person. Under proposed section RD 20B(3), the tax rate that would apply to a multi-year compensation payment would be: a. 10.5% if the average basic tax rate is less than 10.5% and paragraph c. does not apply, or b. the average basic tax rate if neither of paragraph a. or c. apply, or c. the person’s basic tax rate for the income year they receive the payment if that basic tax rate is less than the average basic tax rate. Paragraph (a) - minimum tax rate Paragraph (a) in proposed new section RD 20B(3) introduces a minimum tax rate of 10.5% to recognise the tax required to be withheld from the payment if the payment was the person’s only income.

This formula is as follows: 0.25 x (basic rate 1 + basic rate 2 + basic rate 3 + basic rate 4) Basic rate 1 to basic rate 4 are defined in proposed section RD 20B(5), and they effectively mean the person’s basic tax rate calculated under schedule 1, Part A, clause 1 of the ITA for each of the four income years in the averaging period. Paragraph (c) – basic tax rate The proposed section also introduces a ‘lower of’ test to prevent recipients from being worse off under the alternative tax treatment compared to the status quo. This means that if the recipient has had a higher tax rate in the four years before receipt of the BLSP but has a lower tax rate in the year the BLSP is paid, the person’s basic tax rate for the current year would apply. Payment by ACC Under current information sharing provisions, ACC would be able to request the recipient’s correct tax rate before the BLSP is made and then apply that as the withholding rate on the payment. This would mean no additional amount of tax should be payable for the BLSP (assuming the recipient’s circumstances do not change). The rate determined under proposed section RD 20B would apply to the BLSP separately from the rate applied to the person’s other income in the year they receive the payment. Example 37: Taxation of Scotty’s ACC payment in 2024 (continuation of example 35 above) If Scotty was paid his payment on or after 1 April 2024, the proposed tax treatment would apply. If Scotty had no other income – minimum tax rate Assume that while disputing the claim with ACC, Scotty was able to live mainly on his savings and with support from his partner. Before ACC pays his BLSP, ACC contacts Inland Revenue for Scotty’s average basic tax rate over the previous four years.

If Scotty continued to earn no income in the year of payment of the BLSP, no additional tax would be owing. If Scotty was earning other income Assume that while disputing the claim with ACC, Scotty was able to find a part-time office job. Before ACC pays his BLSP, ACC contacts Inland Revenue for Scotty’s average basic tax rate over the previous four years. His income and average basic tax rate, excluding the BLSP, for each year is as follows: 2020 2021 2022 2023 Income $18,000 $21,000 $26,000 $30,000 Basic tax rate 28 12% 12.8% 13.7% 14.2% Using the formula, Scotty’s average basic tax rate for the previous four years would be: 0.25 x (12 (BTR 1) + 12.8 (BTR 2) + 13.7 (BTR 3) + 14.2 (BTR 4)) = 13.175%. Therefore, instead of Scotty’s BLSP being included in his annual tax return for 2024, it would be taxed separately at his average basic tax rate. ACC can apply the average tax rate to the BLSP ($200,000 x 13.175%) and withhold the tax before making the payment to Scotty. Scotty’s tax liability on the BLSP would be $26,350. Assuming Scotty has $30,000 income from his part-time office job in 2024, he will continue to pay tax at the applicable rate on that income. However, no additional tax will be owed for the BLSP. Without the alternative tax treatment, Scotty’s BLSP would have been included in his taxable income for 2024 ($30,000 + 200,000). Under ordinary treatment, his tax liability would have been $69,820. 29 28 This is calculated by dividing tax paid by taxable income x 100. 29 This calculation assumes the marginal tax rates are unchanged in the 2024-25 income year from the 2022-23 income year.

A multi-year benefit payment is defined as a main benefit consisting of a lump sum that relates to more than one income year. For these purposes, a main benefit is as defined in paragraph (a) of the definition of “main benefit” in schedule 2 of the Social Security Act 2018, namely:  jobseeker support  sole parent support  a supported living payment on the ground of restricted work capacity, total blindness, or caring for another person  a youth payment  a young parent payment, or  an emergency benefit. The proposed formula for calculating the tax rate on the BLSP would effectively treat the tax deducted by MSD before paying the person as the correct amount of tax owed. This means there would be no further tax payable and the BLSP would be ignored for the person’s income tax liability. The BLSP would still be considered for social policy entitlements because these entitlements are, generally, calculated with reference to cash in hand. Example 38: Taxation of Sammy’s MSD payment in 2024 (continuation of example 36 above) If Sammy was paid their BLSP after 1 April 2024, the proposed alternative tax treatment would apply. This would mean that once MSD calculated the tax owing, this would be the final amount of tax payable on the BLSP. The tax rate on Sammy’s payment would be calculated as follows: $2,500 (tax deduction) ÷ ($10,000 (received amount) + $2,500 (tax deduction)) = 0.2 The calculated rate of 20% should equal the amount deducted, meaning no extra tax would be owing on the payment.

Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 July 2024. Key features  From 1 July 2024, the Government would pay a three percent KiwiSaver contribution to eligible PPL recipients.  To be eligible, PPL recipients would also need to contribute three percent of their PPL payments to their KiwiSaver accounts. Background The financial position of women at retirement is typically less secure than men. Although women tend to live longer than men, the average KiwiSaver balances of men are 20 percent higher than those of women. The reasons for this are varied and include overrepresentation in lower paid roles, lower rates of labour force participation, and time spent out of the workforce to raise children or care for family members. Paid Parental Leave (PPL) is a payment made to qualifying individuals and is intended to make up for lost income when a person takes time out of the workforce to have a baby. For the period 1 July 2022 – 30 June 2023, PPL payments will match a person’s weekly income up to a maximum of $661.12 per week before tax. Under the proposed amendment, the government would pay a three percent KiwiSaver contribution on amounts of PPL received by KiwiSaver members where the PPL recipient also paid a corresponding three percent KiwiSaver employee contribution into their KiwiSaver account. This would help to increase the KiwiSaver balances of PPL recipients, many of whom are women.

This relief would enable the profits and depreciation recovery income arising when insurance or compensation proceeds are received for business assets destroyed by the North Island flooding events to be deferred provided the assets are replaced. Similar temporary, time-limited relief was provided for assets destroyed by the Canterbury and Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes. The Bill also includes several minor associated amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), particularly the depreciation rules. Similar amendments were included as part of the earthquake tax relief packages. Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for the 2022–23 and later income years, ceasing in the 2027–28 income year. Background Normally, the receipt of insurance proceeds for a destroyed business asset gives rise to either depreciation recovery income on a depreciable asset, or income on a revenue account asset. The resulting upfront tax liability means that a business seriously impacted by a North Island flooding event will have less cash available to pay for the replacement assets needed to recommence business. In many cases, it would also mean a windfall revenue gain to the Government from the events. While these taxable gains would normally have arisen if the assets were sold, the unexpected nature of the flooding destruction is a very different circumstance, and the resulting tax liability is unexpected. This issue was recognised in relation to the assets destroyed by the Canterbury and Hurunui-Kaikōura earthquakes and rollover relief was provided. Rollover relief defers the recognition of the depreciation recovery income or income on a revenue account asset, provided there is a commitment to rebuild or replace the destroyed assets. As part of the earthquake provisions, several associated amendments were made to clarify the timing around the deductibility of expenditure and recognition of income for the Date: May 2023 107 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] damaged assets. The Bill contains similar proposed technical amendments as part of the flood tax relief package. For more detail and examples on the Canterbury legislation, see Tax Information Bulletin Volume 24, No 10, December 2012. Key features The Bill contains a set of proposed amendments to the ITA as part of providing rollover relief for assets “destroyed” because of the January/February North Island flooding events. These amendments:  provide rollover relief for both revenue account assets and depreciable assets that are destroyed or uneconomic to repair  clarify that on-going expenses or losses can continue to be deducted when a business activity is so disrupted by a flooding event that there is no longer a sufficient nexus between the expenses and the income-earning activity  align the tax treatment of depreciable assets that are uneconomic to repair with the treatment of depreciable assets that have been “irreparably damaged” or are “useless for earning income” for tax purposes  limit the recovery income that arises under the tax rules when insurance proceeds have been received for a damaged asset that is repairable to the amount of depreciation deductions previously claimed for the asset  provide optional matching rules to smooth the timing of income and deductions/disposal losses when insurance proceeds have been received for flood affected (depreciable) assets  clarify that a depreciation deduction may be claimed on depreciable property when access to the property is temporarily restricted because of a flooding event, and  provide an optional adjustment rule for measuring group assets for the purposes of the thin-capitalisation rules. Detailed analysis The Bill proposes to insert new sections CZ 25C, DZ 20B, EZ 23BE, EZ 83 to EZ 87, and FZ 7B to the ITA. These provisions are based on the previous earthquake provisions. A key exception is that the proposed provisions do not include a requirement that replacement land and buildings be located in the same region in New Zealand.

In both cases, the rollover option requires the destroyed 30 asset to be replaced. If it is not replaced by the end of the 2027–28 income year, then the rollover relief would cease in that year. I f the business ceases operations or acquires the replacement asset in an income year before the 2027–28 income year, the rollover relief would cease in that earlier income year. The cost of the replacement asset for tax purposes is reduced to reflect the deferred income in the year the asset is replaced, or partially replaced if the replacement expenditure is incurred gradually. As rollover relief is optional, the taxpayer would need to elect to use the option and notify the Commissioner of their election. This must be done by the date their return of income is required to be filed for each income year that they elect to use rollover relief. Certain information is required as part of the notification. Its purpose is to ensure that the taxpayer turns their mind each year to deciding whether they still intend to replace the asset. Example 39 A taxpayer’s revenue account building located in the Hawke’s Bay is destroyed by a North Island flooding event. The building originally cost $1.5 million. The replacement insurance proceeds are $3 million, and the replacement building is completed on 15 June 2026. In the absence of rollover relief, the building owner will have taxable income of $1.5 million (under section CG 6). Proposed section CZ 25C would allow the owner to defer that income tax liability by allocating an amount of $1.5 million to the replacement building. As a result of negotiations between the building owner and the insurance company, the insurance proceeds can be reasonably estimated on 30 September 2023. In the tax return for the tax year ending on 31 March 2024, the building owner files an election to defer the $1.5 million of income pending replacement of the building. Provided the taxpayer continues to elect to defer the income, it remains suspended for the tax years ending on 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2026. 30 The asset has to be irreparably damaged/useless for income-earning purposes.

A notice will have to be filed with the tax return for the year ended 31 March 2027 advising that the deferred income has been rolled into the tax base for the replacement asset. The taxpayer must also give notice that the amount of unallocated suspended income has been reduced by $1.5 million to $0. When the replacement asset is eventually sold, the difference between the $1.5 million cost and the sales proceeds will be taxable, provided the building is sold for more than $1.5 million. Example 40 Plant and equipment (not previously depreciated under the pool method) destroyed by a North Island flooding event had a cost of $1 million. On the day of the flood, the plant and equipment had an adjusted tax book value of $700,000. The owner receives an insurance pay-out of $1 million. The net depreciation recovered is, therefore, $300,000, and this becomes the suspended recovery income. The replacement assets are acquired over two years at a cost of $400,000 per year. In year three, the owner decides to acquire no more replacement assets. Under proposed section EZ 23BE, the $300,000 suspended recovery income is allocated as follows: Year 1 ($400,000 x $300,000) / $1,000,000 = $120,000) Year 2 ($400,000 x $300,000) / $1,000,000 = $120,000) The cost of the replacement plant and machinery is reduced in total by $240,000. The remaining suspended recovery income balance of $60,000 (representing the portion of assets not replaced) is taxed in the year the taxpayer decides to make no further investment in replacement property. Deductibility of expenses when no income-earning activity Proposed new section DZ 20B addresses the situation where some taxpayers are no longer able to deduct their on-going expenses or losses relating to their income-earning activity. For example, when land is not physically accessible due to silt, resulting in the business activity being so disrupted by the flooding event that there is no longer a sufficient nexus between the expenses and the income-earning activity.

To qualify, the person must:  have an income-earning activity in the “affected area” immediately before the flooding event, and  in the current year, during the period of interruption, have incurred expenditure or loss in meeting an obligation relating to the income-earning activity and that interruption expenditure does not meet the requirements of the general deductibility permission in section DA 1, but would have done so but for the interruption, and  resume the income-earning activity in an income year before the 2028–29 income year. If all these conditions are met, the person is allowed to deduct the expenditure in the year their income earning is resumed. Damaged depreciation property that is uneconomic to repair The tax depreciation rules do not provide an appropriate outcome when an asset has been damaged by a North Island flooding event and the insurer or comparable qualified assessor considers it to be uneconomic to repair, even though the asset may be technically repairable. This is because the tax rules distinguish between assets that are repairable and those that are irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income. Assets that are uneconomic to repair are generally included in the former category. The consequence is that a taxpayer may face a significant unexpected tax liability when an insurance amount is received. To help overcome this problem, proposed new section EZ 83 would provide for a deemed disposal and reacquisition of assets that are damaged by a January/February North Island flooding event and are uneconomic to repair. This would better align their depreciation treatment with those of assets that have been irreparably damaged by a flooding event. Rollover relief would then be available for those assets. The asset would be deemed to be reacquired for nil consideration on the same day as the deemed disposal (which would be for the amount of insurance), meaning that the post- flooding event repairs would be capitalised rather than being treated as deductible expenditure.

It is damaged by a North Island flooding event and the insurance company decides it has an obligation under the insurance policy to replace it at a cost of $10 million because it is no longer fit for purpose and is uneconomic to repair. The damaged building is retained by the insured party and put to another, less productive, use. Proposed new section EZ 83 could be applied in these circumstances. Therefore, the building would be treated as being disposed of for $10 million and reacquired for nil consideration on the date of the flooding event that caused the asset to be uneconomic to repair. As the building would be treated as having been disposed of, the owner of the asset could apply the matching rule in proposed new section EZ 86 to smooth the timing of income calculated under existing section EE 48. Under section EE 48, the result will be: Original cost $5,000,000 Depreciation deductions $4,000,000 Adjusted tax value $1,000,000 Amount for disposal (consideration) $10,000,000 Depreciation recovery income $4,000,000 Capital gain $5,000,000 Rollover relief (under proposed new section EZ 23BE) would be available to the building owner for the $4 million of depreciation recovery income. Cap on depreciation recovery income Section EE 52 of the ITA treats as taxable any insurance proceeds in excess of an asset’s adjusted tax value and expenditure on repairing the asset. As a result, the tax rules may end up taxing more than the amount of earlier depreciation deductions allowed for the asset. In the context of the North Island flooding events, this means that some taxpayers may face significant unanticipated income tax liabilities in relation to damaged (but repairable) assets. Accordingly, proposed new section EZ 84 would limit depreciation recovery income to the amount of depreciation deductions previously taken when insurance proceeds are received for a repairable depreciable asset damaged by a January/February North Island flooding event.

However, proposed section EZ 84 would cap the amount of depreciation recovery income at $4 million. The remaining $1 million would be treated as a capital gain. Property that is available for use For an item of property to be depreciated for tax purposes, it must be used in a business or be available for use. However, it is not clear how this rule should be applied when access to depreciable property is temporarily restricted by a January/February North Island flooding event. Proposed new section EZ 85 would address this issue by treating the item as being available for use during the period of restricted access, provided it was available for use immediately before the restriction was imposed. Depreciation could therefore be claimed. Optional timing rule when damage results in a disposal Proposed new section EZ 86 would provide an optional rule to smooth the timing of income and deductions when insurance proceeds have been received for depreciable property that has been irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income because of a January/February North Island flooding event. The proposed timing rule would also apply to depreciable assets that are uneconomic to repair and to which proposed new section EZ 83 would apply. The optional rule would apply to individual items of depreciable property, in line with the general approach under the depreciation rules. The proposed section provides that any income or deductions are recognised at the earlier of:  the first income year in which o the insurance receipt is, or has been, derived or able to be reasonably estimated, and o the cost of disposing of the item is, or has been, incurred or able to be reasonably estimated, and Date: May 2023 113 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] o the consideration from the disposal of the item is, or has been, derived or able to be reasonably estimated, or  the 2027–28 income year. Whether insurance proceeds and other amounts can be reasonably estimated is essentially a question of fact, which will depend on the individual circumstances of each case. However, it is envisaged that some form of documentation would be required, for example, a written quote from an insurer. Proposed new section EZ 86 would override the normal depreciation timing rules. The section could also be applied to assets depreciated in a pool. A person who opts to use the matching rule would be required to use it for all their items of depreciable property that meet the criteria for applying the rule. This is to prevent taxpayers “cherry-picking” the assets to which they apply the rule. A taxpayer’s election to use the matching rule would be reflected in the tax position they take in their return of income for each tax year – no prior notice of election would be required. Example 43 Equipment originally costing $10,000 is irreparably damaged by a North Island flooding event. The asset’s tax book value is $7,000, with $3,000 of accumulated depreciation deductions. The disposal costs are reasonably estimated in 2022–23 to be $1,000. The insurance proceeds received for the asset are reasonably estimated in 2023–24 as being $9,000. The equipment has a scrap value of $100, which is reasonably estimated in 2022–23. Applying the proposed matching rule, any income or deductions would be recognised in the 2023–24 income year, as this is when all the insurance proceeds, disposal costs and disposal proceeds can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, in the 2023–24 income year, section EE 48 would apply to determine the amount of depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss. Optional timing rule when damage does not result in a disposal Proposed new section EZ 87 would introduce an optional rule to smooth the timing of income and deductions when insurance proceeds have been received for a depreciable asset that has been damaged in a January/February North Island flooding event, but the asset is repairable. The rule is broadly similar to proposed new section EZ 86 in design, except in this case, the asset is economically repairable.

The timing rule provides that any income or deductions would be recognised at the earlier of:  the first income year in which o the insurance receipt is, or has been, derived or able to be reasonably estimated, and o the cost of repairing the asset is, or has been, incurred or able to be reasonably estimated; or  the 2027–28 income year. Proposed new section EZ 87 would override the timing rules in existing sections CG 4, EE 22 and EE 52 of the ITA. The section would also be applicable to assets depreciated in a pool. Example 44 Machinery originally costing $100,000 is damaged by a flooding event. The asset’s adjusted tax value is $60,000, with $40,000 of accumulated depreciation deductions. The insurance proceeds are estimated in 2022–23 as being $110,000. Repair costs are estimated in 2023–24 to be $20,000, and $10,000 is actually incurred in each of 2023– 24 and 2024–25. Applying the matching rule, any income or deductions would be recognised in the 2023–24 income year, as this is when the insurance proceeds and total repair costs can reasonably be estimated. Accordingly, in the 2023–24 income year, existing sections CG 4 and EE 52 would apply. The repair costs are deductible under the general deductibility rules. Section CG 4 would treat $20,000 of the insurance proceeds as taxable, as this is the amount of insurance proceeds that recovers deductible expenditure. Section EE 52 would apply to the insurance proceeds as follows: Adjusted tax value of $60,000 less ($110,000 – $20,000) = ($30,000) Accordingly, the adjusted tax value would be reduced to nil and depreciation recovery income under section EE 52 would be $30,000.

The adjustment would mitigate a timing problem that arises because insurance proceeds may be recognised for tax purposes at a later date than the damage caused by a North Island flooding event. The thin-capitalisation rules are based on accounting measures of assets. For accounting purposes, damaged assets are immediately impaired or derecognised. In contrast, insurance proceeds cannot be recognised until they are reasonably expected. Proposed new section FZ 7B is designed to mitigate this timing difference by allowing certain taxpayers to carry back known insurance proceeds to the date on which an asset was impaired or derecognised as a result of damage caused by a flooding event. The amount that can be carried back would be limited to the lesser of the amount of damage or the related insurance proceeds. Without this option, a business may be temporarily disadvantaged in terms of how much debt they can carry on their balance sheet under the thin-capitalisation rules, resulting in reduced interest deductions. A person who chooses to use this option would be required to notify the Commissioner and provide certain information. Definition of flooding events and affected area The recently enacted Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023 defines a series of weather events that occurred over January-February 2023 as “severe weather events”. It is proposed to replace the definition of “North Island flooding events” in section YA 1 of the ITA with a new definition to align it with the “severe weather events” definition. The proposed new definition of “North Island flooding events” provides that it means flooding and other damage that occurred in an affected area caused by any of the following weather events:  Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period commencing on 8 January 2023 and ending on 12 January 2023.  The heavy rainfall commencing on 26 January 2023 and ending on 3 February 2023 in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato, and Bay of Plenty regions.  Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period commencing on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023.

The Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023 extended the affected area to include the Manawatū and Rangitikei districts. This widened definition would be used for the taxation rollover relief provisions to provide regulatory consistency. The definition is intended to also cover an affected area where subsequent events exacerbate the damage caused by one or more of the above flooding events in that area. An example of such a subsequent event would be the Mangawhai floods.

Using in-country networks in India and Nepal, the main activity is to run one-teacher schools (known as Ekal Vidyalayas) that provide free education to children in over 80,000 remote rural villages. The Limapela Foundation The Limapela Foundation works primarily in Zambia. It provides education and support to children and teenagers in poorer communities. The Foundation runs two schools in Zambia, which support over 700 pupils in education and development. It also provides outreach and medical funds for struggling children in local areas. The Foundation aims to build up vulnerable communities through long-lasting support in education and self-sufficiency. Pasifika Safe Shelter Trust Pasifika Safe Shelter Trust was established to collect non-perishable food and material items to distribute to people in the Pacific region as they live through the effects of a natural disaster. Most recently, they collected farming equipment and tractors to be sent to Tonga. This was to assist in rebuilding the agricultural industry following damage caused to food production by the volcanic eruption and subsequent tsunami. The Make My Name Count NZ Charitable Trust The Make My Name Count NZ Charitable Trust (MMNC) primarily focuses on providing the basics of life for, currently, 172 orphaned children at the Orphanage of Hope in Uganda, a nationally recognised orphanage and charity.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 January 2025. Background Income derived by non-resident companies from operating offshore oil rigs and seismic vessels is covered by an exemption in section CW 57 of the Income Tax Act 2007. These rigs and vessels are used to drill for oil and gas and gather data on potential oil and gas finds. There is a worldwide market in rigs and seismic vessels. No New Zealand company owns offshore rigs or seismic vessels, so any company wishing to explore in New Zealand waters needs to use a rig or seismic vessel provided by a non-resident owner. Section CW 57 was introduced to deal with a problem created by our double tax agreements (DTAs). New Zealand generally taxes non-residents on income that has a source in New Zealand. However, our DTAs provide that non-residents are only taxable on their New Zealand-sourced business profits if they have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. Many of our DTAs (such as the New Zealand-United States DTA) have a specific rule providing that a non-resident enterprise involved in exploring for natural resources only has a permanent establishment in New Zealand if they are present for a particular period, often 183 days in a year. Once a non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, they are taxed on all their New Zealand business profits starting from day one. The issue caused by this DTA provision was that seismic vessels and rigs used in petroleum exploration were leaving New Zealand waters before the 183-day period had expired t o ensure they would not be subject to New Zealand tax. This meant that, in some cases, a rig would leave and a different rig would be mobilised to complete the exploration programme. This “churning” of rigs increased the cost for companies engaged in exploration and had the potential to delay exploration drilling and any subsequent discovery of oil or gas.

The proposed amendment would seek to reduce the inaccuracies by replacing the annualisation of the amount of PAYE income payments received in the four weeks preceding the date of the extra pay with the annualisation of the amount received in the last preceding two paid pay periods (that is, the last two pay periods for which payment was received). Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background Section RD 17 governs the taxation of extra pay when it is received with other PAYE income payments. The amount of tax for the extra pay is currently based on:  the amount of the extra pay, and  the annualised value of all PAYE income payments made to the employee in the four- week period that ends on the date of the payment of the extra pay. However, this approach can understate or overstate the rate of taxation in the case of an employee termination. This is because the final payment received by the employee on termination is not representative of a typical PAYE cycle. Therefore, including that payment in the amount that is annualised can lead to a reduced or inflated annual figure for the employee. If, as a result, the amount of tax is understated or overstated, the taxpayer will have a liability or receive a refund, respectively, at the end of the tax year. The proposed amendment seeks to reduce the number of these inaccuracies by removing the reference to the prior four-week period. Instead, the amount of PAYE income payments received by an employee in the last two paid pay periods preceding the employee’s final PAYE income payment would be annualised. That is, the employee’s final PAYE income payment would not be included in the amount that was annualised, but rather the PAYE Date: May 2023 126 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] income payments received by the employee in the last two pay periods for which payment was made by the employer would be annualised instead.

One day, his long-time employee, Kelvin, advises Ben that he will be leaving to work at a rival store. Ben realises he will have to pay Kelvin the amount of $2,000 in extra pay on the termination of Kelvin’s employment on 3 June. Kelvin is paid weekly, and his hours can vary from one week to the next. Fortunately, Ben has the recent salary information below: Period end Status PAYE income payments 6 May At work $600.00 13 May At work $500.00 20 May Unpaid leave $0.00 27 May At work $550.00 To determine the amount of tax that applies to the extra pay, Ben knows he must annualise the two most recent periods for which payment was made. Ben sees that payment was made in connection with the pay periods ended 27 May and 13 May. He ignores the period ended 20 May because no payment was made for that period as Kelvin was on unpaid leave. He performs the annualisation calculation as follows:  Step 1: Ben adds together the amounts received for the pay periods ended 27 May and 13 May ($550 + $500 = $1,050).  Step 2: Because the sum of the two pay periods represents two weeks’ PAYE income payments, he divides the number of weeks in the year (52) by two to determine the number of fortnights in the year, for a total of 26 fortnights.  Step 3: Ben annualises the amount of Kelvin’s PAYE by multiplying the number of fortnights in the year by the amount determined in Step 1 ($1,050 x 26) for a total of $27,000.  Step 4: Finally, Ben adds the amount of extra pay to the amount determined in Step 3 ($27,000 + $2,000) for a total of $29,000.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2024. Background The accounts of deceased KiwiSaver members can become dormant, no longer receiving contributions while still incurring KiwiSaver provider fees. In some cases, the scheme provider may not learn of the member’s death or know the contact details of the deceased member’s estate. In other circumstances, the executors or administrators may be unaware the deceased’s KiwiSaver account exists. In either case, the member’s account will not be distributed to the member’s intended heirs. Under current legislative settings, Inland Revenue is unable to offer KiwiSaver providers any information about the executors or administrators of the deceased member’s estate. The proposed amendment to section 220B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 would allow the Commissioner to provide KiwiSaver providers with information relating to the administration of a deceased member’s estate. This would assist them in contacting the executors or administrators of the deceased member’s estate.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2020. Background Since 1 April 2020, section 32E(1A) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has provided automatic RWT-exempt status for charitable trusts registered under the Charities Act 2005. This was a simplification change intended to reduce unnecessary compliance costs for registered charities. However, the Charities Act 2005 registers “charitable entities”, not just charitable trusts. The proposed amendment will align the legislation with existing practice and ensure that all entities (for example, companies) registered under the Charities Act 2005 automatically have RWT-exempt status for the duration of their registration.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Sections 18K, 32 and 58 of the TAA are integrity provisions relating to “gift-exempt bodies”. They provide for a gift-exempt body to keep records, and provide returns, showing the sources and application of donations. Additionally, they allow the Commissioner to notify the Minister of Revenue if he believes the funds of a gift-exempt body are being applied for a purpose that is not charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural. A “gift-exempt body” is defined in section 3(1) of the TAA as any overseas donee organisation listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) or any person who has RWT-exempt status following an application made under section 32E(2)(k) or (l) of the TAA. 31 Thus, the definition of a “gift-exempt body” is currently limited to persons that apply for RWT-exempt status. Since charitable trusts registered under the Charities Act 2005 are automatically provided with an RWT-exemption without having to apply, they are unintentionally excluded from the gift-exempt body definition under current law. The proposed amendment to section 32E(1A) of the TAA (discussed in Item: “Charitable entities and RWT-exempt status” a bove) would also extend this automatic RWT-exempt status to all charities registered under the Charities Act 2005. Therefore, the current proposed 31 A person can apply for RWT-exempt status under section 32E(2)(k) or (l) of the TAA if they derive exempt income under sections CW 38(2), CW 38B(2), CW 39(2), CW 40 to CW 52, and CW 64 of the ITA or if they are a non-p rofit organisation to which section DV 8 of the ITA applies. Examples include public and local authorities, local and regional promotion bodies, charities registered under the Charities Act, friendly societies, amateur sporting bodies and community trusts.

The proposed amendment would also ensure that those exempt entities and not-for-profit organisations eligible to apply for RWT-exempt status under section 32E(k) or (l) of the TAA are included within the definition of a “gift-exempt body”, and therefore subject to the integrity rules, regardless of whether they have applied for RWT- exempt status.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on the date of introduction of the Bill. Background Most charities registered under the Charities Act 2005 receive tax benefits, including an income tax exemption. In 2014, new rules were introduced to impose income tax on the value of the net assets of charities that have been deregistered under the Charities Act 2005. These rules were designed to be a disincentive to transfer net assets out of the charitable base once they are settled there. The imposition of tax also ensured deregistered charities are held to account for the assets and income they built up while they enjoyed the benefit of the tax concessions. Section HR 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that one year after the day an entity is removed from the Charities Register (or one year after the day on which that entity exhausts all disputes and appeals in relation to its charitable status, whichever is the latter), certain net assets are included as income of that entity and subject to income tax. Adjustments are made to carve out assets that meet certain criteria, which reduces the net assets balance subject to tax. A carve-out exists for assets that, within the one-year period mentioned above, are disposed of or transferred for charitable purposes or in accordance with the entity’s rules contained on the Charities Register. This carve-out does not require assets to be disposed of or transferred to another registered charity. In practice, the breadth of this carve-out means assets may be transferred to entities that are not subject to regulatory oversight under the Charities Act 2005. With no regulatory oversight, the funds and their accumulated tax benefits may be used for non-charitable purposes or charitable purposes that do not benefit New Zealanders. The policy intent of the rules can therefore be undermined.

Net assets transferred by a deregistered charity to another entity are only carved out from the deregistration tax rules if the receiving entity is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. Assets transferred by a deregistered charity to an entity that is not a registered charity would be subject to the deregistration tax rules. Example 46: Transfer of assets to a charitable trust Grey Warbler Group is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. The charity voluntarily deregisters on 30 March 2025 because it no longer wishes to publicly report on its financial activities. Following deregistration, the Group decides to transfer all the assets it built up while enjoying tax concessions to Kōwhai Charitable Trust, a trust registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 but not registered under the Charities Act 2005. Trusts registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 are not subject to the same obligations as charities registered under the Charities Act 2005. Kōwhai Charitable Trust is not required to publicly report on its financial activities, and it cannot access the same tax concessions as Grey Warbler Group. Under the current rules, Grey Warbler Group would not be liable for deregistration tax on assets transferred to Kōwhai Charitable Trust. Therefore, the Kōwhai Charitable Trust would be able to access the benefit of accumulated tax concessions, even though it would not qualify for those tax concessions itself. The proposed amendment would ensure that the assets transferred by Grey Warbler Group to Kōwhai Charitable Trust would be subject to the deregistration tax. This is more likely to encourage Grey Warbler Group to choose to distribute its assets to another registered charity. However, if Grey Warbler Group does transfer its assets to Kōwhai Charitable Trust, it will not be able to transfer the benefits of tax-exempt status that were conferred on those assets. Example 47: Transfer of assets overseas Kingfisher Charitable Trust is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. The founders decide to deregister the charity from the Charities Register on 30 June 2024 and plan to wind up the trust. On deregistration, the trust has assets of $1.5m and no liabilities.

Before 30 June 2025, the trust transfers assets worth $500,000 to Albatross Association, another charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. The trust transfers the remaining $1m assets to Stingray Charitable Trust, a charity established in the Cayman Islands. Under the current rules, the Kingfisher Charitable Trust would have no deregistration tax liability as all its assets have been transferred to entities with charitable purposes within one year of deregistration. The proposed amendment would ensure that the $1m assets transferred out of the New Zealand charitable sector to Stingray Charitable Trust in the Cayman Islands would be subject to the deregistration tax. The Kingfisher Charitable Trust will not be able to transfer the benefits of tax-exempt status that were conferred on those assets to an overseas charity where there is no oversight by New Zealand regulators and no entitlement to New Zealand tax concessions. Example 48: Transfer of assets received from a Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim Kākāriki Charitable Trust is a charity registered under the Charities Act 2005. The Trust was established to administer assets received from the Crown from a Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim. Kākāriki Charitable Trust deregisters from the Charities Register on 1 January 2024 and transfers all its assets to Whio Incorporated, a company that is not registered under the Charities Act. Under existing rules, the deregistration tax does not apply to assets received from a Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim. The proposed amendment would not change this treatment.

Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background Section HC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) provides that, in the trust rules, a trust is a “charitable trust” in an income year if:  all income derived or accumulated by the trust in that, or any earlier, year is held for charitable purposes, and  any income derived by the trustee in the income year is exempt income under either section CW 41(1) (Charities: non-business income) or CW 42(1) (Charities: business income) of the ITA. This definition is used to ensure that such trusts are excluded from rules relating to settlors’ liability to income tax (sections HC 29 and HD 12 of the ITA). It also ensures that settlors and trustees of such trusts are not associated persons (section YB 8 of the ITA). The section HC 13 definition is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of “charitable trust”, as not all charitable trusts registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 are eligible to derive exempt income under either section CW 41 or CW 42 of the ITA. A trust must be a “tax charity”, as defined in section CW 41(5), to derive exempt income under section CW 41(1) or CW 42(1) of the ITA. The proposed amendments would repeal the definition of a “charitable trust” in sections HC 13 and YA 1 of the ITA and replace any reference in the ITA to a “charitable trust” with a reference to a “trust that is a tax charity”. These changes would simplify the legislation by using a consistent definition throughout for these trusts.

Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018. Background New Zealand taxes income on the basis of both residence and source. While New Zealand residents are generally taxed on their worldwide income, non-residents are only taxed on New Zealand-sourced income. In broad terms, income is treated as having a source in New Zealand when its connection with New Zealand is strong enough for New Zealand to exert taxing rights over that income. However, the point when a connection will be “strong enough” is not always clear and may involve judgement calls that appear arbitrary. The DTA source rule in section YD 4(17D) deems an item of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under a DTA. There are several exceptions to the DTA source rule. Before the introduction of section YD 4(17D), an item of income would only have a source in New Zealand if it was included in a specific domestic source rule. The rule was introduced with other anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) measures to reduce risks of double non-taxation. It applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. The problem with the DTA source rule is that it can deem income to be sourced in New Zealand in unintended circumstances where the income’s connection with New Zealand is tenuous, and where New Zealand did not anticipate collecting tax on that income. Where officials have identified such overreaches, amendments have been made to ensure those amounts are not caught by the DTA source rule (for example, income falling under sections YD 4(15) to (17)).

Detailed analysis Technical services fees Income from personal services is usually treated as sourced in New Zealand under section YD 4(3) or (4) if the service is performed in New Zealand. Under the DTA source rule, fees for technical services provided by a non-resident to a New Zealand customer (payer) can be deemed to be sourced in New Zealand even if the services are performed overseas. However, it is unusual for personal services income to be treated as sourced in New Zealand when the services are neither performed in New Zealand nor connected to a New Zealand PE. This result occurs under New Zealand’s DTAs with India, Fiji and Malaysia only because of a special “fees for technical services” provision in those DTAs. Such a provision does not exist in New Zealand’s negotiating model and is not in our other DTAs. Further, it is difficult for taxpayers to understand and comply with the law, and for Inland Revenue to enforce the rules, when different source rules apply depending on which DTA applies. This may also disincentivise taxpayers from acquiring services from providers in particular countries, and so distort their economic decision-making. The proposed amendment would therefore exclude technical services fees from the DTA source rule. Certain payments connected to a third State PE As DTAs are bilateral in nature, issues can arise when arrangements involve three States. A technical issue arises when a New Zealand resident pays interest and royalties for its PE in a third State to a recipient in the other DTA country. New Zealand’s domestic source rules exclude payments made, or borrowed funds used, in connection with or for the purposes of a business carried on through a fixed establishment outside NZ (see sections YD 4(9)(a) and YD 4(11)(b)(i)). This ensures the payment does not Date: May 2023 138 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] have a New Zealand source when it is connected with a PE in another State. However, the DTA source rule inadvertently overrides these domestic source rule exclusions. This can result in the same income being sourced and taxed in both New Zealand and in the PE State. The DTA between New Zealand and the recipient’s State creates a source in New Zealand but does not provide relief when that income is connected to a PE in a third State. The below example illustrates the overreach in this scenario. Example 49: Overtaxation of income connected to a PE in a third State In this example, a New Zealand company borrows $1m from a US company to fund its PE activity in Canada. The New Zealand company pays interest to the US company on the $1m loan. Under the New Zealand/US DTA, 32 interest is deemed to have a source in the payer’s State (in this case New Zealand), even when it is connected to a PE in a third State. As a result, the interest payment will be treated as sourced in both New Zealand (under the DTA source rule) and likely Canada (under Canadian tax law) and taxable on that basis. It will also be taxable in the US on the residence basis, with relief provided to the US under the New Zealand/US DTA. 32 And most of our other DTAs, with the exception of our DTA with Australia.

This is because the DTA addresses the scenario when there is a PE in a contracting State but not when the PE is in a third State. If not for the DTA source rule, New Zealand’s domestic rules would not treat the interest as being sourced in New Zealand, since it relates to a fixed establishment outside New Zealand (a fixed establishment being similar to a PE). This would prevent the interest having a deemed source in both New Zealand and Canada, the PE State. The proposed amendment would exclude interest and royalties connected to a PE outside New Zealand from the DTA source rule.

Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for financial arrangements if a base price adjustment is required to be completed after the date on which the Bill receives the Royal assent. Background The financial arrangements rules spread income and expenditure over the term of an arrangement and require a base price adjustment when the arrangement matures. However, the financial arrangements rules do not apply to non-residents (section EW 9(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007). To ensure the base price adjustment only includes gains and losses when the person is a New Zealand resident, there is a deemed acquisition of the arrangement when the person becomes a New Zealand resident. This deemed acquisition is currently provided for in sections EW 37 and EW 41. This deemed acquisition was amended in 2006 to include the transitional residence rules. The transitional residence rules were intended to encourage immigration to New Zealand by allowing qualifying residents to exclude their offshore assets from the New Zealand tax base for the first four years. The consequence of these rules is that, when a financial arrangement does not have a New Zealand source, a person will only have a deemed acquisition of the arrangement once the person’s transitional residence period expires rather than when they became a New Zealand resident. However, the changes made for the transitional residence rules did not consider that immigrating transitional residents may hold financial arrangements with a New Zealand source. Such arrangements are always subject to New Zealand tax, even when held by a non- resident – however, they are not taxed under the financial arrangements rules unless they are held by a New Zealand resident, so accrued gains and losses are not included.

Although the person is taxed correctly during the life of that arrangement, the base price adjustment incorrectly includes gains and losses in the period before the person became a New Zealand resident. This issue particularly arises for certain immigrants who are required to hold New Zealand assets (such as New Zealand government bonds) to meet their visa requirements and acquire these before moving to New Zealand. The proposed amendments are intended to correct this issue. Key features The proposed amendments would add an additional paragraph to each of sections EW 37(1) and EW 41(1). This paragraph will create a deemed acquisition of a New Zealand-sourced financial arrangement if that arrangement was held by a non-resident when they become a transitional resident. This deemed acquisition will only affect the tax position of the person once that arrangement matures by excluding from the base price adjustment any accrued gains and losses that arose before the person became a transitional resident. Detailed analysis It is proposed to add the same paragraph to each of sections EW 37(1) and EW 41(1). These sections have the equivalent effect, except that section EW 37 applies to accrued obligations (eg, borrowing from another person so there is an obligation to make payment) and section EW 41 applies to accrued entitlements (eg, lending to another person so there is an entitlement to receive repayment). Proposed new paragraph (ab) will apply when the following three requirements are met:  The person becomes party to the arrangement after 1 April 2008. This date is chosen to align with the start of the Income Tax Act 2007.  The person becomes a transitional resident after becoming a party to the arrangement. This ensures the deemed acquisition applies to arrangements held when the person becomes a transitional resident.  The person must calculate and allocate income or expenditure under the arrangement for an income year under the financial arrangements rules. The third requirement, in subparagraph (ab)(iii), is the most important and intentionally applies similar language to that in existing section EW 9(1), which covers the application of the financial arrangements rules to residents. This requirement is designed to ensure that financial arrangements with a New Zealand source are only captured once a non-resident Date: May 2023 142 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] becomes a resident (including a transitional resident). It will not apply to a foreign-sourced financial arrangement held by a person becoming a transitional resident. This is because such an arrangement is treated, under section HR 8, as if the transitional resident were non- resident, in which case section EW 9(1) does not apply. Foreign-sourced arrangements of a person becoming a transitional resident have been excluded from the proposed amendments as these already have a deemed acquisition under section EW 37(1)(d) or EW 41(1)(d) once the person ceases to be a transitional resident. Likewise, arrangements of a person becoming a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional resident are excluded from the proposed amendment whether those arrangements are New Zealand or foreign sourced, as these already have a deemed acquisition under section EW 37(1)(b) or EW 41(1)(b).

The relevant period for the 10% income interest test would be changed to the period of ownership within the accounting period, rather than the entire accounting period. Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 July 2011. Background Several different methods are potentially available to a person to calculate the FIF income or loss from their FIF interests. To use the AFI method a person is currently required to have an income interest in the FIF of 10% or more in the accounting period. Where there are variations in the income interest during the accounting period, a weighted average calculation is performed. However, this rule does not work as intended. An acquisition or disposal may result in an income interest below 10% for the entire accounting period (based on a weighted averaged calculation) even if the actual interest held during the period of ownership is 10% or more. As a result, a taxpayer may not be able to access the AFI method for that period and may have to apply a less favourable FIF calculation method instead. The proposed amendment would change the relevant period for application of the 10% income interest test to be the period of ownership within the accounting period, rather than the entire accounting period.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2008. Background There are special rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) that deal with a situation where a taxpayer calculates their provisional tax liability with reference to the prior year and a reassessment of that prior year is subsequently made that changes that instalment amount after they have paid it. However, section RC 5(6) is cu rrently limited to situations where the prior year (current year (CY) – 1) is reassessed. This creates an issue where a taxpayer is using the year preceding the prior year (CY – 2) to calculate their provisional tax liability and that year is subject to a reassessment. In that case, the taxpayer may be exposed to use of money interest and penalties where they have no knowledge of the actual liability. The treatment of the CY – 2 year is inconsistent with the treatment of the CY – 1 year and the policy intent. There is no policy reason why the two years (CY – 1 and CY – 2) should be treated differently. It appears this was a drafting error at the time the ITA was rewritten. The proposed amendment would restore the wording of section RC 5(6) before the rewrite of the ITA.

Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on the day after the date the Bill receives the Royal assent. Key features The proposed amendments would ensure the legislation works as intended by re-linking several provisions to other amended provisions and by correcting several outdated references.

Effective date The proposed amendment would be effective for the 2017–18 and later income years. Background Section RE 14C of the Income Tax Act 2007 deals with the situation where an intermediary, such as a custodian, receives a non-cash dividend from a foreign company and passes that non-cash dividend on to the owner of the underlying shares. This section provides that the intermediary does not have to pay resident withholding tax in respect of the dividend. However, some of the language used in the section does not reflect the custodial relationship correctly. Specifically:  the section refers to the custodian “deriving” the dividend, when legally the custodian has no shareholding in the underlying company, and  the ultimate shareholder is referred to as the “shareholder in the company”, which can be read as the custodial company rather than the underlying foreign company. The proposed amendment would clarify the wording of section RE 14C to ensure it works as intended.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 1 April 2020. Background Under the current depreciation rules, depreciation can be claimed on “non-residential buildings” but not “residential buildings”. Although the terms “residential building” and “non-residential building” are defined in the ITA, the word “building” is not. In the recently published Interpretation Statement IS 22/04: Claiming depreciation on buildings, Inland Revenue confirmed its view that, in a depreciation context, a “building” will, among other things:  be enclosed by walls and a roof,  be able to function independently of any other structure, and  have an appearance and function that fits with the idea of what a conventional building looks like and is ordinarily used for. This interpretation arguably leads to the conclusion that a part of a building owned under a unit title is not a “building” in its own right and is therefore not depreciable, even though it may be used predominantly for “non-residential” purposes. Such an outcome is not considered to be consistent with the policy intent of the depreciation rules. The proposed amendment would clarify the position with effect from 1 April 2020, the date on which depreciation for non-residential buildings was reinstated.

Effective date The proposed amendments would be effective for residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021, regardless of whether the residential land has already been disposed of. Background Under the bright-line test, disposals of residential land are taxable for different periods depending on when the property was acquired. If residential land was acquired:  between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018, the bright-line period is two years  between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021, the bright-line period is five years  on or after 27 March 2021, the bright-line period is 10 years, unless the land qualifies for the shorter five-year new-build bright-line test. Main home exclusion For residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021, an exclusion is available under section CZ 40 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) if the person disposing of the residential land predominantly used the property as their main home for most of the bright-line period. Note that this exclusion was previously located in section CB 16A. When the main home settings were updated on 27 March 2021, the previous settings that applied to residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021 were relocated to section CZ 40. If the section CZ 40 main home exclusion applies, income derived from the disposal of the residential land within the bright-line period is not taxable under the bright-line test. If the exclusion does not apply, the income is taxable.

Problem definition If a person purchases their main home off the plan or constructs their main home, the construction period does not count as main home use, even if they subsequently only use the finished property as their main home. This is because, while the property was being constructed, they were not actually using it as their main home. This was unlikely to be a concern under the original two-year bright-line test or prior to COVID-19. However with disruptions to the construction sector because of COVID-19 lockdowns, labour shortages, and supply-chain issues, it is possible that someone may not qualify for the main home exclusion solely because of construction delays. This issue does not arise in relation to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as the way in which the main home exclusion now operates has changed and it includes a deeming rule for the construction period. Key features Proposed new sections CB 16A(1B) and CZ 40(2B) would ignore the period during which the person’s main home is constructed when determining whether the residential land was used as the person’s main home for most of the bright-line period. The two proposed sections are identical, except for specific terminology unique to section CZ 40. The proposed amendments would apply to residential land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021, regardless of whether the residential land has already been disposed of. Section CB 16A was replaced in its entirety with effect on 27 March 2021. Proposed new section CB 16A(1B) would therefore only apply to disposals occurring before 27 March 2021, as the existing section CB 16A that applies from 27 March 2021 already deals with this issue. Proposed new section CZ 40(2B) would apply to disposals occurring on or after 27 March 2021. The ordinary meaning of “construction” would apply, as it does in existing section CB 16A(1C). Construction would encompass work to build or erect the main home, including the design phase.

Example 50: Off-the-plan main home and construction delays In December 2019, Ben entered into an agreement to purchase residential land “off the plan” in a new development. Construction was due to be completed in early 2021, but due to delays, construction was not completed until June 2022. Ben moved into the property immediately following settlement in June 2022 and used the residential land as his main home until December 2023. In December 2023, Ben enters into an agreement to dispose of the property. Under existing section CZ 39(5), Ben’s bright-line period starts in December 2019 (rather than when the legal title is registered in his name) as he purchased the residential property off the plan. Ben’s bright-line period ends in December 2023. Ben is subject to income tax under the five-year bright-line test. Under the current law, Ben does not qualify for the main home exclusion because he did not use the property as his main home for more than 50% of his total bright-line period. He lived in the property for approximately 18 months, but the construction period was 30 months. Under the proposed amendment to section CZ 40, Ben would ignore the 30-month construction period and only look at the period from June 2022 to December 2023 when determining whether he qualifies for the main home exclusion. Ben used the property as his main home for that whole period and therefore would qualify for the main home exclusion.

Effective date The proposed amendment would take effect on 26 October 2021. Background The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 (the Amendment Act) introduced a four-year time bar to reassessments of child support. Beyond the four-year period, reassessments will not occur, subject to specified exceptions. This was intended to provide more certainty for parents and reduce administration costs, while balancing equity concerns through specified exceptions. Currently, there is no exception to allow the Commissioner to grant a liable parent a temporary exemption in the time-barred period. Additionally, the Commissioner is not able to backdate a change to an existing exemption in the time-barred period. This is contrary to the original policy intent of the Amendment Act and inconsistent with the exemption relating to victims of sexual offending, which is specifically excluded from the time bar. Temporary exemptions from paying child support are available to liable persons when certain criteria are met. They are granted on the grounds that a person has limited income and limited capacity to earn income. These exemptions apply to liable persons who are:  in prison, hospital or a treatment facility for at least 13 weeks,  suffering a long-term illness or injury for at least 13 weeks and unable to do paid work because of the illness or injury, or  under 16 years old. It was intended that these exemptions could be applied or adjusted in periods that would otherwise be time barred but the Amendment Act does not achieve this outcome.

Effective date The proposed amendments would take effect on 8 January 2023. Background Between 8 January 2023 and 3 February 2023, a series of fronts crossed the upper North Island delivering extremely heavy rain, high winds, and widespread flooding in the Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Northland, and Waikato regions. Then, between 12 February 2023 and 16 February 2023, Cyclone Gabrielle moved across the North Island, also resulting in heavy rain, high winds, and flooding. These weather events impacted taxpayers’ businesses and livelihoods. In response to the events, the government enacted several provisions that provided tax relief from income tax and fringe benefit tax for certain aid in the form of cash and benefits provided by employers to flood-affected employees. In addition, the government enacted a provision that provides for the tax-free provision of accommodation to employees who are required to relocate and work on projects of limited duration for rebuilding or recovery in areas covered by the North Island floods. This existing provision extends the time limit for a “project of limited duration” from three to five years and applies to employees starting work at that workplace in the period commencing on the starting date of the relevant flooding event and ending six months after that date.

In addition, since the flooding provisions were enacted, other government legislation covering the flooding events has been enacted that uses a different definition of the flooding areas. This definition is wider than the one that was originally used in the tax legislation. The proposed amendments align the definition of “North Island flooding events” with the definition of the affected areas in the Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023 for consistency across government.

1\. Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Even if the trustee tax rate is aligned with the top personal tax rate, there will continue to be opportunities to circumvent that rate by substituting trusts with companies or portfolio investment entities (“PIEs”). However, trusts are a completely different legal structure and they are not complete substitutes for PIEs or companies. For example, some trusts have investments (such as businesses controlled by settlors or beneficiaries, like farms and small- to-medium enterprises) that could not be put into PIEs. Furthermore, trusts have certain tax advantages that companies do not, such as being able to distribute capital gains immediately to beneficiaries tax free and to stream distributions to different beneficiaries. This reduced level of substitutability means changes to the trust taxation rules are likely to be worthwhile, even if no changes are made to the taxation of companies or PIEs. Issues relating to the taxation of companies/shareholders and PIEs are outside the scope of this RIS. ... and existing rules should be sufficient to mitigate over-taxation in most cases Some trusts with settlors and beneficiaries on lower tax rates could be over-taxed if the trustee tax rate is increased to 39%. Existing rules can mitigate this as they allow income of a trust to be taxed at a beneficiary’s marginal tax rates if the income is allocated to the beneficiary as beneficiary income. Beneficiary income can be credited or paid to a beneficiary, or it can be allocated to the beneficiary for them to receive at a future date (such as when they reach a particular age). There will be situations where income is not allocated to beneficiaries. This includes when: • there is a lack of information regarding the beneficiaries of a trust so income cannot be allocated; • the trustees do not yet know which beneficiaries to allocate income to; or • non-tax reasons for keeping income in a trust are prioritised (such as protecting income from creditors or against relationship property claims). Where the existing mechanism is clearly insufficient, special rules can be introduced to mitigate over-taxation. However, without undertaking public consultation, there is a risk that there are barriers we have not identified which would prevent trusts from mitigating over- taxation. Detailed design We consider two special rules are necessary at this stage to ensure the proposal addresses the under-taxation of trustee income and mitigates over-taxation. Public consultation is needed to determine whether any additional rules are required. Rule to buttress a 39% trustee tax rate We recommend a rule to prevent beneficiary income allocations to corporate beneficiaries being used to circumvent the 39% rate. A company can be a beneficiary of a trust. Under current law, income allocated as beneficiary income to a corporate beneficiary is taxed at 28% (the company tax rate). Treating such allocations as trustee income for the purposes of determining the rate of tax (39%) and who pays the tax (trustees) would ensure that trustees cannot circumvent a 39% rate by sheltering income in a corporate beneficiary. We propose limiting the application of this integrity rule to certain trusts to ensure that the use of trusts in large corporate groups would not be affected. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] companies. This issue is more pronounced for PIEs than for trusts because companies are more substitutable for PIEs than for trusts. Reduced substitutability for trusts Ministers have decided to progress increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts) while considering PIE and company/shareholder misalignment issues on a longer timeframe. Even if the trustee tax rate is aligned with the top personal tax rate, there will continue to be opportunities to circumvent that rate by substituting trusts with companies or PIEs. However, trusts are a completely different legal structure from companies and PIEs, and they are not complete substitutes. • Substitutability with PIEs: Some trusts have investments that earn large amounts of income that could not be put into a PIE. These are primarily businesses that settlors or beneficiaries control, such as farms and small-to-medium enterprises. While the general population may not have many of these investments, they represent a large amount of the assets of high-income investors. • Substitutability with companies: Trusts have certain tax advantages that companies do not. Capital gains derived in trusts can be distributed immediately to beneficiaries tax free, whereas capital gains can only be extracted from a company upon liquidation or as a taxable dividend. Trusts can also stream distributions to different beneficiaries and can be used for asset protection in a way that companies cannot. Also, the company and dividend tax rules are relatively more comprehensive than the trust tax rules. Therefore, there are some important advantages that would counteract, to a degree, the incentive for taxpayers to shift income from trusts to companies. This reduced level of substitutability means changes to the trust taxation rules are likely to be worthwhile, even if no changes are made to the tax treatment of PIEs or companies. Raising the trustee tax rate to 39% will still raise revenue in a relatively low compliance cost way, while better meeting the Government’s distributional objectives. However, we will continue to monitor the effect of the trustee rate as well as monitoring other structures that could be used to undermine a 39% trustee tax rate. Consultation with stakeholders and through the select committee process may bring to light such structures. Ministers’ commissioning Ministers have commissioned development of a policy proposal to address misalignment between the trustee and top personal tax rates and to raise revenue for Budget 2023. The requirement to develop policy options and detailed design in time for Budget 2023 limits the available time for policy development. Issues relating to the taxation of PIEs and companies/shareholders are outside the scope of this RIS. Administrative and delivery constraints Trade-offs are required in determining whether to progress any of the options analysed in this RIS. The systems, administrative and delivery impacts on Inland Revenue need to be considered in the context of other work being progressed on the wider Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. It is expected that a large initial system development would be required to support this proposal. In addition, it is expected that any of the options outlined in this RIS will result in Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] ongoing customer contacts. However, it is difficult to determine the exact impact on Inland Revenue until final policy decisions have been made on all Budget 2023 initiatives that impact on Vote Revenue. Quality of data and evidence Limited available data Our ability to determine whether the proposals will have a disproportionate impact on certain groups or types of trusts is limited. New Zealand does not have a trusts register, and outside of the recently introduced trust disclosure rules or income tax returns filed by trusts with Inland Revenue, there is limited available data. Trust disclosure rules Increased trust disclosure requirements were introduced for the 2021–22 and later income years to help evaluate the effectiveness of the 39% top personal tax rate and gain insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees. The constraint of needing to develop policy proposals in time for Budget 2023 limits the ability to use information from the recent trust disclosure rules. This is because most trusts can file their first returns under these rules as late as 31 March 2023, after the policy development of these proposals. Since the larger, more complex trusts file close to 31 March, there would have been significant limitations in using interim data as it may not have been representative of the domestic trust population. The Trusts Act 2019 came into force in January 2021 and introduced greater transparency and compliance requirements for trusts. With the trust disclosure rules and the Trusts Act both coming into force in 2021, Inland Revenue’s most recent full year of data (the 2020–21 income year) will largely precede the current regulatory environment for trusts. HWI research project Inland Revenue’s HWI research project is due to be completed in April 2023. Data collected as part of that project was not used in the development of these proposals. Limitations on consultation Inland Revenue and Treasury officials worked closely together on the development of the proposals. Due to Budget sensitivity constraints, we have not been able to consult with external stakeholders on these proposals. Without undertaking public consultation, there is a risk that there are barriers we have not identified that would prevent existing rules from being fully effective in mitigating over-taxation for some trusts. To partially mitigate the inability to undertake public consultation during the Budget preparation period, we have: • worked closely with internal Inland Revenue trust experts; • researched overseas jurisdictions that have broadly similar tax regimes and trust laws to New Zealand (Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States); • drawn on issues arising from the previous misalignment between the trustee tax rate and top personal tax rate in the 2000s; • undertaken targeted consultation with certain public sector agencies: o the Financial Markets Authority – Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko o the Ministry of Justice – Te Tāhū o te Ture o the Public Trust Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Table of Conte nts Regulatory Impact Statement: The Taxation of Trustee Income .................. 1 Coversheet ................................................................................................. 1 Purpose ...................................................................................................... 1 Problem Definition ...................................................................................... 1 Executive Summary .................................................................................... 1 Limitations and Constraints on Analysis...................................................... 3 Quality Assurance ...................................................................................... 6 Table of Contents ....................................................................................... 7 Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem ............................................... 9 Current tax law ........................................................................................... 9 International comparisons ........................................................................... 11 Tax planning using a trust ........................................................................... 11 Other uses for trusts ................................................................................... 12 Misalignment in the 2000s .......................................................................... 12 2020 decision to introduce a new top personal tax rate .............................. 13 Current landscape ...................................................................................... 14 Over-taxation and under-taxation................................................................ 15 What is the policy problem or opportunity?

A trust is a relationship where a person (the trustee) holds property for the benefit of another person or persons (beneficiaries). The settlor is the person who creates the trust and is the source of trust property. A settlor can also be a trustee and a beneficiary of the same trust, provided there is more than one beneficiary. The main legal feature of a trust is the separation of legal and beneficial ownership of the trust property between the trustee and beneficiaries. 2. A discretionary trust is a trust where the distributions to the beneficiaries are subject to the trustee’s discretion. A fixed trust, or non-discretionary trust, is a trust where the trust deed specifies how the assets of the trust are to be distributed exactly. Tax law does not distinguish between discretionary trusts and fixed trusts, and most domestic trusts in New Zealand are discretionary trusts. 3. The annual income of a trust is taxed as it is derived, either to the trustees or to the beneficiaries of the trust. Trustees of a trust are treated as a single taxable unit and their trustee income is calculated separately from their personal income. If there is more than one trustee, each trustee is jointly and severally liable for any tax. 1 4. Beneficiary income is all income earned by a trust in an income year which “vests absolutely in interest” in a beneficiary during the income year or is “paid” to a beneficiary before the trustee files the trust’s tax return. 2 The definition of “pay”, for an amount and a person, includes to: • distribute the amount to them; • credit them for the amount; or • deal with the amount in the person’s interest or on their behalf in some other way. 5. That is, income does not need to be distributed to a beneficiary to be beneficiary income; the income can be allocated to a beneficiary. Provided the trustees cannot change their mind about the allocation (i.e., the income is vested absolutely in the beneficiary), the income is considered beneficiary income and is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rates. 1 Sections HC 2 and YA 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 2 Section HC 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that income derived by a trustee during an income year will be taxed as beneficiary income if it vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year, or is paid to a beneficiary by the later of: • 6 months following the end of the income year in which the income was derived; and • the earlier of: o the date on which the trustee files its tax return; and o the date by which the trustee is required to file its tax return under section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] there is no further tax when the tax-paid trustee income is later distributed to the beneficiary. 14. These tax benefits mostly relate to income derived from capital rather than from labour. Capital income can be shifted to a trust without constraint simply by shifting ownership of the assets. However, it can be more difficult to shift labour income to a trust. Labour income is normally taxable to the person providing the labour. O t h e r u s e s f o r t r u s t s 15. In 2012, the Law Commission found that trusts appear to be established for the following main reasons: for family succession planning, to protect assets from creditors, to ensure separate assets (i.e., non-relationship assets) are protected from relationship property claims, to operate businesses efficiently, to provide for family members with special needs, for investment schemes and innovative commercial arrangements, and to provide for philanthropic or charitable activities. Trusts are also used for less acceptable purposes, including to avoid income and assets tests used by the Ministry of Social Development to assess eligibility for state assistance, to defeat known creditors, and to defeat the equal sharing regime under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. 11 16. A settlor can retain effective control of trust property by also being a trustee. They can also retain effective control by having powers to appoint new trustees, remove existing trustees, or appoint additional beneficiaries. A settlor can also retain enjoyment of trust property by being a beneficiary or having close family members who are beneficiaries. Trusts, therefore, may allow settlors to retain the benefits of ownership of property transferred to a trust while avoiding the burdens and risks of ownership. M i s a l i g n m e n t i n t h e 2 0 0 0 s 17. Since the introduction of the current tax regime for trusts in 1989, the trustee tax rate has been 33%. This rate was chosen intentionally to achieve alignment with the top personal tax rate, and it has only fallen out of alignment during the two periods since 2000 when the top personal rate was 39%. 12 11 Law Commission (November 2012) Review of the Law of Trusts: Preferred Approach (lawcom.govt.nz) from \[1.20\] to \[1.22\]. 12 A 39% rate on income over $60,000 was introduced for the 2000–01 and later income years; this threshold was increased to $70,000 from 1 October 2008. The top personal rate was lowered to 38% for the 2009–10 income year and then further lowered to 33% from 1 October 2010. The current 39% rate on income over $180,000 was introduced for the 2021–22 and later income years. Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] settings for income derived by a trust and not allocated to a particular beneficiary at that time. Existing settings, or alignment of the trustee and top personal tax rates, may over-tax some lower-rate individuals... 30. A beneficiary (who could also be a settlor) with personal income of less than $70,000 has a marginal tax rate that is below 33%. If income is retained in a trust as trustee income and later distributed to a beneficiary who has a marginal tax rate below 33%, that income would be taxed at a higher rate than their personal income. This is an existing risk in the tax system that would be exacerbated if the trustee tax rate is raised. As noted above, there are cases where it is appropriate to tax a beneficiary at a rate higher than the rate that would apply to their personal income, particularly if the beneficiary is a minor and is a relative of the settlor (the minor beneficiary rule). However, there are other cases where taxing a beneficiary at a higher rate could result in over-taxation. 31. A similar argument can be made when considering the marginal tax rate of a settlor of the trust – as many trusts are effectively a gifting mechanism used by settlors to provide property to beneficiaries over time. Attributing trustee income to the principal settlor 19 (as income from property that has not yet been completely gifted to a beneficiary) could be an option for how trustee income should be taxed. This approach is explored in more detail in Section 2 (Option 2). 32. Table 6 shows that in the 2021 financial year, the median trustee income was $8,000 and 68% of trusts (120,000 trusts) reported less than $180,000 of trustee income each ($2,500m in aggregate, or 14% of trustee income). 24% of trusts (23,000) had only beneficiary income. The majority of trusts therefore have relatively small amounts of trustee income. This illustrates that while increasing the trustee tax rate as proposed would likely be progressive, some trusts with lower-rate beneficiaries may be over-taxed. ... however, existing rules should be sufficient to mitigate over-taxation in most cases 33. Existing rules should be sufficient to mitigate over-taxation in most cases. Trustees can allocate income to a lower-rate beneficiary as beneficiary income, instead of treating it as trustee income. This allows the income to be taxed at the beneficiary’s lower personal tax rate, rather than the higher trustee tax rate. However, this may result in additional compliance costs for trusts. 34. Since a settlor can also be a beneficiary of a trust, this approach can be used in situations where the settlor is alive, is a beneficiary of the trust, and has a lower personal tax rate than the trustee tax rate. Trust income can be allocated to the settlor as beneficiary income and taxed at the settlor’s lower rate. If the settlor does not want to retain the income, they can settle that income back on the trust as corpus. Distributions of corpus to beneficiaries are not subject to tax. This approach effectively allows income to be taxed at the settlor’s lower rate while still being retained in the trust for later distribution to beneficiaries. This is an approach available under current law – however, in Section 2, Option 2 considers whether to make this approach mandatory for income retained as trustee income when there is a living principal settlor. 35. However, there may be situations where it is not desirable or possible for income to be allocated to lower-rate beneficiaries. As a result, some level of over-taxation may not be preventable under existing settings. This issue is covered in more detail in Section 3. 19 A “principal settlor” is the settlor who has made the greatest settlement on a trust. Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Retaining income as trustee income results in under-taxation... 36. Trustee income is currently taxed at 33% but is exempt from tax on subsequent distribution to beneficiaries, even if those beneficiaries are on a 39% personal tax rate. Example 1: 39% tax rate beneficiary Amena has personal income of over $180,000 per annum and is a beneficiary of a trust. $50,000 has been retained in the trust as trustee income (with a tax liability of $16,500 at the 33% trustee tax rate). In the following year, the tax-paid trustee income ($50,000 less $16,500 tax = $33,500) is distributed to Amena. This distribution is not subject to tax. That income has only been subject to a 33% tax rate, and Amena does not need to pay the 6% difference between the 33% trustee tax rate and the 39% personal tax rate despite earning over $180,000. If the income was earned directly by Amena as personal income, the tax liability would be $19,500 at the 39% tax rate. ... and this is a much larger problem than over-taxation in terms of total income 37. As noted in Table 5, most trustee income (78%, or $13.3 billion out of $17.1 billion, for the 2021 financial year) is concentrated in a relatively small number of trusts (5%, or 14,000 out of 177,000 trusts). That is, under-taxation is a larger problem than over- taxation in terms of total income. This does not mean that all this income is under-taxed, as it does not take into account the number of settlors or beneficiaries (or their personal tax rates), but it is an indication that there is a significant amount of under-taxation. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 38. The Government’s stated long-term revenue objective is to “ensure a progressive taxation system that is fair, balanced and promotes the long-term sustainability of the economy, consistent with the debt and operating balance objectives”. 39. Medium-term fiscal pressures may require the Government to have the flexibility to raise more revenue in the future. The primary way of doing this is through adjusting rates on the Government’s chosen tax bases, rather than piecemeal reforms through the base maintenance work programme. 20 40. The Government currently raises revenue from three main tax bases: personal income tax, company tax and goods and services tax (“GST”). The personal income base is a key tax base, raising around 50% of total tax revenue. The system of personal tax rates and thresholds is designed to reflect the Government’s view on how progressive the tax system should be. However, misalignment, combined with the current tax rules for companies and shareholders, makes it difficult for governments to raise revenue through the personal tax base in a way that is consistent with the Government’s revenue strategy and economic strategy objectives. 41. Misalignment arises when the marginal tax rate that applies to an individual’s income is higher than the tax rate that applies when income is earned through a company or a trust. The ability to raise more revenue from the personal tax base is significantly constrained because of misalignment between the 39% top personal tax rate and the 20 The aim of a base maintenance work programme is to repair and maintain our tax rules so that existing tax bases are as fair and efficient as they can be. While base maintenance measures will sometimes raise revenue, their primary aim is to improve the efficacy of the tax system.

This misalignment allows the top personal tax rate to be circumvented and reduces the progressivity of the income tax system.

A key factor in considering options to address misalignment between the trustee tax rate and the top personal tax rate is whether an option moves in the direction of a robust and sustainable tax system. To help achieve this, any reform should: • ensure trusts cannot be used to circumvent the 39% personal tax rate; • minimise the over-taxation of lower-rate individuals where possible, particularly for trusts with only lower-rate settlors and beneficiaries; and • raise revenue for Budget 2023.

Options to address misalignment of the trustee tax rate and top personal tax rate have been assessed against the following criteria. • Under-taxation: Does the option ensure that trusts cannot be used to circumvent the top personal tax rate? • Over-taxation: Does the option result in lower-rate individuals being over- taxed? • Complexity: Is the option easily understood? Does the option increase the complexity of the tax system? • Coherence and sustainability: Does the option make sense in the context of the entire tax system? Is the option future-proofed? • Revenue impact: How would the option impact tax revenue? • Administrative and delivery implications: How would the option impact Inland Revenue? When can the option be delivered by? • Compliance costs: How would this option impact taxpayers? W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 44. Based on Ministers’ commissioning, options are considered in the context of developing policy proposals in time for Budget 2023. The level of detail on some of the more complex options is limited due to time constraints. 45. The options in this RIS focus on the tax rules for trusts. Wider issues relating to misalignment between the company, PIE and top personal tax rates are outside the scope of this RIS. 46. Changes to the trust disclosure rules introduced for the 2021–22 and later income years are outside the scope of this RIS. Inland Revenue is scheduled to undertake a post- implementation review of those rules in 2023, after a full year’s worth of data has been disclosed (after 31 March 2023). W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? 47. We have considered the following options: • Option 1 – Increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% with modifications for certain trusts with lower-rate settlors and beneficiaries, if necessary. • Option 2 – Taxing trustee income at the principal settlor’s personal tax rate. • Option 3 – Introducing an imputation-style system for trustee income, similar to what is currently in place for companies and Māori authorities. 48. We also explored the following alternative approaches. These options were ruled out in early policy development and are not covered in any detail due to their significant limitations in addressing the problem definition: Regulatory Impact Statement | 20 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] • Retaining the 33% trustee tax rate but requiring 39% rate individuals (i.e., individuals that earn over $180,000) to pay a top-up tax at 6% on distributions of trustee income. This would ensure trust income that is distributed to 39% rate individuals is taxed at 39%. This option was ruled out due to administrative complexity and because the additional 6% tax on trustee income could be deferred by delaying distributions of trustee income to 39% rate individuals. The additional 6% tax could also potentially be completely avoided by deferring distributions until a 39% rate individual is on a lower rate (e.g., when the individual is working part-time or has retired) or by streaming taxable distributions to lower-rate beneficiaries and tax-free distributions (corpus and capital gains) to higher-rate beneficiaries. This approach would also be a significant departure from the current trust taxation regime for a small group of individuals. Compared with other options, this option might only partially achieve the objective of ensuring trusts cannot be used to circumvent the 39% top personal tax rate and it is unclear if this approach would raise revenue for Budget 2023. • Introducing specific anti-avoidance provisions. This was ruled out because it would involve high administrative costs and (depending on how well the provisions are enforced) may not meet the objectives of ensuring trusts cannot be used to circumvent the 39% top personal tax rate and raising revenue for Budget 2023. • Taxing trustee income on a progressive tax scale up to 39%. While this option has the appeal of mitigating any over-taxation that might arise with a flat trustee tax rate, it was ruled out because it would create significant tax planning opportunities. Complex aggregation rules would be needed to ensure taxpayers do not settle multiple trusts to take advantage of the progressive tax scale and enforcing those aggregation rules would involve significant administrative costs. This option could result in a reduction in revenue compared with the status quo, especially if the aggregation rules are not applied consistently, and trusts would continue to be used to circumvent the 39% top personal tax rate. It is likely that none of the objectives being sought in relation to this policy problem would be satisfied. O p t i o n a n a l ysis Option 1 – Increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% with modifications for certain trusts with lower-rate settlors and beneficiaries, if necessary 49. This option would align the trustee tax rate with the top personal tax rate at 39%. The trustee tax rate would continue to be a final tax imposed in the year income is derived. Under-taxation 50. Increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% would ensure that trustee income is not under- taxed when the income is accruing for the benefit of beneficiaries (who could also be settlors) whose personal income, plus their income from trusts, exceeds $180,000. A 39% trustee tax rate would improve the robustness of the tax system by increasing the likelihood that income attributable to 39% rate individuals is subject to the appropriate amount of tax. This option would also improve the sustainability of the tax system by minimising revenue leakage under existing settings. 51. As outlined above in the limitations section, even if the trustee tax rate is aligned with the top personal tax rate, there will continue to be opportunities to circumvent that rate by substituting trusts with companies or PIEs. However, trusts are a completely different legal structure from companies and PIEs, and they are not complete substitutes. Regulatory Impact Statement | 21 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] • Substitutability with PIEs: Some trusts have investments that earn large amounts of income that could not be put into a PIE. These are primarily businesses that settlors or beneficiaries control, such as farms and SMEs. While the general population may not have many of these investments, they represent a large amount of the assets of high-income investors. • Substitutability with companies: Trusts have certain tax advantages that companies do not. Capital gains derived in trusts can be distributed immediately to beneficiaries tax free, whereas capital gains can usually only be extracted from a company upon liquidation or as a taxable dividend. 21 Trusts can stream distributions to different beneficiaries and can be used for asset protection in a way that companies cannot. Also, the company and dividend tax rules are relatively more comprehensive than the trust tax rules. Therefore, there are some important advantages that would counteract, to a degree, the incentive for taxpayers to shift income from trusts to companies. 52. This reduced level of substitutability means changes to the trust taxation rules are likely to be worthwhile, even if no changes are made to the tax treatment of PIEs or companies. Raising the trustee tax rate to 39% will still raise revenue in a relatively low-cost way, while better meeting the Government’s distributional objectives. Over-taxation 53. Aligning the trustee tax rate with the top personal tax rate may result in distributions of tax-paid trustee income to lower-rate beneficiaries being taxed above the beneficiaries’ marginal tax rates. This may be appropriate, for instance in the case of a discretionary trust where the beneficiary is a minor and a relative of the settlor (the minor beneficiary rule). In cases where it is not appropriate, there are options to mitigate this. 54. An existing rule allows income earned by a trust to be taxed at a beneficiary’s personal tax rate if the income is allocated or paid to the beneficiary during the income year or within an extended period following the end of the income year. There may be situations where this existing rule would not effectively prevent over-taxation. Other jurisdictions have rules to address specific situations. Modifications to address risks of over-taxation are covered in detail in Section 3, although it is important to note that the inability to undertake public consultation during the Budget preparation period means we have had to make judgements and recommendations based on limited data. We expect further information to come to light on the over-taxation risks posed by a 39% trustee tax rate once the proposals become public. 55. If a trust retains income as trustee income because the trustees have not decided which beneficiary to allocate the income to, the income should be taxed at the trustee tax rate. It is not over-taxation if the 39% rate applies in this situation, as the settlors/trustees have retained control over the income. Complexity 56. Depending on the design of any potential modifications (Section 3), this approach is the least complex option – it fits within the existing tax regime for trusts and does not involve any significant structural reform. 21 Available subscribed capital can also be distributed through share repurchases, funded by capital gains, without liquidation of the company. Regulatory Impact Statement | 22 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Coherence and sustainability 57. Aligning the trustee and top personal tax rates supports the coherence of the tax system. The trustee tax rate was intentionally aligned with the top personal tax rate when the current trust tax regime was introduced in 1989, and it has only fallen out of alignment during the two periods since 2000 when the top personal tax rate was 39%. 58. This option improves the sustainability of the tax system by reducing misalignment pressures between the trustee and top personal tax rates. In principle, this option should be robust to changes to the personal tax system provided the trustee tax rate (once it is aligned with the top personal tax rate) remains aligned with that rate. However, we have not considered the impact of any potential changes to the personal tax system in detail. Revenue impact 59. The amount of revenue this option would raise is highly uncertain and heavily dependent on the behavioural response by trustees. If more income is diverted to other entities or is allocated as beneficiary income instead of being retained as trustee income, less revenue will be raised through the taxation of trustee income. Examples of behavioural responses by trustees include: • Restructuring out of trusts: Taxpayers could substitute trusts with PIEs or companies, however these entities are not fully substitutable, as noted above. • Reducing income derived by trusts: A large proportion of trustee income is dividend income (see Figure 1) and could be easily diverted into other entities or retained in companies. • Beneficiary income allocations to individuals: Trustees could allocate income as beneficiary income to beneficiaries of the trust on lower personal tax rates. • Beneficiary income allocations to companies: Trustees could appoint a company as a beneficiary and allocate beneficiary income to the corporate beneficiary (taxed at 28%). This matter is covered in more detail in the “Rule needed to buttress proposed 39% rate” subsection of Section 3. 60. The introduction of any modifications to this option would likely reduce the revenue raised from increasing the trustee tax rate. Furthermore, any fiscal impact would also depend on whether changes to the taxation of PIEs and companies are progressed – if they are, this option could raise more revenue. 61. With these caveats, a costing produced in 2020 for the introduction of the 39% personal tax rate indicated that increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% with no modifications was estimated to raise approximately $350m per annum (based on the income data at that time). That estimate was based on most of the relevant income being taxed at 39% and only assumed a moderate behavioural response. The timing lag relates to information flows: the first year of affected tax returns needs to be filed before the additional income tax is recognised, and the second tax year and part of the third tax year is simultaneously accrued based on that new information. Regulatory Impact Statement | 24 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] for simply changing the trustee tax rate to 39% and implementing some simple modifications would be 1 April 2024. More complex modifications would require additional time, and the earliest implementation date for such changes would be 1 April 2025. Compliance costs 66. Depending on the design of any modifications, this option is not expected to have a significant impact on compliance costs for trusts. Relying on paying or allocating income as beneficiary income to mitigate over-taxation could result in increased compliance costs for trustees in determining who to allocate income to each year. However, this is a decision that already needs to be made by trustees. 67. Some trusts with only lower-rate settlors and beneficiaries may consider themselves unfairly impacted by the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Such trusts may never have a 39% rate settlor or beneficiary, yet they will be forced to decide whether to allocate income to mitigate over-taxation and may face increased compliance costs as a result. Taxpayers may consider this particularly unfair when they are using trusts for non-tax reasons, such as to protect assets from creditors or relationship property claims, and allocating income as beneficiary income could undermine those non-tax reasons. Option 2 – Taxing trustee income at the principal settlor’s personal tax rate 68. Instead of trustee income being taxed at a flat rate (as under the status quo or Option 1), such income could be taxed at the principal settlor’s 22 “trust-affected” personal tax rate in the year the income is derived by the trust. This rate would be determined by taking into account both the settlor’s own personal income and the trustee income of any trust for which they are a principal settlor. For trusts without a living principal settlor, trustee income would be taxed at 39% (similar to Option 1). 69. As noted above, this approach can already be voluntarily achieved by trustees under current rules. Trust income can be allocated to a settlor (as a beneficiary) as beneficiary income and taxed at the settlor’s marginal tax rates. The settlor can settle that income back on the trust as corpus – distributions of corpus to beneficiaries are not subject to tax. This option would achieve the same result but would make it mandatory. This would help ensure that trusts are not over-taxed due to the trustees/settlor not knowing about this approach or applying it incorrectly. Under-taxation 70. Applying the principal settlor’s trust-affected personal tax rate to trustee income could be appropriate for many trusts, given that settlors generally retain a large degree of effective control or influence over the trusts they settle property on. Many trusts are effectively a gifting mechanism used by settlors to provide property to beneficiaries over time, so taxing trustee income (as income from property that has not yet been completely gifted to a beneficiary) at the principal settlor’s trust-affected tax rate could be appropriate. 71. This option would ensure that the 39% tax rate would be paid on trustee income when, in aggregate, the trustee income and the principal settlor’s personal income exceeds $180,000. 22 A “principal settlor” is the settlor who has made the greatest settlement on a trust. Regulatory Impact Statement | 26 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] (such as a trust settled by a court to hold Māori land while the beneficiaries are being determined). 75. This option would be an improvement on the status quo in terms of under- and over- taxation, but it is unclear if the additional complexity (relative to Option 1) is justified. Determining the appropriate tax rate for trustee income for a year may require calculating a composite rate, based on the principal settlor’s personal income and the aggregate trustee income from all other trusts where the individual is also a principal settlor. This is unlikely to be administratively straightforward. Coherence and sustainability 76. This option could reduce the coherence of the tax system by introducing a new regime for the taxation of trusts with living principal settlors but retaining existing rules for other trusts. However, a settlor-attribution approach would help future-proof the tax system by ensuring there is no misalignment issue between the trustee and top personal tax rates, even if personal tax rates were to change in the future. Regardless of future changes to the personal tax system, this option would address under-taxation and mitigate over- taxation – albeit only for trusts with living principal settlors. Rules could potentially be developed for trusts that do not have living settlors, but these would be difficult to design and are likely to be complex. Revenue impact 77. The fiscal impact of this option has not been estimated due to limited time and the lack of detailed design at this stage. Given the complexities involved, any estimate would be premature and highly uncertain. Administrative and delivery implications 78. The estimated initial system development impact for Inland Revenue is small but this would depend on the detailed design of this option. Inland Revenue would need time to engage with its ecosystem partners, such as software providers, and this would be aligned to Inland Revenue’s regular annual change engagement process. Additional time would be required to develop a solution for all parties. The earliest implementation date would be 1 April 2025. 79. There would likely be a medium-sized initial administrative cost in the first year to support customer enquiries about the rates at which they have been taxed and the impact on their tax assessments. Ongoing administration costs for Inland Revenue are expected to be small. Compliance costs 80. This option would likely result in increased compliance costs for trustees of a trust with a living principal settlor. Trustees would need to know the personal income of the principal settlor of the trust. This could potentially be challenging to comply with if there are multiple trusts that need to be aggregated or if there is a new principal settlor part way through an income year. 81. There should be no compliance cost impact for trusts without a living principal settlor, as existing rules would apply. Regulatory Impact Statement | 27 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Option 3 - Introducing an imputation-style system for trustee income 82. There are other options that would integrate the taxation of trustee income with the personal income tax system. However, they would involve fundamental changes to how trustee income is taxed. One approach would be to introduce an imputation-style system for the taxation of trustee income, similar to what is already in place for companies and Māori authorities. 83. Trustee tax would still be paid in the year that trustee income is derived, either at the current 33% rate or at the 39% rate (to align with the top personal tax rate). Trusts would receive imputation credits for tax paid on trustee income, and those credits would be distributed to the beneficiaries who later receive that income. Distributions of trustee income to beneficiaries would be taxed at the beneficiaries’ personal tax rates, but beneficiaries would be able to offset their tax liability with any imputation credits from tax paid by the trust. Any surplus imputation credits could be refundable to the beneficiary, carried forward, or used to offset their tax liability for other income (such as employment income). Example 4: An imputation-style system for trustee income Thiago is the trustee of a discretionary trust with two beneficiaries, Indah and Matteo. In the 2024–25 income year, the trust derives $200,000 trustee income – this is taxed at 39%, resulting in $78,000 tax paid, leaving $122,000 after tax. This gives the trust $78,000 of imputation credits for the amount of tax paid. In the same year, Indah earns $200,000 personal income (with a marginal tax rate of 39%) and Matteo earns $30,000 personal income (with a marginal tax rate of 17.5%). Deferral disadvantage to lower-rate beneficiaries Two years later, in the 2026–27 income year, Thiago decides to distribute $30,500 trustee income, with $19,500 imputation credits attached (for a total of $50,000 tax-paid trustee income) to Matteo. Matteo still earns $30,000 personal income. This distribution brings Matteo’s taxable income to $80,000. Under the personal tax scale, $80,000 personal income results in a tax liability of $17,320. The imputation credits could satisfy the tax liability on the distribution of trustee income, and if Matteo can offset the imputation credits against his other personal income, then he would have no income tax to pay for that year. If the imputation credits are refundable, Matteo would receive a $2,180 refund at the end of the year. Although Matteo would be able to use the imputation credits to reduce his tax liability and receive a refund, he would be disadvantaged by having to wait for the income to be distributed from the trust. Deferral advantage to higher-rate beneficiaries In the 2029–30 income year, five years after the income was derived, Thiago distributes the remaining $150,000 trustee income to Indah (comprised of $91,500 after-tax trustee income and $58,500 imputation credits). Indah is in semi-retirement and only works part-time – her personal income is now only $30,000. The $150,000 distribution brings Indah’s taxable income to $180,000, with a tax liability of $50,320. Due to the amount of imputation credits, Indah could reduce her tax liability to nil and receive a refund of $8,180. Although the trustee income was taxed at 39% in the year it was derived when Indah was on a marginal tax rate of 39%, Indah would be able to benefit from the distribution being deferred until she was on a lower marginal tax rate. Regulatory Impact Statement | 28 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Under-taxation and over-taxation 84. This approach would help ensure that the ultimate recipients pay tax on distributions of trustee income at their personal tax rates in the year a distribution is received. Recipients on higher personal tax rates than the trustee rate (if the trustee rate remains at 33%) would pay additional tax. Depending on the specific design, surplus credits for recipients on lower personal tax rates could be credited against other tax liabilities, refunded, and/or carried forward for use in later years. 85. This option would likely improve the long-term robustness, sustainability, and flexibility of the tax system. It would be robust to different designs of the personal tax system. The ability to shelter income permanently in a trust would be greatly limited, regardless of the specific trustee or top personal tax rates, and concerns regarding over-taxation would be mitigated. 86. However, if the trustee tax rate remains at 33%, there would be a delay between the year in which tax is paid on trustee income by the trustees and the year in which additional tax is paid by beneficiaries. Similarly, regardless of what trustee tax rate applies, there would be a delay between the year in which tax on trustee income is paid and the year in which lower-rate beneficiaries get the benefit of surplus imputation credits. This is similar to the existing situation for natural person shareholders of a company, although a larger deferral benefit currently applies to income earned in companies. • Deferral benefit for high-rate beneficiaries: There would be a deferral benefit for higher-rate beneficiaries if the trustee tax rate that applied in the year income is derived by a trust remained lower than the top personal tax rate. The Government would not receive the additional income tax payable on trustee income until that income is later distributed to the higher-rate beneficiary. If the income is not distributed until the beneficiary is on a lower rate (e.g., once the beneficiary is only working part-time or has retired), no additional tax would be paid, even if the beneficiary was on the 39% top personal tax rate when the income was originally derived by the trust. This issue could be resolved by also increasing the trustee tax rate to 39%. • Deferral disadvantage for beneficiaries on lower rates: There would be a deferral disadvantage for beneficiaries on a personal tax rate lower than the trustee tax rate. The Government would receive the benefit of income retained as trustee income being taxed at the higher trustee tax rate in the year the income was derived, and lower-rate beneficiaries would not receive the benefit of surplus credits until trustee income is later distributed. This disadvantage would be exacerbated if the trustee tax rate was increased to 39%. Complexity 87. This option would be significantly more complex to design than Options 1 or 2, given it would involve a significant departure from the current trust taxation regime. Further consideration would need to be given to: • Continuity and commonality requirements for imputation credits – should a beneficiary be allowed to receive imputation credits for tax that was paid before they became a beneficiary of the trust? Or should it be a requirement that to receive imputation credits from a trust, a person must have been a beneficiary of the trust in the income year to which the credits relate? Regulatory Impact Statement | 29 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] • The treatment of surplus credits – should beneficiaries be allowed to offset these against other income (e.g., employee income)? Should surplus credits be refundable? Or should beneficiaries just be able to carry surplus credits forward to offset against any future tax liability arising from trustee income that is distributed to them in the future? • Anti-streaming rules – these would be required to prevent trustees from streaming tax-exempt distributions (such as capital gains or corpus) to higher-rate beneficiaries and streaming tax-paid trustee income to lower-rate beneficiaries (who would have surplus credits, which could be refundable depending on how this option is designed). • Distributions to minors – the minor beneficiary rule is currently the only defence in the law against income-splitting (apart from anti-avoidance rules, such as in the case of personal services income derived through trust structures). Would a special rule have to apply to trustee income that is distributed to a minor beneficiary to ensure allocations of trustee income are not used to split income with minors? 88. If the trustee tax rate remains at 33%, this option would allow tax planning opportunities. For example, 39% rate settlors could defer distributions of trustee income until later in life, when they have less income and lower personal tax rates. This is currently possible with closely-held companies but not with trusts. Coherence and sustainability 89. This option would improve the coherence of the tax system by implementing similar rules to the imputation system for companies and the Māori authority tax regime. Parallels could be drawn from these existing systems in terms of both policy design, implementation, compliance, and education – however the unique features of discretionary trusts would mean this would not be seamless. 90. This option would also improve the sustainability of the tax system by integrating the taxation of trusts with the personal tax system. The ultimate recipients of income derived by trusts would pay tax at their personal rates – although there would be deferral issues, as noted above. An imputation system could also improve social policy targeting. Distributions of trustee income would form part of a beneficiary’s personal income and therefore would count towards the abatement of social policy measures, such as Working for Families. Administrative and delivery implications 91. This option would require large-scale initial system development for Inland Revenue, and the detailed design of the rules may need to take into account the requirements and limitations of software providers. Although Inland Revenue currently administers an imputation credit system for companies and Māori authority credits, it is expected that significant development would be required to achieve the policy outcomes as described. Inland Revenue would need time to engage with its ecosystem partners, such as software providers, and this would be aligned to Inland Revenue’s regular annual change engagement process. However, additional time would be required to develop a solution for all parties. The earliest implementation date would be 1 April 2025. 92. There would likely be a medium to large initial administrative impact for Inland Revenue in the first year to support trustees with understanding the new rules and to help individuals understand the impact on their tax assessments. Ongoing administration costs for Inland Revenue are expected to be medium. Regulatory Impact Statement | 30 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Compliance costs 93. Despite the existing imputation systems for companies and Māori authorities, experience suggests that both taxpayers and their agents find imputation one of the most challenging aspects of the tax system, so extending it to trusts could require a significant educational effort and ongoing support for taxpayers and their agents. 94. Additional compliance costs would arise from trustees needing to maintain memorandum accounts for imputation credits and understanding and complying with complex anti- streaming and integrity rules. W e l l-b e i n g a n d e c o n o m i c c o n s i d e r a t i o n s 95. All three options considered above would have similar well-being and economic impacts. 96. The options would all raise additional revenue in ways that support the Government’s distributional objectives, as they would prevent taxpayers from circumventing the top personal tax rate on their individual income. Therefore, all options would likely strengthen the sense of fairness in the tax system (social cohesion) through improving horizontal and vertical equity. The counter to this is that Option 1 could result in some individuals being over-taxed if income is retained in a trust as trustee income and later distributed to lower-rate beneficiaries, which could result in a perception of unfairness. 97. All options would likely have less benefit by themselves than they would as a package of three measures addressing misalignment across the tax system, including changes to the tax treatment of PIEs (or at least PIEs that are not KiwiSaver or other retirement savings schemes) and changes to the tax treatment of companies/shareholders. This is because increased taxes on trusts would inevitably result in some leakage of revenue to entities such as PIEs and companies, which would reduce the effectiveness and economic efficiency of the trust tax changes. There would also be some compliance costs incurred if assets or business activities were to be shifted from a trust to another entity. However, as discussed above, PIEs and companies are not fully substitutable for trusts. 98. Even by themselves, the changes would likely support fairness, economic efficiency, and well-being. While an increase in the absolute amount of tax raised would inevitably give rise to some economic costs, the options discussed above would broaden an existing tax base and make it harder for people to circumvent the personal tax scale. The additional economic costs per dollar of revenue raised would likely be lower than many alternatives because broader tax bases are generally more efficient than narrower tax bases. Māori perspectives 99. The tax system provides specific tax rules for Māori organisations who manage and own communal assets for the benefit of whānau Māori, hapū, and iwi. Māori organisations that are eligible to apply these rules are called Māori authorities and are taxed at 17.5%. These rules were purpose-built to meet the unique characteristics and circumstances of how Māori own and manage communal assets and pursue their specific development outcomes. Changes to the Māori authority tax rules are outside the scope of this RIS. 100. We would expect that most trusts used by Māori for communal ownership purposes would, in principle, be eligible to be taxed as Māori authorities. Therefore, our initial view is that the objectives and options of the proposals in this RIS are unlikely to impact Māori Regulatory Impact Statement | 31 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] development outcomes or present a barrier to sustainable prosperity and resilience for whānau Māori and future generations. 101. Due to Budget sensitivity constraints, we have been unable to publicly consult on the impact of these proposals. In the absence of full public consultation, the impact of the proposals on broader considerations of well-being beyond the use of trust structures by Māori, including any boundary matters relating to the interpretation of the Māori authority rules, is not fully understood. However, during policy development officials did undertake limited engagement with Te Tumu Paeroa – the Office of the Māori Trustee. This engagement focused on the reasons why a trust might choose not to elect to be a Māori authority. Very few trusts handled by Te Tumu Paeroa are not Māori authorities for income tax purposes, and as mentioned above, Māori authorities are not expected to be affected by these proposals. Distributional impacts 102. We consider that all three options would increase the progressivity of the tax system. However, the available data is limited. As noted in Table 5, 2020–21 tax returns indicate that a relatively small number of trusts (5%) earn most trustee income (78%). In addition, data from the Household Economic Survey 2018 (HES 2018) suggests that net-worth decile 10 households 23 hold 40 percent of their wealth in non-financial (generally property) and financial assets in family trusts. Some of the non-financial assets, such as principal residences, would not generate any taxable income, so would not be impacted by any tax change. However, other assets may generate taxable income streams. Impact on investment, savings, economic efficiency, and broader well-being 103. All three options increase the tax paid by trusts so that the top personal tax rate would apply to individuals with incomes over $180,000 more so than at present. This would mean a higher level of tax on income earned in trusts, including income from business investments undertaken by trusts. 104. While there may be impacts on specific investments (for example, in business or rental properties) and savings, these are unlikely to have a large effect on aggregate capital stock, productivity or wages. It would not give rise to the same level of concern about increases in the costs of capital (or hurdle rates of return) that an increase in the company tax rate might do. This is because non-residents are unlikely to be significant participants in New Zealand-based trusts; they mainly invest in New Zealand through companies. While New Zealanders on the top personal tax rate would obtain lower after-tax returns from investing through trusts, these would be the same as the after-tax returns they receive from investing directly. 105. Some specific impacts of increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% (Option 1) are set out here. The magnitude of all these impacts is uncertain but is unlikely to be large. There are many factors that influence decisions to invest other than the trustee tax rate. These impacts are an inevitable consequence of reducing opportunities for individuals to side- step the top personal tax rate and seeking to have a fairer tax system: • Under-taxed assets: A higher trustee tax rate would increase the incentive to invest in lightly-taxed assets, such as owner-occupied housing. 23 Note that some individuals in net worth decile 10 would be in lower income deciles. Regulatory Impact Statement | 32 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] • Rental housing: Current Inland Revenue data suggests about 16% of rental properties are held in a trust. 24 A higher trustee tax rate would have a mixed impact on investments in rental housing. To the extent rental income is subject to a higher tax rate, this could reduce incentives to invest in rental property. It could therefore put downward pressure on house prices and/or increase rents. However, to the extent rental properties derive untaxed income, in the form of capital gains, any increased tax may encourage investment in rental properties over other forms of investment. • Business investment: Increasing the trustee tax rate may impact incentives to invest in businesses through trusts, including farming and commercial property. To the extent that existing integrity issues remain with companies and shareholders, this may result in restructuring rather than a reduction in investments. Such restructuring would likely result in some one-off compliance costs. • Labour income: Increasing the trustee tax rate would reduce the return on labour income earned through a trust. However, most labour income is not earned through trusts, so increasing the trustee tax rate would improve fairness by ensuring a broader set of individuals pay tax according to the personal scale. • Savings: Increasing the trustee tax rate may reduce incentives for those on higher marginal tax rates to accumulate savings in trusts. Conversely, a higher tax on savings means individuals would need to save more to reach a savings goal. This makes the overall impact on savings hard to determine. • Investment in different entities: Consistent taxation of income earned through different entities can also promote the efficient organisation of income-earning activities. If investors in less efficient business structures can pay less tax than those investing in more efficient business structures, investment may be distorted towards the less efficient business structures (which is not desirable). Removing distortions means businesses can be organised in the most efficient way. 24 Inland Revenue’s Residential Rental Property Data Model suggests that 43,080 2019–20 tax returns indicated that trusts were involved with residential rental income (out of a total of 269,346 residential rental property filers).

Due to the inability to conduct public consultation during the Budget preparation period, there is significant uncertainty regarding the exact impact of increasing the trustee tax rate to 39%. 110. The amount of revenue raised is highly uncertain and heavily dependent on the behavioural response by trusts. The more income that trusts divert to other entities or allocate as beneficiary income instead of paying tax at the trustee tax rate, the less revenue that will be raised. Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 39 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Section 3: Deta iled de sign 111. This section covers detailed design of Option 1 (Increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% with modifications, if necessary), specifically focusing on issues relating to mitigating any risks of over-taxation and whether additional rules are necessary to buttress the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Other consequential matters are covered in the appendix. R u l e n e e d e d t o b u t t r e s s p r o p o s e d 3 9 % r a t e 112. To buttress the 39% trustee tax rate, we recommend a rule to prevent income allocations to corporate beneficiaries being used to circumvent the rate. A company can be a beneficiary of a trust. Under current law, income allocated to a corporate beneficiary is taxed at 28%. In the context of a family trust, this is generally not appropriate for a number of reasons. 113. The real beneficiary of such an allocation is the ultimate natural person shareholder in the company. The allocation should be taxed at the marginal tax rates of that person or persons. There is no reason for taxing the income earned by a trust and allocated to a company in the same way as income earned directly by the company. 114. If the shareholder of the corporate beneficiary is the trust that is making the allocation, the allocation achieves nothing. The income effectively remains within the trust. The principal, or in many cases only, effect of the allocation is to ensure that the income is taxed at 28% rather than the trustee tax rate. While a subsequent distribution of the income by the company to the trust will be taxable as a dividend (with imputation credits attached), such a distribution may never be made. 115. Currently, allocations of income to corporate beneficiaries are not common in New Zealand, outside certain specialised contexts. However, the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate to 39% would significantly increase the attractiveness of making such allocations. These allocations are a major issue in Australia, where the trustee tax rate is 47% and the corporate tax rate is often 25%. Australian officials have told us that it is common, for instance, for income to be allocated by a trust to a corporate beneficiary owned by the allocating trust (referred to as a “bucket company”) but for the cash to be retained in the trust or lent to a high-rate individual beneficiary, with the loan outstanding indefinitely. They have told us that these kinds of transactions give rise to significant compliance problems. 116. The difference between the 28% corporate tax rate and the current 33% trustee tax rate does not seem to motivate this behaviour in New Zealand. However, we think it is likely that the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate, and the greater differential between the corporate and trustee tax rates, would lead to similar practices and problems in New Zealand to those already experienced in Australia. To give just one instance of a problem, the tax law might need to be amended to ensure that an allocation to a company that is not paid in cash gives rise to a loan by the company to the trust, which in turn gives rise to a deemed dividend if the loan is not subject to interest. Such rules would inevitably involve a high level of complexity. 117. Accordingly, to ensure that trusts cannot allocate beneficiary income to companies to circumvent a 39% trustee tax rate, a rule should be introduced so that income allocated to corporate beneficiaries is taxed as trustee income for the purposes of determining the rate of tax (39%), who pays the tax (the trustees) and who provides the return of income (the trustees). This rule should be limited to corporate beneficiaries that are “close Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 40 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] companies” 25 and where a settlor of the trust has “natural love and affection” 26 for a (direct or indirect) shareholder of the company. This ensures that the rule is targeted towards family trusts and would not affect the commercial use of trusts in large corporate groups. This is very similar to the treatment of income allocated to minor beneficiaries under the minor beneficiary rule. Example 5: Income allocated to corporate beneficiary Meriope is a beneficiary of a trust. She has a personal tax rate of 39%. The trust has derived $100 of income (this is (1) in the diagram). To avoid the $100 being taxed at the 39% trustee tax rate, the trust allocates the income to a corporate beneficiary as beneficiary income (this is (2a)). The income is taxed at the 28% rate in the hands of the company. The trust then loans $100 to Meriope (this is (2b)). The $100 is not taxable income in the hands of Meriope. Overall, only $28 of tax has been paid on the income. However, $39 of tax should have been paid on the income, since the $100 has actually gone to Meriope (via the loan from the trust). Under the proposal, the $100 allocated to the company would be taxed at the 39% trustee tax rate. $39 of tax would be paid on the income. 118. Treating beneficiary income allocations to these corporate beneficiaries as trustee income will avoid the under-taxation that would otherwise arise if the income were taxed at the corporate rate. It should not give rise to over-taxation. A family trust will not make an allocation to a corporate beneficiary unless the company is owned by one or more of the other beneficiaries or the trust itself. If one or more of those shareholder beneficiaries is on a lower rate, the trust can allocate the income directly to that person to prevent over-taxation. If the corporate beneficiary has a real need for funds, either the shareholder beneficiary or the trust on their behalf can invest the money in the company by way of either debt or some form of capital contribution. 119. We note that this rule would not prevent trusts from restructuring in response to an increased trustee tax rate, for example, by transferring the ownership of income- producing assets to companies owned by trusts or investing in PIEs. However, as discussed above, companies and PIEs are not completely substitutable for trusts. This reduced substitutability would limit the degree to which trusts are able to shift assets to circumvent the 39% rate. 25 A “close company” is a company where five or fewer natural persons or trustees hold more than 50% of the voting interests in the company (treating associated persons as one person). 26 “Natural love and affection” is an existing concept in tax law. It is used to describe an action by a person where the motive is induced not by a promise of something in return, but by the natural love and affection the person has for another. Natural love and affection is generally considered to subsist between relatives, whether by blood, marriage, a non-spousal domestic relationship, or adoption. It can be present between close friends as well, although not ordinary acquaintances or colleagues. Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 41 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Financial implications 120. This rule would help ensure the estimated revenue raised by increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% is not negatively impacted by the use of corporate beneficiaries by trusts to avoid the 39% rate. The rule is not expected to result in any additional revenue over the forecast period. Administrative and compliance implications 121. Although this rule is broadly similar to the current minor beneficiary rule, we expect that taxing beneficiary income allocations to certain corporate beneficiaries as trustee income would have a small administrative impact on Inland Revenue. This would include helping trustees understand the new rules and amending forms and guidance. This rule may result in some trusts changing their behaviour or restructuring to ensure they are not affected by the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. F u r t h e r a n a l y s i s o f t h e r i s k o f o v e r-t a x a ti o n 122. Beneficiary income is the primary method that trustees can use to mitigate risks of over- taxation under current law. As discussed above in the “Current tax law” section in Section 1, beneficiary income is trust income that is paid or allocated to the trust’s beneficiaries before the trust’s tax return is filed. There are three main types of beneficiary income: • Income distributed or paid to a beneficiary. • Income allocated to a beneficiary that is credited to the beneficiary’s current account. • Income that is allocated to a beneficiary for them to possess at a future date or event (e.g., when they reach a certain age). 123. If trust income is retained and taxed as trustee income, a 39% trustee tax rate may result in over-taxation, particularly for trusts with only lower-rate settlors and beneficiaries. However, in most circumstances where a trust only has lower-rate settlors and beneficiaries, trustees should be able to mitigate over-taxation by allocating income to beneficiaries (including a living settlor in their capacity as a beneficiary of the trust) as beneficiary income, so that the income is taxed at the beneficiaries’ personal tax rates. This is the method that comparable jurisdictions mostly rely on to mitigate over-taxation. 124. The following sections outline the risks of over-taxation that we are aware of for various types of trusts. Due to the inability to undertake public consultation during the Budget preparation period, there may be some situations where trusts could be over-taxed at a 39% trustee tax rate that we have not been able to identify. T r u s t s f o r w h i c h m o d i f i c a t i o n s a r e r e q u i r e d Estates 125. Estates are taxed as trusts, with the executor or administrator of an estate considered a trustee for tax purposes. If an amount of income would have been included in a deceased person’s income had they still been alive when it was received, the income is considered income of the trustee. Generally, estates are subject to the same tax rules as trusts. Therefore, estates can allocate income as beneficiary income to mitigate over-taxation. 126. Some estates have no choice but to retain income as trustee income if the affairs of the deceased person are still being worked through and the beneficiaries (and their interests) Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 43 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Example 6: Modification for estates Ortus dies on 20 February 2025. He had received $50,000 of personal income in the income year of his death. His estate derives $10,000 of income before 31 March 2025, and another $10,000 after 31 March 2025 but before 20 February 2026 (i.e., within 12-months of Ortus’s date of death). The affairs of Ortus’s estate are still being worked through, so the income received by the estate is considered trustee income for tax purposes. The estate chooses to apply the modification to the income it derives. Instead of the $20,000 of trustee income being taxed at 39%: • the $10,000 of trustee income in the 2024–25 income year is taxed at Ortus’s marginal tax rates. The combination of Ortus’s $50,000 of personal income and the $10,000 trustee income falls within the 30% personal income tax bracket ($48,001 to $70,000); and • the $10,000 derived by the estate in the 2025–26 income year is taxed at 10.5% because it falls within the $0 to $14,000 personal income tax bracket). 129. We understand that many estates are wound up within 12 months of a person’s date of death, so allowing the modification to apply for this length of time may be sufficient for many estates. However, without public consultation, it is difficult to determine the appropriate length of time for this modification. If the period is too long, this modification would create incentives to delay the distribution of assets to the beneficiaries. Engagement with stakeholders once these proposals are made public would help refine how long this modification should apply. Financial implications 130. Introducing a modification for estates would have an estimated fiscal cost of $5 million per annum for the 2025–26 and later fiscal years. Administrative and compliance implications 131. A modification for estates is not expected to result in a significant increase in compliance costs for estates. It will likely require amending the tax return for estates, communicating the new rules to taxpayers, and assisting estates with queries regarding their tax treatment. T r u s t s f o r w h i c h m o d i f i c a t i o n s s h o u l d n o t b e r e q u i r e d 132. This section of the report sets out trusts for which we explicitly considered the risk of over-taxation but concluded that modifications should not be required based on the information we currently have. Without undertaking public consultation, there is a risk that there are barriers we have not identified that would prevent existing rules being fully effective at mitigating over-taxation for these trusts. We expect our decisions on the necessary modifications to be challenged and tested once the proposals become public and that consultation with stakeholders could bring unexpected concerns to light. Fixed trusts 133. A fixed trust is a trust when the trust deed specifies how the assets of the trust are to be distributed exactly. Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 44 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Existing rules should mitigate over-taxation for fixed trusts... 134. We understand that almost all trust deeds of fixed trusts provide trustees with a power of advancement, so trustees have the discretion to bring forward allocations of beneficiary income in advance of the future event (e.g., the beneficiary attaining a particular age) specified in the deed. However, without undertaking public consultation, we have no data on how prevalent the power of advancement is in fixed trusts. 135. To prevent over-taxation for fixed trusts with lower-rate beneficiaries, the trustees of these trusts could exercise a power of advancement to allocate income as beneficiary income, so that the income is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rates. If the trustees do not want the beneficiary to have access to that income until the future date or event specified in the trust deed, they could allocate the income to the beneficiary as future possession beneficiary income. Future possession beneficiary income is still taxed at the beneficiary’s rate in the year the income is derived, even though the income does not become available to the beneficiary for their possession until sometime in the future. However, allocating income as future possession beneficiary income may result in additional compliance costs when compared with distributing or allocating the income for immediate access. ...so a modification should not be required 136. Since existing rules should be able to mitigate over-taxation for fixed trusts where the trustees have a power of advancement, we do not consider it necessary to introduce a modification for these trusts. Trusts for disabled people 137. The Law Commission’s 2012 review of trust law noted that some trusts are established to provide for family members with special needs (“disability trusts”). 28 However, the Law Commission’s papers do not provide data on the number of disability trusts or how they are used. Without public consultation, it is unclear how many disability trusts there are in New Zealand or how they are used. We consulted the Ministry of Justice – Te Tāhū o te Ture, the Public Trust and Whaikaha – Ministry of Disabled People during the development of these proposals, but they were unable to provide data on how many trusts are used to support disabled people in New Zealand. Existing rules should be sufficient to mitigate over-taxation for disability trusts... 138. The needs of a disabled beneficiary can likely be met by trustees paying or allocating income to the disabled person as beneficiary income. Beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rates rather than the trustee tax rate, so a modification for these trusts should not be necessary. However, it is possible these trusts may face barriers to using existing rules to mitigate over-taxation that we are not aware of because we have not been able to publicly consult on the potential impacts of the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. 139. For disability trusts, paying or allocating beneficiary income to an intellectually disabled beneficiary may be undesirable if it means the beneficiary has immediate access to the income. However, this is not solely a tax issue. As a general matter, we expect that beneficiaries with impaired decision-making capacity will have an agent acting on their 28 Law Commission (November 2012) Review of the Law of Trusts: Preferred Approach (lawcom.govt.nz) from \[1.21\].

In these situations, allocating income as beneficiary income would likely be sufficient to mitigate over-taxation. 140. Similar to other trusts, if trustees know they will allocate income to a particular beneficiary but do not want the beneficiary to have access to the funds until sometime in the future, they could either allocate to the settlor (as a beneficiary) to access the settlor’s tax rate or allocate income to the disabled beneficiary as future possession beneficiary income. Refer to the “Current tax law” section in Section 1. ...overseas regimes have low uptake and seem to have non-tax objectives... 141. Australia has a special regime for disability trusts. The regime was mainly put in place for social policy reasons, although it does provide a special tax treatment for disabled beneficiaries of these trusts. Uptake of the Australian regime has been very low – there are only approximately 1,000 special disability trusts in Australia. Given the population of Australia is significantly larger than the population of New Zealand, if a modification for disability trusts were to be introduced in New Zealand and uptake were similar to that of Australia’s regime, it is likely that any modification introduced in New Zealand would only be used by a very small number of trusts. 142. Although Canada, the UK, and the US have special regimes for these trusts, like Australia these regimes seem to be predominantly focused on providing social assistance rather than tax relief for disabled people. By contrast, the objective of any modification put in place in New Zealand would be to ensure disability trusts are not over- taxed if the trustee tax rate is increased to 39%. ...and a modification would be difficult to design 143. Based on the limited information available to us at present, we do not think a modification for disability trusts is required to mitigate over-taxation. However, public consultation would help us confirm whether this is correct. 144. If a modification is necessary to mitigate over-taxation for disability trusts, we recommend consulting the disabled community on its design. Our research on similar regimes overseas shows that a modification for disability trusts would likely be complex and would require drawing boundaries that may be difficult to target correctly without input from the disabled community. Designing a modification for disability trusts would involve considering various issues, including: • What rate should apply instead of the trustee tax rate? To prevent both under- and over-taxation, ideally the beneficiary’s marginal tax rates would apply to any trustee income of a disability trust. This would be relatively straightforward for trusts with only one beneficiary. If a disability trust was allowed to have multiple disabled beneficiaries, or a mix of disabled and non-disabled beneficiaries, it would be challenging to determine how trustee income should be apportioned or taxed. A simplification could be to either (i) tax trustee income at a lower flat rate for disability trusts, or (ii) tax trustee income at the highest personal tax rate of the disabled beneficiaries. If Ministers decide to introduce special rules, we do not recommend either of these approaches without first consulting the disabled community to further understand how these trusts are used. • Should disability trusts be allowed to have more than one beneficiary? The modification would be simpler to administer and comply with if disability trusts were only allowed to have one beneficiary. This is the approach taken in Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 46 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Australia. One disadvantage of this approach is that any existing trusts with multiple disabled beneficiaries would need to restructure or set up new trusts to access the modification. Multiple disabled beneficiaries could be allowed, however, as noted above, this would require arbitrary or complex rules on how trustee income should be taxed. • How should “disability” be defined? There are risks with defining who the modification should apply to without consulting the disabled community. A simple way to define “disability” would be to link the definition to the receipt of Government support payments (such as the Supported Living Payment on the ground of restricted work capacity, or the Child Disability Allowance). A key risk of defining “disability” in this way is that disabled people who do not receive those support payments would not be able to access the modification. There are risks with creating a bespoke definition, especially without public consultation, as Inland Revenue lacks the expertise to both design and apply such a definition. • Should specific rules apply if a trust ceases to be eligible for the modification? After tax on trustee income is paid at the disabled beneficiary’s marginal tax rates or a lower flat rate, the trustees may decide to add further non-disabled beneficiaries (or disabled beneficiaries with higher marginal tax rates) to the trust. The trust would no longer qualify for the modification, but trustee income that has previously been taxed at a lower rate because of the modification might still be retained in the trust. If that retained income is then distributed to those new beneficiaries, they would be able to benefit from the modification. There is a risk that this could allow higher rate individuals to benefit from income being taxed on another person’s lower marginal tax rates. We have identified three possible responses: i. Clawback mechanism: If trustee income is taxed at a lower (<39%) rate under the modification, the distribution of that income to a person other than the disabled beneficiary could be subject to a clawback mechanism. This would ensure that disability trusts do not provide tax planning opportunities and would minimise any under-taxation of trustee income. However, such a mechanism would likely be punitive. ii. Specific anti-avoidance rule: Instead of a clawback mechanism, a specific anti-avoidance provision could be introduced to target the use of disability trusts to obtain a tax benefit for non-disabled beneficiaries. iii. No specific rules: No specific rules would be introduced to prevent the use of disability trusts in tax planning, although if restrictive eligibility criteria are put in place (such as requiring these trusts to have only one disabled beneficiary) this should be sufficient to minimise tax planning opportunities. The existing general anti-avoidance rule should be sufficient if the modification is used to avoid tax. 145. Given Ministers’ concerns regarding disability trusts (refer to “2020 decision to introduce a new top personal tax rate” subsection in Section 1), we have considered how such a modification should be designed. Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 48 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] “Widely-held” trusts 147. Although “widely-held” is a misnomer when describing a trust (because apart from a unit trust, a trust is not owned or held), it is a useful term to informally describe trusts that have a large number of beneficiaries (e.g., trusts with more than 100 beneficiaries, with beneficiaries that are associated persons treated as 1 beneficiary). Inland Revenue data shows a large variety in these types of trusts, 29 and that this group includes trusts in large corporate groups, estates and family trusts. 148. As outlined above, the main defence against over-taxation is for trustees to allocate or pay income as beneficiary income to ensure that the income is taxed at a beneficiary’s lower marginal tax rates. Widely-held trusts may face an increased risk of over-taxation... 149. Widely-held trusts may have an increased risk of over-taxation because they may face practical limitations (such as difficulties collecting beneficiaries’ IRD numbers), and they have different behaviours and motivations when compared with family trusts with fewer beneficiaries. As a result, widely-held trusts may also choose to treat all their income as trustee income for simplicity, regardless of the specific circumstances of the individual beneficiaries. 150. Some Māori land trusts will have large numbers of beneficiaries. However, we expect these trusts will be eligible to be Māori authorities. Trusts that are Māori authorities are subject to a bespoke tax regime and are taxed at 17.5%. However, as noted in the “Well- being and economic considerations” subsection of Section 2, the inability to undertake public consultation during the Budget preparation period with relevant Māori groups limits our understanding of the potential impacts of a 39% trustee tax rate. ...but existing mechanisms should be sufficient to address risks of over-taxation for these trusts 151. While there is a risk of over-taxation for widely-held trusts, we do not consider it appropriate to provide special rules for trusts simply because they have a large number of beneficiaries. Trustees of a discretionary trust would be able to easily add beneficiaries to the trust simply to satisfy a “widely-held” definition. Generally, we expect that existing mechanisms would be sufficient to address risks of over-taxation for widely-held trusts. 152. Without undertaking public consultation, it is difficult to determine whether there are legitimate risks of over-taxation in this group. We expect affected taxpayers will want to provide feedback on this issue once the proposals are made public. Energy consumer trusts 153. Most electricity distribution companies in New Zealand are owned by trusts or local councils. The electricity industry was reformed in the 1990s, resulting in the ownership structures of most energy companies being standardised through trusts settled in accordance with the Energy Companies Act 1992. 30 29 There are significant limitations in this analysis. Trustees are not required to disclose details of beneficiaries that do not receive a distribution to Inland Revenue. Therefore, this analysis is based on trusts that are making distributions to beneficiaries and may be less likely to be at risk of over-taxation. 30 Some energy companies are not owned by trusts, but by local councils or have foreign ownership.

Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 would be required to implement the proposals. These changes are proposed to be included in an omnibus taxation Bill, scheduled to be introduced on Budget night, 18 May 2023. The Bill is expected to progress through the full select committee process and be enacted after the 2023 General Election and before the end of March 2024. The proposals are recommended to apply for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most trusts), with a commencement date of 1 April 2024. 164. Inland Revenue currently has a significant Tax and Social Policy Work Programme utilising the majority of the department’s specialist design and delivery capacity. The Budget 23 work programme is proposed to be implemented primarily between September 2023 and April 2025 with significant implementations required for 1 April 2024 and 1 April 2025. The accumulative delivery effort during a compressed period presents potential risks to successful delivery due to the volume of design and development work, limited specialist capability and extensive testing. This will impact Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver other initiatives and services to support customers. 165. Inland Revenue provides services within a wider ecosystem which includes 3 rd Party Software Developers, Payroll Providers, and Intermediaries. The Budget 2023 initiatives will also require these partners to make significant system changes with short lead in times and compressed timeframes which may result in delivery risk and impacts on partnership relationships. 166. Inland Revenue will work with stakeholders and tax intermediaries on communicating the proposals to affected taxpayers. The specifics of any education campaigns and communications strategies will be considered once policy proposals are further developed. The usual guidance will be published on the proposed changes on Inland Revenue’s website and in a Tax Information Bulletin shortly after the proposals are enacted.

The inability to undertake public consultation during the Budget preparation period is a risk. However, stakeholders and affected parties will have the opportunity to provide input on the proposals through the select committee process, refining the quality of the legislation. There will likely be issues and barriers that have not been identified due to the lack of consultation. 168. We do not expect to need to collect any further data – the recently introduced trust disclosure rules will help monitor the effectiveness of the proposals. Inland Revenue is scheduled to undertake a post-implementation review of those rules in 2023. 169. Inland Revenue will continue to monitor the outcomes through the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP), including a focus on the risks of over-taxation and other structures that could be used to undermine a 39% trustee tax rate. An advantage of consultation through the select committee process is that it may bring to light such issues. 170. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly.

Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 53 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] Appe ndix: Consequential issues 171. This section covers a range of issues that arise as a consequence of increasing the trustee tax rate to 39%. We have considered whether changes are needed in response to these issues but do not consider any necessary at this stage. M i n o r b e n e f i c i a r y r u l e 172. Beneficiary income derived by a minor (under 16 years old) from property settled on a trust by a relative or legal guardian, or an associated person of the relative or legal guardian, is subject to tax at the trustee tax rate. This is an integrity measure to prevent parents, other relatives, or guardians from splitting their income with children. A 39% trustee tax rate would increase the incentive for trustees to allocate amounts to beneficiaries on lower incomes, particularly children 16 years or older. 173. Due to the limited time for policy design, we have not considered potential changes to the minor beneficiary rule in detail. Consideration of whether the minor beneficiary rule is fit-for-purpose would benefit from public consultation and further policy consideration. R e s i d e n t w i t h h o l d i n g t a x 174. Resident withholding tax (RWT) is deducted at 33% from dividends by the payer before the recipient receives the dividend. RWT is intended to help taxpayers that receive investment income to pay their tax throughout the year. We do not think it is necessary to increase the RWT rate on dividends. Although a significant proportion of income derived by trusts is dividend income, such a change would affect many recipients of dividends that are not subject to a 39% rate. P r o v i s i o n a l t a x 175. Provisional tax for a year is generally paid in three instalments. Under the standard option, provisional tax is calculated based on the taxpayer’s prior year’s residual income tax plus 5% or 10% when the taxpayer has an extension of time to file their prior year’s tax return (and has not yet filed it). 176. The use of money interest regime incentivises taxpayers to pay their entire residual income tax for the year by the final provisional tax instalment, as after that date interest will accrue on any difference between the amount paid and the taxpayer’s residual income tax liability. Therefore, practically, taxpayers will pay the total tax owing on the final instalment date. 177. For the first two years of the proposed 39% trustee tax rate, the standard option would be based on the tax liability under a 33% trustee tax rate and could thus underestimate the amount of tax that trusts need to pay. This could result in trusts underpaying tax in their first two instalments and having a higher catch-up third instalment. 178. We do not think it is necessary to make any changes to the provisional tax rules. Providing special rules to address this transitional issue would be complex and extremely difficult to implement. The provisional tax rules were not amended when the top personal tax rate of 39% was introduced. Given that taxpayers are already incentivised to pay their liability at the final instalment, this issue is a small timing difference overall. Regulatory Impact Statement – The Taxation of Trustee Income | 55 \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] \[SENSITIVE\] 185. Increasing the trustee tax rate from 33% to 39%, without changing the tax rate on taxable distributions from non-complying trusts, would erode the time value of money calculation. Therefore, increasing the trustee tax rate from 33% to 39% would increase the benefit from deferring or avoiding New Zealand tax on trustee income for non-complying trusts. ...but no change is required at this stage 186. Although increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% would erode the time value of money factor of the 45% rate, we do not consider it necessary to increase the tax rate on taxable distributions from non-complying trusts. The rate is already relatively high, and other 45% tax rates were not increased when the 39% top personal tax rate was introduced.
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] This Regulatory Impact Statement is limited to the Pillar Two GloBE rules, it does not s 9(2)(f)(iv) Inland Revenue does not know for certain if a critical mass of countries will adopt the GloBE rules 1 . At this stage it seems likely this will be achieved as the general consensus amongst New Zealand’s main investment partners is positive with regards to the design of the GloBE rules. It is uncertain however, when countries’ GloBE rules will become effective such that they would apply to tax New Zealand MNEs. Whilst the OECD’s original intention was for the rules to be effective in 2023, given that the rules are still not finalised it seems that an effective date in 2024 or possibly 2025 is more likely. cover other international tax initiatives such as Pillar One • Pillar One – this aims to ensure a fairer distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest and most profitable MNEs around the world. It is intended that Pillar One will replace unilateral digital services taxes (DSTs). • Pillar Two – as set out in this paper, this seeks to put a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax (i.e. the GloBE rules) that countries can use to protect their tax bases. 2. Forecasting expected tax revenue There are limitations on Inland Revenue’s ability to forecast the potential revenue that will be raised by introducing the GloBE rules including: • Elements of the design are yet to be finalised, including safe harbours (where the rules will not apply). • GloBE will have a deterrent effect (i.e. MNEs will be less likely to engage in profit shifting, thus leaving their income in New Zealand) this behavioural change is difficult to quantify. • GloBE tax raised will depend on the reaction by other governments (i.e. whether and how they introduce the GloBE rules) and by MNEs (i.e. whether they restructure to move assets out of low tax countries). The OECD has provided models that aid participating countries in preparing estimates of the expected tax revenue based on a number of assumptions, which have been used to prepare forecasts. 3. Estimating the administrative cost The administrative requirements of the GloBE rules are still being designed. Inland Revenue have prepared the estimated build cost on the basis of: • similar regimes that have been implemented, and • a conservative estimate of the additional requirements unique to the GloBE rules. 1 For these purposes a “critical mass” means enough countries adopt the GloBE rules that it is not possible for New Zealand MNEs to escape the tax by earning income only in countries which do not adopt the rules. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the pillars will avoid negative economic implications of a protracted tax and trade related conflict, estimated to reduce global GDP from between 0.1 percent to 1.2 percent. 2 Indeed, countries which introduce unilateral measures can face tax and trade tension, consequently, the OECD 3 have been mandated by the G20 to facilitate the design and delivery of multilateral solutions with the OECD-sponsored Inclusive Framework (IF). 4 In October 2021, the G20/OECD two Pillar solution was endorsed by over 130 countries in the IF, including New Zealand: • Pillar One aims to ensure a fairer distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest and most profitable MNEs around the world. It is expected that USD 100 billion of profits will be reallocated to market jurisdictions each year. It is intended that Pillar One will replace unilateral digital services taxes (DSTs) • Pillar Two seeks to put a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax that countries can use to protect th eir tax bases. It is estimated that Pillar Two will generate around USD 150 billion in additional global tax revenues per year. 5 This endorsement did not bind any country to adopt either Pillar, rather it gave the OECD a mandate to continue to develop the rules and instruments with the contribution of the IF ready for implementation and ratification in participating states. This Regulatory Impact Statement considers the Pillar Two measures only. New Zealand has a comparatively high corporate tax rate, consequently, it benefits from multilateral measures aimed at reducing pressure to lower corporate tax rates. In the absence of this proposal, there is an incentive for foreign owned intellectual property to be moved out of New Zealand and for New Zealand MNEs to develop their intellectual property outside New Zealand. To that end, New Zealand has been actively participating in the IF to ensure the GloBE rules result in an outcome as advantageous to New Zealand as possible. GloBE tax rules The GloBE rules are designed to ensure that in-scope MNEs pay at least a 15% effective tax rate (ETR) on their income in each country where that income is reported for financial reporting purposes. An important aspect of the rules is that they only apply to income in a country in excess of a substance-based income exclusion. The exclusion is calculated under a formula which gives 2 OECD (2020), Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Economic Impact Assessment, retrieved from www.oecd.org 3 The OECD bring together a very high level of tax technical expertise and are very influential in international tax policy matters. 4 The IF brings together over 140 countries to collaborate on the implementation of the OECDs work, including the Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, which was delivered in 2015 and addressed gaps and mismatches in tax rules that were being exploited. 5 (OECD) 2021, OECD releases Pillar Two model rules for domestic implementation of 15% global minimum tax, retrieved from www.oecd.org Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] a percentage return on the value of tangible assets and payroll expense in the country. The exclusion is intended to focus the rules on the taxation of mobile forms of income. An in-scope MNE will follow three steps to work out if they are subject to any GloBE top-up tax which they will need to disclose in an annual GloBE information return which will be provided to every country in which they operate: 1. The MNE calculates its ETR by comparing the accounting tax expense in a country with its accounting profit (with some GloBE specific adjustments). 2. If the MNE’s ETR in a country is less than 15%, it calculates GloBE top-up tax, which is the tax required to bring the ETR on its mobile income in the country up to 15%. 3. The GloBE top-up tax is then allocated under the following rules: • The Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) which applies on a top-down basis, gives the ultimate parent entity (UPE), or in some cases an intermediate holding company, country the right to collect GloBE top-up tax for the MNE’s group entities. • The Under-Taxed Profits Rule (UTPR) applies as a back-up to the IIR. If no IIR applies to an MNE, the UTPR will allocate the GloBE top-up tax in proportion to the group’s payroll costs and tangible asset values in each participating country. The UTPR also allocates top-up tax for the UPE country. The UTPR protects the integrity of the IIR by discouraging MNEs from relocating to countries that do not implement the GloBE rules. The GloBE rules also allow a country to introduce a Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT) to apply the rules to income earned in that country. A DMT is optional. It gives a country priority over the Income Inclusion Rule and the Under-Taxed Profits Rule in the collection of the GloBE top- up tax for that country. In-scope MNEs will incur upfront and ongoing costs associated with building the systems or processes required to complete the GloBE information return. Given the complexity of the GloBE rules these compliance costs are expected to be significant in nominal terms, though given the size of the organisations to which they apply, they may be relatively insignificant. Compliance costs may also be reduced through the availability of safe harbours. The details and conditions of such safe harbours are still being developed and agreed by the IF. Implementation of the GloBE rules If a country adopts the GloBE rules, it must adopt the OECD’s Model Rules released in December 2021, its Commentary released in March 2022 and the Agreed Administrative Guidance released in February 2023. This is critical to ensuring that the rules operate in a co- ordinated way to achieve the desired tax outcomes. There would be a high risk of double taxation or double non-taxation if implementing countries adopted different rules to measure the level of taxation and top-ups required in each country. Similarly, there could be significant double taxation and disputes between countries and taxpayers if some countries do not respect the agreed ordering rules. What is the policy problem or opportunity? As a comparatively high tax rate country, the GloBE rules are inherently beneficial to New Zealand. The GloBE rules reduce the pressure on New Zealand’s corporate tax rate through setting a floor on the tax rates other countries can use to entice New Zealand MNEs to shift their mobile income to said countries (i.e. the lowest tax rate they can offer is a 15% effective tax rate). The GloBE rules also remove the need for New Zealand to develop unilateral rules which would risk making New Zealand a relatively less attractive place for an MNE to be based. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] By adopting the GloBE rules New Zealand would support the initiative by contributing to the critical mass required to make the rules effective. New Zealand would also collect any GloBE tax on New Zealand MNEs that have mobile income in other countries taxed at less than 15%. If New Zealand decides not to introduce the GloBE tax rules but a critical mass of other countries do • There will be tax leakage to other jurisdictions as New Zealand will not collect the GloBE tax in relation to New Zealand MNEs • New Zealand will still benefit by the disincentive to profit shift, given the applicability of foreign GloBE rules, in which case more income should be left in New Zealand to be taxed. • Inland Revenue will not incur the IT system build or ongoing administrative costs of implementing the tax • New Zealand MNEs in scope of Pillar Two (NZMNEs) 6 will need to comply with the GloBE rules and pay any GloBE taxes under the UTPR to every foreign jurisdiction they’re operating in which has introduced the GloBE rules (some of our larger NZMNE’s are operating in more than 30 countries). This will require more resource and will result in higher compliance costs on affected NZ MNEs than if New Zealand introduced the GloBE rules where the NZMNEs could comply with and pay any taxes to Inland Revenue. • New Zealand’s ability to influence the outcomes of the Pillar Two initiative at international fora, as they relate to New Zealand specific issues (e.g. capital gains or industry specific issues) would be more limited as well as any ongoing support a NZMNE may request. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? • Provide support for the multilateral initiative, which New Zealand have contributed to designing, to target the mischief that puts pressure on New Zealand’s corporate income tax rate. • Where a critical mass of countries implements the GloBE rules: o Ensure New Zealand collects the tax on NZMNEs GloBE tax liabilities. o Assist NZMNEs in complying with the GloBE rules by introducing the IIR in New Zealand which removes their need to comply with multiple UTPRs and therefore reduces their compliance costs. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? The criteria that have been used to assess the options are: Compliance costs: Does the preferred option meaningfully lower the compliance obligations and associated costs for NZMNEs? 6 It is expected there will be around 20-25 NZMNE’s in-scope of the GloBE rules Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Administration: Is the preferred option possible for Inland Revenue to implement and administer without substantial upfront and ongoing administration costs? Revenue raised: Does the preferred option raise tax revenue net of its cost to administer? Coherence: Does the option align with and support international norms around tax policy. What scope will options be considered within? The scope of options are, if a critical mass of other countries adopts GloBE, should New Zealand adopt GloBE or not? The option of N ew Z ealand adopting the GloBE rules if a critical mass of countries does not adopt the rules has not been considered, as it is unrealistic. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What options are being considered? Option One – New Zealand does not implement the GloBE rules (status quo) Where a critical mass of countries introduces the GloBE rules, NZMNEs will need to comply with multiple country under taxed profit rules (UTPR), the criteria noted above are assessed as follows: • This will result in a higher compliance obligation and associated costs through NZMNE’s needing to comply with multiple UTPR’s. • Inland Revenue will not be required to administer the rules nor respond to taxpayer queries on them. To the extent NZMNE’s face issues from the GloBE rules New Zealand would not be well placed to influence the outcome of these issues. • In terms of revenue raised, no tax revenue will be raised in New Zealand under Option One other than through any behavioural changes by NZMNE’s to retain in, or relocate mobile income to, New Zealand. To the extent New Zealand MNE’s are required to pay tax under the GloBE rules this will be to foreign jurisdictions (i.e. tax leakage). • On the impact of not introducing GloBE rules on the coherence of New Zealand’s tax system: o There may be a minor impact on New Zealand’s international tax reputation by not joining the critical mass. o Due to the mechanics of the GloBE rules, and that they would be applied by other countries in any event, there would be no practical effect of New Zealand not adopting the rules – the attractiveness of New Zealand as a destination for foreign investment, and as a place to headquarter an MNE group, would be unaffected. Option Two – New Zealand adopts the GloBE rules, if a critical mass of other countries do Where a critical mass of countries introduces the GloBE rules, NZMNE’s will need to comply with New Zealand’s income inclusion rules (IIR): • This will result in a lower compliance obligation and associated costs against the status quo, through complying with only one tax through Inland Revenue. • This option will have a higher administrative cost for Inland Revenue which will incur the upfront build costs as well as ongoing administrative costs. • Option Two raises tax revenue, where NZMNE’s have a GloBE tax liability it will be payable to New Zealand under the IIR (and possibly the DMT). The revenue generated should be above the costs of administration. • With regards to coherence, adopting GloBE rules would be consistent with New Zealand’s general approach to corporate income taxation, including cross-border, by supporting OECD initiatives. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • As a small country that relies on imported capital, New Zealand generally supports strong international rules-based frameworks, where the frameworks aim is to protect and enhance New Zealand interests and strengthen international cooperation. GloBE achieves this by reducing pressure on New Zealand’s corporate tax rate with no impact on New Zealand’s investment attractiveness. There are still some outstanding design issues with how the GloBE rules would interface with the New Zealand tax system such as the interaction with the New Zealand imputation regime and the mode of implementation of the GloBE rules 7 . Stakeholder views Whether New Zealand does or does not adopt GloBE if a critical mass of other countries does was the subject of an officials’ issues paper “OECD Pillar Two: GloBE rules for New Zealand” released on 5 May 2022. The officials’ issues paper canvassed the relevant options and went into further detail about incorporation into New Zealand’s tax framework and laws. Eleven submissions were received from a mix of representative bodies, advisors, non- government organisations and individuals. Officials met individually with submitters to discuss the content of their submissions and discussed the officials’ preferred options. Submitters generally supported New Zealand adopting the GloBE rules if a critical mass of other countries does. Submitters noted that: • It is in New Zealand’s interests to adopt GloBE rules as the goal of the rules, to disincentivise profit shifting by MNEs, aligns with the Government’s priorities. • The operation of the rules means that were New Zealand not to adopt GloBE rules, but a critical mass of countries does adopt, taxpayers would have the compliance costs regardless and there would be tax leakage to other jurisdictions. • Adopting GloBE rules in New Zealand would streamline and simplify compliance for NZMNEs making it easier for them to pay top up tax in New Zealand as opposed to paying tax under the UTPR to multiple jurisdictions. There was a general preference for NZMNEs to deal with Inland Revenue rather than other tax authorities. 7 The mode of implementation will be whether New Zealand tax legislation should directly incorporate the GloBE rules or simple reference these rules. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? The option that is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits is Option Two: implementing the GloBE rules into New Zealand if a critical mass of other countries do. The option has clear benefits over Option One (not implementing the GloBE rules if a critical mass of other countries do): it reduces compliance costs, ensures New Zealand is well placed to influence the outcomes of the global regime, is revenue positive and ensures New Zealand’s international tax system remains dynamic to future responses proposed by the OECD. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] reaction can materially impact this number. Total monetised benefits $20-25m Low Non-monetised benefits Low Low Our initial modelling, aided by the OECD’s global economic impact assessments indicate that the GloBE rules proposals will raise a modest amount of revenue. It is noted that there are a high number of assumptions in this model, as it is dependent on the final rules (in particular safe harbours), how and which countries implement the GloBE rules and the behavioural response of MNEs. Our forecast estimate of GloBE top-up tax revenue from New Zealand adoption is approximately $25 million per annum made up of: • $25 million per annum from GloBE top-up tax from applying the IIR to NZMNEs. This amount makes allowance for the possibility of other countries increasing their tax rates in response to Pillar Two to reduce the amount of top-up tax collected by us. We expect this revenue to increase over time as transitional concessions are unwound. • A further positive amount from the UTPR and the DMT, however it is not possible to estimate how much this will be because it is dependent on the behavioural reaction to the GloBE rule from governments and MNEs so has conservatively been forecast at zero. Inland Revenue have also estimated that the adoption of GloBE rules by other countries is likely to lead to increased income tax revenue of approximately $16 million per annum due to reduced profit shifting (i.e. this will occur irrespective of what option is chosen). From a cost perspective, the administration costs for Inland Revenue are dependent on the final design aspects, but have been provisionally estimated at $11.1m for the upfront build cost and $3.1m per annum in ongoing costs. Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? The proposal to introduce the GloBE rules into New Zealand is to be legislated via a taxation bill that is likely to be introduced in March 2023. The rules would apply by way of an Order in Council once a critical mass of countries have adopted the rules. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the new rules. No concerns have been identified with its ability to implement the proposal. Information will be provided to increase awareness regarding the new rules. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website along with any relevant press releases which might be issued advising taxpayers of the changes. Adopting these rules into domestic law would require legislative change. If the OECD Model Rules are incorporated by reference in domestic legislation, then legislative change would be simpler (i.e. a legislative change could be made to state that the OECD model rules have force in New Zealand’s domestic legislation). Greater legislative change would be required for replicating the rules into New Zealand legislation. Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] From an administration perspective, the preferred option would involve an upfront cost (preliminary estimates suggest circa $11.1m) to build functionality within START (Inland Revenue’s computer system). to enable for the sharing and receiving of GloBE information with other jurisdictions. Inland Revenue would need to exchange information with other countries, to the extent that NZ MNEs file returns that Inland Revenue must share with other countries which have implemented GloBE rules and where that MNE operates. How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? If the GloBE rules are implemented, the OECD will make any future changes to the model rules where necessary. Any changes to the OECD rules and or reporting will be reflected into domestic legislation in New Zealand 8 . Inland Revenue would also allocate resource to compliance initiatives to ensure that the information received is utilised and the correct amount of tax is paid. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with Inland Revenue about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be addressed either operationally, through discussions with the OECD, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. 8 Either by way of amending legislation or automatically if the OECD Model Rules are referenced in the domestic legislation.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] Problem definition 8. We consider that a fairness issue arises when all the following occur: a. A backdated (or remedial) payment relating to two or more tax years is made in a lump sum, b. The amount is significant enough to move the taxpayer into a higher tax bracket, c. If spread over the relevant tax years, the taxpayer would have had a lower tax liability in relation to that amount, and d. The delay or error has been caused by an action or inaction by the Crown. 9. Example one demonstrates how this can occur in practice: Example one Montgomery Scott (Scotty) was a forklift operator for one of the major ports in New Zealand. In 2018, he was involved in a workplace accident that saw him suffer long-term damage to his leg. For a time, Scotty received weekly compensation under the Accident Compensation Act 2001 for loss of earnings. However, ACC stopped paying him weekly compensation in 2018 when it considered he was able to return to paid employment. Scotty disputed this decision, but it took some years to resolve as there were several investigations that needed to be completed before final eligibility was established. In 2022, Scotty was awarded a payment of $50,000 per year. This was paid in a lump sum of $200,000 in March 2022. If Scotty had received this amount in the relevant years, his tax liability for the payments would have been as follows: 2019 2020 2021 2022 Total Income $50,000 $50,000 $50,000 $50,000 $200,000 Tax liability $8,020 $8,020 $8,020 $8,020 $32,080 However, for tax purposes the payment is only taxed on receipt of the full amount in 2022. This will result in income in the 2022 year of $200,000, and a tax liability for Scotty of $58,120. The difference between the two treatments is an additional tax liability for Scotty of $26,040. 10. Receipt of a BLSP can ‘artificially’ push a recipient into a higher tax bracket for a single year. This compounds the disadvantage suffered by the affected person, who in addition to the delay in receiving their entitlement, also receives a smaller net amount than if the amount was paid over multiple years. 11. A contributing issue is that over time the recipient could move tax brackets as their income increases. This will also mean that the BLSP is taxed at a higher rate that it would have if it was paid over the period that it should have been. Payments within the problem definition 12. During the initial scoping of the project, we drew a distinction between lump sum payments in general, and BLSPs which relate to prior years. A lump sum payment of income may lead to a higher tax bill in one tax year than if it were spread over multiple Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] years. However, this does not create a policy issue unless the entitlement to the payment arose, and should have been paid, in earlier years. 13. After initial consultation, we considered that there were two types of payments that fell within the problem definition and were of most concern, ACC lump sum payments and backdated MSD entitlements. Around 1,200 backdated lump sum payments are made annually by ACC with an average payment of around $48,000. MSD make more payments annually, but the amounts are much smaller, with many being under $1,000. In the majority of MSD cases, any resulting tax payable is written off, so the issue for MSD payments is much smaller. ACC lump sum payments 14. ACC makes different types of compensation or reimbursement payments depending on the situation. In some cases, whether a person is entitled to ACC compensation may be the subject of dispute or delay in awarding compensation and making payment to the person. These payments can relate to several years, meaning these payments can be large, running into tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. 15. Payments of weekly compensation are akin to employment income and PAYE must be withheld when such payments are made. If these payments are made belatedly in a lump sum in one tax year, the individual may be overtaxed when compared with the tax that would have applied if the payments were made over multiple years. Backdated MSD entitlements 16. Backdated payments of MSD entitlements may also give rise to an increased tax liability if they are paid in a subsequent tax year, although these payments tend to be smaller amounts than ACC payments. This may occur for multiple reasons, including a system error, or incorrect or incomplete information being provided at the time of an assessment. 17. There are some existing legislative provisions that can help mitigate these issues: a. Withholding: the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Social Security Act 2018 provides that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can agree a withholding rate and tax payable with the Chief Executive for the Ministry of Social Development. However, this is not particularly useful for BLSP, as each individual BLSP may require a different rate of withholding and it does not alter the tax liability assessed on the payment, just any shortfall in withholding. b. Write off: the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to write off tax for an individual when their income is solely comprised of income- tested benefits, education grants, New Zealand superannuation or a veteran’s pension. However, this write-off is not available if the recipient is receiving Working for Families or where an individual moved to employment for all or part of a year and is awarded a backdated amount of an income-tested benefit by MSD, they will not qualify for this write-off. 18. While these existing mechanisms may mitigate consequences for some BLSP recipients, a tailored solution will ensure all BLSP recipients are treated the same. Payments that were out of scope 19. As mentioned, we have drawn a distinction between lump sum payments in general and BLSPs which relate to prior years. 20. Further distinctions may be drawn when a lump sum payment arises from an employment agreement, in other words, when it is contemplated the payment will be paid out in a lump sum as opposed to spread over multiple tax years. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 21. Where a provision in an employment agreement triggers an entitlement and this entitlement is paid out pursuant to the provisions in the employment agreement (e.g., bonuses), we consider no alternative tax treatment is required. 22. This was affirmed through consultation that although arguments can be made for other types of payments to be included, 2 other lump sum payments are generally either: a. calculated with reference to prior years but incurred because of an action during the current year (e.g., redundancy and pay equity payments); or b. are not material enough to shift a person into a higher tax bracket (e.g., holiday pay reparation). Wh a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l ati o n t o t he p o l i c y pr o b l e m ? 23. The main objective is that any tax effects from receiving a multi-year payment in one year are mitigated using an alternative tax treatment to approximate the lower amount that would have been paid had the payment been made over multiple years. 24. We note that implementing an alternative tax treatment would not compensate customers for delayed payments. This project seeks to address the tax impacts only. We acknowledge that the delayed nature of these payments adds to the perception of a lack of fairness. However, to the extent that further compensation for delayed payment is desirable, 3 this is outside the scope of this project and should ultimately be dealt with in the specific Act that authorises the payments. 2 Feedback from initial consultation was that the most common lump sums paid were holiday pay remediation payments, redundancy payments and payments ordered by the Employment Court/Employment Relations Authority. 3 ACC BLSPs generally include a portion intended to compensate for the time value of money. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? The criteria that have been used to assess the options are: • Equity: do the options address the fairness issue? • Compliance costs: do the options impose disproportionate compliance costs on payers or BLSP recipients? • Fiscal cost: the fiscal costs to the government should be minimised. • Administrative cost: are the options possible for Inland Revenue, ACC, and MSD to implement and administer without substantial administration costs? • Stakeholder support: are the options supported by interested parties? W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 26. Several employment-related payments relate to prior year entitlements (e.g., holiday pay recalculations). One of the complexities in considering the BLSP issue is fairness and where to draw the line as to which payments should be eligible for an alternative tax treatment. 27. The scope of the project was refined through initial targeted consultation and agreement by the Minister of Revenue. 4 The payments that warranted alternative tax treatment were: a. backdated payments of ACC weekly compensation, and b. backdated MSD entitlements. 28. The scope was further refined by the problem definition because we are most concerned with payments which artificially push a recipient into a higher tax bracket for a single year. 29. Both of the identified payments are paid by the Crown and involve people who have often suffered a disadvantage. The disadvantage suffered by the affected person is compounded as, in addition to the delay in receiving their entitlement, they also receive a smaller net amount than if the amount was paid over multiple years. 30. These payments also result due to some failure of the Crown whether this be an action or inaction by the Crown that prevented the person being paid at the time they should have been paid. 4 IR2022/310 refers. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? The options that have been considered are • Option one: status quo; • Option two: apply an average tax rate from the previous four income years to the BLSP; • Option three: apply the average marginal tax rate from the current year, ignoring the BLSP; • Option four: allow reassessment of earlier tax years when the payment should have been received; and • Option five (for MSD payments only): ignore the BLSP and assume the tax deducted is correct. Background 31. The options for dealing with payments made by ACC and MSD differ due to the way in which tax is calculated by each of the payers. 32. For BLSPs made by ACC, tax is deducted from the payment at the extra pay rate (or potentially the modified withholding tax rate as advised by Inland Revenue). In this case, depending on whether they use the correct rate of withholding, a tax debt may still arise. 33. MSD BLSPs are paid “net of tax” (with tax already deducted). MSD determine how much the recipient is entitled to in their hand and then gross up that amount for the tax payable. MSD calculate the tax to withhold as if the payments had been made on time (by reference to previous years). Since Inland Revenue tax the BLSP in the year of receipt, this may result in a higher amount of tax payable for the recipient. 34. Whilst we could use the same options for both types of payments, using the ACC solution for MSD payments could still result in tax debts unless MSD changed the way they withhold tax from the payments. We considered that the way MSD calculates the tax should result in a more accurate calculation for MSD BLSPs, than under the approximated ACC model. 35. Options 2 and 3 below would only apply to ACC payments and option 5 would apply to MSD payments. Option 4 would apply to both. Option One – Status Quo 36. Option one is the status quo. Maintaining the status quo would continue to tax BLSPs on a cash basis. While taxing these payments on a cash basis is often the best option for employment-related payments, applying this to BLSPs can give rise to fairness issues if they are paid in a later tax year but relate to two or more previous tax years. 37. Maintaining the status quo would continue to lead to unfair outcomes for recipients of BLSPs. Option Two – Apply an average tax rate from the previous four income years 38. Inland Revenue would calculate an average tax rate 5 of the person based on the previous 4 years’ income information Inland Revenue holds. This rate would then be applied to the BLSP separately from the person’s annual income tax calculation. This 5 Average tax rate refers to the total amount of tax paid divided by total income. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] option is based on the way a person who invests in a portfolio investment entity is squared up for the year. 39. Under this option, the payer could request the person’s average tax rate before the BLSP is made and then apply that as the withholding rate. This would mean no additional amount of tax should be payable for the BLSP (assuming the recipient’s circumstances do not change). 40. Initially, consultation posed the option of either 2 or 4 years. Overwhelmingly submitters preferred the four-year option as averaging the tax rate over more time should smooth the rate for any changes within that time. 41. This option would apply to payments made on or after 1 April 2024 due to the lead in time required to make system changes both at Inland Revenue and the paying agencies. 42. A retrospective application date was considered as an option during consultation and in reporting to Ministers. However, officials considered there was no clear basis to make such a change retrospective. It did not meet any of the usual requirements to make a change retrospective such as confirming a long-standing policy intent or correcting a clear error in the legislation. This would also have increased the fiscal cost significantly. Equity 43. This option would address the issue of the BLSP pushing the person into a higher tax bracket by removing the BLSP from the person’s tax calculation. This would mean their overall tax liability should be lower than the status quo. 44. Using the average tax rate rather than an average marginal tax rate should also result in a more accurate taxation of the payment as it represents a true average tax rate for the recipient. 45. It would also partially smooth any changes in a person’s tax rate between the time they should have received the income and the time they receive the BLSP. The “lower of” test 6 would allow the status quo to be applied if that resulted in a lower tax impost. This should address any issues of fairness if the option would disadvantage the recipient. 46. It would also enable ACC to request the withholding rate before making the payment, to enable the correct amount of tax to be deducted (provided their income situation did not change for the current year) which would avoid the recipient having additional tax to pay. Compliance costs 47. This option would require ACC to contact Inland Revenue to obtain their average tax rate before making the payment. ACC would then have to apply that withholding rate and indicate that they are paying a lump sum on the employment information supplied to Inland Revenue. 48. This option will have minimal compliance costs for recipients. For ACC payments, ACC will be able to request a withholding rate from Inland Revenue and apply this without requiring further information from the recipient. Provided the recipients position does not change in the current year, they will not be required to pay any additional tax. Fiscal cost 49. The fiscal cost of this option applying to payments made on or after 1 April 2024 is outlined below: 6 See paras 60-62 Regulatory Impact Statement | 9     \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Table 1: Four-year average tax rate $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue  (1.900) (8.100) (8.500) (8.900) Administrative cost 50. Implementing this option will require moderate systems changes from ACC. This is because it will require an update to the employer information return to identify the BLSPs. This will impact ACC because they will be required to identify when the payment is a BLSP, which will flow through to Inland Revenue where the alternative tax treatment needs to be applied. There will also be costs involved in requesting the new proposed tax rate from Inland Revenue to enable them to withhold correctly from the BLSPs. 51. ACC has indicated the changes required are possible within the timeframe, and system changes may cost between $200,000 -$400,000 to implement. 52. This option will also involve complex system changes by Inland Revenue to alter the annual tax calculation to account for the differing treatment of those payments. The differing treatments may also be more difficult for recipients to understand over the status quo (notwithstanding that the status quo results in higher taxation). Inland Revenue has indicated that the changes required are possible within the timeframe, and while they will be included within wider changes, Inland Revenue estimates the cost will be in the range of $200,000 -$400,000. Stakeholder support 53. This option was the preferred option during targeted consultation given its simplicity and ability to address the current inequities. Option Three – Apply the average marginal tax rate from the current year, ignoring the BLSP 54. This option is similar to option two, but instead of using the recipient’s average tax rate over the previous four years, it would use their average marginal tax rate 7 for the year the BLSP is received (excluding the BLSP). Like option two, this rate would then be applied to the BLSP in a separate calculation. Equity 55. This option would address the issue of the BLSP pushing the person into a higher tax bracket by ignoring the BLSP for the person’s tax calculation. However, it would not 7 Average marginal tax rate refers to the incremental tax paid on incremental income. For example, the current marginal tax rate for each dollar of income up to $14,000 has a tax rate of 10.5%. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10     \[IN CONFIDENCE\] address the issue of any changes in a person’s tax rate between the time they should have received the income and the time they receive the BLSP. 56. Using the average marginal tax rate would effectively be a snapshot of the person’s current tax position, rather than achieving a more even average tax rate (using multiple years) as in option two. Compliance costs 57. These would be the same as option two. Fiscal cost 58. The fiscal cost for this option is as follows: Table 2: Current year marginal tax rate $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue  (1.600) (6.600) (6.900) (7.200) Administrative cost 59. This option would require similar system changes for Inland Revenue and ACC as option two. Stakeholder support This option was not preferred during targeted consultation. Stakeholders thought this may lead to unfair outcomes where their current tax rate does not reflect their previous position when they should have received the payments. Additional rules for options two and three 60. In addition to each of option two and three, the lowest tax rate to be applied would be 10.5%, 8 and there would be a “lower of” test. 61. Changing the status quo could result in some recipients being worse off than under the current treatment. This could occur where a person has had a higher tax rate in the four years prior to the lump sum payment but has a lower tax rate in the year the lump sum is paid. In this case, the recipient may end up with a higher tax bill than under the status quo. To counter this, a “lower of” test would ensure recipients are not worse off under this proposal compared to the status quo. 62. If there was no “lower of” test, from the information we have obtained from ACC, we estimate that the number of people worse off than under the current treatment, would be between 39-84 per year. Due to the small number of affected taxpayers, this may be 8 For example, a person with an average tax rate of less than 10.5% would be capped at 10.5% to account for the payment itself. However, the cases where a person would have an average tax rate at less than 10.5% would be rare, given the lowest rate applied to any income over $0 is 10.5%. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] delivered in a slightly different way than the main proposal (i.e., it may require some manual intervention by the recipient). These issues will be worked through in the ultimate design of any proposed solution. Option Four – Allow reassessment of earlier tax years when the payment should have been received 63. This option would essentially remove the cash receipt “basis” for these BLSPs by allowing the taxpayer to re-open assessments for earlier tax years and spread the income back over the periods to which it relates. After the income is spread, the lump sum would be taxed as if it was received in those years. 64. For some claimants, their BLSP could relate to over 10+ years which would result in multiple reassessments over a large number of years. 65. Re-opening assessments would also trigger the reassessment of related obligations and entitlements, for example Working for Families tax credits and student loan obligations. 66. Essentially this is the treatment that MSD follow in calculating the withholding tax from the BLSPs that it pays. Equity 67. This option would produce the fairest, and most accurate result in terms of tax liability. This would tax the BLSP as if it was received in those years. However, because this would re-open earlier years’ assessments it would also trigger the re-assessment of related obligations and entitlements, for example Working for Families tax credits and student loan obligations. This could claw back previous years entitlements and lead to other inequitable outcomes. Compliance costs 68. This would place a high compliance burden on Inland Revenue to identify every past income return and verify the tax code. For some, this would require 10 or more years of returns and may include a mix of paper and electronic records. This would come with a significant manual intervention. 69. As this would reopen previous assessments, it would reassess all social policy entitlements which could lead to the creation of debt and owing entitlements. The multiple reassessments could be complex to understand and may require recipients to dispute or apply for reassessment again. This would be administratively burdensome and have significant compliance costs for the recipient. Fiscal cost 70. Due to the workability and complexity of this option, particularly in relation to the need to reassess social policy entitlements, it was not formally costed. Inland Revenue considers it would likely have at least as large of a fiscal cost as option two (see table 1 above). This would be due to the amount of manual intervention required, in addition to the effect of reassessing many years of entitlements. Administrative cost 71. This option would require significant system changes for Inland Revenue and ACC. 72. As mentioned above, this would result in a large administrative cost, given the large amount of work involved in reopening and reassessing previous tax assessments, especially where there may be limited information (for example, in the transition from Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] paper to electronic returns). It would also require a significant manual effort by Inland Revenue to ensure the reassessment can be processed. Stakeholder support 73. This option was not preferred during targeted consultation. While Stakeholders acknowledged this would be the most accurate option, we received some feedback that the prospect of the reassessment of all social policy entitlements outweighed the benefits of spreading the income. Option Five – Ignore the BLSP and assume the tax deducted is correct 74. This option would apply only to MSD BLSPs. This option would assume the tax deducted by MSD is correct and ignore the BLSP for the purpose of the recipient’s income tax liability (but not social policy entitlements). 75. We would accept the tax withheld as correct because of the way MSD calculates the tax on the BLSPs. 76. MSD calculates entitlements from the ground up. They first decide how much a person is entitled to in their hand and then grosses that amount up for the tax payable. This also occurs for BLSPs, MSD calculates the net amount of the underpayment and calculates the tax to withhold with reference to the period the client was underpaid. In essence, MSD calculates the correct tax liability as if the payments had been correctly made on time. This is similar to option four, however, this would not trigger a reassessment of social policy obligations for previous years because the reassessment is being calculated by MSD. Equity 77. This option would produce a fairest, and accurate result in terms of tax liability for most BLSP recipients. This is because the result would tax the BLSP as if it was received in the years it related to. It would also remove the additional tax liability that occurs because of Inland Revenue’s application of tax in the current year, which can result in additional tax being payable. 78. This would also resolve the inconsistency of the current tax write-off that is available for some MSD BLSP recipients where there is additional tax payable. 79. This write off is available for auto-calculation customers who do not receive Working for Families and for whom their only income is from MSD (with a de minimis that allows a small amount of other income). 9 However, for those who receive Working for Families or those who are no longer on a benefit, the differences in tax are payable. 80. As MSD would calculate the reassessment, this removes the additional square-ups than would occur in option four. Compliance costs 81. This option will have minimal compliance costs for MSD recipients, and they will be unlikely to have any additional income tax owing. Fiscal cost 82. We have not accounted for any fiscal cost for the change to the treatment for MSD BLSPs. This is on the basis that because in the majority of cases, any tax liabilities arising from those payments is subject to a write off. It will only be where a recipient Section 22J of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] has ceased to receive a benefit or where they have WFF debt that the amount will be payable. 83. The fiscal cost is likely to be immaterial. Given this, we consider the fiscal cost of these BLSPs to be within the margin of error of the fiscal cost of the ACC BLSPs, and therefore no additional amount needs to be accounted for. Administrative cost 84. Implementing this option would require moderate systems changes from MSD. This is because it will require an update to the employer information return to identify the BLSPs. This will impact MSD because they will be required to identify when the payment is a BLSP, which will flow through to Inland Revenue where the alternative tax treatment needs to be applied. 85. The proposals will also involve complex system changes by Inland Revenue to alter the annual tax calculation to account for the differing treatment of the BLSP payments. 86. MSD has indicated this work is doable in the timeframe, and they estimate the cost of the changes to be $525,000. Stakeholder support 87. This option was supported during external (stakeholders and MSD) and internal consultation. MSD agreed that this option is likely solve the current equity issues for their customers.

For ACC BLSPs, option two is likely to best address the problem and deliver benefits to BLSP recipients, compared to the status quo. The option is likely to achieve the objective, by mitigating the tax disparities that currently arise for BLSP recipients. 89. For MSD BLSPs, option five is likely to best address the problem and deliver benefits to BLSP recipients, compared to the status quo. This option is the best way to address the tax disparity that arises with the current treatment and would impose almost no compliance costs on recipients. This option essentially calculates the correct amount of tax that would have been payable if the BLSP was paid in the years it should have been received, without the additional reassessments, that would be generated in the tax system, that would occur under option four. 90. Option two and option five are the preferred options which best meet the policy objectives and are able to be implemented within the existing ACC, MSD, and Inland Revenue systems. Both options involve one-off moderate systems changes for ACC, MSD, and complex changes for Inland Revenue. However, once the treatment is implemented, the compliance costs for BLSP recipients and payers of BLSPs should be minimal. As the changes involve modifying the employment information tax return, the policy would apply to payments made from 1 April 2024 to allow sufficient time to implement the changes required. Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 3: Delivering a n option H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e i m p l e m e n t e d? 91. To implement the proposal, it will require legislative, and system change from ACC, MSD, and Inland Revenue. 92. The proposals, if agreed, would be included in the 2023 omnibus taxation bill. The alternative tax treatment for ACC and MSD BLSPs will apply to payments made on or after 1 April 2024. The purpose of a later application date is to allow ACC, MSD, and Inland Revenue time to implement the required system changes. 93. Under the new proposals for ACC payments, ACC BLSP recipients will still be provided the option to choose their desired withholding rate for their BLSP, with this new rate (provided by Inland Revenue to ACC) as an option. Appropriate guidance will be issued to those involved. Application date 94. Due to the prospective application date of 1 April 2024, this would not address any past inequity for recipients who have been disadvantaged by the status quo. While applying the proposed solution retrospectively may be seen to be “undoing a wrong”, we do not consider this change would meet the usual criteria for a retrospective change. 95. Changes are normally made retrospective where a change fills in a gap in existing legislation -in particular, a relatively newly enacted regime. Usually, retrospective application either “fills gaps” in such a regime, fixes an obvious error or confirms well- documented policy intent. The tax treatment of BLSPs would fill no such gap and it is a well-established policy decision that employment “type” payments are taxed on receipt. 96. A second reason legislative changes may be applied retrospectively is where the change is taxpayer friendly, and the fiscal cost is acceptable. On a prospective basis, this change is taxpayer friendly because it reduces the tax impact on BLSPs. However, extending the change retrospectively will favour some taxpayers in this situation but not all, unless the change was made back to when these types of payments were first made (which could in theory go back to 1974 when ACC was created). To extend the benefit for some taxpayers for a shorter period will continue to result in some taxpayers not getting the benefit of the change. Additionally, determining where that line should be set would be arbitrary. The fiscal cost of such a change would also be prohibitive.

Inland Revenue will monitor the effectiveness of the proposed reforms on an ongoing basis, through the normal use of data analytics. The data obtained will assist with analysing whether the new rules are effective and whether they have lessened the tax BLSP recipients have to pay. 98. Once the rules are implemented, Inland Revenue will monitor any feedback from external stakeholders on how the rules are functioning. Regulatory Impact Statement | 19
\[\[\[INININ COCOCONNNFFFIDIDIDEEENNNCECECE\]\]\]\[IN CONFIDENCE\] While women are expected to disproportionately benefit from the proposal owing to the greater representation of women among PPL recipients, the proposal would benefit all PPL recipients regardless of gender. Inland Revenue’s preferred option On balance, IR supports the overall proposal of a government payment of a three percent employer contribution. While the solutions to issues such as overrepresentation in lower paid roles and lower rates of labour force participation among women lie outside KiwiSaver, developing comprehensive solutions to these issues represents a long-term project which would require resourcing as part of the government’s work programme. Although the overall impact of the proposal is likely to be small, and disproportionately benefit wealthier households who are able to contribute to their KiwiSaver accounts while a member of the household is on PPL, the proposal would nonetheless go some way toward mitigating the effect of time spent out of work for PPL recipients. Additionally, although the amount paid to a PPL recipient over the course of parental leave would be small, the effect of compound interest over the remainder of a caregiver’s career would increase the absolute value of the contribution and promote an improvement in financial security for caregivers in retirement. While this is a finely balanced assessment, IR supports option 2 over option 3, as this is consistent with current KiwiSaver settings where employers must pay a contribution only if the employee contributes three percent or more from their pay. This alignment with existing KiwiSaver settings means it is likely to be lower in cost and simpler to administer. Additionally, the selection of option 2 would not preclude the subsequent selection and implementation of option 3 at a later date, if a future government decided the proposal had merit and should be adopted as part of a future budget initiative. Views from consultation Due to the time constraints imposed by the budget process and time constraints in preparing advice, consultation with the public or with iwi and hapū has not been undertaken on the options. However, in 2022 a joint agency working group 1 undertook some initial engagement on a range of issues and options for KiwiSaver Enhancement. While the working group engaged on broad issues and enhancement options, it did not get feedback on the PPL options specifically from iwi or hapū, business or small business representatives KiwiSaver providers or the general public. However, feedback from these meetings on the enhancement approach generally indicate it is likely that: • either option would be supported by KiwiSaver providers • iwi and hapū might support option 3 over option 2. 1 This included officials from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), Ministry of Social Development (MSD), IR and the Public Service Commission (PSC). Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[\[\[INININ COCOCONNNFFFIDIDIDEEENNNCECECE\]\]\]\[IN CONFIDENCE\] 4. These issues affect women’s ability to contribute to their KiwiSaver accounts and otherwise save for their retirement, including their eligibility for the member tax credit (MTC), a government incentive designed to encourage New Zealanders to save for their retirement. 5. The primary solutions to address these inequalities lie outside of KiwiSaver settings. These solutions include labour market interventions as well as education policy relating to childcare. However, providing additional government contributions for recipients of PPL would enable better outcomes for women who are currently in the workforce and others who contribute to KiwiSaver from their PPL. While PPL is available to all parents regardless of gender, we estimate that for the 2020 – 21 financial year, approximately 95 percent of PPL recipients identified themselves as women. 5 What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 6. The objective is to improve retirement outcomes for women. Although the primary avenues for addressing the identified inequities lie outside KiwiSaver, the interventions identified could go some way towards mitigating the effect of labour market and social differences on women. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 7. The options identified will be compared using the effectiveness and efficiency criteria in the table below. In evaluating the effectiveness of the proposal, the “EAST” behavioural insights framework has also been considered. This identifies the successful features of behavioural change interventions as Easy, Attractive, Social and Timely. 5 Gender is taken from individuals preferred titles (i.e., Mr, Mrs or Miss), as disclosing gender is optional upon a Paid Parental Leave application. In a small percentage of cases gender cannot be determined form title (gender neutral or no title provided) Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[\[\[INININ COCOCONNNFFFIDIDIDEEENNNCECECE\]\]\]\[IN CONFIDENCE\] What options are being considered? Option 1 – Retain the status quo 11. The government could choose to retain the status quo and take no active steps toward addressing the existing retirement gender equity issues. Wider government work on options to address these issues (e.g. pay equity, access to affordable childcare) would continue as resources allow. Option 2 – The government would pay a matched three percent “employer” KiwiSaver contribution to contributing PPL recipients 12. The government could subsidise the payment of a three percent KiwiSaver “employer” contribution to PPL recipients provided the recipient also pays at least a three percent KiwiSaver employee contribution into their KiwiSaver retirement savings accounts. Option 2 – The government would pay a three percent “employer” KiwiSaver contribution to eligible PPL recipients, irrespective of how much they contribute to their KiwiSaver account from their PPL payments 13. The government could subsidise the payment of a three percent KiwiSaver “employer” contribution to all PPL recipients, regardless of whether or not they were making an employee contribution into their KiwiSaver retirement savings account. Comparison of options against the status quo 14. The following table uses assessment criteria to assess Options 2 and 3 against the status quo (Option 1). Each option is scored on how it contributes to each criterion in comparison to the status quo and the high-level reasons for the score are recorded directly below each criteria score. The final assessment is provided in the final row of the table. Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - -much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[\[\[INININ COCOCONNNFFFIDIDIDEEENNNCECECE\]\]\]\[IN CONFIDENCE\] What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? 15. Each of the options considered above has specific costs and benefits. For example: o Option 1 – Status quo: • Taking no additional action would maintain the status quo, with resource continuing to be applied as it is currently and the KiwiSaver gender inequality issues outlined in the problem definition would remain. This assumes that no other KiwiSaver policy enhancements are currently being considered. However, work focused on developing wider solutions to gender pay and participation in paid work could continue as resources allow. • Both options 2 and 3 apply to PPL recipients. Although IR does not have comprehensive data on the gender of PPL recipients it is estimated that 95 percent of those receiving PPL in the 2020-21 financial year were women, with men comprising two percent of PPL recipients. The gender of the remaining three percent of PPL recipients was unknown on his methodology. 6 o Option 2 - government would pay a three percent KiwiSaver employer contribution to PPL recipients provided the PPL recipients contributed at least three percent of their PPL to their KiwiSaver accounts: • Currently, approximately 15% of PPL recipients contribute to their KiwiSaver accounts while receiving PPL. As the proposal would incentivise PPL recipients to contribute to their KiwiSaver accounts, it is possible that the proportion of PPL recipients contributing to their KiwiSaver would increase, along with the KiwiSaver balances of PPL recipients. • At the current maximum government PPL contribution of $661.12 (gross) per week, a three percent government contribution would represent $19.83 per week, for a maximum of $516 over 26 weeks of PPL. As PPL recipients would have to contribute the same amount to qualify for the government contribution, this would represent up to $1,032 in annual KiwiSaver contributions which might otherwise not be made. • Additionally, the proposal’s incentivisation of KiwiSaver employee contributions could also result in KiwiSaver members receiving some portion of the Member Tax Credit (MTC). The MTC matches KiwiSaver employee contributions at 50 percent up to a maximum of $1,042.86, meaning the government contributes up to $521.43 to a KiwiSaver member’s account each year. A KiwiSaver member who contributes $516 over 26 weeks of PPL would receive an MTC of $258 from the government. 6 Gender is taken from individuals preferred titles (i.e., Mr, Mrs or Miss), as disclosing gender is optional upon a Paid Parental Leave application. In a small percentage of cases gender cannot be determined from title (gender neutral or no title provided). Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[\[\[INININ COCOCONNNFFFIDIDIDEEENNNCECECE\]\]\]\[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Although the proposal would result in a small contribution in absolute terms, it would account for approximately 20 percent of the shortfall of contributions for a woman on the median wage taking a full year off full-time paid work. Additionally, the impact of compound interest over the remaining course of a retiree’s working life would increase the value of this contribution considerably. • However, as the receipt of the government subsidy is conditional on the PPL recipient also contributing, there is a risk that the benefit of this proposal could disproportionately accrue to higher income households who are able to afford KiwiSaver contributions while on PPL. o Option 3 - government would pay a three percent KiwiSaver employer contribution to PPL recipients regardless of whether they were making employee contributions: • Requiring the member to have contributions deducted from PPL is likely to result in a large proportion of the new benefit being captured by those who are more financially comfortable and so can afford to have deductions made from their PPL. However, it maintains the core KiwiSaver principle of “matched employee contributions”. • Making government contributions while on PPL unconditional would reach a greater number of those unable to afford to make their own KiwiSaver PPL deductions. However, it would not encourage ‘employee’ contributions. • Option 3 would also cost significantly more in fiscal terms. Although the administrative costs of Options 2 and 3 are not expected to be substantially different, the cost of Option 3 is expected to have an upper estimate of $101.8m over the 2022/23 – 2026/27 forecast period. This is more than five times the expected cost of Option 2 (of $19.219m). Trust and confidence criterion – same for options 1 and 2 16. KiwiSaver providers have previously indicated that frequent ‘tweaks’ to KiwiSaver have the potential to reduce trust and confidence in KiwiSaver as a stable long-term government intervention. While these are minor changes, we consider that they are more likely to increase trust and confidence in KiwiSaver than to reduce it, because they are increasing government incentives for participation. 17. By acknowledging structural inequities, these options for providing targeted support have potential to strengthen the ‘social licence’ of the scheme and increase public confidence and engagement in KiwiSaver. 18. The risk that people ”over save” in KiwiSaver and would have better financial wellbeing if they used the funds in the present is mitigated by the opt-in nature of those options which would otherwise affect present spending. Inflation – same for all three 19. Finally, the interventions will not have a material inflationary effect, given the increased government spending would be invested directly into KiwiSaver accounts and not be expended in the economy until a person reaches 65 or is eligible for early withdrawal (e.g. a first home withdrawal or serious illness). The proposed payments would not be Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[\[\[INININ COCOCONNNFFFIDIDIDEEENNNCECECE\]\]\]\[IN CONFIDENCE\] considered income and would therefore not affect entitlement to benefits or Working For Families payments Views from initial engagement 20. Due to the time constraints imposed on officials in preparing advice and the budget process it has not been possible to undertake consultation with the public or with iwi and hapū on the options. 21. However, in 2022 a joint agency working group undertook some initial engagement on issues and options for KiwiSaver Enhancement. 7 22. Officials engaged with KiwiSaver and funds management providers, the KiwiSaver lead for the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Council, representatives from capital markets and academic sectors, the Council of Trade Unions, Business New Zealand, the Small Business Advisory Council and staff at a number of iwi savings schemes. Officials also met with representatives of two iwi without savings schemes and two social services providers who work primarily with Pacific Peoples and whānau Māori. Impacts for iwi and hapū and whānau Māori 23. Engagement with iwi/Māori was limited, but the feedback received indicated that: • there is a strong and widely held interest in saving for the future among Māori, focussed on being able to pass on savings to support tamariki and mokopuna. • KiwiSaver is valued for its support of home ownership, and its rewards and incentives. However engagement with KiwiSaver could be increased among whānau Māori. 24. Survey data indicates KiwiSaver works similarly for Māori as for non-Māori in terms of participation, when controlling for income level, employment status and other factors. 8 Māori who contribute to KiwiSaver are more likely than non-Māori to be contributing at 4 and 6 percent. This is consistent with engagement feedback about the high value placed on saving and on KiwiSaver’s role in saving towards home ownership. 25. KiwiSaver settings do not vary by ethnicity; however, they currently compound the impact of colonisation for Māori. 9 Since Māori are over-represented in low paid work, underemployment and unemployment, incomes are significantly lower than for non- Māori. For this reason iwi, hapū and whānau Māori may potentially • prefer option 3 over option 2, as it better addresses distributional impacts; and 7 These included work to consider KiwiSaver recommendations of the 2019 RRIP, Capital Markets 2029 report and Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Council. 8 Māori have lower rates of membership and of contribution than non-Māori, due to being overrepresented in unemployment, underemployment and low paid work. 9 Māori have lower rates of home ownership, higher rates of unaffordable housing, and are over-represented among the unemployed, as well as in jobs that involve lower pay, fewer skills, and fewer advancement opportunities. Māori have significantly lower net worth and life expectancy than non-Māori. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[\[\[INININ COCOCONNNFFFIDIDIDEEENNNCECECE\]\]\]\[IN CONFIDENCE\] • prefer any option which is not tied to participation in paid work, over PPL based options. Impacts for KiwiSaver providers 26. A range of individual KiwiSaver providers have publicly noted the gender retirement savings gap 10 and need to close it. 11 27. Both options 2 and 3 may have some small implementation costs and impacts on the KiwiSaver industry, such as updating existing information and guidance on government contribution entitlements. Despite these costs, we expect the options would be supported by industry on the basis that they seek to acknowledge and partially address the gender gap in retirement savings and/or drive KiwiSaver membership and contributions. Each option would also increase KiwiSaver funds under management and industry revenue from management fees. Overall assessment 28. Although neither option will directly address the wider issues associated with gender and retirement savings, the assessment model (above) indicates Option 2 is preferable to Option 3. Two key factors in reaching this assessment are the misalignment with the existing matched employee/employer contribution settings which would occur if Option 3 were to be implemented, as well as the significantly lower fiscal cost associated with Option 2. 29. While, as noted above, the overall impact of Option 2 is likely to be small, the proposal would nonetheless go some way toward mitigating the effect of time spent out of work for PPL recipients. 10 ASB Media Release in 2022 (https://www.asb.co.nz/documents/media-centre/media-releases/women-better- off-day-to-day-but-miss-out-on-750-million-at-retirement.html). 11 ANZ Dollars and Sense: A Decade of KiwiSaver (2017); ANZ, KiwiSaver Equity for Women NZIER for KiwiWealth (2022). Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[\[\[INININ COCOCONNNFFFIDIDIDEEENNNCECECE\]\]\]\[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 3: Implementation 30. Provided Cabinet agrees to progress the policy, the proposal would be introduced in the 2023-24 Annual Rates’ Bill and would take effect from the 2024-25 Financial Year (i.e. from 1 July 2024). This would mean that existing PPL recipients who contribute to their KiwiSaver accounts would be eligible for a three percent government contribution on any remaining PPL payments beginning from 1 July 2024 (but not on any PPL payments received prior to 1 July 2024). By contrast, PPL recipients who begin receiving PPL after 1 July 2024 would be eligible for a three percent government contribution for the full duration of their PPL. Section 4: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? 31. KiwiSaver is jointly administered by the Treasury, MBIE, and IR, and is monitored on a ongoing basis as part of the agencies’ ongoing stewardship obligations, including through regulatory reviews. 32. The operation and progress of the proposal will be observed by the responsible agencies and reported on as required. Additionally, KiwiSaver settings may be considered by the Retirement Commissioner as part of a statutory review of retirement savings settings every three years, (the focus is set in the Terms of Reference issued by the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs). 33. This provides an opportunity for an independent consideration of KiwiSaver’s features and their success in achieving the Government’s objectives. 34. The findings of external reporting frameworks which monitors the performance of pension systems around the world (such as the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index) could also be considered as a method of evaluating the operation of the KiwiSaver scheme.

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL) Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? Seismic vessels are used to gather data on potential oil and gas finds, and rigs are used to drill for oil and gas, in the exploration and development stages of petroleum mining. These are very specialist and expensive pieces of equipment that are owned by businesses that specialise in providing these services to petroleum miners who have permits for a specific area. These rigs and vessels do not generally work offshore in winter weather for health and safety reasons. While there is a worldwide industry in rigs and seismic vessels, no New Zealand companies own these assets, so any company seeking to explore natural resources in New Zealand waters needs to use a rig or seismic vessel provided by a non-resident owner. Offshore rigs and seismic vessels owned by non-residents are covered by an income tax exemption that is due to expire on 31 December 2024. Wells generally take between 30 and 90 days to drill and there is significant cost in bringing a rig or vessel to and from New Zealand. Because of this, operators often align their plans in order to conduct their work using the same rig or vessel in the same summer period. There is usually a programme of work that forms the core activities of the rig or vessel, and then there may be opportunistic wells or surveys added because the rig or vessel is already coming. These opportunistic wells or surveys are at particular risk from the expiry of the existing exemption as completing these could result in the rig or vessel being in New Zealand long enough to become a New Zealand tax resident and therefore taxable on income derived from exploration and development activities in New Zealand waters, including from already completed contracts for core activities. In the absence of an exemption these operators leave New Zealand before this time to prevent a New Zealand income tax liability arising. Since 2018, when the exemption was last extended, there have been a total of two offshore non-resident drilling rigs, spending 313 and 226 days in the country each and 14 wells have been drilled. By contrast, between 2000 and 2005 (before the exemption was introduced), no rigs stayed in New Zealand waters beyond six months. Thirteen seismic vessels have operated in New Zealand since 2009, of which one stayed over 183 days. Before 2005, the average length of stay was around four months. Maintaining the exemption removes a barrier for lengthier stays (which have been fewer but are typically more lucrative). There have been 80 offshore wells drilled since 1 January 2009. Twenty-three of these wells have been exploratory in nature, with some hosting sub-commercial discoveries. All of these efforts, successful or not, improve our knowledge of the Crown mineral estate, which is critical to making economic discoveries. A substantial discovery has the potential to significantly benefit the economy and the Government's fiscal position by way of direct economic benefits, royalties, increased tax revenue, and other indirect benefits (e.g. supporting goods and services and consumption). It is likely that a number of wells would not have been drilled without the tax exemption, as the application of income tax would likely have created too large a barrier (due to the high Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators I 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] s 9(2)(h) Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators | 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • While New Zealand is attempting to transition from fossil fuels and will not issue new offshore petroleum exploration permits there continues to be an offshore petroleum industry and that industry, while it exists, will always be reliant on non- resident rigs and seismic vessels. New Zealand does not have a policy to actively disincentivise, or prevent, petroleum production and even if it was to do so in the future there would be more efficient measures to achieve this than a policy that inadvertently encourages churn. • There is no expectation that tax legislation will remain constant. If a decision was made in the future to end this exemption the Government has regular tax omnibus bills and could repeal the provision in a shorter time than leaving the remaining time of a 5-year exemption to expire. While we have not attempted to quantify the cost, the administrative and parliamentary costs of a future repeal would be the same, or likely lower, than the cost of a single 5-year extension.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] objectives (e.g. the redistribution of income). A greater availability of contemporaneous information about the tax system’s role in redistribution would assist governments and the public in determining whether their policy objectives are being realised. New Zealand’s tax system is not well understood by the public o Responding to future tax challenges will require informed debate about the tax system, its goals, priorities, constraints and impacts. Support for changes to the tax system to cope with demographic or technological change will likely require an understanding of where the burden of tax currently falls, where it will fall in the future and whether tax continues to be raised in a fair and efficient manner over time. However, despite being important to all New Zealanders, more could be done to improve the public’s understanding of the current tax system and priorities. For example, there is an ongoing misunderstanding of what secondary tax is and whether it is fair. There are additionally areas of the tax system that are often subject to debate such as the application of exemptions to GST, and the setting of marginal tax rates. o The issues noted above are all matters which capture the public’s interest. Although the details of tax policy and administration is a specialist subject, increasing the public’s understanding of the tax system should inform and improve the quality of public debate and engagement on tax issues through an improved knowledge of general tax policy frameworks. Information deficits o There are areas of the tax system on which there is little information available. Examples include the effective tax rate paid by high wealth individuals (HWI), the relative effect of the tax system on labour force participation, or the level of certainty within the tax system and its impact on business decisions. o Data deficits in areas such as these limit the ability of governments to accurately identify and define policy issues. The unavailability of data and analysis also constrains officials’ ability to offer advice on optimal policy responses to current issues. This can lead to relying on information based on overseas systems, which may not be fully comparable. 7. While there are a range of reasons for having tax working groups and reviews, one aspect is to use these groups to seek, collate and publicly report information on the tax system and whether it is fit for purpose. This can help lift the public engagement and debate but comes with associated administrative costs. There is debate in academic circles over the effectiveness of ad hoc reviews in leading to changes in tax systems compared to not having reviews. 8. As has been seen in other contexts, there is the potential for aspects of public debate to occur using incorrect information or misunderstanding of information, which can lead to mistrust. Trust in government has an impact on the efficient running of public services and this has been an issue for some segments of society. As the tax system relies on voluntary compliance from all taxpayers with targeted enforcement, changes in levels of trust in government or perceptions of tax can impact revenue collection. Improving trust and understanding in core public services such as the design of the tax system could support voluntary compliance and longer-term revenue integrity. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 9. As noted in an earlier Cabinet paper (CAB-22-MIN-0332), Cabinet’s policy objectives are to: o Improve the public’s understanding of New Zealand’s tax system; o Inform discussions on tax, fiscal and economic issues among stakeholders, policy makers and the wider public; and o Contribute to the achievement of wider long-term social, fiscal and economic objectives through data driven reporting. 10. The intervention identified in this Regulatory Impact Statement seeks to primarily address the Government’s desire to improve the public’s understanding of the tax system and increase the quality of public engagement on tax policy issues, as set out in the first and second bullet points above. However, the initiative will contribute to the attainment of the third object by increasing the amount of information available about the operation of the tax system over time, putting a focus on the longer term perspective and the ability of the tax system to fund longer term social expectations of public services. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 11. Where applicable, the options will be evaluated using the policy criteria of reducing compliance and administrative costs and whether they effectively achieve the objectives below. There are no fiscal costs to consider with any of these options. 12. The specific criteria are whether the options are likely to meet the objectives of: o Increasing the public’s understanding of New Zealand’s tax system and improving the quality of public debate on tax policy; o Increasing the quality of information about the operation of New Zealand’s tax system and its key features; and o Being sustainable over time (and able to generate consistent information over time to provide the public with trends on how the tax system is evolving). 13. An option will meet the criteria of increasing public understanding if it is providing information that helps the public to understand how the tax system works and the impacts of tax policy changes on the tax system. The type of information reported and the ability to convey information in a way that increases understanding will be important. An option will meet the criteria of increasing the availability of information if it increasing the quantity and quality of information about the operation of the tax system. An option will be sustainable if it is long-lasting and can generate time series data and demonstrate trends. An option will meet the administrative costs criteria if it reduces or minimises the amount of resources the department uses and likewise an option will meet the compliance cost criteria if it reduces or minimises the costs on the private sector. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What scope will options be considered within? 14. The scope of this project is focused on identifying ways of improving the public’s understanding of New Zealand’s tax system, and of increasing the amount of available information about its operation for the government and the public. Any suggestions for specific reform to tax policy settings or to amending the purpose and principles in existing Revenue Acts are beyond the scope of this project. 15. The scope is also focused on information that informs tax policy design rather than the administrative operations of the tax system. Therefore, it is not considering reporting frameworks or requirements on detailed administrative matters such as the level of administrative spending. These are covered by the Public Finance Act reporting requirements. 16. Wider reporting obligations and principles that apply to Inland Revenue as a public sector agency are also not within scope and are covered by the Public Service Act. 17. One option to improve information among the public would be a public awareness campaign. Various targeted campaigns are already used to help improve taxpayer compliance and understanding of the administration aspects of tax. However, this option would not address the other two objectives and is considered an extension of the status quo for the purpose of the analysis in this document. What options are being considered? Option 1(a) – Retain the status quo 18. The government could choose to retain the status quo and take no active steps toward addressing the policy problems identified earlier. The existing levels of reporting through Annual Reports, website information and Budget documents would remain. This includes a select number of published tax statistics and one-off research and evaluation publications. It also includes the government of the day’s ability to implement a one-off investigation of aspects of the tax system through Inland Revenue or ad hoc working groups. Members of Parliament would continue to seek information through Written Questions, and the public through Official Information Act requests where the information exists. Option 1(b) Retain the status quo, but with increased reporting on selected issues 19. In addition to 1(a) the government could decide to commission additional advice on specific areas of the tax system, with a focus on expected future challenges. This would involve the government identifying upcoming policy issues in advance and seeking data and official advice on an ad-hoc basis. The resulting information could be published or form the basis of public debate such as through a speech or press release. Option 2 – The enactment of a statutory reporting framework 20. The Government could enact either: o (2a) a reporting framework which requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to report regularly on data associated with current or future issues within the tax system; or Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] o (2b) a reporting framework informed by tax principles which requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to report regularly on the data associated with the operation of the tax system against those tax principles. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? 21. Each of the options considered above has specific costs and benefits. o Option 1(a ) – Status quo: Taking no additional action would maintain the status quo, with resources continuing to be applied as they are currently and reallocated in line with changes in government priorities. There would be ad hoc increases in administration and compliance costs if ad hoc reviews are requested on the tax system. However, the status quo would not address the economic and policy impacts which flow from both the current levels of public engagement with the tax system, and the existing information gaps. Accordingly, maintaining the status quo would not improve the public’s understanding of the tax system, or contribute to improving the quality of current tax policy advice. o Option 1(b) – Increased reporting on selected issues: Increasing the amount of reporting on selected issues would improve the availability of public information to some degree and give governments flexibility in commissioning policy advice on current and anticipated issues beyond its baseline level of reporting. This could take both a short and longer term perspective depending on government preferences. This would increase the public’s understanding in the issues reported but not necessarily in the tax system overall. There would be additional administrative costs to additional reporting. However, this option presents several challenges, namely that: i. It mirrors the current ability of governments to commission of ficial advice as it is required. Although this option could improve the quality of advice available on topical issues to governments, it would essentially represent an extension of the status quo. ii. While it could also increase the amount of available information about the tax system, the areas of the tax system which are reported on are likely to vary from one government to the next. This could make it difficult to build up a sustainable timeseries of data which would allow for the observation of variations and trends from one year to the next. It would continue to be subject to reprioritisation of resources within Inland Revenue’s baseline funding and the wider Government work programme pressures and priorities. As a non-statutory option, the increased reporting could be stopped quickly and with little public involvement. iii. Commissioning specific advice is unlikely to increase the public’s understanding of the tax system other than in areas being commissioned. Although official advice is usually released publicly following its consideration by Ministers, the audience for official documents tends to be Ministers or other officials, and once released generally picked up by journalists, researchers and academics rather than the general public. Accordingly, the public reach of this advice is likely to be limited. o Option 2( a) – Enactment of a reporting framework: A statutory reporting framework which provided regular reporting on selected current issues would offer advantages over the previous two options. For example: i. Regular and defined re porting obligations would allow for the observation of trends and variations in the data as the information produced by the framework grows over time. Setting the requirement in legislation increases the chances that the reporting remains consistent over time, and begins to engage the public more, as has been seen with other legislated reporting frameworks. This improves sustainability and public understanding. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] ii. The regular publication of reporting produced by the framework could en courage greater public interest in the tax system and promote debate on the specific areas that are reported on. This may also reduce the scope of future working groups to focusing on how tax systems should change rather than determining the current state of the tax system. o However, a framework which reports on selected issues would also present several challenges. In particular: i. The issues which are the subject of reporting are likely to, at least in part, reflect the views and priorities of the enacting government. The selection of these issues is also likely to be influenced by challenges and risks posed by the current environment. Accordingly, there is the risk that a reporting framework which is focused on specific issues could be seen as focused on the political issues at that time. It could become quickly outdated through changes in the social and economic environment, which could in turn affect the willingness of the public to consider or engage with its findings. This limits the sustainability and could impact public understanding. ii. Although the framework would offer an educational function, this would largely be in respect of the specific issues which are covered by the reporting framework. This would leave the public unaware of the tax policy principles and frameworks which underpin the operation of the tax system, and which guide officials and ministers in evaluating policy proposals. iii. There would be increased administrative costs to meet the reporting requirement and the focus on current tax system issues could require additional data to be collected from taxpayers. This increased compliance costs could be greater if the current issues being reported on change over time in unpredictable ways. o Option 2(b) – Enactment of a reporting framework informed by tax principles: A reporting framework based around tax principles would contain the advantages of Option 2 while mitigating its shortcomings. A reporting framework focused on aspects of the tax system related to the tax principles would: i. Provide a regular source of information about the operation of the tax system relating to the fundamental principles of a tax system. This would allow for the observation of trends and variations in the data over time as the information produced by the framework grows and provide context to understand the inherent trade-offs between different principles of tax. ii. Contribute to an improved public understanding of the operation of New Zealand’s tax system and its underlying policy frameworks. In particular, it would show the interrelatedness between some principles of tax systems, and where trade-offs are required. iii. Offer a trusted, politically neutral source of information. Any future tax working group would have a good base of information to work from potentially reducing the ad hoc administration and compliance cost of developing that information for a review. iv. Direct in legislation the collation of specific information using defined indicators (“principle indicators”) that are key measures of tax principles, to ensure trends of key data are maintained over time. This would involve more administrative work in collating the information and ensuring it remains relevant over time (adapting the measures for changes in technology and ways of working for example) but would also offer the most benefit of the options. It would also involve compliance costs in taxpayers providing any data need to report on the specific measures, but as it is Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] related back to core tax principles the likelihood is that the data will be consistently collected over time, allowing for some efficiencies to be established in the collection and analysis of the data. 22. Option 2(b) (i.e. the enactment of a reporting framework informed by tax principles) is the option being considered. A subsidiary issue lies in how best to express the principles within a statutory framework. Section 2a: Selection of the framework’s principles 23. There are broadly two approaches to the selection of the principles which would guide the statutory reporting framework for the tax system. Option One – General and tax principles 24. The first option would involve the inclusion of general and tax specific principles which cover tax policy design and other areas of social policy as they impact a tax system. For example, during consultation some stakeholders raised the idea of including principles relating to Te Tiriti, human rights, environment/climate change, and social wellbeing. 25. Other principles which have been suggested are linked to operational or administrative processes. Suggestions have been related to principles of public engagement and consultation on policy changes, ensuring the public had direct say on tax policy decisions and respecting the sovereignty of taxpayer information. Option Two – Core tax principles 26. The second option would involve the selection of core tax principles commonly used in a tax policy context. These principles will be familiar to tax professionals and economists and include such principles as equity (or fairness), efficiency, integrity, and certainty. They are focused on the core aspects of the design of a tax system that inform tax policy advice. 27. This option could also include tax principles such as coherence, simplicity and flexibility which have been developed more recently. Discussion Option One – General principles 28. Although many of the wider principles suggested for inclusion in the framework represent important realms of enquiry, including general principles within the framework would extend its focus beyond the operation of the tax system from a tax policy perspective, and into areas of policy for which reporting frameworks already exist. Including wider general principles would therefore risk producing inefficiencies through the duplication of existing efforts which would not necessarily yield new or additional information. 29. For example, on a principle around wellbeing the tax principles reporting proposal would only report on the impact of tax on wellbeing. There is a separate requirement to report on wellbeing as part of the Public Finance Act 1989, which covers a wider range of areas. Likewise, including principles which relate to consultation/engagement and the administration of the tax system would risk duplicating requirements governed by the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Public Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Service Act 2020 and the Public Finance Act 1989. The inclusion of principles which relate to areas such as the environment and human rights would extend the framework’s focus into wider issues of social and public policy which have existing reporting frameworks. 1 Additionally, as these areas are not specific to tax policy design, it is unclear what tax system related information would be reported in connection with these wider principles. Accordingly, Inland Revenue recommends they not be included in the list of tax principles for tax system reporting purposes. Option Two – Core tax principles 30. Although core tax principles will be familiar to economists and tax professionals, they may be unfamiliar to the wider public. These principles have a long and established history of usage in tax policy and are tested and understood in a tax system context. 31. For example, the principles of equity, certainty, efficiency and convenience have been referred to in the context of taxation at least since the publication of Adam Smith’s magnum opus, The Wealth of Nations, in 1776. 32. Variations of these principles, along with more recent additions such as coherence, revenue integrity and fiscal adequacy, were used by the 2010 Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group and the 2019 New Zealand Tax Working Group to assess the design of New Zealand’s tax system. These principles have also been used by overseas tax working groups and in international discussions facilitated by the OECD. The wide use of these principles in a tax context means the framework would be able to draw on a range of existing scholarship and literature in producing its reporting. 33. The tax principles could also inform public debate on the direction of tax policy and the tax system and would provide a framework for considering how different proposals might result in trade-off s between one principle and another. 34. It is possible that some of the information produced by the tax principles reporting framework could assist other reporting frameworks which are focused on wider principles. For example, some aspects of reporting on the tax principles of equity and efficiency (and specifically the neutrality of tax on decision making) could highlight the impact of specific tax policy on the environment. Equity and efficiency may also cover the tax impact of different forms of collective ownership which could help wider reporting on the social wellbeing of different population groups. Measures of vertical and horizontal equity may be able to compare taxpayers by different population characteristics. 35. Although the principles would be a guide to the reporting requirements within the legislation, they would not have any statutory purpose outside of the reporting framework. The principles are not intended to impose requirements on current or future tax laws or guide the outcome of tax related disputes. 1 For example, Statistics New Zealand and the Ministry for the Environment report on aspects of the environment every six months, with reporting on the environment overall every three years under the Environmental Reporting Act 2015. Similarly core Human Rights’ instruments ratified by New Zealand provide for a range of procedures for monitoring compliance. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 36. For the purpose of guiding the reporting requirements, the principles set out in the table below have been proposed for Cabinet’s agreement. An interpretation statement is next to each principle to expand on the application of the principles in a tax policy context, given the general public may be unfamiliar with the terms in a tax policy context. No. Principle Description 1. Horizonal Equity People with similar levels of income should pay similar amounts of tax. The time value of money matters when considering horizontal equity. The tax system should generally recognise the economic effect of income, not its name, while acknowledging there are important areas where exemptions to taxing economic income are justified in the pursuit of wider societal outcomes (e.g. not taxing the imputed rent on an owner occupied home). 2. Vertical Equity The tax system should be progressive. Tax is progressive if people with higher levels of economic income pay a higher proportion of that income in tax. A progressive tax system does not mean that every tax should be progressive (e.g. GST is regressive) but the overall system ought to be. In practice, wealthy people should at the very least pay no lower a rate of tax on their economic income as middle income New Zealanders already do. 3. Efficiency Tax revenue should be raised in ways which minimise distortions to the economy and the use of resources. 4. Compliance and administrative costs Compliance and administrative costs for taxpayers and the Government should be reasonable but this is not justification for substantial unfairness in the tax system. 5. Revenue integrity The revenue system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance. 6. Certainty and predictability People should be able to determine their tax obligations before they are due. 7. Flexibility and adaptability The tax system should keep pace with changes in society, in particular technological and commercial developments, and changes in inequality. Explanation of the tax principles 37. An explanation of what the principles mean in a tax context could help the public to understand their meaning and how they relate to designing tax policy, and to the measures that would be reported. This would support the objective of helping to inform the public and increase public engagement in the design of a tax system. However, there are several principles whose explanations include statements and assertions not commonly associated with the expression of these principles. As further discussed below, Inland Revenue’s view is the inclusion of these statements could present a risk to the integrity, independence and endurance of the reporting framework. For example: Insertion of unfamiliar statements Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] o An explanation of horizontal equity would usually not include reference to the time value of money (i.e. “the time value of money matters when considering horizontal equity”). While the timing of tax payments can have an influence on horizontal equity there could be other factors that also have an impact. Similarly, an explanation of vertical equity would typically refer to people in different positions rather than “wealthy people.” An explanation of the principle of flexibility and adaptability would usually not include explicit reference to changes in inequality. Inclusion of contested statements o The statement “GST is regressive” concerns the distributional impact of a tax on consumption. The distributional impact of consumption taxes remains an area of ongoing inquiry, and there is debate among economists as to whether the distributional impacts of consumption taxes should be assessed relative to annual income or expenditure. The definitions of income or expenditure to be used are also often discussed. o As a proportion of annual income, lower income households tend to pay a higher proportion of their income on consumption, while higher income households able to save a portion of their income display lower consumption relative to income. This can make GST appear regressive. However, the GST to annual income ratio can fluctuate over their lifetime depending on a person’s savings and borrowings at any given time. o Although evaluating GST relative to expenditure can “smooth” variations in a person’s lifecycle, the use of an expenditure base has limitations (as, for example, people may pass on wealth as an inheritance). There is also debate among economists on how best to determine the appropriate expenditure base. Presuming decisions about trade-offs o The pursuit of some principles simultaneously (e.g. certainty and flexibility) will produce conflict, meaning that some degree of trade-off between principles is inevitable. However, in general, decisions about trade-offs between statements of principle are value judgements made with reference to values existing outside the principles themselves. o For example, the inclusion of the statement “but this is not justification for substantial unfairness” within the explanation of the principle relating to compliance and administration costs represents a value judgment about the priority or ranking of principles among themselves. This risks pre-empting the views of future decision makers by presuming a decision about a trade-off between principles which has not yet been made. Neutrality and Longevity 38. The features noted above could pose a risk to the perceived independence of the reporting framework. Because decision makers may reach different decisions about trade-offs between principles or value the pursuit of some principles over others, statements which provide a position on these issues could cause the framework (and the information which it produces) to be viewed as unduly influenced by these statements. Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 39. Statements about the effects of taxes (e.g. “GST is regressive”) could be overtaken by new developments in economic research. To the extent new insights suggest a different conclusion, the framework’s overall perceived integrity and relevance could be affected. 40. This could affect the longevity of the framework. As some of the framework’s value will emerge from the observations which can be drawn from the data series produced by the framework over time, the features noted above could prevent the framework’s full value being realised if future government place less value in its use. Alternatively, they may amend the legislation with a risk that some continuity of reporting is lost. 41. On the other hand, providing a list of the tax principles without some guiding explanation will not assist in the objective of better informing the public. Similarly, an explanation that is factual but bland is unlikely to engage the public in debate. 42. In either case, it will put an onus on officials who are reporting inf or mation on the tax system to set out the caveats and assumptions used in measuring the reports, and the potential weaknesses in the implications that could be drawn from those measures. The reporting would also need to indicate that decisions makers do need to make trade-offs between the different principles as well as any wider principles or priorities that matter to decisions makers. Principle indicators 43. There is no one measure that can provide insight into each tax principle. Due to the challenges associated with assessing each principle directly, Inland Revenue does not recommend prescribing specific methods for assessing each principle within the legislation itself. However, it would be useful for the public and officials to understand the types or categories of information that could be reported against various tax principles. This would also ensure that key trends can be discerned over time through the use of consistent measures set out in the legislation. 44. The framework achieves this by establishing categories of information (or “principle indicators”) which are relevant to each of the principles. Under this approach, the legislation would describe the information that is most relevant, leaving Inland Revenue the ability to select the most appropriate methodologies for collecting and evaluating that information. The indicators would not be restrictive or exhaustive, and Inland Revenue could report on other indicators not listed in the legislation in relation to the tax principles where they are relevant. The indicators would guide what should be reported at a minimum. 45. A descriptive (rather than prescriptive) approach to information collation would prevent confining the framework to specific methodologies and ensure it is able to the take advantage of latest advances in the tax and economic literature. It would also help the framework to account for the quality or availability of different data sets. For example, an enquiry into the principle of certainty could include analysis of the confidence taxpayers have in determining their tax obligations. This could be accomplished through surveys, focus groups or interviews with taxpayers and their agents. Other relevant information could include the number of remedial or retrospective amendments passed during that year, the availability of technical interpretation guides or the number of disputes a year. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 46. However, it will be important to place information collected by the framework in its proper context and outline any limitations. For example, continuing with the theme of certainty, the fact that remedials have been passed into law does not automatically mean the tax environment is uncertain, as some remedials can perform a clarificatory role, which increases the level of certainty within the tax system. 47. Regular engagement with stakeholders (e.g. every three years) and a process for alerting the public to the measures intended to be published would help to ensure that the indicators within the framework remain relevant and meet social expectations. Incorporation of Revenue Strategy 48. Officials considered whether to make changes to the legislative requirement for the government to prepare and publish a Revenue Strategy. 49. The Government’s annual Revenue Strategy is currently part of the Fiscal Strategy report which is required under the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA). Section 26L(1)(d) sets out the requirement to include details of the Government’s revenue strategy in the fiscal strategy report. This must include the Government’s objectives for the tax system and tax policy. Section 26G sets out the principles that apply to responsible fiscal management which includes in section 1(e) “when formulating revenue strategy, having regard to efficiency and fairness, including the predictability and stability of tax rates”. These mirror a number of the tax principles proposed for inclusion in the Tax Principles legislation. 50. Section 26J requires a fiscal strategy report to state the Government’s long-term objectives for fiscal policy and, in particular, for total operating revenue. The fiscal strategy report must explain how those long-term objectives accord with the principles of responsible fiscal management. 51. There is an option of relocating the requirement to produce a Revenue Strategy within the TPA would consolidate these functions within the same legislation where the focus is on the tax principles. The PFA could focus on wider fiscal strategy and cross reference the Government’s revenue strategy under the TPA. 52. The Revenue Strategy could also be used as a “brief of instructions” which would allow the Government to seek specific information on areas of the tax system which are of particular interest to the Government. It could indicate how information provided through previous reporting has (or has not) impacted on the Revenue Strategy. 53. However, as the PFA has semi-constitutional status, the Treasury has suggested further time should be taken to consult and work through the implications of this proposal, particularly the ongoing interaction between the PFA and the TPA, what would be covered in the Fiscal Strategy reporting and what would be in the Revenue Strategy and tax principles reporting. 54. Therefore, an alternative is to proceed to the introduction of tax principles reporting legislation and undertake further consideration on shifting the Revenue Strategy into the TPA. Inland Revenue agrees with this approach. Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 55. The information that would be used for reporting will depend on the availability and suitability of the underlying data. Information from surveys could be produced and published relatively quickly, while analysis of all taxpayer information (for example, to determine the distribution of tax paid by income decile) would take more time to be ready for publication. This is due to the time provided in the Revenue Acts for some taxpayers to file, which can involve extensions of time. 56. An example of this is surveys undertaken to determine the level of certainty taxpayers have that they can determine the correct tax position. Annual surveys will have a higher cost than three-yearly surveys. Frequency of reporting 57. Information on the tax system as it relates to the tax principles and the principle indicators would be published in a report prepared by Inland Revenue. There are three options for how frequently that report should be prepared. The options are: o Annually; o every three years; or o an shorter annual report with a comprehensive three-yearly report. 58. A more frequently published report would create higher administrative costs for Inland Revenue, and potentially for taxpayers and third parties providing the information (to the extent they are not already required to provide it for other purposes). Although the exact form is yet to be determined, the report could be published on an Inland Revenue website, and the comprehensive report would be tabled in Parliament. 59. However, as a number of measures proposed under the tax principle reporting are unlikely to change significantly on an annual basis, Inland Revenue would not recommend a comprehensive annual report. Inland Revenue prefers the third option of a “hybrid” reporting model where a more comprehensive report is produced every three years and a briefer version of the report is provided in other years. This model would seek to use resources efficiently while taking advantage of principle related information which is already regularly produced and annually available. How will the new arrangements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? 60. Inland Revenue will monitor feedback on the publication of material and consider what improvements can be made. As new data or analysis becomes available, Inland Revenue will consider whether it is related to the tax principles and can be published, having regard to the requirements of Revenue Acts to maintain confidentiality and secrecy of specific taxpayers. 61. If the decision is made to publish a comprehensive report every three years, Inland Revenue would undertake engagement with key stakeholders on what measures should be reported for the next report and whether there should be any additional material or explanation to help with informed public debate. If this requires new data Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] to be collected from third parties, this will itself be subject to the usual Generic Tax Policy Process. 62. Consideration will be given to how best to provide the information to the public, which could include the use of data tables, graphs or interactive dashboards as well as seminars and presentations. 63. After the first comprehensive report is completed, the reporting framework will be reviewed to determine whether it is achieving its objectives, whether to add or change the measures included in the legislation and the report, and if other changes can help to meet the objectives.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 1 Regulatory Impact Statement: Deductibil ity of co-operative company dividends Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Agree to a temporary extension of deductibility for dividends on co-operative company shares Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue Date finalised: 8 August 2023 Problem Definition A recent change in the constitution of Fonterra affects its ability to utilise an existing income tax provision to deduct distributions paid to its shareholders. It will result in those deductions significantly reducing, leading to potentially lower distributions and effective over-taxation of distributions for Fonterra shareholders. This RIS considers the options, including a legislative response, to help ensure Fonterra’s shareholders are taxed appropriately following this constitution change. Executive Summary Background Fonterra utilises a provision that allows it to choose to deduct distributions to its shareholders rather than the typical treatment of non-deductible dividends which have imputation credits attached. For most shareholders this provides an equivalent after tax treatment. Fonterra has historically required its shareholders to hold one share for each kg of milk solids they supply to Fonterra. This provides a proportionate link between their supply and Fonterra’s profits. For example, a farmer supplying 5% of Fonterra’s milk would also own (approximately) 5% of its shares and receive 5% of its distributions. Change in constitution Fonterra has recently changed its constitution so that farmers are only required to hold one share for each three kg of milk solids they supply to Fonterra. This allows, but not requires, farmers to hold fewer shares than under the previous constitution. However, it also reduces the linkage between supply and ownership. For example, one farmer supplying 5% of Fonterra’s milk might own 5% of its shares and receive 5% of its distributions while another might also supply 5% but following the constitution change have sold off some of their shares and now only own 2% of Fonterra’s shares and receive 2% of its distributions. Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 Inland Revenue has considered this scenario and concluded that distributions on shares that previously were required to be held but are now voluntarily held will no longer meet the deductibility provision so that compared with previous distributions, only one third will now be deductible. Also due to the interaction of the Income Tax Act 2007, the Companies Act 1993 and Fonterra’s constitution, Fonterra will be unable to attach imputation credits to their dividends. This places Fonterra and its shareholders in a worse position than a regular company as its shareholders will effectively be double taxed on the distributions they receive that the company has not been able to deduct – i.e. once as a tax on Fonterra’s profit and again when that profit is distributed to the shareholder. Time constraint Officials agree that it would be inappropriate for Fonterra shareholders to face a higher effective rate than equivalent income earned through another structure. We also consider thi s should apply from the 2022-23 income year, being the first year covered by the revised constitution. This provides a constraint on the analysis as any law change required to achieve this would need to be added t o the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill. That Bill is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee and is expected to be enacted shortly before the final date for filing an income tax return for the 2022-23 income year (31 March 2024). This time constraint means, while we have consulted with Fonterra, there is insufficient time to consult with Fonterra’s shareholders. This has limited the options considered to ones that will be universally beneficial to shareholders as other options considered out of scope will benefit some shareholders more than others. Options and preferred option This RIS considers retaining the legislative status quo which would still leave Fonterra the option of changing its constitution to allow imputation credits to be attached to non- deductible dividends. However, a constitutional change could not be completed before the 2022-23 year distribution is confirmed in September 2023 and paid in October 2023. Furthermore, officials need more time to consider the appropriate tax treatment of Fonterra’s distributions, so are not seeking to encourage a constitutional change until it is determined whether a future law change, which would make a constitutional change unnecessary, is a better long-term solution. Instead, officials prefer a temporary law change covering the 2022-23 to 2024-25 income years t o restore deductions on distributions to levels that would have been available had Fonterra’s constitution not been changed. This recommended temporary amendment could, in theory, apply to other co-operatives but in practice would likely only be of benefit to Fonterra. It would remove the effective over-taxation for this three-year period while providing time for officials, in consultation with Fonterra and its shareholders, to develop a permanent solution and, if necessary, for amending legislation to be enacted. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 Limitations and Constraints on Analysis Inland Revenue is limited in its ability to disclose sensitive revenue information, so the analysis presented in this RIS does not contain the full suite of information considered by officials in coming to the conclusions in this document. The sensitive revenue information included in this document is limited to that reasonable and necessary under section 18D(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Fonterra is aware of the disclosure of this information. Due to limited time to prepare this analysis we have consulted with Fonterra but have not consulted with its shareholders. This is one of the reasons the options considered have been limited to those that will not make individual shareholders worse off. Responsible Manager(s) (completed by relevant manager) Chris Gillion Policy Lead Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 8 August 2023 Quality Assurance (completed by QA panel) Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & Comment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the regulatory impact assessment prepared by Inland Revenue. The reviewer considers that information and analysis summarised in the regulatory impact statement partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Due to time limitations, it has not been possible to consult with Fonterra’s shareholders and as a result some potential policy options have been ruled out of consideration at this time. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? Background to deductible dividends 1.A co-operative company is a specific type of company with a number of features including that they typically return a portion of their profits to shareholders as rebates or as shares and has shareholders who: •Supply goods or services to the company, •Buy the company’s goods or services, or •Enter into commercial transactions with the company. 2.The Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) 1 provides the ability for a co-operative company to choose to treat distributions 2 paid to its shareholders as a deductible expense that reduces their taxable income. An earlier version of this provision was introduced in 2006 with the intention of applying to structures such as Fonterra had at that time. 3.For a co-operative with shareholders that are taxable at or above the company rate a deductible distribution provides the same total tax revenue as the conventional company treatment of a non-deductible dividend that is distributed with imputation credits. 4.For example, a business with a $100 operating profit that will be fully distributed to shareholders under a deductible distribution or an imputation credit regime: Deductible distribution Imputation Operating profit 100 100 Deduction for distribution (100) 0 Company taxable profit 0 100 Company tax paid @ 28% 0 28 Cash distribution paid 100 72 Imputation credit attached 0 28 Shareholder taxable income 100 100 Tax credit on dividend 0 28 Tax payable @ 33% 33 5 Shareholder after tax income 67 67 5.If shareholders are taxed at less than the company rate (for example, if they have losses carried forward, are a charity or a Maori authority without sufficient other income) they will not get the full benefit of imputation credits so would be better off under a deductible distribution model. 6.This deductibility provision, and its predecessors, was created with the understanding that there would be a linkage between the shareholding and the goods or services supplied between the co-operative and its shareholders. In this way, an individual shareholder’s shares and distributions would be approximately proportional to that 1 Section CD 34B. 2 This RIS uses the terms distributions and dividends. In most instances these terms can be used interchangeably; however, the ITA achieves a distribution being deductible by deeming it not to be treated as a dividend. This RIS maintains the same convention. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 shareholder’s transactions with the co-operative and, therefore, their ownership of the profits that the co-operative generated from those transactions. This provides an equivalent treatment between the deductible/assessable payment the co-operative pays or receives for the transactions with the shareholder and any distributions on the shares they hold. Therefore, where shareholders are required to hold shares (as they were under Fonterra’s previous constitution), there is no tax concession and horizontal equity is maintained between shareholders, so that there is no tax incentive to hold these shares compared to investment in another entity. 7.It also provides a similar outcome to deductible rebates paid by other mutuals and co- operatives. For example, certain electricity lines companies owned by community trusts pay a deductible rebate to users proportional to the supplies (and therefore the profit) between that lines company and the electricity user. An equivalent treatment could be achieved by reducing the lines charge by the amount of the rebate; however, the lines company usually cannot predict their total profit with sufficient accuracy to do so at the time the lines charges are set. Change in Fonterra’s constitution 8.Fonterra has recently changed its constitution so that farmers are only required to hold one share for every 3kg of milk solids they supply. This change is designed to reduce the capital required to become or remain a Fonterra supplier and thereby make it easier for Fonterra to gain or retain market share against its competitors who typically have less expensive capital buy-in arrangements. Individual farmers can reduce their shareholding from the 1:1 ratio to the new 1:3 ratio but only by trading shares with other farmers so collectively Fonterra will still have approximately the same number of shares on issue as under the previous 1:1 approach. Fonterra still treats the 1:1 ratio as the “share standard” and shares up to this amount provide voting rights so a farmer holding less than 1:1 will have fewer votes than a farmer with the same supply and more shares. 9.For example, if Fonterra had 10 shareholders who each provided 100kg of milk solids they would have previously been required to hold 100 shares each. Under the new constitution each farmer could individually reduce their holding to a minimum of 33 shares but only by selling up to 67 shares to one of the other farmers so there were still 1,000 shares on issue. 10.Inland Revenue has determined, as part of a binding ruling, that, the deductible distribution would only be available for distributions on shares that shareholders were required to hold rather than those that were equal to their supply with Fonterra. This application means that, even where all shareholders held shares above the minimum holding and entirely proportional with their supplies, the deduction available to Fonterra would only be 1/3 of that available to an equivalent co-operative without that rule. In the example in paragraph 9, only distributions that relate to the minimum of 33 shares would be deductible and the distributions for the remaining 67 shares would not. 11.Each business will make decisions about how much capital to retain from its after-tax profit, leaving an amount that can be distributed to shareholders. For any level of profit a decrease in deductions will result in greater tax to pay and less cash to distribute. As Fonterra is unable to attach imputation credits to its distributions the shareholders will not receive any direct benefit from the increased tax paid by Fonterra and distributions would be expected to reduce. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 Legislative requirements 12.As noted above, a deductible distribution and the imputation credit regime will, for most shareholders, result in an identical total tax payment. However, when deductible distributions and non-deductible dividends are paid on the same class of shares difficulties can arise. 13.The benchmark dividend rules in the ITA 3 require all dividends in a year to be imputed at the same ratio 4 . However, these rules do not apply to the current circumstance as a deductible distribution is not a dividend and cannot be imputed. Therefore, the ITA does not prevent an unimputed deductible distribution and an imputed non-deductible dividend to be paid by the same company on the same class of shares. To achieve the correct outcome the dividend must have a smaller cash amount with the difference made up by imputation credits. This is consistent with the example in paragraph 4 above. 14.The Companies Act 1993, however, prevents a distribution of a differential dividend 5 on a class of shares except in specific cases which do not apply here 6 . W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 15.The policy problem is the current Income Tax Act and Companies Act legislation when combined with a constitution which does not specifically allow for some distributions to be imputed while others are paid fully in cash will result in Fonterra’s shareholders effectively being overtaxed compared to distributions from other equivalent companies. This is explained in more detail below. Policy problem 16.Where distributions are fully deductible or fully imputable there is no over-taxation as equal distributions can be provided on all shares. 17.If Fonterra can deduct distributions on some but not all shares, it will not be able to fairly compensate its shareholders even when an equal distribution on all shares is made. As Fonterra’s constitution does not contemplate paying differential dividends, then they must provide equal value per share to all shareholders. This means they would be prevented from attaching imputation credits to all non-deductible dividends, either as a replacement for cash or in addition to it, as the holders of the shares which received the non-deductible dividends would then receive different value than the holders of shares which received deductible distributions. 3 Section OB 61. 4 There is limited ability to change this ratio during the year, for example where the company has insufficient imputation credits to impute a second dividend at the same ratio as an earlier dividend; however, this ability is not relevant to the current situation. 5 This is the term used in section 53 of the Companies Act where different shares in the same class receive distributions of different values. 6 The exceptions are for multi-rate portfolio investment entities or where the company’s constitution permits under an objective criteria. The distinction between shares that support supply and shares that do not is an objective criteria; however, Fonterra’s constitution does not currently allow for this. There is also a provision in section LP 6 of the ITA which overrides this requirement for supplementary dividends but this cannot apply to this situation. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 18.The cost of not being able to impute the non-deductible dividends would be shared across all shareholders, including holders of shares with deductible distributions, who, due to the effective over-taxation, would receive a lower after-tax return than intended. 19.For example, consider a co-operative with 100 shares and $100 of operating profit. If this is fully distributed to shareholders with a 33% marginal tax rate and all distributions are deductible the effective tax rate on shareholders is 33%. Operating profit 100 Distribution 100 Less deduction for distribution (100) Co-operative taxable profit 0 Co-operative tax payable (28%) 0 Shareholder taxable income 100 Shareholder tax on taxable income (33%) 33 Total effective tax rate 33% 20.In comparison, under the same facts but with only 50% of distributions being deductible, a non-deductible non-imputed distribution results in over-taxation. Deductible (50%) Non-deductible (50%) Total Operating profit 50 50 100 Distribution 7 41.86 41.86 83.72 Less deduction for distribution (41.86) 0 (41.86) Co-operative taxable profit 8.14 50 58.14 Co-operative tax payable (28%) 2.28 14 16.28 Shareholder taxable income 41.86 41.86 83.72 Shareholder tax on taxable income (33%) 13.81 13.81 27.63 After-tax cash 28.05 28.05 56.09 Total effective tax rate 32.2% 55.6% 43.9% 7 This distribution falls to provide the co-operative with sufficient cash to pay their tax liability. The calculation of how this amount is arrived at has not been shown in this RIS. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 21.If Fonterra is faced with this situation under current legislation and with a constitution that does not provide for differential dividends it would subject its shareholders to over-taxation at any level of distribution above zero. 22.This problem would arise for any co-operative with a similar constitution to Fonterra’s that also relied on the deductibility provision; however, officials are not aware of any other co-operative in that situation. Ability for shareholders to utilise imputation credits 23.As referred to in paragraph 5, there are some shareholders that cannot utilise imputation credits due to their specific tax characteristics. These investors would prefer a cash dividend over a larger dividend that was partially provided in the form of imputation credits; for example, a $80 cash dividend would put them in a better position than a $72 cash dividend with $28 of imputation credits even though most shareholders would prefer the smaller but imputed dividend. 24.This is an existing issue for shareholders with these features and is outside the scope of this RIS to consider this issue, for example by considering whether imputation credits should be refundable. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r ob l e m ? 25.The main objective is to allow Fonterra (and by extension any co-operative company that meets the criteria including that it does not require a 1:1 relationship between supplies and shareholding) to distribute its profits to shareholders without those effectively being subject to tax at greater than intended effective tax rates. 26.A secondary objective is to prevent an unexpected decline, due to those greater than intended effective tax rates, in the after-tax distributions received by Fonterra’s shareholders for the 2022-23 income year. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 27.The criteria that have been used to assess the options are: a.Equity and fairness – The tax system should be fair. Assessment of both vertical equity (the relative position of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. b.Efficiency, effectiveness and coherence – Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. More generally, revenue should be raised in a way that has the least impact on economic behaviour, in particular, does not distort investment decisions in favour of any particular investment. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 28.To prevent the effective over-taxation of Fonterra’s shareholders for the 2022-23 income year it is necessary to consider a legislative solution. It is proposed that this solution be included in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Taxation, and Remedial Matters) Bill which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. 29.Two permanent solutions to this situation would be to make all distributions in this situation non-deductible (which is consistent with the treatment of an ordinary company) or to allow non-deductible dividends to be imputed while not imputing deductible distributions (an example of this is provided in an appendix to this RIS). 30.Imputing non-deductible dividends, while still having a portion of deductible distributions, could only be achieved by a change in a company’s constitution or by legislation overriding that constitution. Both of these options have the same consultation issue explained below so for these purposes have been carved out of scope for the same reason. 31.While all of these options would make most shareholders better off, this would not be the case for shareholders who cannot utilise imputation credits 8 . 32.In that circumstance, it does not seem appropriate to impose an option on shareholders which could make some of them individually worse off without providing them any opportunity to be consulted on this decision. Such consultation has not been practical given the timeframes. Accordingly, these options have been considered out of scope for the purpose of this RIS. 8 Refer to the examples in paragraph 5 and the explanation in paragraphs 23 and 24. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 33.The exclusion of these options means that option two, considered below, is for a limited time period in order that a separate project to find a more permanent resolution can be completed. The options considered out of scope above can be reconsidered as part of that second project. 34.As noted in paragraph 24, this RIS also does not consider the wider treatment of imputation credits by all entities that cannot fully utilise them; for example, by making imputation credits refundable. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? 35.The options to be considered are: i.Status Quo – Fonterra will be unable to attach imputation credits to non- deductible dividends while they also pay deductible distributions on the same class of shares. This would mean Fonterra would need to further amend its constitution to rectify this problem. ii.Temporary extension of deductibility to also allow deductible distributions on shares that are no longer required to support supply. This would allow Fonterra to continue deducting distributions on shares up to its level of supplies with each shareholder based on the previous 1:1 ratio, but only for a limited period while a permanent solution is determined and implemented. iii.Permanent extension of deductibility. As with option 2, except it would apply for all future periods. 36.As noted above, legislative options to remove all deductibility and to impute non- deductible dividends have not been considered as they would make some shareholders worse off and there will be no opportunity for consultation with them before introduction of any proposed law change. Option One – Status Quo 37.As a co-operative that pays a mixture of deductible and non-deductible distributions, Fonterra’s constitution does not allow for differential dividends to be paid, so it will not be able to attach imputation credits to its non-deductible dividends. This means its shareholders will not receive any benefit for tax paid by Fonterra, resulting in greater total tax paid than is intended, effectively being taxed twice. 38.Under this option, Fonterra could change their constitution to allow for differential dividends. However, its shareholders may not agree to this and there would be insufficient time to achieve this before the distributions for the 2022-23 income year (and possibly later years) are determined. Therefore, this option may eventually achieve the main objective but would not meet the second objective of mitigating the over-taxation of their shareholders in the 2022-23 (and possibly later) income years. 39.Also, this option would subject Fonterra to the cost of changing its constitution and impose compliance costs on its shareholders to consider this change. Officials are yet to conduct a policy project to determine the appropriate permanent policy position for Fonterra’s distributions. In the event this project determined that a legislative change was desirable (for example, to make all distributions deductible or no distributions deductible), this would make further changing Fonterra’s constitution unnecessary. While Fonterra is able to progress changing their constitution at any time, officials prefer developing the project to consider a permanent resolution before recommending that Fonterra follow this path. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 40.This option has poor horizontal equity. A shareholder deriving their portion of income from Fonterra would be subject to a higher effective total tax rate than if they had derived that income through a different structure. 41.This option is also not coherent in the absence of a constitution change. It provides a disincentive to invest in Fonterra over other structures. Option Two – Temporary extension of deductibility 42.This option involves a change to the ITA to allow Fonterra to choose to deduct distributions on shares a supplier/shareholder chooses to hold up to the amount supplied. This would be consistent with Fonterra’s previous treatment that previously required shares to be held up to the amount supplied. Dividends on shares above the level of supplies would continue to be non-deductible, which is the treatment that has always applied 9 . 43.This would meet the main objective for the period of the extension but would not do so beyond that, so a further project would be necessary. It would meet the secondary objective as it could be introduced and enacted before the 2022-23 income year return was due to be filed. It is possible that at the end of considering a second project the final position under option two would be equivalent to that in option one, so consideration is mostly for the period of the extension. 44.This option improves horizontal equity for the period of the extension as income earned through this structure, by most investors, would be taxed consistently with equivalent income earned through other structures. Some investors who had tax rates lower than the corporate tax rate would be better off than if they earned equivalent income through other structures but this would be consistent with other co-operatives and Fonterra’s previous constitution where they were required to hold those shares; however, in those instances suppliers are required to hold the shares rather than choosing to. Any distributions on shares above the level of supplies would continue to be non-deductible so there would be no tax incentive to acquire shares above the amount that was previously required to be held. 9 The imputation treatment of these dividends is not considered as part of this RIS and would not be addressed by the considered options. This would be incorporated into the second policy project that is part of the preferred option. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 45.This option improves coherence for the period of the extension but, by design, does not provide any change in coherence beyond that. Although there may be an incentive to invest in Fonterra (or given existing holdings this would be more accurately to not divest an existing investment in Fonterra) by a small group of investors 10 who would receive tax favourable treatment this would only apply for a limited period so is not expected to materially influence investor decisions. After the end of the extended period a further change would be necessary, but this can be considered as part of a separate project. Option Three – Permanent extension of deductibility 46.A change to the ITA to allow Fonterra (and any other future co-operative in a similar situation) to choose to deduct distributions on shares a supplier/shareholder chooses to hold up to the amount supplied. This would be consistent with Fonterra’s previous treatment that required shares to be held up to the amount supplied. 47.For the initial period that matched the period in option two the tax treatment would be identical. However, it would provide a permanent concession 11 to certain investors that would not be available to other investors with different tax attributes or any investors in other entity types. That is, the ability for an investor who cannot fully utilise imputation credits to benefit from deductible dividends in a way that they wouldn’t be able to with a regular company. This concession does not exist for investors in other co-operatives or Fonterra under its previous constitution, even where the tax outcome is the same, as the shares that are required to be held are proportionate with supplies and therefore the shareholders are not able to consider other investment choices beyond indirect effects such as from changing their level of supplies. 48.This option would improve horizontal equity as for the majority of investors the over- taxation problem would be resolved and they would be taxed appropriately. However, as it permanently introduces a concession for a smaller group of investors, it does not improve horizontal equity by as much as option two. 49.This option is less coherent than the status quo as it introduces a permanent concession that is not available to other investment choices and, therefore, incentivises investment in Fonterra (and any co-operative who adopted a similar structure in the future). However, that concession would still be limited to dairy farmers (or other activities for a separate future co-operative) so the overall effect would be somewhat limited. 10 Refer to the examples in paragraph 5 and explanation in paragraphs 23 and 24. The tax advantage arises from the additional cash dividend that is available from the deductible distribution compared to an equivalent imputed dividend. Based on Fonterra’s 2022 distribution officials estimate this benefit for an average farmer, provided they had the necessary tax criteria would be in the region of $1,000 for a year. However, some holdings, particularly by charities, may be larger than the average in which case the potential benefit would be proportionately larger. 11 As with option two, officials estimate this benefit to be in the region of $1,000 for a year based on Fonterra’s 2022 distribution; however, this would continue indefinitely and would increase proportionately to any future increase in distributions. Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 Māor i p ers pe cti ve 50.There will be a variety of Māori investment into Fonterra including through Maori authorities and charities. Due to the varying tax structures, these investments may not be able to (fully) utilise imputation credits for the reasons explained above. 51.The constraints applying to the analysis, specifically the absence of consultation with shareholders, means that we don’t have a good understanding of the arrangements that Māori may use to hold shares in Fonterra. 52.As such, it is difficult to know if there are any disadvantages for Māori over and above those already mentioned in the analysis, being the potential for imputation credits to be unused (because of the tax rate differential). The same comment also applies to charities and other affected entities. Although the tax rate for Maori authorities, at 17.5% is lower than the imputation credit rate of 28%, many Maori authorities will have other taxable income that could benefit from surplus imputation credits. 12 Therefore, to the extent imputation credits cannot be utilised this is more likely to arise where Fonterra shares are owned by a charity than by a Maori authority. 53.However, the status quo and the other options considered in this RIS all cover the deductibility to Fonterra and the consequential effect on cash distributions and have no direct imputation credit effect. The treatment of cash distributions will be consistent with all other income earned by these groups. In other words, a distribution becoming deductible is expected to result in that cash distribution being larger. Therefore, all shareholders, irrespective of their tax status, would receive the same benefit in proportion to their shareholding. The tax consequences of that increased distribution would, then, follow that shareholder’s individual tax status (i.e., taxed at their marginal rate, used to reduce losses that would otherwise be carried forward, or non-taxable). The same analysis would not apply to a proposal to impute non-deductible dividends as that would change the relative benefit to shareholders depending on whether they could utilise imputation credits; however, that proposal is not being considered in this RIS. The additional time to consult arising from a second policy project will resolve this issue to the extent possible. 12 For example, a Maori authority receiving deductible distributions from Fonterra will also receive payments from Fonterra for milk supplied and the surplus imputation credits would reduce the tax payable on any net profit from supplying that milk.

Option One – Status Quo Option Two – Temporary extension Option Three – Permanent extension Equity and fairness 0 ++ This option will resolve the issue but only for a temporary period so that a further response will be necessary.

However, permanently introduces a treatment that could be considered a concession for a subset of investors Efficiency, effectiveness and coherence 0 + Due to the temporary nature it is unlikely to affect investment decisions - Would create an incentive to invest in the co-operative rather than other companies and for other co-operatives to consider restructuring to apply the provision.

It would allow the treatment that applied to the 2021- 22 and prior years under the previous constitution to be continued on a temporary basis while a permanent solution is developed. By not allowing this treatment permanently (option three) it would not introduce a permanent concession to incentivise investment in Fonterra (and other future co-operatives adopting a similar structure) over alternative investment choices. As the temporary extension would only apply until the end of the 2024-25 year, the benefit would only be available to Fonterra suppliers rather than other investors. Further, as the average benefit for an individual year is relatively small, it is unlikely to incentivise holding additional Fonterra shares even for the temporary period. 55.As noted in the scope section, option two will not provide a permanent resolution to this issue. However, the only way a permanent resolution can be achieved is by providing a permanent concession or providing an option that advantages some shareholders relative to others and this cannot be achieved within the timeframes available. A separate project will need to be commissioned to consider this – this project would consider whether a further law change is necessary or whether Fonterra should make further changes to its constitution. Moreover, it would also provide the opportunity for wider consultation. 56.Option one is not viable if there is to be a solution for the 2022-23 distribution as Fonterra could not change its constitution in time, and shareholders may not necessarily agree to such a change. Also, as noted above, this would impose costs on Fonterra and its shareholders that may not be necessary if the policy project referred to in option two determines that a treatment other than a partially deductible, partially imputed distribution is preferable.

Note that the table below does not include the cost to Fonterra (and indirectly its shareholders) or the benefit to Government revenue from distributions becoming non- deductible due to the change in constitution.

This should be achieved by a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Taxation, and Remedial Matters) Bill which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. This Bill is expected to be enacted in March 2024. 58.As this Supplementary Order Paper will be released shortly before the House rises there will be insufficient time for the Finance and Expenditure Committee to call for public submissions on the proposals. However, officials have worked with Fonterra during the development of the Supplementary Order Paper and will continue to do so, to the extent necessary, during the remainder of the parliamentary process. 59.Although the preferred option will first apply for the 2022-23 income year which has recently finished, in many cases the income tax returns for that year will not be due to be filed until after the Bill is expected to be enacted. 60.A change in deductibility (to an amount consistent with what would have been expected had the constitution not changed) will affect the amount of distributions made and the calculations in income tax returns but does not have any material impact on the administration of the tax system.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Regulatory Impact Statement: Digital Services Tax Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: This analysis has been prepared for the purpose of informing Cabinet of the options to tax highly digitalised multinational enterprises on income earned from New Zealand. The two options are: • Amount A of Pillar One of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy; and • A New Zealand digital services tax (DST). The analysis enables Cabinet to decide whether to implement a DST for an interim period whilst the OECD solution takes effect in practice. Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue, Minister of Finance Date finalised: 9 August 2023 Problem Definition The international tax framework relies on principles of physical presence and value attribution that have not kept pace with changes in modern business practice and with the increasing digitalisation of commerce. This means that highly digitalised multinational enterprises can derive significant revenue from a country (such as New Zealand) without being taxed in that country. Executive Summary There are concerns that highly digitalised multinational enterprises do not pay tax commensurate with the revenue they derive from their markets. The issue arises because the existing international tax framework is not adequately able to tax business profits arising from use of digital business models and other new business practices. These developments mean the traditional criteria for taxation (allocation of profits based on tax residence or physical presence in a source country) are less effective. The result is that countries’ tax bases are undermined, and that digitally capable businesses are able to access tax advantages because traditional tax settings were devised for a pre-digital world. Over time this will mean that the tax burden is less evenly shared between participants in a jurisdiction’s economy. It will also undermine the perceptions of fairness that underlie voluntary compliance. Concerns that highly digitalised multinational businesses are able to minimise taxes and shift profits are not new. These concerns are shared by members of the international tax community and by other interested parties, such as some non-governmental organisations. The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting work undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Co-operation and Development (OECD) aimed to address the issues and find a solution which better enables taxation of the profits of these businesses by both the countries they are resident in and those from which they earn income. However, that work has focussed on reducing opportunities to avoid paying tax under the existing framework. The problem posed by highly digitalised multinationals requires a more fundamental change to the framework itself. We consider the risks to social cohesion and the integrity of the tax system are too great to leave the problem unaddressed in the long term. As a result, two options have been considered that would address the under taxation of highly digitalised multinational enterprises in New Zealand. These are: • Pillar One, Amount A of the Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy (the Two Pillar Solution). This is an OECD-led multilateral response. Amount A would reallocate some income from large multinationals to market jurisdictions; that is the jurisdiction in which the sales generating the profits are made. Pillar One also includes an Amount B, which aims to simplify the transfer pricing rules for marketing and distribution activities. At the time of writing, Amount A is still under negotiation aft er missing a deadline for its completion in July. However, the OECD expects the multilateral convention that will allow for its implementation to open for signature in the latter part of 2023. While A mount A of Pillar One is preferred by both officials and the Government, • A unilateral digital services tax (DST) which would tax the revenues of in-scope highly digitalised businesses at a low rate, based on the revenue attributable to local users. This could be implemented more quickly than a multilateral solution, although it entails certain risks. The options for New Zealand to act unilaterally are constrained by international tax and trade agreements. This means any unilateral solution cannot be an income tax (as it would be inconsistent with existing double tax agreements) or discriminate against foreign nationals (which would be inconsistent with our trade obligations). Further, in the absence of an effective international solution, it would be optimal to make any unilateral solution broadly align with those already proposed or in effect abroad. These constraints mean that if the Government seeks to take action outside of a multilateral framework, a DST is the only realistic option at this point in time. While officials and the Government consider the multilateral solution to be the preferred solution, the Government has directed officials to prepare a DST as a potential interim solution, pending effective implementation of an acceptable multilateral outcome from the OECD process. The New Zealand DST is designed to tax multinationals that derive revenues from New Zealand users of search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces. Businesses in-scope of the DST are those which have a global revenue in excess of €750 million per year from digital activities and have New Zealand revenue from those activities in excess of NZD $3.5 million per year. It taxes the revenues (rather than profits) derived from these activities, regardless of the multinationals’ physical presence in New Zealand. The DST will be imposed at a low rate (3%). We have considered two broad options for the timing of the imposition of a New Zealand DST: s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • A DST Bill with a fixed commencement date of 1 January 2025 (Option C in the analysis); and • A DST Bill with an ability to defer the commencement date by Order in Council (Option D in the analysis) The DST has been compared against the status quo and the OECD’s Pillar One, Amount A solution under eight criteria: • addressing the tax policy problem; • minimisation of compliance costs; • minimisation of administration costs; • the effect on our international relationships; • retaining flexibility to change course; • ability to be deployed in a timely manner; • minimisation of negative impacts on New Zealand’s trading environment; and • the domestic impact. Both solutions address the tax policy problem. For the DST, the Government’s flexibility and ability to act in a timely manner in light of all the objectives sought from the proposal are affected by when the Government decides to introduce a DST Bill and by what mechanism it chooses to decide upon an effective date. Implementing Amount A of Pillar One would deliver the highest net benefits while meeting the policy objectives (assuming the outstanding issues are resolved in a way that does not undermine what was proposed in the Statement on a Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy (the October Statement) 1 ). The final form of Pillar One is not yet certain — in particular, whether both Amount A and Amount B will need to be implemented together. The attractiveness of Pillar One to potential signatories will depend on that final formulation. Officials think that it would be better to take a cautious approach and wait until the effectiveness of Pillar One as a whole, and its chance of successful implementation, can be better judged in light of future developments before introducing a unilateral DST. While both options entail compliance and administration costs, Pillar One al igns with New Zealand’s multilateral approach to international relations. It also has domestic stakeholder support. Im plementing Pillar One also requires a commitment that unilateral measures will not be imposed, constraining the Government’s flexibility should Amount A of Pillar One take a number of years to be ratified and implemented by signatory countries. 1 Statement on a Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy (October 2021), OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD, Paris. s 6(a), s 9(2)(j), s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] A DST is able to quickly address the identified policy problem and public perceptions that fairness is lacking in the rules for the taxation of highly digitalised multinational enterprises. The Government will be able to change to an acceptable multilateral option at an appropriate time. However, imposing a DST may have tax and non-tax consequences. Prior consultation via the Government Discussion Document Options for taxing the digital economy (2019) indicates that many stakeholders may view a DST poorly. It should also be noted that the burden of the DST is likely to passed on to some extent by the affected taxpayers to New Zealand customers of in-scope digital service providers. A DST may improve social cohesion and bol ster the integrity of the tax system. However, this would be achieved at the expense of imposing compliance and administration costs in the interim period — which may be short. Further, it is considered likely to damage New Zealand’s relations with some international partners if New Zealand were to unconditionally adopt a DST while the OECD solution was still making progress. In addition, a DST may harm our trading environment. While the exact scope and scale of possible retaliatory tariffs is hard to predict, they can be ex pected to be proportionate to the DST. While we expect tariffs to be a small amount in the context of New Zealand’s total trade, they will be significant for affected exporters. Of the two options that enable the Government to progress a DST, Inland Revenue and Tr easury officials strongly advise against the first option (Option C — a DST Bill with a fixed commencement date). From an international relations perspective, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) strongly recommends continuing to wait for a multilateral solution. O fficials from these agencies recommend the Government wait until the beginning of 2024, before deciding whether to introduce a DST Bill. This is because: • introducing the DST Bill in early 2024 would not delay the imposition of the DST. There would still be enough time for the Bill to be enacted before 1 January 2025, which is the earliest proposed effective date for the DST; • an introduction in early 2024 would allow more time to communicate in good faith with key stakeholders; • we will be better able to maintain New Zealand’s reputation as a strong supporter of multilateralism; • we will have a better idea of Pillar One’s prospects of success in early 2024, in particular whether a critical mass of countries has signed the Amount A multilateral convention and whether Pillar One as a whole would benefit New Zealand; and • s 6(a) s 9(2) (h) s 9(2)(d), s 9(2)(f)(iv), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] However, Inland R evenue and Treasury officials see merit in the second option (Option D — a D ST Bill with an ability to defer the commencement date). preparation for a DST is a reasonable option. The ability to defer the commencement date is preferred as it does not commit the Government to adopting a DST at this time, but enables flexible and timely adoption if the Government views this as necessary at a later date. Introducing a DST Bill now may also add pressure to conclude and implement Pillar One to ensure it is an effective solution. Implementing a DST is expected to have a cost t o Inland Revenue of $2.4 million over the forecast period (2022/23 to 2026/27), assuming a 1 January 2025 implementation date. It would then be forecast to collect $222 million in revenue over this same forecast period, assuming the same implementation date. To be compliant with our OECD commitments, a DST cannot be imposed before 1 January 2025 (provided a critical mass of countries sign the Amount A multilateral convention by the end of 2023). This is also the earliest feasible implementation date from a systems perspective. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing operation of the DST. Limitations and Constraints on Analysis Limitations on analysis The problem of under taxation of multinational enterprises is generally accepted by participants in the international tax community. As a result, jurisdictions have sought both unilateral and multilateral solutions to the problem. Given the focus on this area of the international tax framework, changes to the taxation of multinational businesses which address the issue should be expected as many jurisdictions perceive the current framework as deficient. The form the solution will take is not yet certain. Currently, work is ongoing at the OECD on the Two Pillar Solution. Amount A of Pillar One of the Two Pillar Solution will require in-scope multinational enterprises to reallocate a portion of their super-normal profits to market jurisdictions — that is the jurisdiction in which the sales generating the profits are made. Amount A of Pillar One is the OECD’s answer to the policy problem. Most alternative solutions to Amount A that have been proposed or implemented in other countries take the form of a narrow or comprehensive DST. We are only considering a comprehensive DST, as this more fully addresses the policy problem. Narrow DSTs implemented abroad typically focus on advertising, although the policy problem is not limited to businesses selling advertising. A narrow DST would create different taxation treatment for different digital business models and would not fully address the underlying tax policy issues. Further, countries that have implemented narrow DSTs have also been the subject of retaliatory trade measures in response to their DST. The OECD has also issued guidance on the design of alternative measures in an effort to ensure consistency where countries do move ahead unilaterally while a multilateral s 9(2)(d), s 9(2)(f)(iv), s 9(2)(g)(i) s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] solution is negotiated. 2 The guidance states that unilateral measures would need to be consistent with any World Trade Organisation and free trade agreement obligations, including the obligation not to discriminate against foreign service providers. Any alternative to Amount A of Pillar One would also need to be consistent with our double taxation agreements, meaning it could not be an income tax. These constraints, together with the particular policy problem, limit the alternative solutions. Other options, such as changes to the taxation of intangible assets, have been considered but do not sufficiently answer the policy problem. They are not further considered in this regulatory impact statement. Ministers have directed officials to prepare legislation for a potential New Zealand DST which could be introduced to Parliament to signal New Zealand’s commitment to address the policy problem. This legislation is intended to act as a backstop and take effect if countries cannot make sufficient progress towards implementing the OECD solution by 1 January 2025. While our preference would be to set the commencement date by Order in Council, of the two options we have analysed for progressing the DST, we prefer introduction of a DST Bill with the commencement date capable of deferral until 1 January 2030 (Option D in the analysis). The deferral mechanism will allow Ministers to make a judgement in light of important future developments and allow for greater flexibility and ability to mitigate international risks. To enable highly digitalised multinational enterprises to comply more easily across jurisdictions a potential New Zealand DST should be similar to those designed by other OECD countries. It should also be simple to operate given its intended interim nature. Given these constraints, we consider that a full DST is the only feasible unilateral measure that could solve the policy problem. Officials have been working on the high-level design of the DST for some time, but the confidential nature of the proposal and the limited timeframe since direction to prepare a Bill was received has limited the ability to fully assess the impacts on external stakeholders including exporters and Māori. Consultation may produce further insights into the impact and design of the DST. However, based on our experience in similar international workstreams, we consider it likely that public engagement with technical features of the DST is more likely to occur when a bill is introduced to Parliament. As such, consultation could occur at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage as part of the select committee process. Understandings and assumptions A number of key assumptions and understandings underpin our impact analysis. Two Pillar Solution • New Zealand committed not to impose any unilateral measures until 1 January 2024 under the October Statement. This was intended to allow time for the OECD work to progress. 2 Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation: Interim report 2018, OECD/G20 Base Erosion & Profit Shifting Project: https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/9789264293083- en.pdf?expires=1681856848&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=EFF050652C3113CE4834F91996890C38 Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • This commitment was extended until 1 January 2025 under the Final Outcome Statement on the Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy 3 (the Outcome Statement) which New Zealand approved in July 2023. However, this extension is conditional on a critical mass of jurisdictions signing the Amount A multilateral convention before the end of 2023. It is not yet certain whether this critical mass will be achieved. • There is also the possibility of a further extension to 1 January 2026. This has not yet been agreed to by country members of the OECD’s Inclusive Framework. Any extension would require sufficient progress to have been made on Amount A. • If A mount A is successfully implemented by a critical mass of countries, then the DST will not be necessary. New Zealand DST • The DST should be ready for implementation (should the Government wish to do so) as soon as is practical, subject to constraints placed on us by our international obligations and internal resourcing. This means the DST would be effective from 1 January 2025 at the earliest. • The DST would be an interim measure while work continues on a multilateral solution. • The DST would be repealed once an acceptable international solution is implemented. • Inland Revenue can design and implement systems and guidance to support the DST from the effective date. Systems should be easy to turn off when the tax is no longer required. • There are a limited number of potential taxpayers (estimated to be 15 to 20), therefore the compliance and administration impact of the tax will be limited. • These taxpayers will comply without significant enforcement activity from Inland Revenue. Other risks • Countries in which in-scope multinational businesses are headquartered (host countries) have reacted strongly and negatively to countries that have already proposed or implemented a DST. This includes implementing retaliatory tariffs on specific exports from DST imposing jurisdictions. • Other interested parties may perceive New Zealand’s actions poorly or as premature. However, this risk would be mitigated if we act alongside with other likeminded jurisdictions. Some international partners may be concerned that preparing for an interim alternative signals a lack of confidence in the OECD process and therefore undermines Amount A’s chances of success. This can be 3 Final Outcome Statement on the Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy (July 2023), OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD, Paris. s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] mitigated by not definitively committing to adopting a DST at this time, in order to allow time for Amount A to succeed. • The costs and benefits of implementing a DST have not been fully analysed. As above, other countries that have implemented a DST have experienced trade retaliation from host countries In other cases, where a DST has been proposed but not implemented, trade retaliation did not eventuate. • B ased on evidence from overseas, some of the cost of the DST is likely to be passed on to consumers in at least some circumstances. This means the tax will be borne to some extent by New Zealanders rather than digital multinationals. • A lthough a multilateral solution is preferred, the Pillar One proposal may not ultimately be in New Zealand’s best interests. Pillar One consists of two loosely related measures: Amount A and Amount B. The final linkages between the two measures not yet clear and therefore the package overall cannot be analysed. D ata and evidence Due to the novel nature of this tax, there is not a wide range of data sources. As such, the data and evidence used to analyse the risks and benefits of a DST is limited. The analysis is based upon international experiences and publicly available corporate financial statements.

This is because the stakeholder views summarised in the RIS are mainly informed by a public consultation which took place in 2019, and there has not been more recent stakeholder consultation. Since 2019 there have been developments on the OECD’s Pillar One work and updated evidence from DSTs operating in other jurisdictions which stakeholders could have views or insights on. The RIS uses other sources of information to analyse recent developments such as Inland Revenue’s participation in the OECD work and published reviews and news articles about the impacts of DSTs which have been implemented in other jurisdictions. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? Current international tax framework 1. The international tax framework was developed in the 20 th century. However, our modern economic system has outgrown this framework. The growth of the digital economy means that highly digitalised multinational enterprises can derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. This means very large businesses can have a large presence in the New Zealand market without contributing their “fair share” of tax. 2. Features of digital business models that have exposed shortcomings in the current international tax framework include: a. Scale without mass: multinational enterprises are able to transact with customers over the internet without having the physical presence required by double tax agreements for income tax to be charged in the country. b. User value creation: Even where a digital company does have a physical presence, the profit allocation rules do not recognise the new kinds of value that digital companies can generate in their market countries. c. Intangibles: Much of the value of modern multinational enterprises is attributable to intangible assets. Intangible assets are both difficult to value and highly mobile, meaning that such businesses are able to shift their profits to low tax jurisdictions by locating their intangible assets there and charging royalties. 3. While these features also exist for other business models, they are particularly acute for highly digitalised businesses. Modernising the tax framework for multinational enterprises 4. Over the last ten years New Zealand has taken steps to improve the tax framework that applies to multinational enterprises. For example, initiatives such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project have reduced the ability of multinational businesses to engage in aggressive tax planning. New Zealand has acted to implement these initiatives. Changes in New Zealand’s collection of GST have also helped to level the playing field for local businesses. 5. These measures, combined with our strong anti-avoidance rules, mean that New Zealand’s tax laws are effective at preventing tax avoidance by multinational enterprises. There is evidence that taxpayers are responding to these measures by reducing related-party debt, removing hybrid instruments (and entities) and restructuring their business operations in New Zealand. 6. Further, in recent years Inland Revenue has placed an increased level of compliance scrutiny on the tax practices of multinational businesses. This has been supported by enhanced disclosure requirements, guidance, binding rulings and advance pricing agreements to support compliance with our tax laws. 7. These measures have strengthened the existing international tax framework by reducing opportunities for businesses to avoid tax. However, these measures do not address the new challenges of “scale without mass,” “user value creation” and “intangibles” posed by the digitalisation of the economy. Addressing these issues requires more fundamental changes to the international tax framework. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OECD Two Pillar Solution 8. There has been global concern about the under taxation of the digital economy. Efforts are underway at the OECD to negotiate a modernisation of the international tax framework, addressing these concerns. 4 9. One part of the proposed OECD reforms is “Pillar One Amount A” of the Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy (Two Pillar Solution). 10. Pillar One Amount A addresses tax issues in the digital economy by creating a new global mechanism by which multinationals would pay more tax in the jurisdictions where they generate revenues, regardless of their physical presence there. Multinationals would be required to reallocate 25% of their income over a 10% return on revenue to market countries, in proportion to their sales in those countries. Effectively they would share a quarter of their super profits with market countries. The countries where those super profits are currently being returned would then need to provide tax relief on the reallocated amounts. Amount A is not limited to digital companies. Instead it would apply to all multinationals (with some limited exceptions) with global revenue over €20 billion (likely falling to €10 billion after seven years). 11. H owever, the outcome of the Amount A process is uncertain. Even if the agreement is concluded according to the latest timeframes, effective implementation would require participation from key countries, including those who are a major location for multinational enterprises. 12. A New Zealand digital services tax (DST) would address the same tax issues as Amount A via a different approach. The DST is designed to tax multinationals that derive large revenues from New Zealand users of search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces. It taxes the revenues (rather than profits) derived from these activities, regardless of the multinationals’ physical presence in New Zealand. Agreement to a solution implementing Amount A will require countries to remove all unilateral measures such as DSTs and to commit to not introducing them in future. 13. Pillar Two of the Two Pillar Solution creates a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to address tax competition and the erosion of the corporate tax base. New Zealand is currently working towards implementing Pillar Two via domestic legislation. Pillar Two is not dependent on the success of Pillar One and can co-exist with a DST due to its differing purpose. Status quo 14. The status quo damages New Zealand’s collective wellbeing by reducing Government revenue on an ongoing basis and increasing the perceived unfairness of the tax system. This undermines social cohesion and the public’s confidence in the integrity of the nation’s tax system. As the digital economy continues to expand at a faster rate than the rest of the economy, and digitalisation increasingly drives economic and productivity growth, the effect of this is only expected to grow. 5 However, this effect is not currently quantifiable as there are no authoritative estimations of the New Zealand digital economy’s growth rate. For the advertising 4 Base erosion and profit shifting - OECD BEPS 5 Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Interim Report 2018, OECD/G20 Base Erosion & Profit Shifting Project,: https://www.oecd- ilibrary.org/taxation/tax-challenges-arising-from-digitalisation-interim- report\_9789264293083-en s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] sector, it can be observed that digital advertising now accounts for over half of all advertising spending and continues to grow at a faster rate than traditional advertising. 6 A competition inquiry in Australia found that large multinationals like Google and Facebook account for the majority of digital advertising revenue. 7 15. The reduction in revenue arises from the amount of profit that New Zealand is unable to tax under the current tax framework. Present estimates suggest that a DST could collect revenue of approximately $86-90 million for each assessment year, growing in line with growth in the digital economy. Due to the design of the DST, this revenue is representative of profits realised by highly digitalised multinational enterprises that are attributable to users in the New Zealand market. 16. This problem poses a threat to New Zealand’s tax revenue through a decline in voluntary taxpayer compliance and a narrowing of the tax base. Narrowing could happen in two ways. a. First, if growth in the digital economy continues to outstrip growth in traditional business models the ability to tax an increasing proportion of income earned in New Zealand by multinationals will be constrained. b. Secondly, more businesses may adopt structures to take advantage of the shortcomings in the international tax framework. 17. If a solution is not ready to implement in the medium-term, this will allow the status quo to become further embedded, with all the risks that entails. Interactions with other government work programmes 18. Other government agencies are leading work programmes that could be seen as part of an overarching theme of responding to the challenges (and opportunities) presented by the growth of the digital economy. o Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage is engaged in work that would require digital platforms to enter negotiations with New Zealand news media entities for their content that is made available by digital platforms. There is likely to be overlap between the digital platforms required to negotiate and the highly digitalised multinationals captured by the DST. o The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) engages in and supports other agency engagement in international discussions on digital issues, including trade in multilateral bodies (e.g. OECD, World Trade Organisation (WTO) and United Nations), and digital trade is a common feature in international trade negotiations including free trade agreements and the US- led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which seeks to support the growth of the digital economy. What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem 19. There is international concern about the ability of highly digitalised multinational enterprises to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax in that country. This is because the international tax framework was developed in 6 NZ Advertising Turnover Report, Marketing Association, 28 August 2022, https://marketing.org.nz/news/nz- advertising-turnover-report 7 Digital Platforms Inquiry – Final Report, 26 July 2019, Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/digital-platforms-inquiry-final-report Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the early part of the 20th century and has not kept pace with changes in modern business practice and with the increasing digitalisation of commerce. 20. The features of digital multinational enterprises (“scale without mass”, “user value creation” and “intangibles”) create two issues that damage the integrity and fairness of the tax system: a. They allow multinational businesses to earn revenue from a country without being liable to income tax within its borders; and b. They allow multinational businesses to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions. 21. These issues are most acute for highly digitalised enterprises. However, they also apply to a lesser extent more generally, as more ordinary business models have become increasingly digitalised. This leads to an equity issue whereby the tax base is narrowed, concentrating the tax burden on a smaller group of taxpayers who cannot shift their income offshore or whose income is not derived from the digital economy. Affected population 22. The key groups affected by the proposal to implement a DST are highly digitalised multinational enterprises and the individuals and businesses across New Zealand who use their services. 23. The experience of other countries, such as the United Kingdom, shows that the number of highly digitalised multinationals is quite small, though each multinational enterprise is large. The United Kingdom’s DST has just 18 taxpayers. 8 We expect a similar, or smaller, number of taxpayers in New Zealand. Based on their public statements and previous consultation, highly digitalised multinational businesses recognise the problem, but do not support a DST. They consider countries should address the problem through Pillar One of the OECD Two Pillar Solution instead. 24. We assume that use of one or more of the in-scope digital services is widespread. Based on previous consultation we know the public at large view the problem similarly to Inland Revenue (as discussed under “Previous Consultation” below). 25. Others who may be indirectly affected by the imposition of a DST will include: a. N ew Zealand exporters. and b. N ew Zealand departments and agencies who support exporters or hold other relationships with countries that are potentially affected by the implementation of the DST. 26. The OECD and other countries may also be indirectly affected to the degree it affects their own work programmes. 27. Officials expect Māori to be affected in the same way as others in similar circumstances. Time and process constraints limited analysis on this point. 28. At present, no other specific population groups have been identified that will be disproportionately affected by the tax changes proposed. Affected populations and their concerns may become apparent via submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. 8 Investigation into the Digital Services Tax, National Audit Office, 23 November 2022: https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/investigation-into-the-digital-services-tax/ s 6(a), s 9(2)(d), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Previous Consultation 29. A discussion document was issued by the Government in 2019, Options for taxing the digital economy (the 2019 discussion document). This canvassed views on a DST and the multilateral solution. We received 374 submissions, including 333 from individuals that followed the same template. Submissions primarily focused on whether or not to adopt a DST, rather than the design of either instrument. Nearly all submitters agreed that a multilateral agreement at the OECD would be the best long- term solution to the challenges facing the international tax framework. 30. There was widespread opposition to any DST from the business sector, including many domestic firms that would not be subject to it. These submitters generally acknowledged the challenges posed by the digital economy. However, they argued that a DST would impede innovation and growth, undermine the international tax framework, and expose New Zealand to the risk of trade retaliation. They were also concerned about the compliance costs of a DST, and its application to New Zealand firms. Finally, they were concerned that affected multinational enterprises would simply pass on the cost of a DST to New Zealand consumers. Overall, they considered the risks and disadvantages of a DST outweighed the amount of revenue it would raise. They argued that New Zealand should focus its efforts on a multilateral solution at the OECD instead. 31. By contrast, individuals and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) supported a DST as an interim measure. These submitters were generally concerned about deficiencies with the current income tax rules. They consider that the current rules lead to economic inequality, the under taxation of multinational businesses, and a lack of government revenue to fund public services. These submitters supported greater taxation of multinationals. 32. In the development of the 2019 discussion document, officials also considered alternative options, such as a minimum corporate tax (which the Government is now moving to implement as part of Pillar Two of the OECD solution) and a tax on offshore royalties. While a minimum tax addresses profit shifting by multinationals generally, neither it nor a tax on offshore royalties would address the fundamental challenges of taxing the digital economy. Therefore, the only realistic options are the multilateral solution or a comprehensive DST. 33. It is currently envisaged that any future consultation will occur at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage via the select committee process. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 34. The objective of the DST is to ensure highly digitalised multinational enterprises pay tax in New Zealand commensurate with the value they generate from our market. Broadly, an acceptable DST should: a. Minimise compliance costs, b. Be compliant with New Zealand’s international obligations, and c. Be interim in nature, pending a more permanent acceptable multilateral solution. 35. For the DST to ensure highly digitalised multinational enterprises pay more tax in New Zealand, it needs to be easy to comply with. Otherwise, there is the risk of the affected firms refusing to comply or leaving the New Zealand market. 36. To be effective, the DST needs to exist outside of the current international income tax framework. This means it cannot be an income tax (or creditable against an income tax). It would also need to comply with New Zealand’s obligations under the WTO and our free trade agreements. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 37. New Zealand also needs to maintain a business and regulatory environment which attracts foreign capital and trade. As a small open economy and capital importer, New Zealand is heavily reliant on foreign direct investment and trade to drive its economic growth and development. Accordingly, New Zealand’s DST should not depart too far from international norms. Regulatory Impact Statement | 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem 1. There are three options considered in this regulatory impact statement that have been used as a comparison against the status quo. These are: a. Pillar One, Amount A; b. An unconditional commitment to a DST, by introducing a bill with a fixed 1 January 2025 application date; and c. Progressing a DST, by introducing a DST Bill with a commencement date that can be deferred by Order in Council. What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 2. Given our objectives, the options are to be compared against eight criteria: a. Tax Policy: the option should address the tax policy problem of highly digitalised multinational enterprises not paying tax in New Zealand commensurate with the revenues they derive from our market. b. Compliance costs: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. c. Administration costs: administration costs should be minimised as far as possible. This includes ensuring the option can be implemented, and repealed, with low administrative costs. d. International relations: the option should be compliant with our obligations to other countries under OECD instruments and under other international agreements, including international trade agreements. Diplomatic and trade risks should be minimised as far as possible. e. Flexibility: in a fluid international environment, flexibility to change course should be retained for as long as possible. f. Timeliness: the option should contribute to the Government having an instrument, or instruments, prepared that can be deployed in a timely manner. g. Trading environment: the option chosen should minimise negative impacts on the trading environment. This includes impacts on both businesses directly affected by the option chosen and those indirectly affected by possible non- tax impacts, such as exporters. h. Domestic impact: the economic effect on exporters and consumers. The views of stakeholders should also be considered when comparing options, as this may affect successful policy implementation. 3. There will be trade-offs between achieving our tax policy objective and our objectives for international relations, flexibility and timeliness. 4. As the DST design is not finalised, costs have been provided on a best estimate basis. These costs may change in accordance with final decisions on the design and implementation of the DST. What scope will options be considered within? 5. Ministers have directed officials to progress work on a New Zealand DST. This is intended to be an interim solution while Pillar One of the OECD’s Two Pillar Solution awaits finalisation and implementation. Further, at this time no decision has been made by the Government to definitively adopt any particular solution (including Pillar One). 6. Other options which have been considered include: a. A narrow DST focused on digital advertising only. However, the same issues arise in connection with other types of digital business. As such, a narrow DST would create different taxation treatments for different digital business Regulatory Impact Statement | 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] models and would not fully address the underlying tax policy issues. Further, the international reaction to narrow DSTs has been similar to the reaction to comprehensive DSTs and therefore this option does not remove the risk of trade retaliation. b. A tax on offshore royalties paid into low taxed countries. This would discourage a common form of profit shifting. It could serve a role in signalling the Government’s intolerance of tax avoidance by multinationals. However, based on the UK’s experience with such a rule, is unlikely to fully address the policy problem in the same way that as a comprehensive DST or Amount A of Pillar One. 7. Pillar Two of the Two Pillar Solution deals with profit shifting generally rather than addressing the specific challenges of taxing the digital economy. Pillar Two creates a global minimum tax. It is not linked to Pillar One or a DST, in that Pillar Two can be adopted with or without a DST or Pillar One. Pillar Two legislation was introduced into the New Zealand Parliamentary process on 18 May 2023. 8. As noted above, the constraints mean the only two options for solving the problem are Amount A of Pillar One of the Two Pillar Solution (which would require us to sign a multilateral convention once it was agreed) and a comprehensive DST (provided it is consistent with our international obligations). 9. In October 2021, New Zealand, alongside 136 other jurisdictions, committed to the pursuit of the Two Pillar Solution (via the October Statement 9 ). As part of this commitment, New Zealand has agreed not to introduce a DST or other unilateral measures until 1 January 2024. This commitment was extended to 1 January 2025 under the Outcome Statement 10 (provided a critical mass of countries sign the Amount A multilateral convention by the end of 2023). Adherence to both Statements is consistent with New Zealand’s longstanding reputation as a supporter of multilateralism. Further the Statements limit the timing of possible options. 10. The progression of a DST could take a number of forms. The Government could unconditionally commit to adopting a DST now, or it could progress a DST to take effect if Amount A cannot be implemented within a reasonable timeframe. As such, the options analysis considers both the immediate introduction of a DST Bill following Cabinet’s decision with a fixed commencement date, and introduction of a DST Bill with a commencement date that can be deferred via Order in Council. Under the latter option, the Government could defer the commencement of the DST by fixing a date (no later than 1 January 2030) via Order in Council. This mechanism could be exercised multiple times, provided the date specified is before the backstop commencement date of 1 January 2030. This would enable the Government to consider the progress towards implementation of Amount A and other relevant international developments and defer the DST if deemed appropriate. 11. A further limitation is that, if a DST were to be implemented, it should be similar to those designed by other OECD countries. This will assist highly digitalised multinational enterprises to comply across jurisdictions. 12. The DST should also be simple to administer given its intended interim nature and for ease of compliance and administration. 9 Statement on a Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy, (October 2021), OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD, Paris. 10 Final Outcome Statement on the Two Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy (July 2023), OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD, Paris. Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 13. The OECD has provided guidance on the adoption of interim solutions. 11 It advises that DSTs should be designed in a way that limits their impact to large firms rather than start-ups. New Zealand has done this through the use of the €750 million in- scope revenue threshold (that is revenue from digital activities). 14. The €750 million per year in scope revenue threshold is based on the following analysis: a. The threshold builds upon the international standard for Country by Country reporting and Pillar Two of the OECD’s Two Pillar Solution. This is a well- known standard that is administratively simple. b. The application of the threshold to highly digitalised businesses targets the DST at those entities who are more likely benefit from the existing deficiencies in the international tax rules. c. The threshold provides certainty to businesses by providing a bright-line test. Setting the gross revenue threshold at a high level carves out digitalised businesses that do not have a significant global presence. This minimises the compliance costs for smaller business entering domestic markets (such as New Zealand). d. Setting the threshold in relation to digital turnover targets mature digital business activities. This reduces negative effects on growth and innovation (including for existing firms looking to adopt new business models). 15. 16. Following the OECD’s guidance, the gross revenue threshold is supplemented with a local threshold. The purpose of this threshold is to exclude those businesses with only small or negligible user participation and related network effects in New Zealand. The $3.5 million dollar threshold for in-scope New Zealand revenue is broadly in line with the equivalent thresholds adopted in other countries relative to gross domestic product. 17. There are no non-regulatory options available (as any change in tax policy needs to be via regulation). Accordingly, aside from the status quo, there are no readily apparent regulatory or non-regulatory options other than some form of a DST or Amount A of Pillar One (which would still be pursued as the preferable solution if a DST was adopted in the interim). As such, this regulatory impact statement considers the DST as a potential interim solution. What options are being considered? Option A – Status Quo – no solution implemented 18. Option A is the status quo. New Zealand would not address the problem. 19. Tax Policy: The tax policy problem will remain unaddressed with highly digitalised multinational enterprises not paying tax in New Zealand commensurate with the revenues derived from the New Zealand market. 20. Compliance Costs: As no action will be taken, additional compliance costs will be non-existent. 11 Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Interim Report 2018: Chapter 6, Inclusive Framework on BEPS | OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project | OECD iLibrary (oecd-ilibrary.org). s 9(2) (h) Regulatory Impact Statement | 19 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 21. Administration costs: As no action will be taken, additional administration costs will be non-existent. 22. International relations: As no action will be taken, there will be no immediate effect on international relations. In the longer term, if other countries implement solutions, New Zealand’s international reputation would not be materially damaged if we chose not to act, but it could set our international tax policy apart from key partners as we would not be addressing the problem at all. 23. Flexibility: Flexibility to change course is retained even when deciding to continue with the status quo. 24. Timeliness: As no action will be taken, the Government would be less prepared for the agile deployment of a policy solution. It would take at least two years to design and implement an alternative solution from scratch. 25. Trading environment: This option is not expected to affect New Zealand’s trading position. 26. Domestic impact: This option is expected to be well received by businesses and taxpayers who would be subject to a DST. It would also be acceptable to exporters as there is no risk of trade retaliation. However, the status quo probably would not be supported by interested individuals and NGOs. 27. In the longer term, the uncertainty arising from not acting may frustrate some stakeholders. Further if an OECD solution cannot be implemented within a reasonable time period, taxpayers are likely to be frustrated at the continued under taxation of prominent digital multinationals. This perceived unfairness would reduce social capital and undermine voluntary compliance along with the integrity of the tax system. Option B – OECD Pillar One Amount A 28. Option B would be to wait for Pillar One Amount A to be finalised by participating parties at the OECD and implemented, or for it to clearly have failed, before considering any further action. 29. Amount A of Pillar One would create a new taxing right on a portion of the profits of multinational groups with more than €20 billion in annual revenue. Amount A requires 25% of any profit in excess of a 10% margin to be redistributed to the countries where the revenue was earned. This new taxing right would be subject to exclusions for certain activities (such as extracting resources and financial services) and aims to ensure the affected companies pay more tax where they earn their revenues. 30. Tax Policy: Amount A of Pillar One is our preferred solution, and the Government has stated that Amount A is also its preferred solution. Amount A is designed to address the challenges of taxation in the digital economy but is not limited to highly digitalised companies. Amount A would address the tax policy problem by requiring in-scope multinational enterprises (including digital multinationals) to reallocate specified profits to market jurisdictions, therefore ensuring these businesses pay tax commensurate with their revenues in a jurisdiction. It has the added advantage of being a multilaterally agreed and coordinated solution that fundamentally updates the international tax framework. This should result in greater certainty for business while addressing the policy problem. As Amount A is integrated into income tax systems, it would also be a tax on net income, which avoids the negative effects of taxes on gross income such as the DST (such as application to loss making firms). 31. While there has been substantial agreement on most key elements of Amount A, further work is required before the end of 2023. This means we cannot yet estimate with reliability the potential revenue (although we expect it to be roughly comparable to a DST based on current settings). We expect any further changes to Amount A to either be neutral to New Zealand or in our favour. Regulatory Impact Statement | 20 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 32. However Pillar One also includes Amount B, which is a simplified approach to pricing distribution and marketing activities carried out between related parties. It i s not yet clear whether Amount B will be linked to Amount A, such that countries cannot (or will not) sign up to one without the other. Some form of linkage seems likely at this stage. If Amount B is required to be adopted alongside Amount A, Pillar One as an overall package may not be in New Zealand’s best interests. This could leave a DST as the only acceptable solution for New Zealand. 33. C ompliance costs: As currently proposed, Amount A of Pillar One would entail considerable compliance costs for a small number of very large multinational enterprises (around 100 initially, though the scope is intended to increase over time). These amounts could be quantified via the Amount A process at the OECD. However, in-scope multinationals would face only one set of global rules rather than different rules in each jurisdiction they operate in. The compliance costs for in-scope multinationals in respect of their New Zealand operations and obligations are expected to be incremental. No New Zealand headquartered multinationals are expected to be in scope of Amount A (including following the scope expansion, although this could change at some point in the more distant future). 34. Administration costs: There would be some administration costs to Inland Revenue in the establishment and ongoing maintenance of the Amount A regime. These will be limited due to provisions included for the global administration of Amount A and the fact that no New Zealand headquartered companies will be in scope. While currently it is not possible to estimate the costs to Inland Revenue, it is expected they will be no more than the cost of implementing Pillar Two ($11 million build cost with $3 million ongoing annual administrative costs). 35. International relations: There would be no adverse effect on international relations or trade with the adoption of this option, as it would necessarily be internationally agreed. This option would strengthen New Zealand’s reputation as a supporter of multilateral approaches. 36. Flexibility: Adopting Amount A will involve New Zealand agreeing not to introduce any DSTs or similar measures in the future. This would constrain New Zealand’s flexibility to change course in the future. Further Amount A, once agreed at the OECD, will not be open for further negotiation reducing flexibility. New Zealand would be able to withdraw from Amount A in the future within the limits of the multilateral convention (although this would be a significant step and is not something New Zealand typically does). 37. Timeliness: By committing to Pillar One Amount A, the Government’s timeline is constrained by progress at the OECD, which has been repeatedly delayed. 38. The OECD had expected to agree the text for a multilateral convention that would implement Amount A by the end of July 2023. While there was agreement on most elements of Amount A, agreement was not possible on some outstanding elements. Accordingly the finalisation of Amount A has been delayed until later in 2023. The OECD currently intends to have a multilateral convention for Amount A open for signature by the end of 2023. 39. In addition, if Amount A and Amount B are linked, a successful conclusion for Amount A will depend on the progress of Amount B. The finalisation of Amount B has been delayed to January 2024. We are not certain whether this timeframe can be met as s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] there is still significant disagreement between counties on key elements of Amount B (as reflected in the public consultation document for Amount B issued in July 2023 12 ). 40. E ven if Amount A is finalised and signed, it still needs to be ratified by a critical mass of countries before it comes into force. This means the participation of key countries is essential to Amount A’s success. f Amount A does come into force, the time required to implement the tax in the domestic laws of different countries mean that there will be another six months to two years before in-scope multinationals start paying tax under Amount A. 41. A ccordingly, there are significant timeliness disadvantages with Amount A. 42. Trading environment: As the internationally agreed solution, widespread implementation of Amount A should mean there would be no adverse impact on New Zealand’s trading environment. However, uncertainty over yet to be agreed aspects of Amount A could have the potential to change this advice. 43. Domestic impact: As the internationally agreed solution and based on previous consultation, if this option was implemented it would be accepted by most stakeholders. However, individual stakeholders and civil society are likely to become frustrated if there is a significant delay in implementing Amount A. If Amount A is not implemented for a significant period of time, then this option could have a similarly negative effect on social capital as the status quo. Option C – Commit to adopting a DST (introduce a DST Bill with a fixed commencement date) 44. Option C would be for the Government to introduce a DST Bill as an interim measure pending the implementation of an acceptable multilateral solution. 45. Under this option the Government would commit to adopting a DST now. The DST would be implemented on 1 January 2025. 46. As currently proposed, the DST would be levied at a rate of 3% on gross digital service revenues that are attributable to New Zealand users. Only groups with global revenue from digital services of more than €750 million per year and with revenue from digital services connected to New Zealand users or land of more than NZD $3.5 million per year would be liable to pay DST. These key design features are in accordance with the OECD’s suggestions for designing unilateral measures and are similar to those of DSTs already in force in other jurisdictions. 47. Tax Policy: By implementing a DST, the tax policy problem would be addressed, and highly digitalised multinational enterprises would begin paying tax on their income from the New Zealand market. Present estimates suggest that a New Zealand DST could collect revenue of approximately $86 million in the 2025-26 tax year, increasing with the growth in the digital economy. 48. An increase in tax paid by affected multinational enterprises is evidenced by the experience of other countries who have introduced DSTs. The UK’s DST raised £358 million in tax revenue in its first year and most of the affected taxpayers now pay slightly more DST than corporate tax (£351 million). 13 T he DST effectively doubled 12 Tax challenges of digitalisation: OECD invites public input on Amount B under Pillar One relating to the simplification of transfer pricing rules; oecd.org/tax/beps/oecd-invites- public-input-on-amount-b-under-pillar- one-relating-to-the-simplification-of-transfer-pricing-rules.htm 13 Investigation into the Digital Services Tax, National Audit Office, 23 November 2022: https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/investigation-into-the-digital-services-tax/ s 6(a), s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 22 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the tax paid by these multinational groups in that year, although the mix of taxes paid was not evenly spread – i.e., some paid more DST than corporate tax and others the reverse. 49. In other jurisdictions it has been observed that some multinationals have passed on some of the cost of the DST to their customers. 14 50. Compliance costs: The affected firms would have increased compliance costs by being subject to a DST. The UK Audit Office found collecting the data required to calculate the liability was a significant challenge for some groups, 15 however this could be addressed through an adequate choice of calculation methods in the design of the tax (including allowing multinationals to use the same method as they use for the UK DST). If other jurisdictions also move to introduce a DST at the same time, highly digitalised multinational enterprises may find themselves having to comply with many differently designed DSTs. We do not currently have an estimate of those costs as there is no clear international data, but we may obtain insights via the select committee process. 51. Administration costs: There would be estimated administrative costs of $2.4 million over 2022/23 to 2026/27 for Inland Revenue in setting up the systems required for a DST, as well as ongoing collection and enforcement costs. Eventually, there would be costs associated with winding down the tax if an acceptable multilateral solution is agreed. 52. Int ernational relations: It is expected that if the Government commits to adopting a DST now there will be adverse impacts on New Zealand’s international relations and reputation as a strong supporter of multilateralism. 53. 54. Flexibilit y: By committing to introduce a DST New Zealand would have identified an interim solution and would take steps to implement it. However by proceeding with a fixed commencement date, New Zealand would not have flexibility to respond quickly to international developments, such as progress towards implementing the OECD solution and the reaction of other countries to similar measures. Given that a DST is a unilateral measure, New Zealand would still be able repeal the DST in order to implement a multilateral solution at an appropriate time. 55. Further, a definitive implementation date would make it difficult to effectively message to our international stakeholders the interim nature and conditionality of the DST, as well as limit our ability to confidently emphasise our continued commitment to the multilateral process. 56. Timeliness: This option could mean there is a measure in place sooner than otherwise. However, once in place, the DST would need to be repealed as part of a future acceptable multilateral solution. This could be accomplished alongside the legislation to implement the Government’s current preferred solution. 14 Apple, Google, and Amazon respond to European tech taxes by passing on costs - The Verge 15 Investigation into the Digital Services Tax, National Audit Office, 23 November 2022: https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/investigation-into-the-digital-services-tax/ s 6(a), s 6(b)(ii) s 6(a) Regulatory Impact Statement | 23 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 57.Trading environment: Any DST implemented would also need to take account of New Zealand’s international trade law obligations. 58. 59. The ex act scope and scale of possible retaliatory tariffs is hard to predict, but they can be expected to be proportionate to the DST. The value of the tariffs would likely be a relatively small amount in the context of New Zealand’s total trade. However, they will be significant for affected exporters. For example, when the US announced its intention to impose tariffs on France in response to their DST, these were valued at US$325 million 16 compared to estimated DST revenue of US$567 million. 17 This package was at the upper bound of those prepared against other DST-imposing nations. 18 Significantly, the tariffs targeted high value, recognisable French products such as cosmetics and handbags. 60.The US has also prepared tariff packages against other countries which have introduced a DST. These include the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Austria, Türkiye and India. The value of these packages ranged from US$16.25 million to US$221.75 million based on DST revenues to be incurred by US firms of US$45 million to US$325 million. 61. 62.C onsistent with the experience of other countries outlined above, it is expected that the val ue of any retaliatory tariffs would counteract some or even all of the potential revenue from the DST. A s a result, despite the increased government revenue from the DST, overall national welfare may not increase as much as expected. 63.Other negative impacts on our trading environment, such as on New Zealand’s i nternational reputation or the trade inefficiencies arising from these tariffs, are unknown and unquantifiable. 64.Domestic impact: Submissions received in respect of the 2019 discussion document suggest businesses and the taxpayers subject to a DST would oppose this option. 16 Notice of Action in the Section 301 Investigation of France’s Digital Services Tax, Office of the United States Trade Representative, 16 July 2020, https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/France\_Digital\_Services\_Tax\_Notice\_July\_ 2020.pdf 17 France’s new digital tax will net 500 million euros, DW, 3 March 2019, https://www.dw.com/en/france-to-set- new-500-million-digital-tax-for-30-tech-giants/a-47759058 18 Section 301 investigations – Digital services taxes, Office of the United States Trade Representative, 26 November 2021, https://ustr.gov/issue-areas /enforcement/section-301-investigations/section-301-digital- services-taxes s 6(a), s 6(b)(ii) s 6(a) s 6(a) s 6(a) Regulatory Impact Statement | 24 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] There is likely to be greater support from NGOs and individuals. Further feedback on both technical aspects of the DST and broader considerations is expected at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage through the select committee process. Some submitters may be of the view that further consultation should have taken place prior to introduction to Parliament. 65.We do not expect a DST to result in any existing digital platforms deciding to exi t the N ew Zealand market. This is based on the relatively small size of the proposed DS T ( 3% tax on revenue), and the way digital platforms have responded to the imposition of DSTs in other countries . 66.We also do not expect that the imposition of a DST in New Zealand alone would have a m aterial impact on global investment in innovation by these digital platforms . H owever, it is worth noting that in an international environment where multipl e unilateral DSTs have been proposed or implemented, it is possible that digital platforms could respond by reducing the quantity and quality of research and i nnovation they undertake. This could potentially reduce the welfare for individuals and the scope for innovation and growth by other businesses that utilise digital platforms . 67.The m ore likely responses by digital platforms are to either increase the prices they charge for their services, or simply absorb the cost of a DST. Which of these is preferred will depend on the specific market power and elasticities of dem and and s upply that each in-scope platform faces . 68.If in-scope firms’ profit maximising response is to simply absorb the additional cost and not ex it the New Zealand market or make any changes to their investment i n i nnovation, then we would consider a DST to be a highly efficient tax. It woul d be levied entirely on foreign multinationals, with none of the incidence falling on New Zealand individuals or businesses . 69.In c ontrast, if the profit maximising response by in-scope firms is to increase prices , the ec onomic incidence of a DST would be borne at least in part by purchasers of tax able services (e.g., companies paying digital economy firms for advertising etc.) and possibly consumers downstream from those transactions. This could als o potentially result in a negative flow on impact to productivity and innovation for domestic firms . 70.Ther e are several factors that determine the incidence of a tax. The primary factors are the level of market competition and the elasticity of demand and supply for a gi ven good or service. These factors are unlikely to be consistent across all in-scope digital platforms. Very detailed information about demand elasticities is likely necessary to predict how tax costs would be borne by each platform, and/or passed thr ough to others. This is information that officials do not possess. 71.O fficials have instead identified four characteristics that, if met, would tend to sugges t that an i n-scope digital platform will bear the burden of the DS T: a.they can generate a higher return than is necessary for them to sell to c onsumers at that location (location specific rents) ; b.the cost of selling to one more user is close to zero (no or negligible marginal costs); c.the c ost of setting up in a location are low (location specific fixed costs); and d.ther e are network effects or barriers that prevent effective competiti on ( contestability). 72.As the theoretical incidence of a DST is highly uncertain, we have looked at the real- world experience of how platforms and investors have reacted to the implementati on or announcement of DSTs in other countries . Regulatory Impact Statement | 25 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 73.While none of the real-world evidence is conclusive, it does suggest that if a DST was to be implemented, it is likely that at least some of the burden will be borne economically by some of the in-scope digital platforms. 74.Overall the direct macroeconomic impacts of a DST are expected to be small, especially relative to the effect of any trade retaliation. While officials are uncertain as to the incidence of a DST, we are relatively certain that, even in the situation where most of the cost is borne by domestic businesses and individuals, the size of this impact will not be large. This is primarily because the expected tax revenue associated with the DST is small, which means that any increases in price resulting from the tax are also likely to be small. In the unlikely worst case scenario, if all affected multinationals passed on all the cost of the DST, then the prices charged by those multinationals would rise by 3%. Option D – Progress a DST as an interim alternative to an acceptable multilateral solution (introduce a DST Bill with commencement able to be deferred by Order in Council) 75.Option D would be for the Government to introduce a DST Bill as an interim measure. While largely similar to Option C, under this option, the Government retains flexibility to defer the commencement date in response to progress at the OECD on Pillar One and international developments in response to Pillar One. In this sense, the Government would not commit to adopting a DST unconditionally. 76.Under this option, the DST would have a commencement date of the later of 1 January 2025 or a date specified by an Order in Council made before 1 January 2025; with a backstop commencement date of 1 January 2030. The Order in Council mechanism, if used, would be on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. 77.When considering whether to defer the commencement of the DST, t he Government could consider international developments and progress at the OECD. 78.Otherwise the key features of the DST would be as described in Option C. As with Option C, the DST would be repealed if an acceptable multilateral solution was implemented. 79.Tax Policy: By implementing a DST, the tax policy problem would be addressed as described in Option C. 80.Compliance costs: The compliance costs are as described in Option C. 81.Administration costs: The administration costs are as described in Option C. 82.International relations : The decisions on when to introduce a DST Bill, and when to impose the tax, are highly nuanced. International partners would have some assurance that the DST would not be imposed before 1 January 2025. 83. 84. s 6(a), s 6(b)(ii) s 6(a), s 9(2)(g)(i) s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 26 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 85. under this option, it is possible to defer imposition of the tax and to either change course more easily. As such the Government can choose to adopt the DST only if the OECD process proves ineffective and a group of other countries also announced their decision to adopt DSTs. This flexibility means that Option D is preferable from an international relations perspective to Option C. 86.Flexibilit y: This option is more flexible than Option C as it gives the Government the certainty of having a measure in place while maximising its ability to quickly react to changing circumstances, including progress at the OECD, the actions of similarly situated countries, and the overall international context. The latter includes the space to move with likeminded company, . It enables the Government to form a view as to the best overall outcome for New Zealand and, unlike Option C, leaves room for the Government to change course in the future. Importantly, not announcing a definitive date for implementation of the DST would allow New Zealand’s messaging to emphasise the conditionality of the DST, which could, in fact, encourage progress towards conclusion and implementation of the OECD solution. 87.Timeliness: Li ke Option C, this option could mean there is a measure in place sooner than otherwise. Under this option a DST could still be imposed from 1 January 2025 (like Option C) if the Government decided not to defer commencement. So Option D is not inherently less timely than Option C. However, the ability to defer the commencement date means the Government would be better placed than under Option C to take account of future developments in deciding when and if DST should be imposed. Like Option C, once in place, this option would need to be repealed if an acceptable multilateral option was implemented. 88.Trading environment: We do not exp ec t any tariffs to be imposed on introduction of the DST Bill. 89.Domestic impact: The dom estic impact would largely be as described in Option C. However, due to the additional flexibility and timeliness and the opportunities to mitigate harms to our international relations and trading environment, it may be seen more positively than Option C. On the other hand, a significant deferment without meaningful progress at the OECD would likely cause a similar frustration for individuals and non-Governmental organisations as Options A and B. s 6(a) s 6(a), s 9(2)(g)(i) s 6(a), s 9(2)(d), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 27 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] How do the options compare to the status quo/counterfactual?

Option A (status quo) would leave the problem of under taxation of highly digitalised multinational enterprises unaddressed. Over time, this option is likely to come under pressure due to the identified negative effects on the tax system, or actions taken by other jurisdictions to address the issue. We do not consider that Option A is sustainable. 91. O ption B (implement OECD Pillar One Amount A) reflects current Government policy and is the preferred option. It would deliver the highest net benefits while meeting the policy objectives, and at the same time ensuring our international reputation remains intact. However, this option scores negatively on timeliness 92. W hile Option C (commit to a DST) is not the preferred solution to address the underlying issues with the international tax system and their impact on New Zealand’s collective wellbeing (this would be a robust Pillar One Amount A outcome), it would address the identified policy problem in a timely manner and would shape the public perception of fairness around the taxation of highly digitalised multinational enterprises in a way that would likely improve social cohesion. However, Option C would entail significant international relations and trade risks that could reduce the net benefit of a DST for New Zealand. It has not been possible to undertake a full analysis of the costs and benefits for New Zealand. 93. Option D (progress a DST with the ability to defer its imposition) has similar benefits as Option C. However, it enables the Government to have greater flexibility in deciding when to impose the tax. The deferral mechanism will allow Ministers to make a judgement in light of important future developments. If commencement of the DST were deferred until the OECD process had proven ineffective and other countries were also enacting them, then the trade and international reputation risks would be reduced compared with Option C. It would also avoid any perception that New Zealand is undermining the OECD process and could allow us to align our DST with other countries that choose to progress with a DST. Overall, the greater flexibility and greater ability to mitigate international risks means that officials prefer Option D over Option C. 94. In s hort, the multilateral solution is our preferred option. 95. Our r ecommendation is to defer imposing or committing to imposing a DST until the benefits of Pillar One and its likelihood of success can be better assessed. At this stage t here is still a realistic chance that Pillar One could be successfully agreed and implemented and many countries are still publicly optimistic about its prospects. 96. Further, although a group of countries seeking an alternative to Amount A has not emerged yet, officials consider it likely that other countries will begin to adopt a DST if it becomes clear that Amount A is unable to address the problem for the reasons given above. 19 19 France Says EU Must Prepare Digital Tax as Global Deal Blocked, Bloomberg, 20 February 2023. s 6(b)(ii) s 6(b)(ii) s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) Regulatory Impact Statement | 29 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 97.For this reason, officials strongly advise against Option C. We consider Option D to be a reasonable approach, given it does not commit the Government to adopting a DST at this time, but enables adoption if the Government views this as necessary at a later date. 98.On balance, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials prefer waiting until the beginning of 2024 to decide whether to adopt Option D and introduce a DST Bill. This is because: •introducing the DST Bill in early 2024 would not delay the imposition of the DST. There would still be enough time for the Bill to be enacted before 1 January 2025, which is the earliest proposed effective date for the DST; •an introduction in early 2024 would allow more time to communicate in good faith with key stakeholders; •we will have a better idea of Pillar One’s prospects of success in early 2024, while maintaining New Zealand’s support for multilateralism, in particular whether a critical mass of countries has signed the Amount A multilateral convention and whether Pillar One as a whole would benefit New Zealand; and •it is likely that other countries will begin to adopt a unilateral DST if it becomes clear that Pillar One will be unsuccessful. This may c reate the space for New Zealand to move in likeminded company 99.Our preference would be to set the commencement date by Order in Council (rather than having a fixed date with the ability to defer it by an Order in Council). Further, best practice indicates that a bill should not provide for an unlimited ability to defer the application date, meaning that a backstop commencement date is required. Option D therefore represents a compromise between certainty and flexibility. 100. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials also see merit in introducing a DST Bill now, following the OECD’s inability to land Pillar One by its July 2023 deadline and in light of our concerns with Amount B of the OECD solution. The introduction of a DST Bill may also add pressure to conclude and implement Pillar One to ensure it is an effective solution. 101. MFAT offi cials strongly recommend staying with Option B, and waiting until 2024 to decide whether to adopt Option D. s 6(b)(ii), s 9(2)(g)(i) s 6(a) s 6(a) s 6(a) s 9(2)(h) s 6(a) Regulatory Impact Statement | 30 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] What are the marginal costs and benefits of the option?

Additional outreach and compliance activity may also be required, incurring further costs. • C onsumers are likely to experience some additional costs through the pass-on of some of the tax by the affected taxpayers, however the extent of this is uncertain as Affected groups Comment Impact Evidence Certainty Total monetised costs One-off & ongoing $2.4m Medium Non-monetised costs One-off & ongoing High Medium Additional benefits of the selected option compared to taking no action Regulated groups Ongoing.

There are limited benefits to directly affected groups. • Progress towards a DST will offer greater certainty over the Government’s approach to this policy problem and engagement in the select committee process at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage will enable directly affected stakeholders to participate in the development of the final design of the DST. However, the ability to defer commencement does mean some amount of uncertainty will remain. • Similar benefits accrue to wider government and private sector stakeholders. • Society will receive some benefit from the strengthening of perceptions of fairness and justice in the tax system. • If a DST is imposed, then Government revenue will benefit from addressing the tax policy problem because the affected businesses will be paying a tax more closely related to the income realised from the New Zealand market. Assuming a 1 January 2025 application date, this has been estimated to be $222 million over the forecast period (2025/26 to 2026/27). • Restoring perceptions of fairness and justice in the tax system will also benefit Inland Revenue and the Government, as this will support Inland Revenue’s voluntary compliance model. Regulatory Impact Statement | 33 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 1. The new arrangement would be implemented through legislation. This would be a stand-alone bill, creating a new Digital Services Tax Act. The DST legislation enacted in other jurisdictions has provided examples of suitable legislation. 2. To be compliant with our OECD commitments, a DST cannot be imposed before 1 January 2025. As a matter of policy, the implementation of tax rules on a prospective basis is preferred. This provides taxpayers with maximum certainty about the applicable law. Practically speaking, a prospective approach allows both Inland Revenue and affected taxpayers time to prepare for the new tax. The earliest practical date would be for the DST to apply from 1 January 2025. The date deviates from the New Zealand tax year but has been chosen as simpler for the affected taxpayer to comply with and allows time for them to prepare for the implementation of the tax. 3. If a DST were imposed, Inland Revenue would be responsible for producing guidance to support taxpayer compliance and for the administration of it as part of its normal operational activity. 4. There are a number of risks to the successful implementation of a DST, if one were to be imposed. a. These include the possibility that the system impacts on Inland Revenue or the affected taxpayers are larger than expected, or take additional time or resource to implement. This risk can be reduced through undertaking further consultation to develop the detailed design and providing sufficient lead-in time before application of the DST to enable the relevant systems to be built. b. Some set up costs could be incurred but the DST never gets imposed (it gets repealed, possibly after deferral(s)) or is only in force for a short period. Should Pillar One Amount A become the selected option, compliance and administration costs will also be incurred. This will have the effect of duplicating the costs of preparing for a solution to the policy problem. c. Some taxpayers may not comply with the DST without enforcement action. However, we consider this to be unlikely. We note the UK Audit Office reported that HMRC had not identified any non-compliance or avoidance after the first year of their DST. 21 Other taxpayers may leave the New Zealand market (although this is unlikely) or offer less services here than they would otherwise, based on their overall assessment of the costs and benefits of participation. While this has not been observed overseas, most other countries with DSTs have significantly larger markets than New Zealand. This risk can be reduced by designing a DST that is simple to comply with and minimises the additional compliance costs it imposes on the affected multinationals. How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? 5. Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of any DST on an ongoing basis, through the normal use of data analytics and compliance activity. The information gathered by a DST return would assist in monitoring compliance with the new tax. 21 Investigation into the Digital Services Tax, National Audit Office, 23 November 2022: https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/investigation-into-the-digital-services-tax/ Regulatory Impact Statement | 34 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6. The DST return would be a new return. This return would include the information necessary to assess the tax. The filing of returns and payment of the tax could also be monitored. 7. As there is potential for the impacts of the tax to be felt outside the tax system, other agencies would likely raise concerns with Inland Revenue’s policy team. This information, which will be gathered via normal inter-agency correspondence, would feed into the evaluation of the DST. 8. If and when an acceptable multilateral agreement to modernise the international tax framework is reached and implemented, the DST would be repealed as it will no longer be necessary.
Regulatory Impact Statement: A reporting framework informed by tax principles Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: The repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue Date finalised: 7 December 2023 Problem Definition The Government wishes to remove unnecessary legislation, reduce compliance costs for business, and ensure government departments are operating efficiently and focused on their core roles. Executive Summary The Government has indicated some problems with the potential effect and operation of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 and considers non-regulatory and existing reporting may be more appropriate. The Government is, therefore, considering the repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023. During the Select Committee consideration of the Bill that became the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023, a number of submitters put forward arguments that the legislation was unnecessary and could lead to increases in compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Some of the language in the description of the principles did not have broad support. As a consequence, any benefits from informing the public and improving the public debate could be limited to the extent that the debate is not based on a common understanding of the principles. Other submitters supported the Bill, especially the improvement in public information and the requirement to report regularly and over time, but raised concerns with some aspects of the reporting framework and the impact information collection powers would have on businesses. Possible options The options reflect those considered in the original Regulatory Impact Statement. Two options have been identified in addition to the status quo: 1. Option 1: Repeal the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 2. Option 2: Retain and amend the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023 to reduce compliance and administrative costs. This assessment focuses mainly on the possible repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023. Inland Revenue’s preferred option Inland Revenue previously, on balance, supported the enactment of a statutory reporting framework informed by tax principles on the basis that it would increase the amount of information available on the tax system and improve the public’s understanding of tax policy. This would require an enduring reporting framework that would build information and knowledge over time. Inland Revenue’s view was premised on the emergence of broad support for the establishment of a statutory reporting framework informed by accepted tax principles. This would ensure the information which Inland Revenue produced under the Act would be viewed as independent and grow over time. However, following the Select Committee and Bill process it became apparent that the final reporting framework did not have broad support. It is, therefore, unlikely that the framework will prove enduring, or that the information which it will produce will lead to debates based on a common understanding of the principles of the tax system. The Act, therefore, is unlikely to be effective in achieving its purposes. In Inland Revenue’s view, this indicates the anticipated benefits of the Act are unlikely to be fully realised. Amending the current Act is an option and would address some of the issues raised but would not fully address the compliance and administrative cost concerns of the Government and may still not achieve broad consensus. To reduce the additional administration costs arising from the Act, the repeal would need to occur before the first report is due to be presented, which is 31 December 2023. Inland Revenue intends to consider means of improving its current reporting under the Tax Administration Act 1994, subject to internal resourcing and government priorities. Inland Revenue will continue to meet its stewardship requirements under the Public Service Act 2020. Views from consultation with stakeholders and the general public Views of the general public Due to time constraints, no consultation with stakeholders was undertaken on the repeal of the Taxation Principles Reporting Act 2023. Submissions on the initial Bill included the view that the Bill was unnecessary and should not proceed. Other submissions favoured the enactment of the reporting framework but raised concerns with the Bill’s content. The submissions are available on the Parliament website and a summary of submissions is included on the Inland Revenue tax policy website. Responsible Manager(s) (completed by relevant manager) Murray Shadbolt Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue s 9(2)(a) 7 December 2023 Quality Assurance (completed by QA panel) Reviewing Agency: Panel Assessment & Comment: Inland Revenue The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the coversheet prepared by Inland Revenue. The reviewer considers the information and analysis partially meets the quality assurance criteria. However, the lack of time and public consultation on the repeal has limited the opportunities for consultation and limited the depth of the analysis.
1 Operational Guidelines: Section 6A Settlements August 2023 1. Introduction 1.1 Interpretation Statement IS 10/07 (IS 10/07) confirms that Inland Revenue can settle disputes pursuant to section 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). 1 Accordingly, it is important to set out the principles and processes by which Inland Revenue might settle a dispute (or a potential dispute). 1.2 These Guidelines apply to settlements that occur at any stage of the disputes process prior to the filing of a challenge and to the settlement of cases prior to the commencement of the disputes process. The principles in these Guidelines will also generally be relevant to cases in litigation. 1.3 Unless expressly stated otherwise, all legislative references in these Guidelines are to the TAA. 1.4 These Guidelines are structured as follows: 1. Introduction 2. Summary of the key features of section 6A settlements 3. When will a section 6A settlement decision be required? 4. Who can exercise the section 6A delegation? 5. At what stages can a case be settled? 6. What taxes can be the subject of a settlement? 7. The general process for the consideration of a settlement 8. Making a settlement decision 9. The factors to be considered 10. Appendix: Extract on Settlements from Interpretation Statement IS 10/07, October 2010 1.5 Each of these topics is considered separately below. 1 At paragraph 156. Refer Appendix. 2 2. Summary of the key features of section 6A settlements 2.1 Both the courts and IS 10/07 are clear that the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities allow for and support the settlement of appropriate disputes. These Guidelines provide guidance in balancing the competing principles that must be taken into account when considering settlement. This requires a consideration of whether the particular settlement complies with the dual duties of collecting the highest net revenue practicable over time (section 6A) and protecting the integrity of the tax system (section 6). 2.2 The starting point is that, where the facts are clear and the law is settled, the Commissioner must generally apply the law correctly. Frequently the facts and law will not be entirely clear, which is one of the principal reasons for preparing these Guidelines. Furthermore, even when the position is clear, there may still be a basis for accepting an outcome which does not fully reflect the strict legal position. 2.3 Settlement decisions are to be made by considering the six factors that are discussed below and determining how important each factor is to the particular dispute. All features of a settlement situation should fall within one or more of these factors. 2.4 When considering whether or not a dispute should be settled, the final step is always to stand back and confirm that the decision to settle (or not) is consistent with the dual duties of collecting the highest net revenue practicable over time and protecting the integrity of the tax system. 2.5 Above all, this requires the decision to settle (or not) to be measured against the impact settlement may have on voluntary compliance. A too rigid approach can potentially undermine compliance, though compliance may also be undermined if Inland Revenue too quickly accepts a taxpayer’s proposal. 3. When will a section 6A decision be required? What is a settlement? 3.1 It is important to first determine whether a settlement (as opposed to something else) is being considered. This is because different scenarios can arise that do not involve a settlement when Inland Revenue is in dispute (or will potentially be in dispute) with a taxpayer. 3.2 For the purposes of these Guidelines, a “settlement” or “compromise” involves the use of the Commissioner’s general discretion under section 6A to accept less tax than should, strictly speaking, be collected from the relevant taxpayer. This decision occurs before any re-assessment and is made despite the Commissioner having a clear view of how the law applies to the relevant facts. 3.3 A settlement can only be accepted or rejected where the criteria set out below have been considered and a decision has been made by a person holding a section 6A delegation. What is not a settlement? 3.4 Settlement decisions can be contrasted with other decisions or scenarios relating to disputes such as: 3.4.1 An exchange of information or arguments which results in either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer changing their view on how the law applies to the taxpayer’s situation. In such a case, the matter will be resolved on the basis of that changed understanding, resulting in either an agreed adjustment or the 3 dispute being abandoned by the Commissioner. This is a “resolution” of the dispute rather than a “settlement” or “compromise”. SPS 15/01 Finalising Agreements in Tax Investigations sets out the principles for finalising agreements in these circumstances. A resolution made in finalising agreements in tax investigations is based on a genuine agreement as to the relevant facts and will be the result of the application of the law to those facts. Conversely, in a settlement the parties may not reach agreement but may still decide to settle by way of a compromise on the quantum of core tax in dispute or the quantum of shortfall penalties. 3.4.2 In the process of quantifying a disputed amount of, say, suppressed income, which is inherently uncertain, a properly authorised Customer Compliance Services (CCS) officer may agree to assess an imprecise but approximately correct amount (e.g. for the purpose of a default assessment). These Guidelines are not relevant to that scenario. Similarly, these Guidelines do not apply in relation to tax avoidance cases where the Commissioner has simply determined an amount to be assessed to the taxpayer, including by reconstruction, through the application of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). 3.4.3 In some cases, a general decision might be made about a class of case, and this may be a care and management decision but not a settlement in relation to a specific case. An example is found in the agreed approach set out in Revenue Alert 21/01, which explains how the Commissioner will apply sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the ITA in relation to the diversion of personal services income. 3.4.4 Decisions about exactly which periods are to be investigated (e.g. four years rather than three), while an exercise of the care and management power, can usually be made in the normal administration of an investigation without compromising an established liability. As a result, these Guidelines will not need to be considered in these circumstances. Conversely, if the years in question have already been quantified, and a proposal involves Inland Revenue abandoning the proposed adjustments for, say, one year out of four, these Guidelines will need to be applied. 3.4.5 Certain discretions might be triggered on the basis of information provided or submissions made by the taxpayer, with particular respect to either the write- off of debt (sections 176 and 177), the remission of certain penalties or interest (section 183D) or similar remission provisions. This is not an exercise of the Commissioner’s care and management powers under section 6A. Rather, it is a legitimate exercise of other discretions, albeit arising in the context of resolving a taxpayer’s liability to tax. An example is the situation in which the taxpayer, although disputing the proposed adjustment, is prepared to acknowledge that they have probably got it wrong, but they are unable to pay the tax for financial or other reasons. If a legitimate case for write-off of the debt can be made, there is no reason why the CCS team cannot reach a two- part agreement (first as to the basis of the assessment and second as to recovery/write off). 3.4.6 An officer given the appropriate authority to do so may decide to not commence an investigation after a risk review (for example). This may be the case even if an eventual discrepancy seems reasonably likely. This decision could be made for a number of reasons. For example, there could be time bar considerations, the tax at stake might be a small amount or the collectability of the tax may be limited. This is a resource allocation decision rather than an actual compromise in relation to the particular investigation or dispute. As a result, this type of decision is outside the scope of these Guidelines. 4 4. Who can exercise the section 6A delegation? General care and management delegation holders 4.1 Both accepting and rejecting any settlement offer is an exercise of the care and management responsibility. As a result, it must be considered by an appropriate delegation holder (even in circumstances where a settlement offer is obviously frivolous). Roles that hold the section 6A settlement delegation are set out in the Reserved Decision-Making Matrix. 4.2 As decisions under these Guidelines will be primarily made within CCS, those exercising the general care and management discretion within CCS will be the Deputy Commissioner CCS (Individuals or Business) and Customer Segment Leaders. 4.3 The Legal Services Leader is also able to consider settlements and any settlement decisions post the filing of a challenge should only be made by the Legal Services Leader. Any settlements in the post-adjudication period but prior to challenge must also be discussed with the Legal Services Leader before a decision is made. 4.4 CCS Deputy Commissioners, Customer Segment Leaders and the Legal Services Leader are referred to as general care and management delegation holders in these Guidelines. Group Leads as decision-makers 4.5 Group Leads (reporting to Customer Segment Leaders) with the appropriate capability also have the ability to consider a settlement. However, their discretion is limited as described below. 4.6 Group Leads are empowered to settle a dispute, with careful reference to the criteria set out in these Guidelines, where the settlement offer does not include the cancellation of losses or an undertaking to not use available losses and: - The core tax in dispute is less than $250,000; or - The settlement offer involves the Commissioner conceding less than $100,000 of the amount in dispute (including use of money interest (UOMI) and shortfall penalties). 4.7 Group Leads can also reject any settlement offer where the amount offered represents less than 50% of the core tax potentially in dispute (whether or not the core tax is less than $250,000 or the settlement involves a concession of more than $100,000). 4.8 It should be noted that a settlement offer of less than 50% of the tax in dispute still requires a detailed consideration of the settlement factors discussed in these guidelines. If a Group Lead considers that an offer of less than 50% should be accepted for any reason, this should be discussed with and considered by one of the general care and management delegation holders referred to above. Settlement decision limitations Training and Critical Task Assurance (CTA) 4.9 Those exercising the delegation should also have completed training and should have a good understanding of the principles set out in these Guidelines. 4.10 Any recommendation to the delegation holders to use care and management to settle an actual or potential dispute is also subject to CTA review (subject to any 5 amendments made to the CTA process from time to time). This review will generally be undertaken by a Level 3 Solicitor with appropriate training. Pre-dispute settlements 4.11 Where the Commissioner is considering a settlement prior to the commencement of the statutory disputes process, the settlement decision must always be made by a general care and management delegation holder (i.e. not a Group Lead). Further discussion of when a settlement in these circumstances may be appropriate is set out below at paragraphs 5.1 to 5.4. Precedential settlements and settlements where other cases/periods are in dispute 4.12 Group Leads should only exercise their delegation if they are confident that the dispute is not similar to other ongoing investigations or disputes. Where a settlement is intended to apply to multiple investigations, or could potentially impact on another investigation or dispute, or could reasonably be seen as inadvertently providing a precedent for settling a similar investigation or dispute, the decision to settle the dispute should be made by a person holding the general care and management delegation. Settlement where a similar case or associate is in litigation 4.13 Delegated decision makers should not agree to settle a dispute (or reject a settlement offer) if litigation has commenced in respect of another taxpayer or period on the same issue unless approval has been obtained from the Legal Services Leader. 4.14 Legal Services approval should also be sought if litigation has commenced in respect of an entity associated to the taxpayer. CCS staff should generally be liaising with Legal Services in any event to ensure that any settlement does not impact on any live litigation proceedings. Use of tax losses 4.15 Taxpayers sometimes offer to settle a dispute by paying tax through the reduction of tax losses which would otherwise not be available to be used. For example, a taxpayer might offer to use losses incurred in subsequent years to meet an earlier year’s tax liability in circumstances where this is not provided for by the ITA. 4.16 Inland Revenue’s policy is to not generally accept this. However, the use of losses in this way can be accepted if the following circumstances exist and the utilisation of losses is approved by a general care and management delegation holder (i.e. not a Group Lead): 4.16.1 The tax losses are used to pay income tax only and not other tax types. For the avoidance of doubt, income tax does not include taxes which have been treated as income tax by s YA 2; and 4.16.2 The taxpayer has paid the core income tax to the fullest extent possible. In other words, where there is the ability to pay the core tax, the use of tax losses is not appropriate. The taxpayer’s ability to pay will need to be discussed with appropriately trained CCS officers; and 4.16.3 The tax losses to be used as payment would very likely have been used within the next two tax years. In other words, the elimination of the losses means there will now be taxable income in the following two years on which tax will be payable; and 6 4.16.4 The taxpayer’s compliance history is good and there are no future voluntary compliance concerns. This means that in cases of avoidance and evasion, the use of tax losses will not generally be appropriate. Similarly, if there are concerns that the losses themselves may not be legally supportable, e.g. because they may have been generated from an avoidance arrangement, they may not be used for these purposes. 4.17 In this way, the use of tax losses in settlement will mean that the disputed tax will effectively be paid within the next two years. This provides the taxpayer with a limited timing benefit, but one that may be acceptable in the circumstances. 4.18 It should be noted that losses can be used to offset income in the usual way allowed by the ITA and the restrictions on the use of tax losses discussed above does not apply to those situations. This includes any specific provisions that may allow for the carrying back of losses to prior income years. 4.19 Tax losses may also be used to pay shortfall penalties – see sections IA 3(1) and IW 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The use of tax losses in this way is therefore not subject to any care and management approval. 4.20 If the reduction in available tax losses is part of the settlement, then the settlement deed will need to record the assessment of the loss balance carried forward. The Commissioner will stipulate in the deed that this loss balance carried forward figure will be included in the taxpayer’s next income tax return to be filed. The use of any losses should not in any case be recorded as constituting a payment for imputation credit or other tax credit purposes. Settlement periods 4.21 A settlement will usually apply across the periods in dispute. However, it can sometimes be a viable settlement option to limit the periods in dispute by conceding one or more periods. This could occur, for example, if the settlement criteria indicate that this is appropriate as the evidence relating to a particular period is less clear (increasing the litigation risk). 4.22 In unusual cases, the settlement agreement can relate to future (i.e. not-yet disputed) periods, but only in respect of an arrangement which is continuing for a definite period (which shouldn’t generally be more than two years), and not in the case of tax avoidance arrangements. However, as the key goal is to achieve full compliance, agreeing to future tax returns being made on a known incorrect basis should be rare. Payment and collection issues 4.23 Generally, settlements should be on the basis of payment in full. However, in some cases it may be desirable to manage payment and collection issues as part of the settlement of the tax dispute. 4.24 CSS staff involved in the case should seek expert advice from specialists in debt collection to determine whether it is appropriate to apply debt provisions such as those relating to instalment arrangements. Section 6A settlements should not be a substitute for the correct application of write-off provisions, such as sections 176 and 177C: see examples 9 and 10 in IS 10/07. Personal guarantees or security 4.25 To support collection of the settlement amount, a personal guarantee or security may be appropriate as a term of settlement in certain circumstances. In such a case, the settlement should not be finalised until the personal guarantee or security has been 7 approved for Critical Tax Assurance purposes. Please refer to the taking of securities item in the CTA matrix for further explanation. Legal Services must assist if a personal guarantee or security forms part of a settlement. 5. At what stages can a case be settled? Settlement of cases in dispute or pre-dispute 5.1 Settlement can occur at any point in an investigation or during the disputes process (including during the conference phase, see below). This includes the period prior to the issue of a NOPA. However, the Commissioner will only be in a position to settle prior to the issue of a NOPA if the Commissioner: - has determined what amount is properly assessable; - has a thorough understanding of the taxpayer’s position; and - understands how all of the settlement principles discussed below apply in the context of the case in question. 5.2 In limited circumstances a pre-dispute settlement might be appropriate even if the Commissioner has not determined exactly what amount is properly assessable. It may be sufficient for the Commissioner to have a reasonable understanding of the amounts payable so that he can weigh that up against the resources needed to continue the audit and enter a dispute. 5.3 The other settlement factors will obviously still be relevant and must point to a settlement being appropriate in the circumstances. It would not be appropriate to settle with a taxpayer where the Commissioner has little or no idea of the amount of tax at stake, especially where gross carelessness, avoidance or evasion are suspected. 5.4 Where the Commissioner is considering a settlement prior to the commencement of the statutory disputes process, the settlement decision must always be made by a general care and management delegation holder (i.e. not a Group Lead). Settlement of cases subject to challenge and post-adjudication settlements 5.5 These Guidelines do not strictly apply to settlements that occur after the taxpayer has been re-assessed and has challenged the assessment, although the settlement factors discussed below will generally be relevant to any settlement decision. In those circumstances, the decision to settle rests with the Legal Services Leader. 5.6 As previously mentioned, Legal Services should also always be consulted for any post-adjudication but pre-challenge settlement offer. Legal Services may also form an integral part of settlement decisions made under these Guidelines, as may the Crown Law Office, particularly in relation to assessing dispute or litigation risk. 2 5.7 In addition, and as already noted above, no settlement decision is to be taken except with Legal Services approval if litigation has commenced in respect of another taxpayer or period on the same or a very similar issue. Likewise, Legal Services approval must also be sort if litigation is ongoing in relation to a partnership, group company or other entity the taxpayer is associated with. 2 Consistent with the Protocol agreed between Inland Revenue and Crown Law: see http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz/assets/uploads/irdprotocols.pdf 8 6. What taxes can be the subject of settlement? 6.1 Disputes about most tax types can be the subject of settlement (but not student loans). Different compromises may occur in relation to one aspect of the settlement amount but not others. 6.2 In addition to simply adjusting the taxable amount for a period, consideration can be given to agreeing to limit the periods affected, to use a lesser penalty type, or to applying a different valuation methodology, where there is flexibility within the law to do so. These approaches should be applied with care and with precedent in mind. 6.3 Set out below is a brief discussion of how settlement should operate in relation to core tax, shortfall penalties and UOMI. Core tax 6.4 Inland Revenue may compromise on the quantum of core tax in dispute if a compromise is justified in terms of these Guidelines. However, protecting the integrity of the tax system means that the general body of taxpayers should not perceive that disputing a tax issue with Inland Revenue will always lead to an assessment that is less than core tax. As such, the smaller the percentage of core tax the taxpayer is offering to pay, the increasingly compelling the other factors supporting settlement need to be. Shortfall penalties 6.5 It is often preferable to compromise on shortfall penalties rather than core tax and Inland Revenue can compromise on the quantum of shortfall penalties in a settlement. It is also possible to accept a lower level of penalty if that is appropriate (for example agreeing an unacceptable tax position penalty rather than an abusive tax position (ATP) penalty. 3 ) UOMI 6.6 The amount of UOMI should generally follow the amount of core tax payable (as reduced if applicable). The purpose of UOMI is to compensate the Crown for being out of pocket through the taxpayer not paying tax on time. This purpose would be generally undermined if Inland Revenue regularly accepted settlements that did not have any UOMI imposed on the settled amount or if it was overly discounted. 6.7 However, UOMI may be compromised below that flowing from the level of core tax payable pursuant to a settlement in some circumstances where it is considered appropriate. 6.8 Guidance on when this may be appropriate can be taken from Standard Practice Statement: Options for relief from tax debt (SPS 18/04). Section 183D provides that the Commissioner may remit UOMI (and penalties) and SPS 18/04 discusses when it may be appropriate to do so. While a compromise of UOMI is different from remission, the SPS provides useful guidance in relation to when a UOMI compromise may be appropriate in a settlement context. 6.9 Note that taxpayers are allowed to use tax pooling to reduce their UOMI exposure and so the effect of tax pooling should not be seen as a compromise of UOMI. 3 When the penalty is for ATP or evasion, and there are assessments which are not in dispute, so there are no challenge or dispute rights remaining, section 177C(3) prohibits the writing off of outstanding tax. Unless there are very strong integrity and/or voluntary compliance reasons, the Commissioner would be very unlikely to compromise on penalties pursuant to sections 6 and 6A when a taxpayer is liable to pay an ATP or evasion shortfall penalty and no dispute rights remain. 9 7. The general process for the consideration of a settlement 7.1 Ordinarily, the process for agreeing or rejecting a settlement will involve the following steps: Pre-Decision Considering a taxpayer’s offer 7.2 The settlement proposal will usually have been provided by a customer. The team considering the dispute (or potential dispute) will analyse whether they think accepting the offer would be consistent with Inland Revenue’s care and management responsibilities, taking into account the matters covered in these Guidelines. It would be rare for the Commissioner to initiate a settlement, although this is possible. Offers/counteroffers from the Commissioner 7.3 On the rare occasion that the Commissioner is considering making a settlement offer without first receiving a settlement proposal from the taxpayer, any such offer must first be considered in accordance with these Guidelines and a recommendation put forward for consideration and signed off by the appropriate delegated decision maker. 7.4 There will be circumstances where settlement seems appropriate, but not on the terms offered by the taxpayer. In those circumstances, it may be appropriate to provide a counter-offer recommendation that is consistent with sections 6 and 6A for the delegation holder’s consideration. Once that has been signed off, the counteroffer can be formally made to the taxpayer. Discussing settlement with taxpayers or their advisors 7.5 The Inland Revenue case team may have discussions with the taxpayer or their advisors regarding a potential settlement. Where potential settlement discussions occur between a taxpayer and the case team, it needs to be made clear that: - Those discussions are on a ‘without prejudice’ and confidential basis; - Any proposed settlement will need to be approved by the relevant section 6A delegation holder; and - Any agreed settlement will need to be formalised in writing, generally through the execution of a binding deed, ideally to be prepared by Inland Revenue (an exchange of letters is sometimes an acceptable alternative). Facilitated conferences 7.6 Where the subject of settlement arises during a facilitated conference: 7.6.1 Any settlement discussion at a facilitated conference should be clearly delineated from discussions about the legal and factual issues in dispute. The discussion should be directed by the facilitator who should ensure that, as far as possible, all of the factual differences between the parties have been resolved. The facilitator should only support the request for a settlement discussion if satisfied that the parties have positively engaged in trying to resolve the issue in other ways. 7.6.2 The facilitator should ensure the parties understand that the settlement discussion is on a “without prejudice” basis and that the dispute facilitation itself is adjourned. A “without prejudice” discussion is one that is subject to ‘settlement privilege’. This means that documents and communications 10 related to the attempt to settle do not have to be disclosed as part of any litigation. For a detailed explanation, please contact Legal Services. 7.6.3 The facilitator should also ensure that the Inland Revenue officers who are involved in the settlement discussion are aware of these Guidelines and the need to obtain sign-off at the appropriate delegated level (whether the recommendation is to settle or not to settle). 7.7 It must be made clear to the disputant that any settlement discussions will proceed in accordance with the criteria and processes set out in these Guidelines. In particular, taxpayers need to be aware that settlement on a “splitting the difference” or purely arbitrary basis to conclude the dispute is not acceptable. 7.8 Depending on the result of settlement discussions, the parties may need to reconvene the conference or bring the conference phase to an end. Preparation of a recommendation memo 7.9 Once those discussions have been completed, the team should draft a memorandum that provides a recommendation to the relevant decision-maker. That memorandum will need to take into account the settlement criteria set out in these Guidelines. 7.10 The memorandum should have been approved by a CCS Team Lead (or a Group Lead who is not making the settlement decision). The recommendation must also be Critical Task Assured to confirm that it is consistent with sections 6 and 6A and these Guidelines. The Decision-Making Framework 7.11 The decision-maker, having received the recommendation to settle (or reject the offer), will decide whether to accept or reject the proposed settlement in accordance with Part 8 below. That decision can of course be contrary to the recommendation provided by the relevant officers. 7.12 The delegation holder’s decision will be based on a balancing exercise using the factors described below. This ensures that, whatever decision is made, it is consistent with the Commissioner’s section 6 and 6A obligations. 7.13 It is obviously important that the decision-maker clearly documents the decision- making process. This will include what the decision is, what information he or she has had regard to in reaching the decision and the reasons for the decision. Post-decision Rejection of a settlement offer 7.14 If the delegation holder has decided to reject the offer, the taxpayer will need to be informed. Often the taxpayer asks for reasons why the offer was not acceptable. It is appropriate to briefly explain why the offer was rejected. In most cases, the explanation will be that the core tax payable and/or shortfall penalties and/or UOMI was too low given the Commissioner’s view of the application of the settlement factors. 7.15 In particular, the impact on voluntary compliance and tax system integrity from accepting the offer should be stressed. If settlement was rejected on the basis of the precedent it would create, so that only full core tax (and penalties if relevant) is acceptable, the case team should advise the taxpayer of this position. This eliminates the time and resources needed for making and considering further unacceptable offers. 11 Accepting a settlement – drafting of a settlement deed 7.16 If the delegation holder accepts a settlement proposal, its terms will need to be formalised in writing and this document will need to be signed by the delegation holder on behalf of the Commissioner. This will normally be by way of a deed, which should be prepared by Legal Services. Normal terms of any settlement would make clear reference to: 7.16.1 the intended assessments including penalties; 7.16.2 the taxpayer’s obligations in terms of future compliance; 7.16.3 the confidential and non-precedential nature of the settlement; 7.16.4 the provision of information; 7.16.5 the manner in which the settlement is to be affected (for example, if an instalment arrangement is to be entered into, this should be captured and the appropriate process followed in respect of such arrangements); 7.16.6 the date for events to occur (in many cases payment) and terms relating to default in payment; 7.16.7 any guarantees or security required; 7.16.8 the consequences of non-payment or default if payment is not required; and 7.16.9 the position relating to consequential adjustments (including to other tax types, periods, or related parties). 7.17 Please contact Legal Services to assist with the drafting of any deed and please note that a settlement deed is subject to CTA. 7.18 The usual process is for the taxpayer to sign the deed prior to the Commissioner’s representative. This may occur electronically. A witness to the deed, must be over eighteen and not be a party to the deed themselves. They must sign the deed and add the relevant details (I.e., where they reside and their occupation or description). Letter agreements 7.19 A less formal exchange of letters can also give effect to the agreed settlement, if the core tax being resolved is small (under $50,000), the issue is not precedential and approval is obtained from a general care and management delegation holder. 7.20 If the Commissioner issues a settlement offer letter which is not subject to conditions, and it is accepted, it is important to remember that it constitutes an obligation which the Commissioner will not resile from unless there is non-payment, misrepresentation, or significant non-disclosure. Please note that the settlement offer letter is also subject to CTA. The Settlement Register 7.21 The CCS Team must summarise the decision to settle by completing a settlement register form and sending this along with the settlement deed and memo to the Legal Services Leader, who maintains a register of section 6A settlement decisions for future reporting and integrity purposes. 8. Making a settlement decision 8.1 Before deciding on the proposed settlement’s merits, the decision maker will need to ensure that certain ‘threshold’ issues have been satisfied. These are: 8.1.1 Is all the relevant information held? A decision to settle can only be made if the decision maker is fully informed. The CCS team will need to have obtained sufficient information (from the taxpayer, third parties and, where necessary, independent experts), together with legal input from Legal Services (and 12 sometimes TCO or PaRS), to determine whether its position is robust. If the decision maker considers that there is potentially more relevant information that could impact on the decision, they should request that information; and 8.1.2 With that information, is the Commissioner’s position correct? A settlement is only appropriate where it is considered that Inland Revenue’s view of how the law applies to the taxpayer’s facts is correct. Although any dispute will involve risks, where it is considered that the taxpayer’s position clearly represents the better view of the law, the Commissioner should not be considering settlement. In those circumstances, the Commissioner should withdraw from the dispute. 8.2 Once the decision-maker is satisfied that there is sufficient information to determine that Inland Revenue is correct, they then need to decide whether or not the proposed settlement should be accepted. The starting point for that decision involves the following: 8.2.1 Inland Revenue is under an on-going obligation to apply the law. As such, a compromise for less than the properly imposed amount (including UOMI and penalties where relevant) can only be entertained when it is consistent with the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities. The starting point is that taxpayers are obliged to pay the correct amount of tax and a departure from that should only be mandated after a careful application of the criteria in these Guidelines. 8.2.2 In this regard, while it is important to consider the factors described below in combination when considering the particular settlement proposal, the overriding obligations are to ensure that any settlement collects the highest net revenue over time, protects the tax system’s integrity and promotes voluntary compliance by taxpayers. The decision to settle a dispute or not must be consistent with those objectives. 8.2.3 In most circumstances, consideration of the factors described in the next section will involve a balancing exercise. This is because some of those factors will favour settlement whereas others will suggest a settlement should not be entertained. For example, where a settlement involves significant resources and complexity, there may well be net savings if the dispute was settled and high dispute risk if it is not. This needs to be tempered by the possible negative impact a settlement may have on promoting voluntary compliance, both in relation to that taxpayer and taxpayers more generally if the settlement were to become widely known. 9. Discussion of the factors to be considered Introduction 9.1 These Guidelines provide a framework for making consistent decisions about settling or compromising actual or potential disputes, by making it mandatory to consider a number of factors, which will generally be relevant to any settlement decision. The factors that will generally be more relevant to settlement decisions are the first four factors. The last two factors discussed (tax in dispute and taxpayer’s ability to pay) are ordinarily unlikely in their own right to justify accepting or rejecting a settlement proposal. 9.2 Decision-makers should not assume that particular factors will always be the most relevant to the proposed settlement under consideration. They will often require application or balancing in different ways in different factual scenarios. For example, what involvement did the taxpayer have in a scheme (e.g. in designing or promoting 13 it), has the taxpayer co-operated to date and what stage is the dispute at (e.g. what level of resource has already been committed?). Finally, it is important not to take into account any irrelevant factors. 9.3 The portion of IS 10/07 dealing with settlement agreements, which forms the basis of these Guidelines, is attached. The non-exhaustive list of criteria, mentioned at paragraphs 151 to 161 in IS 10/07, should be used as a guide. 9.4 The following commentary expands on and explains those criteria in a more practical context. The criteria discussed below are consolidated into six factors, which should adequately address any circumstances which arise in a dispute context. There may be times when a direct reference to the criteria specified in IS 10/07 will also be appropriate, but this should not generally be necessary. Factor one: impact on voluntary compliance and the integrity of the tax system 9.5 Every proposed settlement must be considered against its impact on the inter-related goals of voluntary compliance for taxpayers generally and protecting tax system integrity. A settlement proposal that significantly erodes voluntary compliance would not be protecting the integrity of the tax system. Even if other factors support a settlement, the Commissioner should not settle at the proposed compromise if voluntary compliance by all taxpayers would be meaningfully impacted and tax system integrity is not protected. The relationship between voluntary compliance and tax system integrity 9.6 Section 6(1) requires the Commissioner and his delegated officers to protect the integrity of the tax system at all times. The meaning of “integrity of the tax system” is set out in section 6(2). The section refers to taxpayer perceptions of that integrity. It also refers to the Commissioner acting fairly and within the law and the corresponding rights of taxpayers in this regard. Under this section, taxpayers also have rights to be treated with no greater or lesser favour than other taxpayers. 9.7 Section 6A(2) provides that in collecting taxes, the Commissioner must consider the importance of promoting voluntary compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts. Promoting voluntary compliance includes encouraging proactive taxpayer behaviour to get things right. 9.8 A taxpayer’s primary tax obligations are set out in section 15B of the TAA. They include correctly determining the amount of tax to pay, paying that tax on time, filing returns and complying with other obligations imposed by the tax laws. Where the correct tax treatment is uncertain, compliance can be measured by taxpayers proactively requesting the Commissioner’s view as to the correct tax treatment. 9.9 The Commissioner’s view is that the requirement to protect the integrity of the tax system means protecting the system of voluntary compliance on which the tax system relies for proper functioning. The matters that need to be considered in terms of the integrity of the tax system are therefore inextricably linked with the effect of a settlement on voluntary compliance. A settlement that is too low undermines voluntary compliance and tax system integrity 9.10 The starting point is that a settlement that is too low does not encourage voluntary compliance or support tax system integrity. This is because a perception that the Commissioner will readily settle any dispute creates a perception that there is no or limited cost to risk-taking behaviour. 14 9.11 A question which arises from section 6(2) is whether taxpayers will see the Commissioner’s approach to settlement at a discounted amount as reasonable. If not, is the Commissioner being overly lenient or unduly harsh in his approach to settlement given the circumstances? In other words, does the proposed settlement give the general body of taxpayers’ confidence that the tax system is operating fairly and consistently. 9.12 The encouragement of voluntary compliance and maintenance of tax system integrity also requires any decision to settle to be taken carefully where the issue under consideration is relevant to a large number of taxpayers. In these circumstances the existence of a settlement, if publicised, could undermine the general perception of other taxpayers, and lead to a net loss of integrity and voluntary compliance. In contrast, a unique or “one off” dispute, if settled, is less likely to have this effect. 9.13 Where Inland Revenue is perceived to be “lenient” on a particular type of taxpayer or making concessions on a perceived difficult area (e.g. evasion, avoidance or areas of “black letter” complexity), then the public may have less regard for the tax system. The Commissioner should take a firmer line in cases where behaviour deliberately undermines the integrity of the tax system, such as where evasion is alleged. Voluntary compliance and tax system integrity as a factor in favour of settlement or a neutral factor 9.14 On the other hand, voluntary compliance and tax system integrity could be undermined if Inland Revenue invests a great deal of resource disputing an issue that is either not material or is otherwise unmeritorious. So, where there is little tax at stake, and no general clarifying proposition of law is likely to come from the dispute, rejecting an individual’s reasonable settlement offer may adversely impact taxpayers’ perceptions of the system’s integrity. 9.15 By contrast, the public may have more confidence in the tax administration if the reverse occurs – i.e., Inland Revenue stays the course in a dispute with difficult issues or aggressive taxpayers but settles cases that have a small amount of tax at stake and do not impact on taxpayers more generally, especially where the Commissioner has limited resources. 9.16 However, it should be kept in mind that, even in relation to difficult issues or aggressive taxpayers, other settlement factors might strongly indicate that settlement is appropriate. For example, where Inland Revenue’s limited resources could be deployed more effectively elsewhere and there is significant litigation risk, the appropriate settlement of a difficult issue would be unlikely to undermine tax system integrity and voluntary compliance. 9.17 In some cases, a settlement might be expected to have a neutral impact on voluntary compliance. This means that other factors will be the reasons for compromising on the tax, shortfall penalties or UOMI payable. While a compromise on the amounts payable may not increase voluntary compliance, it may also not reduce it and therefore undermine tax system integrity. In other words, if other factors support a settlement, then settlement would be appropriate unless it would reduce voluntary compliance generally. The relevance of the specific taxpayer’s past and future compliance 9.18 A decision maker is entitled to take into account the past compliance record of the taxpayer involved in the dispute. The taxpayer’s known appetite for tax risk may be relevant to assessing their future compliance, and if past compliance is particularly bad, then it is far less likely that a settlement would be contemplated. 15 9.19 The likely future compliance of the taxpayer will also be relevant. Sometimes we can legitimately say that we are confident that the taxpayer now understands the error which has occurred, has taken steps to fix it and will be compliant in the future (perhaps because there is very good past compliance behaviour). This can be important in terms of promoting voluntary compliance, since continuing to vigorously pursue the dispute might well undermine that future compliance. Consistency 9.20 Taxpayers in the same situation should generally be treated consistently. However, this does not mean that taxpayers must be treated identically just because the issue in dispute is the same. 9.21 In the context of a group of taxpayers who have adopted an incorrect tax position in the same circumstances, it is permissible to offer a better settlement to members of that group that are willing to settle earlier in the disputes process. However, it should also be noted that this will not always be the case. If for example, the Commissioner has settled with a taxpayer during the conference phase of the disputes process and a court decision subsequently clarifies the law, the same settlement may not be appropriate for another taxpayer seeking to settle at the conference phase. 9.22 As a general proposition there needs to be appropriate reasons why a comparable settlement would not be accepted in comparable circumstances. However, it is important that Inland Revenue has the flexibility to treat different situations appropriately. Therefore, if possible, settlements should be made on the basis that they are not indicative of what might be agreed in a future case, and the terms are to be kept strictly confidential. 9.23 In summary, the Commissioner should always be endeavouring to treat taxpayers in similar circumstances as consistently as possible while following the law, but it must be acknowledged that there will often be differences that justify different treatment. Furthermore, Inland Revenue should not adopt a consistent position with a previous settlement if that previous settlement can no longer be justified. Taxpayer disclosures and voluntary compliance 9.24 There are situations where settling might improve voluntary compliance so this factor could support a compromise on what is payable. Providing information proactively through voluntary disclosures and seeking the Commissioner’s views on what the law requires through rulings and indicative views are also part of what it means to be voluntarily compliant. These situations are discussed below. 9.25 Whether a taxpayer has disclosed a particular tax position taken may be a relevant consideration. A taxpayer can voluntarily disclose a potential tax shortfall, but the Commissioner may not agree that the disclosed shortfall is correct. If the disclosure is full and complete, this usually indicates that the taxpayer is attempting to be compliant, and this should be encouraged. However, a voluntary disclosure where an audit commencement has been indicated is less persuasive when considering whether a settlement should be accepted. 9.26 Where the disclosure is less than complete, this raises questions as to why information may have been withheld from the disclosure. Such a disclosure may not be supportive of a compromise on the amount the Commissioner considers payable. 9.27 Whether a taxpayer has sought a ruling may also be a factor that the Commissioner might take into account in terms of taxpayer compliance. A ruling application generally indicates a taxpayer wishing to be compliant by seeking the Commissioner’s view of the tax treatment of an arrangement. As such, this should be seen more 16 favourably than an issue identified in an audit, otherwise the Commissioner could be seen to be discouraging compliance through ruling applications. 9.28 Awareness of the Commissioner’s view of the tax treatment of an arrangement in these circumstances should not generally be seen negatively in a settlement context, especially where the issue is not straightforward. Ultimately, if a taxpayer has brought the issue to the Commissioner’s attention via a ruling application, this should be encouraged. A dispute flowing from an indicative view request should be seen similarly to that arising from a ruling application. Incorrect Inland Revenue guidance 9.29 A further scenario where voluntary compliance might be promoted with a more lenient settlement approach is in relation to penalties and/or UOMI where Inland Revenue was at fault either through the provision of incorrect guidance to a particular taxpayer or through the provision of incorrect information in a publication. This is consistent with the approach in SPS 18/04 Options for relief from tax debt, albeit that a compromise under a settlement is different from the remission of an assessed penalty or consequential UOMI. Factor two: Inland Revenue resources and taxpayer compliance costs 9.30 Section 6A(2) confirms that the use of Inland Revenue resources and the compliance costs imposed on taxpayers are two relevant factors when making a settlement decision. 9.31 Paragraphs 124 to 126 of IS 10/07 make the point that excessively high taxpayer compliance costs could undermine voluntary compliance. However, IS 10/07 also notes that Parliament contemplated that taxpayers would incur compliance costs to comply with their tax obligations and as a result of the Commissioner exercising the powers conferred on him to ensure taxpayer compliance. As a result, although taxpayer compliance costs may be relevant to a settlement decision, they will not generally be determinative or of significant weight. 9.32 In terms of Inland Revenue resources, the question is whether those finite resources could be better used for other purposes. The decision-maker has to have a reasonable idea of the amount of cost to Inland Revenue if it applies the resources necessary to continue the dispute, including potential litigation costs. 9.33 The cost of investigative, legal and other resources (such as forensic or Crown Law Office resources) need to be estimated. More complex cases will clearly occupy more time and cost more. The dispute will often involve senior technical and investigative staff, as well as external consultants and advisors. There is also the possibility of procedural and other impediments, which all need to be considered. 9.34 Secondly, the decision maker is entitled to take into account the alternative use of Inland Revenue’s resources, or the “opportunity cost”. In the past Inland Revenue has occasionally considered that bringing a dispute to an end, particularly where it is about a small quantum of tax can be more economical than continuing and succeeding in the case itself. In those circumstances, opportunity costs are valid considerations. Compromise may be preferable where the Commissioner needs resources to apply to a different case that is either strategically more important or involves considerably more tax in dispute. 9.35 The calculation is about establishing a reasonable figure for the commitment of resources going forward in the dispute and weighing that against the revenue at stake. This does not just mean the revenue at stake in terms of the particular individual dispute. Inland Revenue would also need to take into account the wider implications of the dispute (although this might happen under the “precedential 17 value” factor, below). This is ultimately about determining, or at least estimating, what is the “net revenue” (in terms of section 6A), which could be affected by the decision. 9.36 This factor will favour a settlement where the resource that Inland Revenue will need to deploy to complete a dispute outweighs the benefit achieved. This may be relevant where, for example, a historic dispute involving a single taxpayer with little tax at stake and no precedential value is still likely to require significant Inland Revenue resources (e.g. because of the complexity of the issue and the need for expert advice). 9.37 By contrast, it may be a more neutral factor where the dispute will not require significant additional resources (e.g. the dispute builds on work previously done by the Commissioner). In any case, the resource factor will need to be balanced against the other factors. Factor three: likelihood of success in the dispute 9.38 There is risk in any dispute that Inland Revenue’s view will not be accepted. What must be weighed here is the extent to which Inland Revenue’s position may or may not succeed in a court or the TRA. In considering the likely dispute risk, a number of factors need to be considered: interpretative uncertainty; evidential issues; and administrative or procedural concerns. Each of these needs to be separately taken into account. 9.39 Although Inland Revenue may consider that it has the better view of the law, there is still a risk that a court will disagree with that position. What must be weighed here is the likelihood of succeeding where there is uncertainty as to the law or the facts. So, for example: 9.39.1 The relevant legislation may not have been previously considered by the Courts or there may be commentary on the law suggesting it can be interpreted in different ways. Alternatively, it may be a novel application of settled law (such as a novel capital v revenue issue). 9.39.2 Where the propositions of law are not in doubt, there may still be dispute risk arising from the standard of the evidence. This can be either factual or expert opinion evidence and the credibility of a witness may be an important factor. Similarly, there may be uncertainty where a taxpayer’s expert is at odds with ours (over, for example, a valuation issue). 9.39.3 Finally, there will be rare occasions where administrative or procedural issues heighten our dispute risk. This may occur in relation to something like time bar (in a novel setting) or where the Commissioner is alleged to have made a tentative assessment. 9.40 Legal Services will be able to assist with this generally, but what is required is an aggregate assessment of the matters that impact on IR’s chances of succeeding. In particular, where there is a very significant dispute (either because it will act as a precedent or because of the quantum of tax involved) Legal Services’ advice on litigation risk should be obtained. Legal Services may also involve the Crown Law Office if appropriate. 9.41 This factor becomes increasingly in favour of settlement as Inland Revenue’s chances of succeeding are lessened. Conversely, where there is little or no litigation risk (for example, a scheme replicates in all material respects a case which has been considered by the courts), then this factor may weigh more in favour of not settling. 18 9.42 There is always some risk of failure, but decision-makers should not be excessively swayed by this. It is an assessment of all of the relevant factors together that remains critical. Factor four: precedential value of the dispute 9.43 A settlement is more likely to be approved if it is confined to its own facts and will not impact on other taxpayers. By contrast, it will be more difficult to justify a compromise where the dispute may impact on a number of taxpayers or where Inland Revenue would like the position to be made more certain. 9.44 The value of a dispute, in terms of its impact on others, may be two-fold. First, there is the impact it may have on other taxpayers in comparable situations. Secondly, there may be a need to have the relevant law clarified for a much wider group. 9.45 If we consider that a particular dispute will formally or indirectly determine the Commissioner’s position in relation to either a number of taxpayers or an issue generally, then it is not as desirable that such a dispute should be settled. For example, if we are in dispute with a taxpayer over whether certain expenditure is capital or revenue expenditure and consider that the issue may apply to the same or similar facts across an entire industry, then this factor would favour the dispute continuing rather than settling (even where other factors might indicate settlement). 9.46 Similarly, where the dispute relates to a potential tax avoidance arrangement that a number of taxpayers have replicated, this would count against settlement. In such circumstances, continuing and resolving (rather than settling) the dispute may ultimately positively impact on matters such as voluntary compliance and resource savings, if only by clarifying the law. 9.47 Inland Revenue may also want to pursue a dispute in circumstances where the law is unclear and obtaining clarity on the law will promote voluntary compliance. A decision to settle might not be contemplated where, for example, it is unclear whether an individual is entitled to claim a deduction for certain accrual or interest expenditure and the interpretation of the provisions could have far-reaching implications for many other investors. 9.48 Conversely, where the dispute is relatively fact specific and is not going to provide any guidance for other taxpayers in like situations, the capacity for settlement is greater, so this factor becomes more neutral to positive in considering a settlement proposal in these circumstances. 9.49 Finally, the terms of the settlement (in addition to whether Inland Revenue settles at all), although confidential can be seen as creating a precedent. While each case should be approached on its merits, we need to be very mindful of this if there are likely to be other similar cases to resolve. 9.50 Please also note the comments above explaining the need to contact Legal Services where other directly relevant litigation or disputes are already under action. 19 Factor five: quantum of tax in dispute 9.51 The greater the potential tax in dispute, the more compelling the other reasons for settlement need to be. Determining the tax at risk is relatively easy for a simple dispute but an aggregation of tax at risk might be required when there is a comparable arrangement involving several taxpayers. In the latter situation, the tax at risk may be closely aligned to the dispute’s precedential possibilities. 9.52 The amount of tax which is affected by the possible settlement is also relevant. There are overlaps with the other criteria of course. So, for example, if the tax is quite small, then it is relatively easy to see that applying substantial investigative and legal resources, which could easily exceed the tax in dispute, could produce a negative net revenue figure. This would never be a decisive factor on its own, but it should be taken into account. 9.53 Where the revenue at stake is very large, say in the millions of dollars, this will be a significant factor in deciding to continue the dispute. Of course, the higher the dispute or litigation risk, the greater the chance that some or all of the tax will not be able to be assessed. Factor six: the taxpayer’s ability to pay 9.54 There may be situations in which the ability to receive a settlement payment from the taxpayer decreases over time. 9.55 The primary aim is to correctly assess the taxpayer. However, it is sometimes appropriate to consider whether Inland Revenue would eventually recover the full tax, UOMI and penalties if the dispute continues. That is, an agreement now with the taxpayer to a reduced assessment and the payment of that assessment may increase the revenue collected compared to an assessment and payment in the future without that agreement. 9.56 That may be the case if funds are currently available for the taxpayer to pay on the basis of a compromised settlement, but there is a real likelihood that the funds will not be there in the future. In this way this factor may be a relevant consideration, though it should not obscure the primary aims of correctly assessing the taxpayer, promoting voluntary compliance and maintaining the integrity of the tax system. 9.57 The mere fact that a taxpayer cannot immediately pay the full amount that should be assessed based on the other settlement factors is not a reason to compromise further. This factor can only be potentially relevant if it is likely that a taxpayer’s financial situation will be materially worse in the near future so that a delay in assessing jeopardises the collection of real money. It may also be relevant that a person currently has money in New Zealand but will shortly leave for a jurisdiction where debt recovery possibilities are limited or non-existent. 9.58 Where the taxpayer’s capacity to pay is an issue, it is recommended that the case team liaise with those who have debt expertise to see whether they have any views on collection issues relating to the taxpayer. 9.59 It should be noted that section 177C(3) of the TAA states that outstanding tax is not written off if a taxpayer is liable to pay ATP or evasion penalties that have been established, rather than just proposed. 9.60 The fact that the taxpayer is currently insolvent and not able to pay the tax could also be a relevant consideration if all other things were evenly balanced, but an inability to pay does not mean a settlement is required. For example, cases on care and management, including Raynel v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583 and Clarke and Money v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,260, clearly indicate that the Commissioner is not 20 required to cease recovery action just because the taxpayer may be insolvent. The Court in Clarke and Money stated: In the exercise of his discretion under section 177 the defendant is fully entitled to consider a whole range of factors including the circumstances which led to the plaintiffs' taxation debts; the nature and extent of the plaintiffs' co-operation and negotiating stance; the speed with which they have provided requested information and the extent of that information; his obligations under section 6 and section 6A(3); and matters of consistency in administration. 9.61 In those circumstances, there may be solid care and management reasons for continuing to pursue a dispute or take recovery action in the face of serious non- compliance regardless of whether the taxpayer can pay. Inland Revenue has other powers with respect to debt. Summary 9.62 When considering a settlement of a tax liability or potential tax liability, the starting point is that the law should be applied correctly and that we should seek to recover all of the tax which is due. Recognising that we cannot do so in all cases, these Guidelines provide: 9.62.1 a set of criteria which can be taken into account, depending on the particular case; and 9.62.2 some guiding principles as to how much weight should be applied to each of the criteria. 9.63 A proposal relating to the application of those criteria to the dispute in question needs to be set out in writing by the CCS team involved, and a decision made by a delegation holder with assistance from Legal Services (including the completion of the required CTA review). 9.64 If consideration of the above factors leads to a conclusion that a settlement should be entered into with the taxpayer, a final check should be undertaken to ensure that that settlement is consistent with the obligation under section 6 of the TAA to protect the integrity of the tax system, which relies on voluntary compliance. A settlement agreement should not be entered into if doing so would have a material adverse effect on voluntary compliance generally. 9.65 Whether or not a specific settlement would adversely affect voluntary compliance, and therefore the integrity of the tax system, depends on the terms of the settlement, the nature of the non-compliance and the likelihood of the settlement being regarded as precedential. 21 10. Appendix: Extract on settlements from IS 10/07, October 2010, paragraphs 151 to 161 Settlements and agreements 151. The courts have held that, under section 6A(2) and (3), the Commissioner can enter into: • Settlements where taxpayers dispute the interpretation of law or facts on which their liability has been assessed (Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,758 (HC); Accent Management (No 2) v CIR (CA); Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR; AG v Steelfort Engineering; and Fairbrother v CIR). • Agreements as to the payment of outstanding tax, penalties and interest (Raynel v CIR). 152. The courts have explicitly held that the Commissioner can settle litigation on a basis that does not necessarily correspond to his view of the correct tax position if he considers that doing so is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6: Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA); Foxley v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,813. The courts have implicitly suggested that the Commissioner can give effect to settlements by way of an amended assessment, but it is not entirely clear whether this is done under section 6A(2) and (3), or only where authorised by another provision. However, it is clear that the Commissioner can amend an assessment under section 89C(d) to reflect the terms of a settlement: Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA). 153. That the Commissioner can settle litigation might seem inconsistent with the conclusion reached earlier that the Commissioner cannot alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements: see paragraphs 69–73 above. However, the courts have made clear that the Commissioner is not exercising any power to alter taxpayers’ obligations in entering settlements. The courts have held that settlements do not involve the Commissioner “assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws, and the execution of laws, without consent of Parliament”: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (HC) at paragraph 74. 154. In taking this position, the courts have emphasised that settlements are made where the taxpayer’s obligations and entitlements are legitimately disputed and, therefore, the Commissioner will need to undertake litigation to collect the full amount of tax he considers owing. The courts have recognised that the Commissioner may consider, in light of the litigation risk, that the resources required could be better used elsewhere to maximise the net revenue collected. In Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA), William Young P held (at paragraph 15): This \[the Commissioner’s ability to enter settlements\] represents an undoubted shift from the approach adopted in \[Brierley Investments\]. The change in policy is justified by recognition that the Commissioner has limited resources and the function of collecting “over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”. Major tax litigation is expensive and places a heavy strain on the human resources available to the Commissioner. The Commissioner must be permitted to make rational decisions as to how those resources can be best deployed. Further, “sensible litigation, including settlement, decisions” must necessarily allow for litigation risk. 155. In holding that the Commissioner is authorised to enter settlements, the courts have given effect to a key outcome intended to be achieved by enacting section 6A(2) and (3). The ORC report shows that it was specifically contemplated that section 6A(2) and (3) would authorise the Commissioner to enter settlements (ORC report, section 8.2): One significant implication from the objective \[that the Commissioner will collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law\] is that IRD will be 22 entitled to enter into compromised settlements with taxpayers, rather than pursue the full amount of assessed tax, in cases where there are legitimate differences of view about the facts in dispute and the costs of litigation are high. 156. The courts have not specifically considered whether the Commissioner can settle tax disputes before litigation or the formal disputes process has started. The Commissioner considers that, in principle, there is no impediment to him doing so. The Commissioner may consider that settling will enable his resources to be better used to maximise the net revenue collected. The Commissioner’s position and responsibilities before litigation or the formal disputes process has started are not inherently different to his position and responsibilities during litigation. However, the litigation processes often results in him possessing more information than he did before. Accordingly, the Commissioner will consider settling before litigation or the formal disputes process has started only if satisfied that he has sufficient information on which to make an informed decision. As with his other powers, the Commissioner will prescribe which officers have the delegated authority to decide whether to settle. 157. The case law is clear that the Commissioner can enter settlements with taxpayers if he considers doing so is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. It is not possible to list all the factors the Commissioner may consider in deciding whether to settle. Ultimately the decision must be determined by consideration of all factors relevant to the particular case. However, the following, non-exhaustive list identifies some of the factors the Commissioner could consider relevant (depending on the circumstances of the particular case): • the resources required to undertake litigation; • the alternative uses of those resources; • the amount of the tax liability at stake; • an assessment of the litigation risk (eg, the likelihood of the Commissioner succeeding); • the implications of the Commissioner succeeding (in whole or part) if litigation is undertaken; • whether settling or litigating would better promote compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers; • the amount the taxpayer would pay if the Commissioner were to settle; • whether the subject matter of the dispute might be determinative of, or have broader application to, other situations; • whether the Commissioner would be prepared to settle on an equivalent basis with other taxpayers in a similar position; • the uncertainty in the tax system that might be created should the subject matter not be authoritatively determined by the courts; and • the likely effects on taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system of settling or litigating. 158. As already stated, the factors identified above are not exhaustive. Some of these factors may not be relevant and additional factors may be relevant given the circumstances of any particular case. It is for the Commissioner to decide on the appropriate weighting given to the relevant factors in a particular case. 23 159. Tax disputes sometimes involve several taxpayers. The Commissioner may need to decide whether to settle with each of the taxpayers individually. In such situations, the Commissioner is not required to settle, or to settle on the same terms, with all taxpayers involved in the litigation: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (HC), at paragraphs 79–86; and Accent Management Ltd v CIR (No 2) (CA), at paragraphs 20–22. However, the Commissioner will be aware that consistency of treatment for taxpayers with the same circumstances is an important consideration under section 6A(3) and section 6. Accordingly, in tax disputes involving several taxpayers, the Commissioner will generally settle on an equivalent basis with those taxpayers he considers share the same circumstances. By contrast, the Commissioner may settle on a different basis with those taxpayers he considers are in different circumstances. Different circumstances might include, for example, the taxpayer’s willingness to settle, the timing of the settlement offers in relation to the progress of the litigation proceedings, the state of the case law at the time, and the Commissioner’s perception of the culpability of the taxpayers involved: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (No 2) (CA) at paragraph 21. Because settlements reflect the circumstances of the particular litigation and of the taxpayers, they are not necessarily indicative of how the Commissioner will deal with similar issues in the future. 160. In deciding whether to settle litigation, the Commissioner will act consistently with the Protocol between the Solicitor-General and Commissioner of Inland Revenue, dated 29 July 2009 (available at the Crown Law Office website: http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz). This means that the Commissioner will consult with the Solicitor-General, who is responsible for the conduct of Crown litigation; and that litigation settlements will be jointly approved by Crown Law and Inland Revenue (except where the settlements concern debt matters and summary prosecution in which Inland Revenue solicitors represent the Commissioner). The Commissioner may also consult the Solicitor-General before entering a prelitigation settlement if the subject-matter is central to a significant dispute in litigation. 161. Finally, where the Commissioner has entered into a settlement or agreement, he will not resile from it except if: • the Commissioner is acting pursuant to a condition in the settlement or agreement that allows him to resile; • the taxpayer has failed to adhere to the settlement or agreement; or • the settlement or agreement was entered into on account of misrepresentations by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer failed to make full disclosure before the settlement or agreement was entered into.
NEW LEGISLATION > ACT > SPECIAL REPORT Special report on build-to-rent exclusion from interest limitation rules Issued: 3 April 2023 Public Act 2023 No 5 This special report provides early information on the build-to-rent exclusion from the interest limitation rules included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 ahead of an upcoming edition of the Tax Information Bulletin.

Background The interest limitation rules in subpart DH of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) took effect on 1 October 2021 and are aimed at tilting the playing field for existing residential property away from investors and towards first home buyers and owner-occupiers. The rules deny an interest deduction for interest incurred for disallowed residential property on or after 1 October 2021. However, the rules do not apply to interest incurred for “excepted residential land” as listed in schedule 15 of the ITA. Exemptions, such as the new build exemption, were included to ensure the interest limitation rules do not have a negative impact on new housing supply. Build-to-rent assets have now been added to the list of excepted residential land to ensure the rules do not negatively impact the supply of this type of large-scale rental property specifically. Key features “Build-to-rent land” has been added to the list of excepted residential land in schedule 15. This means the interest limitation rules do not apply to deny deductions for interest incurred for property that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has received notice has met the asset class definition and been approved as build-to-rent land by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development. However, if the land at any later point fails to meet the asset class definition, taxpayers will no longer be able to rely on the build-to-rent exclusion to prevent the interest limitation rules from applying to deny interest deductions for that residential rental property. “Build-to-rent land” definition The new definition of “build-to-rent land” in section YA 1 of the ITA provides that build-to- rent land is, for a person, land that they own and that is described in section CB 12(1)(a) to (e) or section CB 13 (1)(a) and (b) to the extent to which: Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 4 of 10 Special report – Public Act 2023 No 5 | 3 April 2023  it is or was part of one project of 20 or more dwellings, and  it is currently one of 20 or more dwellings used, available for use, or being prepared or restored for use, as a rental property to which the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) applies, if—  every residential tenancy has the option of a fixed term of at least 10 years, with the ability for the tenant to give 56 days’ notice of termination, and  every tenancy agreement includes a personalisation policy in line with sections 42, 42A and 42B of the RTA. It does not include land that, at any time after it first meets the above requirements, fails to meet those requirements. Existing dwellings must meet definition by 1 July 2023 Existing build-to-rent assets have until 1 July 2023 to comply with the tenure and personalisation policy requirements included in the definition of “build-to-rent land”. The policy is intended to apply to new and existing build-to-rent developments, however, it is highly unlikely any existing developments will have offered 10-year tenancies to all tenants. Effective date The amendments take effect on 1 October 2021 to align with the introduction of the interest limitation rules. Detailed Analysis Land is excluded from the interest limitation rules in perpetuity for as long as it meets the definition of ”build-to-rent land”. The definition contains several elements, which are discussed below. Land described in sections CB 12(1)(a) to (e) or CB 13(1)(a) and (b) Land described in sections CB 12 and CB 13 is land where an undertaking or scheme involves the development or division of the land. Indications that land is part of a particular development could include records of title, consent applications, development/subdivision plans or other materials, such as a prospectus for investors. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 5 of 10 Special report – Public Act 2023 No 5 | 3 April 2023 Land described in sections CB 12 and CB 13 can include land that is in separate adjacent blocks or held on different records of title. This allows for flexibility in the configuration of build-to-rent land if it includes commercial premises or dwellings that do not meet the build-to-rent requirements. In these instances, apportionment will be required (see discussion under the “‘To the extent’ test” heading below). It also does not preclude land that is not contiguous, for example, if there is a road between pieces of land. This requirement ensures (in conjunction with the single owner requirement) that the build- to-rent land is part of one cohesive project, even where it spans multiple blocks of land. While flexibility is allowed for in the configuration, it must still be part of the same project. For example, it would not be possible to claim that ten dwellings on a block of land in Thorndon, Wellington and ten dwellings on a block of land in Newtown, Wellington could comprise a single build-to-rent development. Configuration of development A build-to-rent development must always have no less than 20 dwellings that satisfy the requirements to qualify as “build-to-rent land”. The dwellings can be held in one or more titles and can be on adjoining parcels of land. The development can include commercial premises or other dwellings (that do not meet build- to-rent requirements) that do not form part of the build-to-rent development. For example, there may be owner-occupied dwellings or rental dwellings that do not offer 10-year tenancies or personalisation policies. In these instances, apportionment will be required. Including commercial premises within build-to-rent developments enables community amenities to be provided and allows for alternative revenue streams for the development. Including other dwellings supports developments that want to mix tenure types, which may be needed to make developments viable, particularly in regional centres. ‘To the extent’ test A dwelling will qualify for the exclusion “to the extent” to which it meets the definition requirements. This means each individual dwelling must meet the definition, as well as the overall development, for interest not to be subject to the interest limitation rules. Only interest relating to the portion of the development that meets the definition of “build-to- rent land” will not be denied the deductions under the rules. This includes the portion of shared amenities made available to build-to-rent tenants. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 6 of 10 Special report – Public Act 2023 No 5 | 3 April 2023 Example 1: ‘T o the extent’ to which it meets the definition Te Awhi Co. completed a 35-apartment development in 2024 that also has a block of commercial shops on the ground floor. Of the 35 apartments, 10 are sold to owner- occupiers and 25 are retained by Te Awhi Co. to rent out under the build-to-rent model. Assuming the 25 apartments meet the other requirements of build-to-rent land (that is, they are rented out under the RTA, tenants have been offered a 10-year tenancy agreement and personalisation policies have been included), these 25 apartments will qualify as build-to-rent land. Any interest relating to these 25 apartments will therefore not be denied a deduction under the interest limitation rules. Assuming existing tax rules are satisfied, interest incurred for these 25 apartments will be deductible. Having commercial premises and dwellings that do not meet the “build-to-rent land” definition in the same development does not stop those units that do meet the definition from qualifying for the exclusion. If, instead of being owner-occupied, the remaining 10 apartments were rented out (as a residential rental property that did not qualify as build-to-rent land), they may still be eligible for the new build exemption for a period of 20 years from the date the code compliance certificate was issued. Same person Build-to-rent land must be owned by the same person to qualify for the exclusion. ”Same person” can include any natural person or legal entity (for example, a company, limited partnership or joint venture). Continuous use requirement A unit must continually meet the requirements of the “build-to-rent land” definition to qualify for the exclusion. If, after first meeting the requirements, a unit fails at any point to meet the definition, even if the unit again meets the requirements in the future, it can never again qualify as “build-to- rent land”. Existing build-to-rent developments must meet all requirements by 1 July 2023 and continue to do so at all times after that date. All new developments completed after 1 July 2023 must always comply. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 7 of 10 Special report – Public Act 2023 No 5 | 3 April 2023 Used, available for use, or being prepared or restored for use A dwelling must be used, available for use or being prepared or restored for use as a build- to-rent dwelling to qualify for the exclusion. The wording ”available for use” is intended to cover situations where dwellings are not currently occupied but are being advertised on the market as available for rent. “Being prepared or restored for use” covers scenarios where a dwelling is not currently available for use but is undergoing work to be suitable for use as a rental property. For example, between tenancies a unit may be renovated to replace an outdated kitchen. The dwelling would still qualify during this period even though it is not occupied. Tenure length requirement Tenants of a build-to-rent dwelling must be offered a fixed term tenancy of at least 10 years, which is terminable by 56 days’ notice under section 58A of the RTA, including at times of tenancy renewal and renegotiation. This does not mean the tenant has to accept this offer. They may agree to, or request, a different tenancy offer. Existing build-to-rent developments will have until 1 July 2023 to offer all existing tenants a 10-year contract and must offer all new tenants a 10-year contract from that date. Any build- to-rent development completed after 1 July 2023 will have to meet this requirement immediately. Personalisation policies The definition of “build-to-rent land” requires that explicit personalisation policies are offered by build-to-rent providers to their tenants that are in line with sections 42, 42A and 42B of the RTA. Under the RTA, a tenant can ask a landlord if they can make a change (for example, attach a fixture or make an alteration) to the property. The landlord must not unreasonably withhold consent to the change and may impose reasonable conditions. At the end of the tenancy, tenants will be required to ‘make good’ on any personalisations made during the tenancy, as set out by the RTA. Personalisation policies are not intended to pre-authorise the personalisations featured in the policies, rather they are intended to make clear to tenants upfront what personalisations the build-to-rent provider is happy for the tenant to make. This requirement may take the form of a build-to-rent provider including a clause in associated tenancy agreements or producing a document, offered to all tenants within the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 8 of 10 Special report – Public Act 2023 No 5 | 3 April 2023 build-to-rent development, that explicitly outlines how tenants can personalise their dwellings. Providers must include their position on the keeping of pets. The intention of this requirement is to make lifestyle issues, like pets and home-making, more transparent to prospective tenants. Existing build-to-rent developments have until 1 July 2023 to provide personalisation policies to all current tenants. Any build-to-rent developments completed after 1 July 2023 will have to comply with this requirement immediately. When the exclusion applies To qualify for the exclusion, the Chief Executive of the department responsible for the administration of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 must be satisfied that the development meets the definition of build-to-rent land. Currently, this approval would be granted by the Chief Executive of Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The asset will then be recorded on a register of assets that is then shared with Inland Revenue. The exclusion will continue for as long as the development meets the definition requirements. Taxpayers with existing build-to-rent developments will be eligible for the exclusion from 1 October 2021 if they meet the definition requirements before 1 July 2023 and are approved by HUD. The exclusion for existing developments applies from 1 October 2021 to align with the introduction of the interest limitation rules. New build-to-rent developments can apply the exclusion from the date of application if they meet the definition requirements and are approved by HUD. Existing build-to-rent developments completed before 1 July 2023 will have until that date to meet the definition requirements and apply for registration. If a development does not do so by 1 July 2023, it will never be able to qualify for the exclusion. New build-to-rent developments will need to comply with the requirements immediately and will be eligible for the exclusion from the date they apply for the exclusion, provided they meet the requirements and are approved by HUD. Effect of exclusion The effect of the build-to-rent exclusion is that the interest limitation rules in subpart DH of the ITA would not apply to deny interest deductions. However, interest would still have to be deductible under existing tax rules. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 9 of 10 Special report – Public Act 2023 No 5 | 3 April 2023 Provided a deduction is allowed under existing tax rules, t he interest that may be deducted if the exclusion applies would include interest on loans to:  acquire the land a build-to-rent development is on,  construct or install a build-to-rent development on the land,  pay for things like insurance and rates, and  renovate, maintain, or repair a build-to-rent dwelling. When the exclusion ceases A dwelling will cease to qualify immediately if it fails to meet the definition of “build-to-rent land”. If a dwelling in a development no longer meets the requirements, for example, if it is not rented out under the RTA, interest relating to that dwelling will no longer be excluded from the interest limitation rules. If , when that dwelling ceases to qualify, this results in the development having less than 20 qualifying dwellings, the exclusion will cease to apply to the entire development. Example 2: When a unit ceases to qualify Assuming the same facts as in example 1, Te Awhi Co. is currently deducting interest relating to the 25 qualifying units in their development. In February 2025, f our of these units are sold, so interest is only deductible for the remaining 21 units. In May 2025, two units are rented out to new tenants who are only offered three-year contracts. This does not meet the requirement of offering a fixed-term tenancy of at least 10 years. As such, the two units no longer qualify for the build-to-rent exclusion. As only 19 units now meet the requirements in the build-to-rent land definition, the build-to-rent exclusion from the interest limitation rules will cease to apply for the entire development. The new build exemption may apply to the property for a period of 20 years from the date the property received its code compliance certificate. In situations where an inadvertent breach of the “build-to-rent land” definition occurs, for example, a genuine administrative error sees a tenant in one of 20 dwellings not provided an explicit personalisation policy, Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development will work with taxpayers to assist them in meeting compliance. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 10 of 10 Special report – Public Act 2023 No 5 | 3 April 2023 Interaction with the new build exemption The new build exemption currently applies to exempt new builds from the interest limitation rules for a period of 20 years. A new build is a self-contained dwelling that has received its code compliance certificate on or after 27 March 2020. A build-to-rent development is not barred from accessing the new build exemption. However, a development would still have to meet the build-to-rent land requirements— either from 1 July 2023 if it is an existing build, or immediately for new build-to-rent developments—to be able to access the exclusion at any time in the future (for example, once the 20-year new build exemption ceases). Further information More information about the build-to-rent exclusion is available at Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development’s website: www.hud.govt.nz/our-work/build-to- rent. About this document Special reports are published shortly after new legislation is enacted or Orders in Council are made to help affected taxpayers and their advisors understand the consequences of the changes. These are published in advance of an article in the Tax Information Bulletin.

From 1 July 2023, child support collected by Inland Revenue will be paid to those beneficiaries, and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) will then treat these payments as income when determining entitlement to a benefit or other assistance. Previously, parents and carers who received a sole parent rate of main benefit were required to apply for child support to be assessed and collected by Inland Revenue. Child support payments collected by Inland Revenue on behalf of these sole parent beneficiaries were retained by the government to offset the cost of their benefits. Once the cost of their benefit had been offset, any excess was paid to the beneficiary. Excess payments were not treated as income by MSD when determining the sole parent’s benefit entitlement. However, other beneficiaries (such as repartnered beneficiaries) had their child support passed on. This created inequity and inconsistency between how sole parent beneficiaries and other beneficiaries were treated in the benefit system. To correct this, the obligation for sole parent beneficiaries to apply for child support to be assessed and collected by Inland Revenue has been removed. Any child support payments collected by Inland Revenue will be passed on to sole parent beneficiaries. These changes do not apply to Unsupported Child’s Benefit beneficiaries. MSD will treat the child support payments passed on by Inland Revenue as income when determining the beneficiary’s eligibility to, or rate of, benefit. Monthly child support will be spread across four or five weeks. This process will be automated using information provided by Inland Revenue under its approved information sharing agreement. Related to the amendments outlined above, formula assessments of child support payable by liable parents are now costs that can be considered for Temporary Additional Support and Special Benefit purposes. The Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 implements the first of two phases – passing on child support and treating most child support payments as income. The second phase would implement rules for how child support payments are treated as income in rarer cases and may come into effect at a later date. Effective date All the proposed amendments take effect on 1 July 2023. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 5 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Amendments to the Child Support Act 1991 Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 6 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Passing on child support Sections 141 to 143 of the Child Support Act 1991 Child support assessed and collected by Inland Revenue for parents or carers receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit is no longer retained and is passed on to the receiving carer. Background Child support is money paid by parents who do not live with their children or who share care with someone else. The money is to help with the cost of raising a child. One of the main objects of child support is to ensure children are maintained by their parents. Parents and carers receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit were required to apply to Inland Revenue for a formula assessment of child support, and child support payments collected by Inland Revenue on their behalf were retained by the government to offset the cost of their benefit. Once the full cost of their benefit was offset, any remaining child support payment was paid to them. These settings did not apply to other beneficiaries. For example, parents on a couple’s rate of main benefit who have children in their care from a previous relationship receive any child support payments in full, with none of it retained by the government. Key features The amendments ensure child support payments collected by Inland Revenue for parents or carers receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit are no longer retained by the government. Instead, child support payments are passed on in the same way they are passed on to other beneficiaries. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 7 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Requirement to apply for child support through Inland Revenue removed Sections 9, 12 and 27 of the Child Support Act 1991 Parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit are no longer required to apply for formula assessed child support through Inland Revenue. Background Parents and carers receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit were required to apply for a formula assessment of child support through Inland Revenue, unless one of the grounds for exemption (such as a risk of violence) applied. This requirement did not apply to other beneficiaries with children or other parents outside the benefit system. Key features The requirement that parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit apply for child support has been removed. This enables carers to enter the type of child support arrangement that best meets their needs – whether this is a formula assessment, a voluntary agreement, a private arrangement, or no child support arrangement at all. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 8 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Amendments do not apply to people receiving an Unsupported Child’s Benefit Sections 2, 50, 96Y, 122, 131, 152B and 179A to 180A of the Child Support Act 1991 The amendments that pass on child support payments and remove the requirement to apply for child support through Inland Revenue do not apply to people receiving the Unsupported Child’s Benefit (UCB). Background The UCB is administered by MSD for children living with caregivers outside the State care system. It is a payment that helps caregivers who are supporting children whose parents cannot care for them because of a family breakdown. Caregivers who receive the UCB are required to apply for child support with Inland Revenue. Any child support payments made by liable parents are retained to offset the cost of the recipient’s UCB. Key features The amendments that pass on child support and remove the requirement to apply for formula assessed child support do not apply to UCB recipients. Passing on child support for caregivers receiving the UCB is being considered by Oranga Tamariki as part of the long-term work to reform the system of financial assistance and support for caregivers. These reforms intend to transform the caregiver financial assistance system and passing on child support will be considered in the context of the new model. The relevant sections in the Child Support Act 1991 that applied to a “social security beneficiary” have been amended to only refer to a “UCB beneficiary”. This ensures that those sections continue to apply to people receiving the UCB. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 9 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Amendments to the Child Support Rules 1992 and Family Court Rules 2002 Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 10 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Redundant forms and rules Rules 13, 19 and schedule 1 of the Child Support Rules 1992 and rules 21, 258, 260 and schedule 3 of the Family Court Rules 2002 The prescribed forms and other rules relating to urgent maintenance orders in the Child Support Rules 1992 and Family Court Rules 2002 are revoked. Background The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 revoked the provision of the Child Support Act 1991 that allowed a person to apply to the Family Court for an urgent maintenance order if they had made an application for child support to Inland Revenue, but child support had not yet been assessed. This provision was originally included in the Child Support Act 1991 to cover the transition when child support moved to Inland Revenue in case there were unforeseen circumstances that meant Inland Revenue was unable to assess child support. However, the prescribed forms and other rules relating to urgent maintenance orders in the Child Support Rules 1992 and Family Court Rules 2002 were not revoked at the same time as the provision. These forms and other rules have been revoked because they are redundant. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 11 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Amendments to the Social Security Act 2018 and Social Security Regulations 2018 Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 12 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Use of automated electronic systems Sections 113, 296 and new Subpart 5A of Part 6 of the Social Security Act 2018 and regulations 207, 208A and 208B of the Social Security Regulations 2018 The process of considering child support payments as income is automated. Benefit debt arising from an error in the information shared by Inland Revenue, or the processing of that information by MSD is not recoverable and will be written off. Background Previously, any child support remaining after the full cost of a sole person’s benefit was recovered was paid to the parent or carer. This child support was only income for Temporary Additional Support, Special Benefit, and Childcare Assistance. Now that child support is no longer retained, the child support payment is income for benefits and other assistance. This is consistent with how child support paid to other beneficiaries is treated. People receiving a benefit or other assistance have been required to tell MSD about any income they receive. MSD staff would then determine the period for which the income affects any benefits they receive and apply the income manually over that period. Key features The amendments allow for automation of the process to treat child support payments as income for benefits and other assistance. Automation is supported by Inland Revenue sharing child support information with MSD under their Approved Information Sharing Agreement. The sharing of child support information by Inland Revenue means that a person’s obligation to declare their income to MSD is satisfied unless the information shared is incorrect. In the event there is a systems failure (that leads to a disruption to the disclosure of information to MSD that is used in or by the system) or specified individual errors (as set out in section 304A of the Social Security Act 2018) in the processing of the child support information provided by Inland Revenue, any resulting overpayment of benefit (debt) is not recoverable from the beneficiary and will be written off. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 13 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] New definitions: “information share child support payment” and “general provisions child support payment” Schedule 2 of the Social Security Act 2018 New definitions for “information child support payment” and “general provisions child support payment” are inserted to enable the new income-charging rules to be applied. Background Treating certain child support payments as income under new income rules means it is necessary to specify the child support payments the new rules apply to because there are scenarios where it is not appropriate for the child support payments to be spread as income on a forward-looking basis. Key features The new income rules will apply to an “information share child support payment” only (see “Child support payments treated as income ” below). This is child support that is:  money received by the person, and  not a general provisions child support payment. A “general provisions child support payment” will continue to be treated under the general income rules where appropriate. This is a payment that is money received by the person that is child support and is all or any of the following:  paid in a manner other than by direct credit to a bank account  paid to a person before they apply for and are granted a benefit or other assistance  paid under a formula assessment paid after the full cost of a person’s UCB has been recovered  paid under a voluntary agreement paid to a person receiving a UCB  paid under an order made by the Family Court  foreign child support payment Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 14 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  paid to a person receiving a specified New Zealand benefit while they are not living in New Zealand  payments relating to a child support period before 1 July 2023  child support about which Inland Revenue has not provided information to MSD, and  any child support payments specified by regulations made under section 418(1)(na). New section 418(1)(na) allows newly identified payment scenarios to be added to the definition of general provisions child support payment via regulations. This allows those child support payments to be treated correctly and for them to be classified in a timely manner. Child support payments that do not come under either definition would not be income for a benefit or other assistance. For example, child support that two parents owe each other that has been netted off and is no longer payable. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 15 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Child support payments treated as income Clauses 7A–8, 11–13, 15 and Part 3A of schedule 3 of the Social Security Act 2018 New income rules apply to “information share child support payments”. The income will be spread across the next four or five weeks (depending on the number of benefit payments in a one-month period after the payment is received and whether a weekly or fortnightly benefit is being received). “General provisions child support payments” will continue to be treated under MSD’s existing general income rules. Background New income rules apply to information share child support payments (see “New definitions: “information share child support payment” and “general provisions child support payment” above). Child support is a monthly payment, whereas benefit payments are paid weekly or fortnightly. Under the general income rules, MSD has a discretion to determine the period to which any income relates. This means that when MSD is made aware of a person’s income, they may determine that it relates to a past or future period. If MSD determines the income relates to a past period for which the benefit has already been paid, this can result in benefit debt for the beneficiary. Key features The new income rules treat information share child support payments as income on a weekly basis. This replaces how MSD treats child support payments from Inland Revenue as income for all beneficiaries, not just parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit. General provisions child support payments will continue to be treated as income under MSD’s existing general income rules. Information share child support payments Child support payments collected by Inland Revenue are based on an annual liability. This annual amount is then divided equally into 12 monthly payments due by liable parents. In contrast, benefits are paid on either a weekly or fortnightly basis. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 16 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] If the monthly child support payment was only treated as income in the week or fortnight it was received, the payment may result in more benefit abatement than if the payment was spread over the length of time it is intended to represent. The new income rules take the monthly child support payment and turn it into weekly amounts by spreading the payment evenly across the following four or five weeks after the payment is received. This ensures that entitlement to a benefit is assessed in a way that is consistent with the number of weeks the child support payment is intended to support the child. This means that benefit entitlement will be assessed based on the financial resources available to the receiving carer and debt for families is minimised by ensuring child support payments do not impact benefits that have already been paid. Example 1: Spreading of income Jo is receiving a sole parent rate of benefit. Her ex-partner is paying child support of $180 each month. Previously, the government retained all the child support to offset the cost of Jo’s benefit. Child support for periods from July 2023 will be passed on to Jo instead. The child support for August 2023 is due to be paid to Inland Revenue by 20 September, and Inland Revenue passes the payment on to Jo. Rather than treating the child support as income for August, or as income in the week it is received (which would only abate Jo’s benefit in that week), the payment is treated as $36 of income in each of the following five weeks. This is different from the general income rules in the Social Security Act 2018. Those rules provide MSD with a discretion to determine the period the income is taken into account for benefit purposes. How child support will be treated as income for benefit purposes Whether a person is receiving their benefit weekly or fortnightly will impact the number of weeks their child support payment is treated as income as well as the start and end dates of the income treatment. Weekly benefits When the payment starts to be treated as income The period of entitlement for weekly benefits runs from Monday to Sunday. The benefit payment is made to the beneficiary in the following week. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 17 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] A child support payment starts to be income from the Monday of the week that the payment is treated as being received (referred to in the Social Security Act 2018 as the “deemed receipt”). A payment is treated as received on the business day after Inland Revenue notifies MSD that the payment has been made to the receiving carer. Example 2: When payment starts to be income Inland Revenue notifies MSD that an information share child support payment has been made to a receiving carer on 22 August 2023. The payment would be treated as being received on 23 August (being one business day after Inland Revenue notifies MSD the payment has been made). The payment would start to be treated as income for benefit purposes on 21 August – the Monday of the week the payment is treated as being received. Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 21 Payment starts being income 22 Payment made and MSD notified 23 Date treated as being received 24 25 26 27 If notification is sent to MSD on a Friday, the payment would be treated as being received on the following Monday, and the payment would start to be treated as income on that same Monday. 1 1 If the day after the payment is made is a public holiday, the payment would be treated as received on the next business day. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 18 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 21 22 23 24 25 Payment made and MSD notified 26 27 28 Date treated as being received Payment starts being income 29 30 31 1 2 3 When the payment stops being treated as income When a child support payment stops being income for weekly benefits depends on whether it is an “in-cycle payment” or an “out-of-cycle payment”. An in-cycle payment is any child support payment made by Inland Revenue to a receiving carer on the day that is two business days after the 19th of the month. For example, if the 19th of a month is a Saturday, any child support payment that Inland Revenue pays to a receiving carer on Tuesday 22nd would be an in-cycle payment. In-cycle payments generally represent a child support payment that is on time. However, any late child support payments made on this day will also be treated as an in-cycle payment for benefit purposes. Any child support payments made to a receiving carer on any other day of the month that is not the in-cycle payment date is an out-of-cycle payment. Using the example in the previous paragraph, if the payment was made on Monday 21st or Wednesday 23rd, the payment would be an out-of-cycle payment. Inland Revenue does not make child support payments on non-business days such as weekends or public holidays. Out-of-cycle payments represent payments for an earlier child support period that have not been paid by the due date. When an in-cycle payment stops being treated as income For in-cycle payments, the child support payment stops being income on the Sunday before the “expected date of the next in-cycle payment” – this is the third business day after the Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 19 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 19th of the following month. This rule is designed to ensure that an in-cycle payment stops being treated as income before the next payment starts to be treated as income. Example 3: When an in -cycle payment stops being income Paul is a receiving carer and is receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit. On 21 June 2024, Inland Revenue makes a $400 child support payment to Paul’s bank account and notifies MSD of the payment. The payment is treated as being received one business day after MSD is notified. In this case, because 21 June 2024 is a Friday, the payment is treated as being received on Monday 24 June. The child support starts being income on the Monday of the week the payment is treated as being received, which is also 24 June. The expected date of the next in-cycle payment is the third business day after 19 July, which is Wednesday 24 July. The child support payment therefore stops being income on Sunday 21 July, being the Sunday before the expected date of the next in-cycle payment. Therefore, the child support payment is income from 24 June to 21 July. There are four weekly benefit payments between these dates. Therefore, the child support payment of $400 is divided by four. MSD will treat $100 of child support as Paul’s income for each week during this period. Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 17 18 19 20 21 In-cycle payment made and MSD notified 22 23 24 Date treated as being received Payment starts being income 25 26 27 28 29 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 20 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Payment stops being income 22 23 24 Date we expect the next payment to be treated as received 25 26 27 28 When an out-of-cycle payment stops being treated as income An out-of-cycle child support payment stops being income on the Sunday before the date that is the same date in the next calendar month as the deemed receipt date of the payment. Example 4: When out-of-cycle payments stops being income Inland Revenue makes a child support payment of $100 on 8 November 2023 to Maggie. This is an out-of-cycle payment as the payment is not made on the in-cycle payment date of 21 November (two business days after 19 November). The payment is treated as being received on the next business day, which is 9 November. The payment starts being income from the Monday of the week the payment is treated as being received – 6 November. The same date in the next calendar month as the deemed receipt date of the payment is 9 December. The payment stops being income on the Sunday before this date – 3 December. If the same date in the next calendar month is a Sunday, the payment still stops being income on the Sunday the week before this date. Therefore, the period the child support payment would be treated as income would start on 6 November and end on 3 December. There are four benefit payments between these dates. Therefore, the child support payment of $100 would be divided by four. MSD would treat $25 of child support as Maggie’s income for each week during this period. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 21 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 6 Payment starts being income 7 8 Out-of- cycle payment made and MSD notified 9 Date treated as being received 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 1 2 3 Payment stops being income 4 5 6 7 8 9 Same day in the following month 10 If the date in the next calendar month does not exist, the “same” date will be the 1st of the following month. Example 5: Out-of-cycle payments – no date in the next calendar month A child support payment is treated as being received on 31 August. As there is no 31 September, the “same” date would be 1 October. The rest of the rules for treating child support as income would apply as described above. Fortnightly benefits The period of entitlement for fortnightly benefits runs from Wednesday to Tuesday for two weeks. The benefit payment is made to the beneficiary in the second week of the fortnightly period. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 22 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] When a child support payment starts to be income depends on whether the child support is treated as being received in the first week or the second week of the fortnight. A payment is treated as received on the business day after Inland Revenue notifies MSD that the payment has been made to the receiving carer. If the payment is treated as being received in the first week of a fortnight, the payment would be treated as income from the Wednesday on or before the payment is treated as being received. Example 6: Fortnightly benefits – receipt in the first week Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Mon Tue Week 1 16 Payment starts being income 17 18 Payment made and MSD notified 19 20 21 Date treated as being received 22 Week 2 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 If the payment is treated as being received in the second week of a fortnight, the payment would be treated as income from the Wednesday following the date the payment is treated as being received – that is, the beginning of the next fortnight. Example 7: Fortnightly benefits – receipt in the second week Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Mon Tue Week 1 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Payment made and MSD notified Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 23 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Week 2 23 Date treated as being received 24 25 26 27 28 29 Week 1 (next pay period) 30 Payment starts being income 1 2 3 4 5 6 If a person is paid their benefit fortnightly, the child support payment is treated as income for four weeks only. The child support payment is divided by four to get the weekly income amount. Therefore, when a child support payment is made, MSD will work out when the payment will start to be income and spread the child support payment across the next two fortnightly benefits. Whether a payment is an in-cycle or out-of-cycle child support payment is not relevant when benefits are paid fortnightly. Example 8: Fortnightly benefits Kahla receives a fortnightly benefit. One of her benefit payments is for the fortnight from 16 August to 29 August 2023. Inland Revenue makes a $400 child support payment to Kahla on 17 August. The payment is treated as received on the next business day – 18 August. As the payment is treated as received in the first week of the fortnight (16 August to 22 August), the payment is income from 16 August. The child support payment would be treated as income across two fortnight benefit periods. MSD would treat $100 as income for each week in the fortnight from 16 August to 29 August, and $100 for each week in the fortnight from 30 August to 12 September. Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Mon Tue Week 1 16 Payment starts being income 17 Payment made and MSD notified 18 Date treated as being received 19 20 21 22 Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 24 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Week 2 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Week 1 (next fortnight) 30 31 1 2 3 4 5 Week 2 (next fortnight) 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Payment stops being income Transferring between different benefit frequencies When a beneficiary transfers from a weekly benefit to a fortnightly benefit, or vice-versa, the above rules could sometimes result in their benefit being abated more than intended. The amendments include a limited discretion that allows MSD to treat the child support payment as income over a different number of weeks. The intent is for the income to be treated as close as possible to the prescribed rules. However, sometimes a beneficiary may transfer to a benefit with a different payment frequency part way through the period. This means a child support payment could start being income before the new benefit commences. In those circumstances, the beneficiary would not be paid the correct amount of benefit. MSD is not able to rectify the incorrect payment using the discretion outlined above. The amendments therefore also exempt child support payments from being income for benefit and other assistances when all of the following occur:  a beneficiary transfers from a weekly benefit to a fortnightly benefit or vice versa  the child support payment is treated as being received on or after the day of the new benefit, and  the child support payment is treated as income before the day of the new benefit. However, this exemption does not apply to information share child support under the Public and Community Housing Management Act . MSD will continue to have discretion to assess whether information share child support is assessable income, or a cash asset, for social housing and income-related rent, as no automated charging is occurring. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 25 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 9: Transferring between benefits – child support exemption Barry moves from a fortnightly benefit to a weekly benefit on Tuesday 17 October 2023. Inland Revenue notifies MSD of a child support payment on Thursday 19 October. The payment would be treated as received on Friday 20 October. If Barry was on a weekly benefit for the whole period, his child support income would have been treated as income from Monday 16 October. However, Barry’s weekly benefit did not begin until Tuesday 17 October, which means this child support payment would be treated as income before the day the new benefit starts. The child support payment received by Barry is exempt income and will not be income for benefit purposes. Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 16 Payment would normally start being income 17 New weekly benefit begins 18 19 Payment made and MSD notified 20 Date treated as being received 21 22 How child support payments are treated in specific situations Temporary break in benefits Information share child support payments will continue to be treated as income even when there is a temporary break in the receiving carer’s assistance and they resume receiving an assistance in the same income-charging period (that is, in the four- or five- week period the child support is income for). This may be the resumption of the assistance they were receiving prior to the break, or they may be paid a new type of assistance. The temporary break in the receiving carer’s assistance may be for any reason, whether it is suspended, expired or cancelled. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 26 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 10: Temporary break in benefits Tama receives an information share child support payment that is income over four weeks from 25 September to 22 October. On 5 October, Tama’s benefit is suspended because he temporarily leaves New Zealand. Tama returns to New Zealand on 10 October and his benefit resumes. Tama’s information share child support payment continues to be income while he is overseas, but his benefit is suspended during this time, so this income does not affect his entitlement. Child support received during a benefit suspension or expiry In the previous scenario, information share child support payments received before a temporary break in a person’s assistance continue to be income during the temporary break to ensure the correct amount of child support is income if and when the assistance resumes. For the same reason, information share child support payments received during a temporary break continue to be income so that the correct amount of child support is taken into account when the assistance resumes. This will only apply when the assistance is suspended or expired. This is because a cancelled assistance is not an active record with MSD so the child support payment information provided by Inland Revenue cannot be matched to this client. Example 11: Child support received while an assistance is suspended or expired Tama receives Jobseeker Support. On 5 October, he temporarily leaves New Zealand and MSD suspends his benefit. Tama receives an information share child support payment on 11 October, while his benefit is suspended. In line with the new income rules, MSD will divide this child support and allocate the payment as income across the next four weeks till 5 November. Tama returns to New Zealand on 17 October and his Jobseeker Support resumes. Because the new income rules are applied to Tama’s child support while his assistance was suspended, MSD can apply the correct amount of child support income to his assistance. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 27 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] General provisions child support payments Child support paid to UCB beneficiaries and mixed child support payments UCB excess (the amount of child support paid to the receiving carer after the cost of their benefit has been recovered) is only income for Temporary Additional Support, Special Benefit and Childcare Assistance. This is because the cost of the UCB has been recovered by retaining child support. A “mixed child support payment” refers to when a receiving carer is paid child support and the payment is for a child for whom UCB is paid and another child for whom UCB is not paid (and so child support is not retained). It is not possible to determine the amount of the payment that relates to each child to apply different income rules to the payment. Therefore, MSD will treat the entire child support payment as a UCB excess. This treatment is to ensure the person is not negatively impacted. Because mixed child support payments would have only been income for some benefits, it is not appropriate to apply the new income rules. Example 12: Child support payments for more than one child when UCB is paid for some of those children Hayden is assessed to pay $200 a month of child support to Jess for Oliver, for whom Jess is also receiving a UCB. Hayden is also assessed to pay Jess $200 a month of child support for Liam. Jess is not receiving UCB for Liam. This month, Hayden only pays $280 instead of the full $400. The entire child support payment would be treated as if it were UCB excess. This means the $280 paid by Hayden would only be treated as income for determining Jess’s entitlement to Temporary Additional Support, Special Benefit and Childcare Assistance. Other general provisions child support payments Court-ordered child support payments Payments ordered by a Family Court and foreign child support payments will continue to be treated as income under the general income rules, which means these payments will be processed manually and MSD will have discretion over which periods to allocate these payments to. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 28 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This is because the discretionary rules are considered more appropriate for determining the relevant periods for which these payments should be treated as income. Backdated benefit payments An information share child support payment is excluded from being income if the beneficiary has applied for a benefit, and that benefit is backdated to an earlier date, but they were not receiving income-tested assistance from MSD at the time Inland Revenue makes the child support payment to them. However, this exemption will not apply to information share child support under the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992. MSD will continue to have discretion to assess whether information share child support is assessable income, or a cash asset, for social housing and income-related rent, because no automated charging is occurring. Example 13: Backdated benefits Jack receives a child support payment on 6 September 2023. H e was not receiving any benefit or assistance from MSD at the time. Jack decides to apply for financial assistance and does so on 20 September. MSD determines that Jack was entitled to Sole Parent Support from 30 August. Although Jack received a child support payment on 6 September 2023, and his benefit commenced on 30 August, Jack received this payment before MSD’s decision to grant him Sole Parent Support. This child support payment is therefore not income and does not abate his Sole Parent Support. Child support received from 20 September will be income (unless other exemptions apply) and may abate Jack’s Sole Parent Support. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 29 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Limited ability to review child support income Sections 304, 304A and 418 of the Social Security Act 2018 MSD’s power to review a past benefit period does not apply to information share child support payments unless a specified circumstance applies. Background MSD has broad powers that allow it to review a person’s benefit entitlement. This power is necessary for MSD to ensure beneficiaries receive their full and correct entitlement. Child support amounts assessed by Inland Revenue may change. This may be due to a change in either parent’s circumstances coming to light after the fact. In such cases, MSD ordinarily uses its broad powers to review the receiving carer’s benefit. However, such reviews increase income uncertainty for beneficiaries and contribute toward families incurring benefit debt. Key features The use of MSD’s review power for child support payments is limited to specified scenarios. This ensures child support payments are almost always spread forward, which reduces the likelihood of debt, and ensures that child support payments are treated as income in a way that best reflects money that the beneficiary has available. Example 14: Limited ability to review Elaine was receiving child support for her two children, Chloe and Claire. When Chloe left her care, Elaine did not tell Inland Revenue immediately. When she finally told Inland Revenue, her child support was recalculated from the date Chloe left her care. Elaine now has a child support debt. Despite Elaine’s child support assessment being reduced, MSD will not go back and change the amount of child support that was previously treated as income for Elaine. This is because Elaine still received and had use of the amount of child support that was treated as income at the time. However, if Elaine’s circumstances result in her child support assessment being increased, the increased child support will only be income when it is received. MSD will not retrospectively review her benefit for periods the child support relates to. However, there are circumstances under which MSD should be able to review child support income for a past period. Section 304A sets out the circumstances under which MSD is able Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 30 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] to review child support income and amend the amount that was previously treated as income:  Inland Revenue makes a payment of child support to a beneficiary, and MSD is later notified either by the beneficiary or by Inland Revenue that the beneficiary has not received the payment or not received it by the deemed receipt date.  MSD is satisfied, in exceptional circumstances, that a person cannot access their child support payment.  An error has occurred in the administration of how a child support payment has been treated as income. These include situations where the information shared is incorrect due to Inland Revenue error, or where the information is read incorrectly by MSD’s system or was input incorrectly due to human error.  A beneficiary has been incorrectly identified or is not identified at all as the proper recipient of the payment.  MSD receives the information shared by Inland Revenue late, or the information is provided late.  When a beneficiary has died and they receive a child support payment after their death, because a beneficiary’s benefit entitlement cannot change after they have died. This would allow MSD to amend a beneficiary’s entitlement as necessary. Example 15: Circumstances where MSD will review Barret receives $200 child support each month. One month, Inland Revenue makes a payment of child support to Barret’s bank account. However, an issue with the bank’s processes means Barret did not receive his child support. Because Inland Revenue has notified MSD of the payment, MSD treats Barret as having received income of $50 per week for the next four weeks. Barret notifies MSD that he has not received his child support. After confirming this, MSD can go back and remove the child support income that is on his record. Once MSD has confirmed that the payment has been processed by Barret’s bank, the child support income will be added to his record from when it is processed. New review grounds can be added via regulations if they are identified. This allows new scenarios to be reviewed in a timely manner. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 31 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Deprivation of income Clauses 16 and 17 of schedule 3 of the Social Security Act 2018 A person choosing not to enter into a child support arrangement or to cancel an existing arrangement is not considered to be depriving themselves of income. Background One of the principles underlying the Social Security Act 2018 is that people should use the resources available to them before seeking financial support. When someone has changed their position to put themselves at a financial disadvantage, and this leads to them qualifying for assistance, or assistance at a higher rate, this is considered “deprivation”. Deprivation can apply regardless of whether this was intentional. When MSD is satisfied that deprivation has occurred, it may refuse to grant a benefit, cancel or reduce a benefit already granted, or grant a benefit at a reduced rate. Key features The requirement for parents receiving a sole parent rate of main benefit to apply for child support through Inland Revenue has been removed. Therefore, a parent newly eligible for a benefit may choose not to apply for child support. In addition, existing beneficiaries who previously had to apply for child support through Inland Revenue may choose to cancel their child support. Treating these decisions as deprivation would defeat the purpose of the proposed policies. A person choosing not to apply for child support, or to cancel an existing child support arrangement, will not be considered to be depriving themselves of income. This exclusion applies to all forms of child support, including private arrangements that Inland Revenue does not administer. This change does not apply to UCB beneficiaries (see “ Amendments do not apply to people receiving an Unsupported Child’s Benefit” above). Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 32 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Stand downs Regulation 182 of the Social Security Regulations 2018 All child support paid to a person under the Child Support Act 1991 (excluding an amount that MSD has determined is capital) will be considered when calculating the person’s stand- down period. Background Most main benefits are subject to an initial income stand-down period. The stand-down period is either one or two weeks after the date a person becomes entitled to the benefit. The period depends on the person’s circumstances and their average income determined over an “average income calculation period”. Key features All child support paid under the Child Support Act 1991 that a person receives over the relevant period would be included in their “average income” for calculating the stand-down period. This includes excess child support paid to an Unsupported Child’s Benefit beneficiary. An amount that MSD determines is capital is excluded. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 33 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Cash asset test Clauses 1 and 2, and Parts 35 to 37 of schedule 8 of the Social Security Act 2018 and regulation 3(1) of the Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) Regulations 2018 Information share child support payments are exempted from being a cash asset for the period the payment is income for benefit purposes. After this period, any unspent child support could be included in a cash asset test. The initial exemption period could be extended by an additional 28 days in exceptional circumstances. Background The Accommodation Supplement and Temporary Additional Support are subject to a cash asset test. This means that MSD considers a person’s cash assets (such as savings) when working out their benefit entitlement. If a person has cash assets over a set threshold, they cannot receive these benefits. This test is to ensure that people use the resources available to them before receiving assistance. MSD’s practice is generally to treat payments as a cash asset from the time they are received. Child support payments are intended to support the child for four or five weeks after they are received. Treating child support payments as a cash asset from the time they are received is incompatible with this intent. If the cash asset tests continue to apply to child support payments, receiving carers would be penalised for spending the child support payment over the period it is intended for. Key features Child support payments are exempt from the cash asset test for the period the payments are income for benefit purposes. MSD also has the discretion to extend this period by an additional 28 days in exceptional circumstances. After the exemption expires, any unspent child support payment could be included in a cash asset test. However, the cash asset exemption will not apply to information share child support under the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992. MSD will continue to have discretion to assess whether information share child support is assessable income, or a cash asset, for social housing and income-related rent, as no automated charging is occurring. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 34 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Abatement of youth and young parent payments Part 6 of schedule 4 of the Social Security Act 2018 The abatement regime of the youth payment (YP) and the young parent payment (YPP) have been amended so that child support passed on continues to abate those payments at the relevant rate instead of causing the recipient to lose their payment altogether. Background YP and YPP have an abatement regime where a person’s weekly income starts to abate once it exceeds a specified threshold. Once the person’s weekly income exceeds a second, higher threshold, the payments stop altogether. This is to encourage the young person to further their education or training. With child support being passed on, a receiving carer could lose their benefit if their weekly income exceeds the second threshold. Example 16: Abatement of YP and YPP Rydia is receiving YPP of $440.96 a week. Her weekly income is $298.08 per week. Her YPP is abated $1 for every $1 that her weekly income exceeds $258.08 (the first threshold), meaning her YPP is abated by $40. This reduces her YPP to $400.96 per week. Rydia starts receiving child support of $20 per week, therefore her weekly income increases to $318.08. Under previous rules, she would no longer be eligible for YPP as her weekly income now exceeds $308.08 (the second threshold). Key features A person no longer loses their YP or YPP immediately if their weekly income exceeds the second threshold because of a child support payment passed on by Inland Revenue. Rather, the child support income would continue to abate their benefit at the rate of $1 for every $1 for single persons, and $0.50 for every $1 for couples. If a person’s income from all other sources exceeds the second threshold, they lose their YP or YPP. To achieve this result, income from employment and other sources is considered against the thresholds before any abatement for child support payments passed on by Inland Revenue is undertaken. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 35 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 17: Proposed YP/YPP abatement rules for child support payments Kain has $298.08 weekly income and receives an abated YPP of $400.96 per week. Kain starts receiving child support of $20 per week and his weekly income increases to $318.08. Kain would have his YPP abated by a further $20 to $380.96 per week instead of losing his YPP altogether. However, the abatement rules only apply to child support payments passed on by Inland Revenue. Therefore, if Kain’s weekly income excluding any child support payments (for example, wages) exceeded $308.08, he would lose his eligibility for YPP. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 36 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Child support as an allowable cost Schedule 1 of the Social Security Act 2018 and regulation 71 of the Social Security Regulations 2018 Child support liabilities assessed by Inland Revenue are an “allowable cost” for determining a liable parent’s Temporary Additional Support (TAS). This amendment also extends to Special Benefit (SpB) through an amendment made to the Ministerial Direction. People already receiving TAS and SpB on 1 July 2023 can have these costs backdated (taken into account) to the later of 1 July or the date they become liable for child support. They must apply on or before 29 September 2023 to have the costs backdated. Background TAS and SpB are forms of hardship assistance paid to people who do not have enough income to meet their “essential costs”. Essential costs are made up of a person’s “allowable costs” and “standard costs”. Allowable costs are regular, essential, and unavoidable expenses that cannot be reduced. Key features MSD will consider formula-assessed child support liability as an allowable cost when determining a liable parent’s entitlement to TAS or SpB. This does not extend to voluntary agreements or private arrangements of child support because they do not meet MSD’s standard of regular, essential and unavoidable expenses. Backdating Allowable costs usually cannot be backdated. However, to support MSD with the expected increase in contacts from TAS and SpB recipients, MSD is temporarily allowed to backdate formula-assessed child support liabilities as an allowable cost. Backdating is available for clients who are already receiving TAS or SpB on 1 July 2023 and allows their child support liability to be backdated as an allowable cost to either 1 July 2023 or the date on which they become liable to pay child support – whichever is later. However, these beneficiaries will need to apply to MSD on or before 29 September 2023. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 37 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Amendments to the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 38 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Child support payments treated as income: housing and income-r elated rent Section 2 and 115A of the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 and regulation 14 of the Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) Regulations 2018 Prescribed types of child support payments are excluded as income when determining a person’s eligibility for public housing, rating on the Public Housing Register, and for determining the rate of income-related rent payable. Background For public housing (eligibility, rating on the Public Housing Register and rates of income- related rent), child support payments are treated as income, similar to main benefits and assistance under the Social Security Act 2018. Key features Prescribed types of child support payments are excluded as income when determining a person’s eligibility for public housing, rating on the Public Housing Register, and for determining the rate of income-related rent payable. The same child support payment types that are excluded as income for main benefits under the Social Security Act 2018 are also excluded as income when determining a person’s eligibility for public housing, rating on the Public Housing Register and the rate of income- related rent payable. When Inland Revenue shares child support payment information with MSD, a person’s duty to declare a change in their circumstances is satisfied unless the information is incorrect. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 39 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Deprivation of income: income-related rent Section 112 of the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 A person choosing not to enter into a child support arrangement or to cancel an existing arrangement is not considered to be depriving themselves of income. Background When someone has changed their financial arrangements to put themselves at a financial disadvantage, and this leads to them paying a lower rate of income-related rent than they otherwise would, this is considered “deprivation of income”. This can apply regardless of whether the change in their position was intentional. In these situations, MSD is authorised to include all or a portion of the deprived income when determining the rate of income-related rent payable. This is to reflect the income that would have been assessed had the person not deprived themselves of income. Key features Parents newly eligible for a benefit can choose not to apply for child support. In addition, existing beneficiaries who previously had to apply for child support through Inland Revenue can choose to cancel their child support. Treating these decisions as deprivation would defeat the purpose of removing the requirement for sole parents to apply for child support (see “Deprivation of income ” above). This exclusion applies to all forms of child support, including private arrangements that Inland Revenue does not administer. Child Support (Pass On) Acts Amendment Act 2023 Page 40 of 42 Special report: Public Act 2023/27 | June 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] A person’s duty to advise of a change in circumstances Section 115A of the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 A person’s duty to declare a change in circumstances is satisfied if a child support payment made to the person is disclosed to MSD by Inland Revenue under their approved information sharing agreement. Background Under the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992, a person is required to promptly advise MSD of any change in household circumstances that is likely to result in:  the payment of a higher income-related rent  no longer needing, or being eligible for, public housing. This ensures a person’s income-related rent, eligibility for public housing and priority rating on the Public Housing Register is reflective of their circumstances and current income. Key features A person’s duty to declare a change in circumstances (such as an increase in their child support income) is satisfied if that change is already being communicated to MSD by Inland Revenue. This prevents a person being at risk of benefit debt if they had not declared their changes (despite the information sharing between MSD and Inland Revenue). There may be rare circumstances where the payment details in the information share are incorrect, and the person will need to advise MSD of the error. The person’s obligation to declare a change in circumstances remains if:  MSD is notified of the change via the information share, and  MSD notifies the person of the information share child support payment, and  the person considers the information share is incorrect and does not promptly dispute the correctness of the information. This avoids MSD referring to an incorrect amount of child support when determining a person’s rate of income-related rent, eligibility for public housing or their rating on the Public Housing Register.

NEW LEGISLATION > ACT > SPECIAL REPORT Tax relief for North Island flooding events Issued: 4 April 2023 Public Act 2023 No 5 This special report provides early information on the provisions that provide tax relief for certain payments and benefits provided by employers to employees who have been affected by the North Island flooding events included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 ahead of an upcoming edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 2 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Contents Tax relief for employers’ welfare contributions to employees ..................................................... 3 Effective date ........................................................................................................................................ 3 Background ........................................................................................................................................... 3 Detailed analysis .................................................................................................................................. 4 What is a North Island flooding event ? ..................................................................................... 4 Income tax exemption ..................................................................................................................... 5 Fringe benefit tax exemption ......................................................................................................... 8 Projects of limited duration ........................................................................................................... 10 About this document .............................................................................................................................. 11 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 3 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Tax relief for employers’ welfare contributions to employees Changes included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 provide an exemption for certain welfare contributions made by an employer to employees because of the North Island flooding events. The exemption may be applied to:  accommodation  “sundry” fringe benefits when the employer cannot reasonably estimate which employees received which benefits, and  the first $5,000 of monetary remuneration and fringe benefits of the kind where the employer can reasonably be expected to know which employees received which benefits. A further change extends the definition of “project of limited duration” for projects that are recovering and rebuilding the affected areas. Effective date The exemption for certain welfare contributions applies to payments made within an eight- week period from the beginning of the relevant North Island flooding event. The extended definition of “project of limited duration” applies where the employee starts work at the distant workplace within six months of the first date of the relevant North Island flooding event. Background Under existing tax law (with a few limited exclusions), payments and benefits provided by an employer to an employee are taxable, either as monetary remuneration or by way of fringe benefit tax (FBT). Following the North Island flooding events, employers may make ex-gratia welfare contributions of cash or benefits to their flood-affected employees. As was done for the Canterbury earthquakes, the current changes provide for certain amounts and benefits not to be subject to income tax or FBT. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 4 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 The changes comprise inter-linked tax exemptions for employers and their employees for North Island flood-related employer welfare contributions. Detailed analysis What is a North Island flooding event ? A new definition of “North Island flooding events” has been added to section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and means: (a) Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 8 January 2023 and ending on 12 January 2023, in 1 or more of the following districts: (i) Coromandel: (ii) Gisborne: (iii) Northland: (iv) Wairarapa: (v) Wairoa: (b) heavy rainfall starting on 26 January 2023 and ending on 3 February 2023, in 1 or more of the following regions: (i) Auckland: (ii) Bay of Plenty: (iii) Northland: (iv) Waikato: (c) Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period starting on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023, in 1 or more of the following regions or districts: (i) Auckland: (ii) Bay of Plenty: (iii) Gisborne: (iv) Hawke’s Bay: (v) Northland: (vi) Tararua: (vii) Waikato. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 5 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Income tax exemption New section CZ 23B of the ITA provides that income (which can include accommodation benefits) derived by an employee from an employer is exempt income if:  it is provided by the employer for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of a North Island flooding event  it would otherwise be assessable income  it is derived in the eight-week period beginning on the first day of the relevant North Island flooding event  it does not replace a PAYE income payment, that is, it is not paid in substitution for wages or salary  it does not depend on the seniority of the employee  if the employee is associated with the employer, it is also available to an unrelated full-time employee, and  the employer treats the income as being exempt income of the employee. Extent of the exemption Income that satisfies the above criteria is exempt income to the extent it is:  an accommodation benefit as defined in section CE 1(2), and/or  less than or equal to $5,000 in total, if the income is in a form other than accommodation (including fringe benefits under new section CZ 24B). Frequently Asked Questions This section deals with several questions we have been asked about the application of new section CZ 23B. The new provision mirrors the provisions that were enacted following the Canterbury Earthquakes, with modifications for the different event and the quantum of the amount paid. How was the $5,000 determined? This figure was based on the amount used for the Canterbury Earthquakes, increased by wage inflation over the period since the earthquakes and rounded to $5,000. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 6 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 How was the eight-week period determined? This is the same period as that used for the Canterbury Earthquake provisions. What does the criterion “ does not depend on the seniority of the employee” mean? This restriction is aimed at ensuring that relief payments are not targeted at more senior employees. This could occur in two ways:  when payments are only made to senior employees, or  when senior employees are paid higher payments than lower-level employees. We expect an employer is likely to make identical payments to employees who have been affected by the flooding events, although they may scale payments depending on the scale of the damage suffered by different employees. In either case, it is unlikely that the payment is in substitution for salary and wages. The more linked the payment is to the employee’s salary or status, the more likely the payment is in substitution for other PAYE payments. What if an “accommodation” benefit is provided in cash? The exemption covers accommodation provided to an employee with no monetary limit, whereas there is a maximum amount payable for monetary benefits that are not accommodation. However, some accommodation benefits are paid in cash (that is, as an allowance or reimbursement) rather than as the provision of accommodation directly to an employee. Under the ITA there is no difference between the taxation treatments of the provision of accommodation and the provision of a reimbursement for accommodation costs in the form of allowances. The same applies to this relief, and therefore “accommodation” includes both the provision of accommodation and the provision of an accommodation allowance. Example 1: Payment of accommodation allowance Grovers Grapes Limited (GGL) has been adversely affected by the flooding in the Hawkes Bay area. Its grape vines have been badly damaged. It is a family-owned business that has several long-serving staff (including some family members) who live in dwellings near the property. Those dwellings have been substantially damaged by the flooding and are not currently liveable. Gene Grover, the owner of GGL, tells her staff to find alternative accommodation and advises that the company will provide the staff with an accommodation allowance until the staff can get back to some sense of normality after the impact of the flooding. GGL Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 7 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 pays an accommodation allowance to its staff for 8 weeks. All employees have the same entitlement, and therefore it is not relevant that some payments were made to associated family members of Gene. The staff (including the family members) can treat the accommodation allowance paid as exempt income as it meets the requirements of new section CZ 23B(2)(a). No limit will apply to the amount as it is the provision of accommodation and thus the $5,000 limit will not apply. What if an employer made payments before the Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) being released ? New section CZ 23B was originally introduced into the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 by way of SOP No 319 on 14 March 2023. One of the requirements of the new section is that the payment has been treated by the employer as being exempt income of the employee. Given the timing of the floods and the release of the SOP, some employers may have provided amounts to their employees before the SOP was released and conservatively treated those payments as taxable to the employee and accounted for PAYE on those amounts. The section does not prevent those taxpayers from reversing that treatment to treat those previous payments as exempt, as there is no requirement that the payment is treated as exempt at the time the payment was made. If an employer has treated eligible payments made before the release of the SOP as taxable, they should reverse that treatment for the employee as an error correction to a previous employer information return provided. For payments made before 31 March 2023, employers should ensure that an employer information return filed before 31 March 2023 is corrected to ensure that the right amount of income is treated as tax exempt in the correct tax year. The requirement is designed to prevent asymmetry of the payments where the employer deducts PAYE from a non-flood-related payment and the recipient claims back the PAYE paid as an additional benefit. It is not designed to prevent employers from being able to treat the payment as exempt due to timing. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 8 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Example 2: Payment before release of the SOP B&E Wines Limited (B&E) has a large operation in one of the areas affected by the North Island flooding events. The company has several staff who have been working for it for a long period. When the floods hit, Bert and Ernie, the owners of B&E, want to provide immediate help to their employees, so they pay them all an ex-gratia payment of $4,000 per employee. They pay PAYE on 20 February 2023 as they are unsure if the government will be enacting a tax exemption for those payments. B&E makes this payment to around 100 employees. Once the SOP is released, the company decides to amend the treatment of the payments in the employer information return for the period including 20 February 2023 to treat them as exempt payments. As the employer has treated those payments as exempt, and all the other requirements of section CZ 23B have been met, the payments can be treated as exempt income. Example 3: Asymmetry of payments In July 2023, Devon decides to file a personal tax return for the year ended 31 March 2023. Devon lives in Esk Valley and, while at the pub one night, heard from a mate that $5,000 is available tax free if he lives in an affected area. He just needs to file his tax return on that basis by reducing the employment income figure Inland Revenue holds for him by $5,000. Devon’s employer, Monty Enterprises Limited, didn’t provide any specific support payments for its staff. Inland Revenue will not accept the reduction in employment income as Monty Enterprises Limited has not made a payment eligible for the exemption. For an amount to be tax exempt, all the criteria in section CZ 23B must be satisfied, including the employer treating a payment as exempt. Fringe benefit tax exemption New section CZ 24B of the ITA provides that a benefit received by an employee from an employer is exempt from FBT if:  it is for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the effects of a North Island flooding event Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 9 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023  it would otherwise be a fringe benefit  it is received in the eight-week period beginning on the first day of the relevant North Island flooding event  it does not replace a PAYE income payment, that is, it is not paid in substitution for wages or salary  it does not depend on the seniority of the employee  if the employee is associated with the employer, it is also available to an unrelated full-time employee, and  the employer treats the benefit as not being a fringe benefit. Extent of the exemption All “sundry benefits” are exempt – for example, benefits that were provided at a drop-in centre. Almost always in that case, an employer would have no idea which employee had received what benefits. Accordingly, if the employer cannot estimate the value of the benefits provided to each employee, they are treated as exempt. If the employer can estimate the value of a benefit that an employee has received for a North Island flooding event, t he benefit will be exempt from FBT to the extent that the $5,000 employee income exemption for the North Island flooding event under new section CZ 23B has not been used to exempt employee income. Example 4: Sundry benefits Big T’s Tech Limited (BTT) is a retail chain that has branches all around the Northland area. BTT’s stores have largely been unaffected by the flooding, but many of its staff have been affected. BTT decides to distribute their remaining stock of satellite internet dishes to drop-in centres around the Northland area. As BTT’s staff live in the Northland area and many have lost all forms of communication, some end up going to the drop-in centres to access the internet and call family and friends. The provision of the internet dishes may constitute a fringe benefit to those staff. However, as BTT has no ability to track which employees are using the benefit, or to determine the value of that benefit, it will be exempt from fringe benefit tax as a sundry benefit under new section CZ 24B(3). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 10 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 Example 5: Specific benefit Liz is an employee of Fowlers Fencing Limited (FFL), which is a fencing company based in Gisborne. Liz is a keen cyclist and travels to work and most other places on her e- bike. She has access to a work ute during the day to allow her to travel to worksites and carry fencing materials. No private use of the vehicle is permitted, and the vehicle is locked in a garage at FFL’s premises during the evenings and at weekends. Liz lives in a rural area that was hit hard by the North Island flooding events. Due to the damage to roading and the loss of her e-bike to the floods, she is unable to get around. Josh, the owner of FFL, allows Liz to use the work ute to travel to and from home as well as to assist her neighbours in the clean-up of their properties. This private use of the vehicle would usually incur fringe benefit tax. FFL also provided a cash payment of $500 to each of its staff that has been paid as exempt income under section CZ 23B. FFL can treat the provision of the vehicle as exempt from FBT up to the value of $4,500 (as the maximum collective amount of exempt cash and fringe benefits permitted is $5,000). Projects of limited duration New section CZ 29B of the ITA provides for a modified definition of “projects of limited duration” for projects related to the North Island flooding events to recognise the extended timeframes which those rebuilding projects could take. The value provided or expenditure incurred by an employer on accommodation for employees working on those projects is exempt income of the employees. The provision applies for the purposes of section CW 16B (Accommodation expenditure: out- of-town secondments and projects) when:  the employment duties of an employee require them to work on a project of limited duration for rebuilding or recovery in areas affected by the North Island flooding events, and  the distant workplace is a workplace in the areas affected by the North Island flooding events. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 Page 11 of 11 Special report Public Act 2023 No 5 | 4 April 2023 The usual 3-year time limit in the definition of “project of limited duration” is extended to 5 years if the employee starts work within 6 months of the first date of the relevant flooding event. The section also includes an ability for the time limits to be modified by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. As it is not known how long the recovery and rebuild process will take, this allows for the time limit to be extended if necessary. Example 6: Extended time limit Kaitlyn’s Kontractors Limited (KKL) provides contracting services, primarily road building. They have a large plant based in Northland that services the area. They also have a plant based in Palmerston North that services the lower North Island. In May 2023, with the need to assist in rebuilding the roading infrastructure in the Northland area, Kaitlyn asks 20 of the Palmerston North crew to relocate to Northland to assist with the work for the foreseeable future. Kaitlyn provides those employees with accommodation in Northland for the duration of the project, which is expected to be 4 to 5 years. The exemption in section CZ 29B will apply to treat the provision of that accommodation as exempt income (subject to the other criteria in section CW 16B being satisfied 1 ). About this document Special reports are published shortly after new legislation is enacted or Orders in Council are made to help affected taxpayers and their advisors understand the consequences of the changes. These are published in advance of an article in the Tax Information Bulletin. 1 See https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/operational-statements/2021/os-21-01 for an outline of the requirements of section CW 16B.
