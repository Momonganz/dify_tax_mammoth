These people or entities are referred to in this paper as “related parties”. 1.3 In particular, this paper considers debt remission in situations when there is no change of ownership of the debtor, or the net wealth of the “owner”. A debt remission within a wholly owned group of companies is a very common example of this. The company that advanced the loan (the creditor) suffers a loss, while the other company that borrowed the money (the debtor) has a corresponding gain but overall, there is no change in ownership of the companies, or in the owners’ wealth. 1.4 Under present tax law, debt remission in these circumstances produces taxable income to the debtor, but usually no tax deduction is available to the creditor. Until recently, this asymmetric tax outcome was commonly avoided by the debtor issuing equity to the creditor to “satisfy” the debt obligation. 1.5 However, an interpretation by Inland Revenue has indicated that these debt capitalisations may sometimes be considered to be tax avoidance and if so they are taxed as a debt remission. (See the Appendix.) 1.6 As well as the group company scenario, other relevant scenarios seemingly subject to the debt remission rules (either directly or potentially via the anti- avoidance analysis and reconstruction) include:  debt remission between an overseas parent and its wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary; and  shareholder or partner debt advanced to a company or partnership (which term includes look-through companies and limited partnerships), where the debt is remitted pro-rata to ownership. Policy proposals 1.7 The Government has agreed, subject to confirmation following this consultation, to the following core proposal: 2 there should be no debt remission income for the debtor when the debtor and the creditor are in the New Zealand tax base, including controlled foreign company (CFC) debtors; and  they are members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or  the debtor is a company or partnership; and - all of the relevant debt remitted is owed to shareholders or partners in the debtor; and - if we presume that if the debt remitted was instead capitalised, there would be no dilution of ownership of the debtor following the remission and all owners’ proportionate ownership in the debtor is unchanged. 1.8 Again, subject to confirmation after consultation, the Government has agreed that the core proposal apply from the commencement of the 2006–07 tax year. Inland Revenue’s operational approach 1.9 Given the decision made by the Government, Inland Revenue will not, pending the outcome of the policy process, be devoting resources to determine whether there is any debt remission income arising in the situations described at paragraph 1.7. Outstanding policy issue – inbound investment 1.10 When the owner/creditor is a non-resident, the use of related-party inbound debt is a key BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) concern. Continuing to tax debt remission in this case may dissuade non-residents from over-gearing to begin with. On the other hand, leaving the present tax outcomes in place could also dissuade non-residents from reducing gearing levels. 1.11 Officials’ current conclusion for inbound investment is that more work is needed, and this work is ongoing. However, submissions on this are welcome. Technical matters 1.12 A number of second-tier technical issues have also been identified. These are discussed in this paper. 1.13 We believe that the core proposal has no fiscal effect as debt remission income in the past did not arise because taxpayers used debt capitalisation instead. 3 Submissions 1.14 Submissions on this paper should be made by 14 April 2015 and can be addressed to: Debt remission C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Debt remission” in the subject line. 1.15 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 4 CHAPTER 2 Current tax policy and law 2.1 Debt can be remitted when the debtor:  is discharged from making remaining payments;  is insolvent or liquidated;  enters into a deed of composition with its creditors that results in full remission; or  has no obligation to make payments when, because of the passage of time, the debt is irrecoverable or unenforceable. 2.2 Section EW 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that these remissions (and some other scenarios) can trigger a section EW 31 base price adjustment (BPA). 1 2.3 Under Inland Revenue’s Office of the Chief Tax Counsel’s anti-avoidance analysis (see the Appendix), debt can also be deemed to be remitted when there is a debt capitalisation. This is further discussed below. The debtor 2.4 Under the financial arrangement rules, a remission of debt owing results in income to the debtor. As stated in the December 1997 discussion document, Taxation of Financial Arrangements, at paragraph 11.3: The purpose of the debt remission rules is to recognise the fact that the forgiveness of a debt increases the wealth of the debtor. This should, as with all other gains under a financial arrangement, be brought to tax. 2.5 This outcome was considered and reaffirmed as part of the deliberations on the changes to be made as a result of the discussion document and has applied since the enactment of the financial arrangements rules in 1986. 2.6 The section EW 31 BPA produces this remission income as intended. 2.7 This debt remission income is the correct policy outcome when the debt is from a third party, and this is generally accepted by the private sector. Example 1 illustrates the correct outcome of a debt remission. 1 Unless otherwise stated all section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. 5 Example 1 Liquidation or insolvency 2.8 The effect of liquidation or insolvency is that debt remission income is not effectively brought to account for taxation purposes. For companies, the remission income is deemed to arise at the conclusion of the liquidation process. At this stage, the company has ceased to exist by way of being struck off and there is nothing left to pay the tax. Similar analysis applies for insolvency. Refer Example 2. Example 2 2.9 This was contrary to the initial policy intent. 2 An attempt was made to address this in the 1997 discussion document. 3 However, after submissions were considered, it was decided not to proceed because it would dilute the recovery of the general pool of creditors as any resultant tax liability would rank alongside these creditors, rather than after them. Debt parking 2.10 Debt parking rules were introduced as a result of the discussion document. Before this it was not uncommon for an associated person of the debtor to buy distressed debt from the creditor and effectively freeze the arrangement in order to defer or prevent BPA income of the debtor while often providing a bad debt deduction for the original creditor. 4 Example 3 is an illustration of this. 2 Oliver and Glazebrook, pp 109, 110. 3 See paragraphs 11.22 – 22.26. 4 See paragraphs 11.19 – 11.33. Bank has advanced two loans to Jo Ltd. Jo Ltd has significant liquidity problems and, as part of the reconstruction of Jo Ltd, Bank remits one of the loans. Under the BPA, Jo Ltd has financial arrangement income of the amount of the loan remitted. Bank has advanced a loan to Joe Ltd. Joe Ltd has significant problems and is liquidated. Thus the loan is remitted. Under the BPA, Joe Ltd theoretically has financial arrangement income of the amount of the loan remitted. However, in practice, because the remission is deemed to happen immediately after the liquidation is finished, there are no assets left with which to pay any resulting taxation liability. 6 Example 3 Exceptions to the debt remission rule 2.11 There are two legislative exceptions to the general debt remission rule. First, debt forgiven for natural love and affection is deemed to have been fully repaid for BPA purposes. This is typically a family situation and is not within scope of this reform. 2.12 Secondly, when in relation to a financial arrangement, both parties were members of the same consolidated group at all times during the life of the financial arrangement, any remission income under the debtor’s BPA is not taxable. 5 Certain dividends 2.13 Debt remission income derived by a shareholder debtor from a company, even if the shareholder is a member of the same wholly owned group of companies, is taxable as a dividend under sections CD 5(2) and CW 10(4). 2.14 This law is still current, except for a debt remission that qualifies for the exemption provided by the consolidated group debt remission exemption. 6 See Example 4. Example 4 5 Section FM 8(3). 6 Sections CX 60 and FM 8(3). Bank has advanced a loan to Bill Ltd. Bill Ltd develops significant liquidity problems and, as part of the restructuring of Bill Ltd, the owner of Bill Ltd buys the loan from the bank for 40 percent of its face value. This forces a BPA, and Bill Ltd has financial arrangement income of 60 percent of the loan, being the amount effectively remitted. Sub Ltd is wholly owned by Parent Co Ltd. Sub Ltd lends $1 million to Parent Co Ltd and, two years later, remits the debt. Parent Co Ltd is deemed to have derived a taxable dividend equal to the amount remitted. This is because the dividend is explicitly excluded from the wholly owned group inter-corporate dividend exemption. 7 Amalgamations 2.15 The amalgamation rules provide that when amalgamating companies are parties to a financial arrangement, the debtor’s solvency must be taken into account. 7 If the debtor is insolvent, and unlikely to repay the loan, a BPA immediately before the amalgamation is required. Under current policy settings this should produce remission income. OCTC view of the avoidance tax law 2.16 Inland Revenue’s Office of the Chief Tax Council’s (OCTC) finding is that the capitalisation of debt into shares is prima facie tax avoidance in situations when there is no effective change in ownership of the debtor (regardless of whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent). 2.17 Unless this avoidance is found to be merely incidental, the amount of debt capitalised is reconstructed as debt remission income of the debtor. See Example 5. Example 5 2.18 Given the current Inland Revenue view that there is only partial transparency between partners and their partnership or limited partnership, and between shareholders and their look-through company, this OCTC finding potentially has very wide application. See Example 6. Example 6 7 Section FO 18. This is simplified from the example in the QWBA on debt capitalisation. The 100 percent Shareholder has made a $500 loan to Company D. Later, Company D issues $500 more shares to Shareholder and uses the receipt to repay the loan from Shareholder. In the particular circumstances this was found to be tax avoidance and it is reconstructed as the remittance of the $500 loan so Company D derives BPA income of $500. Raewyn and Paul, equal partners in the R & P Partnership, have each advanced $500 to the partnership. In the circumstances, this is treated as a financial arrangement. Later, the R & P Partnership is not trading well and Raewyn and Paul decide to capitalise the debt. Unless the debt remission outcome is merely incidental, the R & P Partnership will derive BPA income of $1,000. 8 2.19 Related parties debt capitalisation has been a very common debt management technique in New Zealand. There are a number of reasons why related parties debt might be capitalised, including:  group reorganisation immediately before the sale of a subsidiary;  reducing a subsidiary’s debt level to a more appropriate level, which may be influenced by thin capitalisation issues if the subsidiary is foreign owned;  supporting a technically insolvent company when the alternative is to liquidate or strike off the company – frequently in this case the parent company has paid off the third-party creditors and often this is what has caused or exacerbated the associated persons debt;  supporting a partnership that has liquidity issues; and  supporting a technically insolvent subsidiary that has to be retained for a period, perhaps because it has given vendor warrantees. 2.20 Anecdotally, when the OCTC avoidance analysis of intra-group debt capitalisations began emerging in about November 2013, intra-group debt capitalisations dropped off rapidly. Currently, insolvent subsidiaries are either liquidated, or, more usually, retained in their insolvent state. Both of these outcomes can have their problems and, in the long term, these approaches do not provide a sustainable solution. The creditor 2.21 When the parties are not associated (using the usual test), the bad debt deduction for the principal depends on what basis the creditor holds the debt. 2.22 If the creditor is in the business of holding or dealing in such debt, the creditor generally obtains a deduction for a bad debt under the bad debt rules. 2.23 If the creditor in not in such a business, they do not get a deduction for the “capital account” loss resulting from the bad debt. Frequently, debt of the sort that is under discussion in this paper will be on “capital account”. Example 7 illustrates this. Example 7 Joe has advanced a loan to his company Joe Ltd. Joe Ltd later has significant liquidity problems. Joe decides to write off the outstanding balance as a bad debt. As Joe is not in the business of holding or dealing in such debt he is not entitled to a bad debt deduction. Alternatively, if Bank had advanced the loan it would be entitled to a bad debt deduction as it would be in the business of holding or dealing in such debt. 9 Associated persons bad debt override 2.24 The business test described above is overridden when the parties are associated. The associated person creditor is explicitly denied a bad debt deduction for the principal of a debt (see section DB 31(3)(c)). Thus, for example, in an intra-group situation, there is no prospect of the creditor obtaining a tax deduction for the principal of a debt. 2.25 The associated persons rule has been in place in one form or another since the financial arrangements rules were introduced in 1986. A shareholder has a choice of investing in a company or partnership by way of debt or equity. Except for situations when the creditor is non-resident or is otherwise outside the tax base, the investors’ debt and equity investment is economically substitutable. The reason for the associated party bad debt prohibition is that allowing a deduction for a bad debt would bias investment towards debt, as by definition all gains will be attributed to the equity investment only, whereas losses can be attributed over both investments. 8 See Example 8. Example 8 2.26 However, associated persons creditors are currently allowed bad debt deductions for “interest” accrued as income that is “bad”. Asymmetric result 2.27 The fundamental point under consideration in this paper is the asymmetric tax result that can arise from related parties debt remission – the creditor is denied a tax deduction, but the debtor, from the same transaction, has taxable income. This is illustrated in Example 9. 8 “The Supplementary Report of the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure”, paragraph 13.247. Using the Example 7 facts, even if Joe was in the business of holding or dealing in these loans, he would still be denied a deduction because of the associated persons override. 10 Example 9 Jill has advanced a $500 loan to her wholly owned company, Jill Ltd, which has made a look-through company election. This loan is treated as a financial arrangement. Later, Jill Ltd has financial difficulties and the loan is remitted. Because of the look-through company election, Jill derives $500 loan remission income from Jill Ltd’s BPA. However, Jill is denied a bad debt deduction because she is an associated person. Thus Jill has look-through company attributed BPA income of $500, and no deduction against this. This is the asymmetric result. 11 CHAPTER 3 Core policy analysis 3.1 When the separate positions of the debtor and the creditor are considered in isolation from each other, it is understandable that we have ended up with the present associated persons asymmetric tax result. 3.2 Alternative suggestions to this debt remission rule were discussed by the Valabh Committee which suggested, among other things: 9 \[to\] retain restrictions on \[associated persons\] bad debts deductibility but remove the inclusion of debt remission income in assessable income. 3.3 No legislative change resulted from this. 3.4 The 1977 discussion document canvassed aspects of debt remission, including associated persons debt remission, but again no legislative changes resulted. 3.5 Alan Judge’s 1997 paper, The accrual rules, prepared for the (then) Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (now known as Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) tax conference that year contains the most comprehensive discussion of debt remission and debt capitalisation and potential avoidance concerns on pages 31–51. The points he made in both the context of associated persons debt remission and more generally include: “The varying treatment of debt remission and extinguishment in different circumstances is unsatisfactory”. 3.6 It seems fair to conclude that policy analysis of the combined result in related party debt remission has not been fully considered until now. Presumably this is because until recently, related party debt capitalisation was understood to be acceptable. Economic consequence of certain related parties debt remission 3.7 Economically, it does not matter how related party debt is remitted – either by direct remission or indirectly via debt capitalisation. As long as the remission or capitalisation is pro rata by owners, or within a wholly owned group of companies, the outcome is the same – there is no net change in the owners’ wealth. 3.8 The best example of this is a wholly owned group of companies, where economically, the consolidated result or wealth of the owners of the group does not change because of a debt remission or debt capitalisation within the group. 9 Operational aspects of the accruals regime,: discussion paper, October 1991, pp 27–38. 12 Debt capitalisation inside a wholly owned group 3.9 Within a wholly owned group of companies, the financial reporting consolidated profit and loss and balance sheet result is the same at NIL. This consolidated financial reporting result directly reflects the economic result of the group as a whole, which is that the net worth or wealth of the group does not change as a result of debt remission where the debt has always been inside the group. See Example 10. Example 10 3.10 Further, if the parties are in the New Zealand tax base, debt and equity are generally economically substitutable. 10 This is certainly the case within a group of companies when viewed from the perspective of the group. 3.11 Within a wholly owned group there is a range of concessions and adjustments for intra-group transactions. Within a consolidated group there are even more. In general, these concessions and adjustments reflect the economic reality that the group (or consolidated group) is one economic unit. 3.12 Examples of these can be illustrated: Intra-group transaction Wholly owned group Consolidated group Dividends Generally exempt Exempt Trading stock, livestock and excepted financial arrangements Intra-group profit not taxed Intra-group profit not taxed Other revenue account property No special rules – intra-group profit taxed Intra-group profit not taxed Financial arrangements Generally symmetric under ordinary rules, but no special treatment except for bad debt deduction prohibition Symmetric Depreciable property No cost base uplift, but depreciation recovered/loss on sale are accounted fo r Transfer at TBV (cost and accumulated depreciation transfer) 10 The imputation regime generally produces this result. Parent Ltd advanced wholly owned Sub Ltd a loan of $500. Sub Ltd’s trading was poor and Parent Ltd had to advance a further loan of $400 so Sub Ltd could pay off its third-party creditors. Sub Ltd now has shareholder funds of negative $900. At this stage Parent Ltd has lost $900 (plus any equity investment in Sub Ltd). Sub Ltd then capitalises the Parent Ltd loan of $900 into more shares. This capitalisation does not change the net wealth of Sub Ltd and Parent Ltd. Parent Ltd and Sub Ltd’s intra-company entries effectively cancel each other upon consolidation. 13 3.13 Some of these results seem to be historical anomalies (for example, “other revenue account property”); others are more deliberate (“financial arrangements”, for example). However, given the general use of the consolidation regime, and the fact that it has never been seriously reviewed, there is no reason not to address apparent inconsistences, such as the rules around intra-group debt remission. 3.14 There also seems to be a public benefit argument – as previously noted, intra- group debt is often advanced to enable an otherwise insolvent subsidiary to pay off its third-party creditors – why should the tax system then penalise any subsequent rationalisation by way of debt remission or capitalisation? 3.15 Another policy question that has been asked is why should the timing of the equity contribution matter? It is not tax avoidance if it is put in at Day 1, but if put in later, it may be tax avoidance. 3.16 When an insolvent subsidiary is liquidated, under current practice the tax policy outcome is that no extra tax is payable – the policy question then arises over why the Income Tax Act should have a bias towards liquidation as an alternative to debt remission or capitalisation. 3.17 We conclude that the asymmetric debt remission tax result should not generally apply in the intra-wholly owned group situation when all companies involved are resident in New Zealand. This is because there is no change in the wealth of the group, and therefore no economic transaction to tax. The proposed outcome is illustrated in Example 11. Example 11 Parent Ltd advanced wholly owned Sub Ltd $500. Sub Ltd’s trading was poor and Parent Ltd had to advance a further $400 so Sub Ltd could pay off its third-party creditors. Sub Ltd now has shareholder funds of negative $900. At this stage Parent Ltd has lost $900 (plus any equity investment in Sub Ltd). Sub Ltd then capitalises the Parent Ltd advance for $900 more shares. Under current tax law, and presuming that the avoidance was not incidental, Sub Ltd would have $900 debt remission income, which would also be the group result as Parent Ltd does not get a bad debt deduction. The proposal put forward in this issues paper is to make the tax outcome symmetric. 14 Other related party debt remission 3.18 Under the OCTC analysis, a key issue on whether debt capitalisation may be reconstructed as debt remission is that the capitalisation does not result in any proportionate change in ownership. From a tax policy perspective, this extends to owners’ debt remission when the remission is pro rata around all owners. Thus other scenarios should be part of the discussion – for example:  a corporate debtor with a non-corporate New Zealand shareholder (individual or trust) who wholly owns his/her/its company and remits debt owing by the company to them; 11  a corporate debtor with pro rata debt and equity held by New Zealand shareholders when the debt is remitted (or capitalised) pro rata;  a pro rata debt advanced by shareholders or partners when the debt is then remitted (or capitalised) pro rata; and  a non-resident corporate shareholder who wholly owns a New Zealand company (or group) when the debt is remitted (or capitalised). 3.19 Other scenarios exist (for example, a non-resident non-corporate with a wholly owned New Zealand company), but analysis of the four scenarios above should provide sufficient information to apply universally. The corporate debtor, non-corporate single New Zealand shareholder scenario 3.20 In this scenario, the shareholder could be an individual or a trust. From the perspective of the shareholder, the shareholder’s economic wealth does not change because they have remitted debt owed to the shareholder by his/hers/its wholly owned company. 3.21 The analysis is similar to the wholly owned group debt capitalisation discussion immediately above, and the policy outcome follows as well – debt remission by the shareholder should not cause debt remission income in these circumstances. Example 12 illustrates this point. Example 12 11 Effectively scenario 4 of the draft QWBA avoidance scenarios. John has advanced a $500 loan to his wholly owned company, John Ltd. This loan is treated as a financial arrangement. Later, John Ltd has financial difficulties and the loan is remitted. John Ltd derives $500 loan remission income from the BPA. However, John is denied a bad debt deduction because he is an associated person. The proposal in this issues paper is to make the tax outcome symmetric. 15 3.22 However, care will have to be taken to ensure that any debt forgiveness by the company to a non-corporate shareholder is taxed, as it is, economically, a dividend. Pro rata debt capitalisation when the debtor is a corporate 3.23 In this scenario, the company could be a corporate joint venture (JV) or similar, the shareholder debt is pro rata to ownership, is all held by New Zealand-resident shareholders, and the subsequent debt remission (either directly or via debt capitalisation) is also pro rata. 3.24 Again, economically, nothing has happened because from the owners’ perspective, all they have done is remit some debt, or swapped some debt for equity. The owners’ “consolidated” wealth has not changed from what it was before the debt remission or capitalisation. Again, the tax result should not be asymmetric, as shown in Example 13. Example 13 3.25 If a company remits debt owed by shareholders, this amounts to a return to owners – that is, the analysis works for owners’ debt advanced to the company, but not vice versa. This remission is, economically, a dividend. Partners’ advances to partnerships 3.26 The term “partnership” in this paper includes look-through companies and limited partnerships. 3.27 This scenario presumes that an advance by a partner to a partnership can be a financial arrangement because the partner can have different capacities – one as an owner, and one as a lender of monies. 3.28 If the debt is a financial arrangement, similar debt remission issues are relevant – that is, when the debt is remitted or capitalised pro rata to the ownership of the partnership, there is (or for capitalisation, can be) an asymmetric debt remission income. Again, from a policy perspective, this tax result should not be asymmetric. See Example 14. Mike and Judy each own 50 percent of JV Ltd. They have also each advanced $500 to JV Ltd. JV Ltd trades unsuccessfully and Mike and Judy each remit the $500 debt owing to them by JV Ltd. Under current tax law, JV Ltd would have $1,000 debt remission income, and Mike and Judy would be denied bad debt deductions. The proposal is to make the tax outcome symmetric. 16 Example 14 3.29 There is an associated question to this scenario. When partnership debt is not remitted pro rata by partners, there is a genuine transfer of wealth among the partners and debt remission outcomes apply. However, the question arises whether a partner-creditor that remits partnership debt (a non-deductible loss) should suffer their share of the associated remission income. This issue will be considered as part of a separate project. Outbound investment into a wholly owned CFC 3.30 Remission of debt owed by a controlled foreign company (CFC) may result in an “active” CFC becoming “passive” from a tax perspective. If the CFC is passive, or becomes passive because of the remission, debt remission income will arise. 3.31 Conceptually, a CFC is inside the New Zealand tax base to the extent that it is owned by New Zealanders (ignoring FIF interests). However, the “active income exemption” effectively means its income is not actually subject to New Zealand taxation. This New Zealand tax-resident presumption can still reasonably be used so that when owners’ debt is remitted or capitalised pro rata to the owners, no remission income should arise for taxation purposes. 3.32 Our analysis indicates that this would not present any unexpected or inappropriate taxation results. The non-resident inbound investment scenario 3.33 Analysis of this scenario is complicated because the creditor is not in the New Zealand tax base. When the owner/creditor is a non-resident and the debtor is New Zealand-resident, the use of related persons inbound debt is a key BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) concern. Raewyn and Paul, equal partners in the R & P Partnership, have each advanced $500 to the partnership. In the circumstances, this is treated as a financial arrangement. Later, because the R & P Partnership is not trading well, Raewyn and Paul decide to capitalise the debt. Under current tax law, unless the debt remission outcome is merely incidental, the R & P Partnership will derive BPA income of $1,000 but Raewyn and Paul do not get a corresponding tax deduction, even although their net wealth is unchanged. The proposal is to make the tax outcome symmetric. 17 3.34 From the perspective of the owner, the owner’s economic wealth does not change because the owner has remitted debt owed to them by their wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary company. Also, the New Zealand tax base is no worse off, and may be better off, by not impeding the conversion of debt to equity because the obligation to pay (deductible) interest ranks higher than the obligation to pay dividends, and dividends are paid out after tax. 3.35 Alternatively, there is the question of whether this debt remission rule should buttress the current thin capitalisation boundary of 60 percent and therefore provide some base protection. If we allow debt remission/capitalisation in this context to be non-taxable, would that further encourage New Zealand subsidiaries of foreign companies to push the 60 percent debt/assets boundary by capitalising more debt when they are close to the boundary. 3.36 In this context, we have seen examples of debt capitalisation when a foreign- owned New Zealand company has been geared so that it has not been able to pay the interest owed. The interest has then been added to the company’s debt and subsequently effectively capitalised into equity. Taxing these capitalisations may dissuade this type of excessive gearing. 3.37 However, we acknowledge that it is arguable that both the thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules should stand alone, and that it may not be principled to use the related parties debt remission rules to buttress them. 3.38 Policy analysis is still underway on this issue, but submissions on matters that taxpayers believe are relevant to this scenario are welcome. Proposed solution 3.39 There are two ways the related persons asymmetric result could be resolved:  turning the debtor’s remission income off; or  allowing the creditor a deduction. 3.40 The first option seems more appropriate. 3.41 Inside a wholly owned group of companies the second option could cause problems if the debtor is liquidated as insolvent (with no taxation on the income). This would effectively allow a double deduction (the trading loss and the bad debt deduction) for a single economic loss – presuming that the liquidated company’s tax losses have been transferred around the group. 3.42 We therefore recommend that the debtor’s debt remission income is “turned off”. 18 CHAPTER 4 Technical issues Tax losses 4.1 In general, tax losses should not be affected by related party debt remission under this paper’s core proposal. These losses presumably result from third- party trading and should be treated as being genuine for the purposes of this paper’s proposals. 4.2 Losses arising from related party interest income and associated bad debt write-offs is an exception, and is dealt with below. Accrued interest 4.3 The outcomes from these proposals should be, in the domestic context, symmetrical. If the related party creditor has taken a bad debt deduction for an “interest” accrual, the outcome may not be symmetrical. 4.4 Borders seem to complicate this analysis – this discussion presumes that all parties are New Zealand-resident. 4.5 New Zealand has no general or specific rules under which a creditor who takes a bad debt deduction has to notify the debtor. However, it might be reasonable to presume that an associated person debtor could be expected to have knowledge about any bad debt deduction for “interest” that the creditor takes. Example 15 provides a likely scenario. Example 15 Parent Co has made a zero coupon loan to its wholly owned Sub Co. After a couple of years, the subsidiary is either insolvent, or very close to being insolvent. Parent Co takes an annual bad debt deduction for its financial arrangement “interest” income. Sub Co continues to accrue its financial arrangement “interest” expense, which increases its overall tax losses and annually offsets these losses to another company in the group. Economically, the group has two available deductions – the bad debt write off, and the “interest” deduction, facilitated by the group tax loss offset. Against this there is one strand of income – being the “interest” income of parent company/creditor. 19 4.6 The outcome described in Example 15 is available under present law and, anecdotally, is being used in some circumstances. Theoretically, the advantage is cancelled eventually when the BPA is done because the “interest” deduction of the subsidiary/debtor is reversed. Any reversal could be in the distant future as the timing of the BPA is controlled by the related parties. Further, if the debtor is eventually liquidated, the reversal will not be effective as no taxation will be paid. 4.7 Even if the advantage is merely timing, it is not a tenable policy outcome. 4.8 A possible policy solution would be to disallow a bad debt deduction for associated persons interest receivable. This is because the debtor will likely be taking a deduction for the accrual of interest. This would mean that the tax outcome is symmetric when the actual interest deduction is being used. 4.9 This symmetric outcome is important, as a net deduction could potentially be grouped and utilised within the wider group even if the debtor is not in a position to obtain any benefit from the deduction due to a net loss position. However, the disallowance of the creditor’s bad debt deduction should not be dependent on this as it would be difficult to know whether the debtor would be able to utilise the deduction in a later year (by carrying the net loss forward) or by grouping the loss with the creditor or another company in a later year. 4.10 A significant advantage of this solution is that it can apply in non-corporate scenarios such as shareholder or partner creditor to company or partnership debtor. 4.11 A disadvantage is that when the debtor cannot utilise the interest deduction, the tax result becomes asymmetric, to the detriment of taxpayers. In this situation the debtor and the creditor themselves may be able to avoid this outcome by amending the terms of the loan to make it interest-free. Submissions on this point are welcome. 4.12 It has been suggested that section DB 31(5) deals with this situation. If so, this section would need to be further clarified in the context of these proposals as its current scope seems too narrow. 4.13 More complex solutions may be available but simplicity has its advantages. Transitional rule 4.14 The amendment suggested above would only apply prospectively. We may also need to consider past situations when the creditor has taken bad debt deductions for interest accruals when those deductions have not been matched by reversals of expenses by the debtor. This issue will be further considered after the receipt of submissions. 20 Debt parking 4.15 The Income Tax Act 2007 has several references to “debt parking”, as follows:  The core debt parking rule: - section EW 29(8) – BPA forced where debt sold at a discount to associate of debtor; - section EW 43 – debt sold at a discount to associate of debtor; and - section EW 49 – debt sold at a discount to associate of debtor.  The consolidated group debt remission rules are in section FM 8(3)(b). 4.16 The core debt parking rule provides that if a debt is acquired by a person associated with the creditor for less than 80 percent of the market value of the debt, calculated as if it is not distressed, then there is an immediate BPA, and the value of the debt is reset. The difference between the acquisition cost and the debtor’s carrying value is income to the debtor, and the debt is reset to the acquisition cost in the debtor’s books. 4.17 The consolidated group rule provides that intra-consolidated group debt remission is ignored if the debt has always been inside the consolidated group (that is, it cannot have been acquired off a non-consolidated group creditor). 4.18 To ensure that the proposed amendments deal adequately with debt parking issues, the present consolidated group debt parking rule would need to be extended to cover all debt that is affected by the proposals in this issues paper. Certain dividends 4.19 As noted in Chapter 2, a debt remission from a company to a shareholder causes a dividend which is not subject to the debt remission rules, but rather is a taxable dividend. This overrides the wholly owned group dividend exemption. We consider the principles of this dividend exemption should apply and there should be neither debt remission income nor any taxable dividend income within a wholly owned group of companies. 4.20 However, in other ownership situations an upstream debt remission is conceptually a transfer of wealth and should continue to be regarded as a dividend. 21 Amalgamations 4.21 Presently, when amalgamations take place between a debtor and a creditor, regard must be had to solvency, and when the debtor is insolvent and unable to meet their obligations, a BPA is performed which results in the debtor having debt remission income. When the companies involved are members of a wholly owned group of companies, this paper’s core proposal makes this amalgamations rule redundant and an appropriate consequential amendment would need to be made. 22 APPENDIX REPRINT OF QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED QB 15/01 Income tax: tax avoidance and debt capitalisation All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Question We’ve Been Asked is about s BG 1. Introduction 1. At a tax conference held in November 2013 there was a discussion of whether s BG 1 would apply to certain scenarios. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) considers one of those scenarios concerning debt capitalisation. Three other scenarios were the subject of an earlier QWBA: QB 14/11 Income Tax – scenarios on tax avoidance, published in October 2014. 2. In the scenario, the arrangement and the conclusion reached are framed broadly. The objective is to consider the application of the general anti-avoidance provision of s BG 1. Accordingly, the analysis of the scenario proceeds on the basis that the tax effects under the specific provisions of the Act are achieved as stated. Also, the specific anti-avoidance provision of s GB 21 is not considered. However, it should not be presumed that this would always be the case. Also, except where shown below, additional relevant facts or variations to the stated facts might materially affect how the arrangement operates and a different outcome under s BG 1 might arise. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s view as to whether s BG 1 applies must be understood in these terms. 3. Section BG 1 is only considered after determining whether other provisions of the Act apply or do not apply. Where it applies, s BG 1 voids a tax avoidance arrangement. Voiding an arrangement may or may not appropriately counteract the tax advantages arising under the arrangement. If not, the Commissioner is required to apply s GA 1 to ensure this outcome is achieved. 4. For a more comprehensive outline of the Commissioner’s position on the law concerning tax avoidance in New Zealand, reference should be made to the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement: IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (July 2013). Question 5. Whether s BG 1 applies in the following circumstances:  A New Zealand resident individual is the sole shareholder of Company D.  Company D is a qualifying company in the following financial position: Company D Shareholder (natural person) Shares $100 (100%) Loan $700 23 Cash 200 Total Assets $200 Shareholder loan 700\* Share capital 100 Accumulated deficit (600) Total Equity and Liabilities $200 \* The shareholder loan is a “financial arrangement” for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules (FA rules) of subpart EW of the Act and is not part of a wider financial arrangement. 6. Under an arrangement the shareholder and Company D agree that:  Company D will issue additional shares;  the shareholder will subscribe $500 for the shares;  the shareholder’s indebtedness to Company D for the share subscription of $500 will be offset against the shareholder loan; and  the company will repay the $200 balance of the loan in cash. Answer 7. The Commissioner’s view is that s BG 1 would potentially apply to this arrangement. Explanation 8. The apparent objective of this arrangement is to eliminate the loan owed by Company D to its shareholder in circumstances where Company D issues further shares to that shareholder. Tax effects 9. The tax effect of the loan ending is that s EW 29(3) requires Company D and the shareholder to each perform a base price adjustment (BPA) under s EW 31 in the income year the loan is eliminated. 10. The BPA is calculated using the formula in s EW 31(5): consideration — income + expenditure + amount remitted 11. In this scenario, it can be assumed that the income and expenditure items in the BPA formula are zero. The amount remitted item will also be zero for Company D as it is the borrower and unable to remit the debt. The relevant item in the BPA formula for present purposes is “consideration”. 12. “Consideration” is relevantly defined as— ... all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable to the person for or under the financial arrangement, minus all consideration that has been paid, and all consideration that is or will be payable, by the person for or under the financial arrangement. 13. The consideration paid to Company D is the original amount of the loan of $700. The consideration paid by Company D is the sum of the $200 paid in cash and the $500 offset against the loan balance. Therefore, Company D’s BPA calculation is: ($700 – ($200 + $500)) – $0 + $0 + $0 = $0. 14. The tax effect of the arrangement for Company D is that no income or deduction will arise under the BPA as the calculation returns neither a positive nor a negative figure. 24 15. Similarly, the tax effect for the shareholder is that there is no income or deduction arising under the BPA as the shareholder’s BPA calculation is: (($200 + $500) – $700) – $0 + $0 + $0 = $0. Parliament’s purposes 16. Parliament’s purposes for the FA rules is to require income and expenditure under financial arrangements to be recognised by the parties on an accrued basis over the term of the arrangement and to require them to disregard any distinction between capital and revenue amounts. The FA rules provide the tax outcomes for each of the parties to a financial arrangement. In this scenario, this will be the shareholder and Company D. 17. The Court of Appeal in Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 40 also noted that the financial arrangements rules recognise the economic effect of a transaction. The court stated as follows: \[71\] In our judgment, the financial arrangements rules were intended to give effect to the reality of income and expenditure – that is, real economic benefits and costs. They were designed to recognise the economic effect of a transaction, not its legal or accounting form or treatment. The question is whether the taxpayer has “truly incurred the cost as intended by Parliament”. \[Emphasis added\] 18. One issue that arises is whether the parties to a financial arrangement are looked at in combination as a single economic unit. The Commissioner considers that reaching a view on this issue must be derived from the provision in question. While the FA rules are concerned with the overall economic effects of a transaction, in the Commissioner’s view, this requires looking at each of the parties involved in isolation. Aside from company consolidation and amalgamation rules, there is no indication Parliament contemplated that the parties should be considered from the perspective of a single economic unit when it comes to the BPA. This conclusion regarding Parliament’s purpose for the FA rules does not mean that where other provisions of the Act are in question Parliament may have contemplated a single economic unit perspective was appropriate. 19. Parliament’s specific purpose for the BPA is for it to apply as a “wash-up” mechanism which operates when a financial arrangement matures or is disposed of. It operates to account for any gains or losses that have not already been treated as income and expenditure during the life of the financial arrangement. The BPA ensures that for each financial arrangement, all income is returned and all expenditure is deducted. 20. One situation where the BPA applies as a “wash-up” mechanism relevant to this scenario is where ultimately a financial arrangement is not repaid in full. In that case, the BPA formula item “consideration” will be positive for a borrower on account of the consideration received by them being greater that the consideration paid by them. Leaving aside any effect of the other items in the formula (income, expenditure and amount remitted), this would lead to a positive BPA figure. Under s EW 31(3) a positive BPA is income to the borrower (often referred to where there is a debt remission as “remission income”). In the present scenario, had the shareholder of Company D forgiven $500 of the loan instead of subscribing for additional shares, Company D would have had remission income of $500 calculated under the BPA as follows: ($700 – $200) – $0 + $0 + $0 = $500. 21. As a qualifying company, if Company D did not pay the tax on the remission income, the shareholder would have to meet the liability on account of the company (although nothing turns on the company being a qualifying company in terms of the application of s BG 1). Facts, features or attributes 22. For the FA rules, a fact, feature or attribute Parliament would have expected to see present in an arrangement bringing a financial arrangement to an end is that there has been a discharge in economic terms of the obligations of each of the parties under the arrangement. That is, the borrower has borne the economic cost of repaying the loan and the lender has received an economic benefit. 23. This means that, on the maturity of a financial arrangement Parliament would expect that the consideration paid or payable by a person actually equalled the consideration received or receivable by another person in an economic sense. 25 24. Where this does not occur, Parliament therefore intended that income will arise for a borrower where an obligation under a financial arrangement, including principal, is forgiven or otherwise unpaid. This is intended to reflect that the borrower has made an economic gain, or has economically had an increase in wealth, by virtue of not having to repay an amount which they would otherwise be required to pay. Extrinsic material 25. This view is supported by extrinsic materials including the Final Report of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (The Valabh Committee, October 1992). The committee proposed that debts remitted should be deemed to be repaid in full so that no remission income should arise. However, this proposal was rejected by the Government. In the foreword to that report, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue stated that this proposal was “inconsistent with \[Government’s\] revenue strategy” (at \[16\]). 26. In a subsequent discussion document, The Taxation of Financial Arrangements: A Discussion Document on Proposed Changes to the Accrual Rules, December 1997 (the discussion document), the asymmetrical tax results arising from retaining the debt remission and bad debt rules were stated to be “an inevitable consequence of maintaining a capital-revenue boundary” (at \[11.5\]). The discussion document also referred to provisions that ignore remission income in the context of consolidated groups as a “substantial concession to the general rule” (at \[11.32\]). Commercial and economic reality of the arrangement 27. Next it is necessary to analyse the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement to see whether the facts, features or attributes Parliament would expect to be present (or absent) to give effect to its purpose are present. In the present scenario this requires ensuring Company D has in reality discharged its obligations under the loan when viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way. If so, the tax effects of the arrangement will be within Parliament’s contemplation for the FA rules. 28. Company D has discharged its obligations under the loan to the extent of the $200 cash it has paid to the shareholder and this amount is correctly treated as an item of consideration paid in its BPA calculation. Also, on the face of it, it is accepted that consideration for BPA purposes need not be cash but can be money’s worth, such as where mutual obligations have been offset. This has occurred in this arrangement to the extent of the $500 share subscription. A financial arrangement is defined in s EW 3(2) in terms of an arrangement involving “money” being provided or received as consideration. The definition of “money” in s YA 1 specifically includes money’s worth, whether or not convertible into money, and s EW 31 includes within the BPA calculation all consideration paid to or by the person. 29. However, a s BG 1 enquiry is not limited to the legal form of the arrangement. The whole of the arrangement is examined to establish its commercial and economic reality. Given the section at issue, the avoidance inquiry examines whether the loan is in reality repaid, as Parliament would expect where there is no remission income. Therefore, the arrangement is examined to see whether Company D repays the loan in a commercially and economically real sense, and whether the shareholder is repaid in a commercially and economically real sense. 30. In the scenario, there is no actual or economic cost to Company D in issuing shares to the existing shareholder. It has not suffered the full economic cost of repaying the loan. The shareholder, in turn, has not received an economic benefit. There is no change to the shareholder’s interest in the company so the shareholder will not receive a “gain” in value from the receipt of the shares commensurate with the face value ascribed to them by the parties. Company D will simply have more shares on issue, and, the existing shareholder will hold more shares in a company in which they already owned all of the shares. The shareholder effectively finances the repayment of $500 of the loan themselves. There is an element of artificiality and contrivance in this aspect of the arrangement. 31. Accordingly, the parties have not given or received full repayment of the loan when viewed in commercial and economic terms. In commercial and economic reality, the effect of the arrangement is that from Company D’s perspective it discharges its obligations under the loan thereby eliminating a liability for $700 without it suffering any economic loss or expending money or money’s worth beyond the $200 paid. This conclusion does not turn on the fact that Company D is insolvent. 26 32. When looking at the financial consequences of the arrangement it should be borne in mind that the relevant provision at issue is s EW 31 and the BPA outcome arising for Company D. Parliament’s relevant purpose is concerned with a single taxpayer and whether that taxpayer has remission income. As stated at paragraph 18, except for consolidated groups, there is no relevant Parliamentary purpose that provides for the parties to the financial arrangement to be looked at as if they were a single economic unit when determining if remission income has arisen. The FA rules apply to individual taxpayers. When viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way the conclusion is that the loan has, in reality, been remitted by the shareholder to the extent of $500. 33. The Commissioner also considers the commercial and economic reality of the arrangement would be the same even if the shareholder had subscribed for the shares in cash for $500 and Company D had fully repaid the loan in cash. Applying the Parliamentary contemplation test 34. Accordingly, it is the Commissioner’s view that the arrangement does not appear to exhibit the necessary facts, features or attributes that Parliament would have expected to see present to give effect to its purposes for the FA rules and the BPA in particular. Again, in the Commissioner’s view, this means the arrangement could be outside Parliament’s purposes for the FA rules as it circumvents remission income arising under the BPA. While the Commissioner accepts that arguments could be made to the contrary, on balance, it is considered that the arrangement has tax avoidance as a purpose or effect. 35. It has been suggested that the above conclusion is inconsistent with the view of the High Court in AMP Life Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 (HC), where McGechan J commented (at \[129\]) that a debt capitalisation on its own would not be a tax avoidance arrangement. However, in the Commissioner’s view, his Honour’s comment does not necessarily reflect a considered judicial view on the issue of debt capitalisation in the context of tax avoidance. The BPA and debt remission income were not at issue in the case, and McGechan J was responding to the arguments before him concerning whether there was actually an “arrangement”. The Commissioner also notes that the case was heard and decided prior to the Parliamentary contemplation test being set out authoritatively by the Supreme Court in Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115. There is no indication that when making his comments concerning debt capitalisation at \[129\] McGechan J was directly considering what Parliament contemplated for the FA rules in the present context. Merely Incidental test 36. The next step is to test whether the tax avoidance purpose or effect of the arrangement is merely incidental to a non-tax avoidance purpose or effect. If so, s BG 1 will not apply to the arrangement, even though the arrangement has a tax avoidance purpose or effect. A “merely incidental” tax avoidance purpose or effect is something which follows from or is necessarily and concomitantly linked to, without contrivance, some other purpose or effect. 37. Sometimes, quite general purposes are put forward to explain arrangements, and there is a question how to treat such purposes in the context of the merely incidental test. General purposes that can potentially be achieved in several different ways will not explain the particular structure of the arrangement. Section BG 1, including the merely incidental test, is applied to the specific arrangement entered into. In the present context, the elimination of the shareholder loan or the alleviation of the company’s insolvency would be insufficient to explain the particular arrangement and to establish that the tax avoidance purpose or effect is merely incidental to these purposes or effects. This is the situation given the limited facts of the arrangement in this scenario. The tax avoidance purpose or effect appears to be either the sole or the main purpose or effect of the arrangement. Accordingly, the tax avoidance purpose or effect is unlikely to be merely incidental to another purpose or effect of the arrangement and the arrangement in the scenario fails the merely incidental test. 38. However, the Commissioner accepts that in a particular case it may be possible for any tax avoidance purpose or effect of an arrangement involving debt capitalisation to be merely incidental to some non-tax avoidance purpose or effect. If so, s BG 1 would not apply. For this to be the case, the non-tax avoidance purposes or effects would need to explain the involvement of a debt capitalisation within the particular structure of the arrangement. An example may be where a regulatory body imposes a certain approach to the restoration of solvency to a subsidiary. 27 Reconstruction 39. If s BG 1 is to apply to give rise to remission income for Company D, it might be thought that there should be a corresponding deduction for the shareholder as part of a reconstruction under s GA 1. However, Parliament has made a deliberate choice for the FA rules that sometimes it will produce an asymmetrical result. An asymmetrical result can arise where the lender is not entitled to a deduction. For instance, had the shareholder in this scenario remitted the $500, the shareholder would not have a negative BPA (a negative BPA is a deduction under s EW 31(4)). This is because the BPA formula item “amount remitted” would include any amount not included in the item “consideration” on account of the amount being remitted by the shareholder. This would give a BPA calculation of: ($200 – $700) – $0 + $0 + $500 = $0. 40. For the shareholder to obtain a deduction for remitting the financial arrangement they would need to satisfy the bad debt rules in s DB 31. Relevant to the present scenario, if the parties are associated (as they are here) no bad debt deduction is permitted (s DB 31(3)). To be consistent with this, it would follow that any application of s BG 1 in this scenario would not result in the shareholder being provided with a $500 deduction as a consequential adjustment under s GA 1. Factual variations 41. This arrangement can be contrasted with the situation where there is an issue of shares to a third party by a solvent company. In that case, it is more likely that the shares issued as consideration will have an economic effect. The existing shareholders of a company would suffer a dilution of their investment. The third party would obtain an equity interest in the company and there may be a change in the effective ownership of the company. This type of situation is more likely to have been contemplated by Parliament as one where no remission income arises under the BPA (although this would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis). 42. Given the above, it might be asked whether the fact that the company is solvent is relevant in the third-party lender situation. The question is answered by considering what facts, features and attributes Parliament would expect to see present. Parliament would expect that a lender receives repayment in a commercially and economically real way. In some situations, depending on the facts, shares in an insolvent company may have some value to a third-party lender. Examples could be where there is the prospect of the company regaining solvency or it has some valuable assets. In most other situations, shares in an insolvent company will not have any value to a third-party lender and so will not constitute repayment of a loan in a real sense. 28 References Subject references: Base price adjustment Consideration Debt capitalisation Debt remission Financial arrangement Merely incidental Tax avoidance Tax avoidance arrangement Legislative references Income Tax Act 2007: ss BG 1, EW 3, EW 29, EW 31, GA 1, s YA 1 definition of “money” Case references AMP Life v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 (HC) Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZCA 40 Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 115 Related rulings/statements IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (July 2013) Other references: Final Report of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (The Valabh Committee, October 1992) The Taxation of Financial Arrangements: A Discussion Document on Proposed Changes to the Accrual Rules, (December 1997)

This means employee recipients of employee share scheme benefits must file an IR 3 returning the employee share scheme benefit as income and account for the tax on that benefit themselves. 3 1.3 This treatment has not been well understood to date. Accordingly, an Inland Revenue Large Enterprises Update in November 2013 stated: Employee share scheme income isn’t subject to either PAYE or FBT, so shouldn’t be included in the Employer Monthly Schedule (IR 348/EMS) or FBT return you send to us. Instead any employee with this type of income must file an IR 3 tax return for the income year they receive the income in. 1.4 Following this Large Enterprises Update, officials have been asked to consider, as a simplification and compliance cost reduction measure, an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 to permit employers to account for tax on employee share scheme benefits at source, preferably through the PAYE system. 1.5 This issues paper outlines the concerns with the current system in more detail and suggests some possible so lut ions to deal with these concerns. Request for feedback 1.6 Officials are aware that taxpayers will have different views about this issue and different preferred solutions. 1 This paper does not cover approved employee share purchase schemes (commonly referred to as “DC 12 schemes”) as the benefit to employees under these schemes is deemed to be nil; thus the tax collection problem does not arise. 2 The “benefit” under an employee share scheme is, in the case of an acquisition of shares, the amount by which the value of the shares when they were acquired is more than the amount paid or payable for them. Share options provided to employees are generally not taxed until they are exercised, at which time the tax treatment in the previous sentence applies. 3 Officials are aware that employee share schemes can be structured using an employee share loan which is used to purchase shares, where the loan is ultimately repaid using a cash bonus (subject to ordinary PAYE). This “self- fix” results, economically, in tax at source on employee share scheme benefits. This issues paper therefore relates only to non-monetary employee share scheme benefits. 1 1.7 Therefore, this paper asks for feedback on: • officials’ understanding of the problems with the current tax collection system and how widespread these problems are; • possible solutions to the problem and which solution would be preferred – in particular, whether PAYE or FBT is the preferred source taxation system and whether taxation at source should be elective or compulsory; and • if a legislative amendment is made, what transitional measures would be needed to ensure existing employee share schemes are not adversely affected and what timeframe would taxpayers need to make any necessary changes to their systems. Scope of issues paper 1.8 Officials are aware that there are some wider issues with the taxation o f employee share schemes and employee option schemes. This issues paper does not consider these substantive tax issues; it is solely confined to the collection of the tax that arises under the current tax rules. The paper has been prepared in response to taxpayer concerns over compliance costs associated with employee share schemes and a tax collection mechanism that is seen as a barrier to the uptake of these schemes. 1.9 Officials are currently considering the wider issues with employee share schemes and intend to commence consultation on these issues later this year. 1.10 None of the suggestions in this issues paper are intended to alter the quantification or timing of the taxation of benefits under an employee share scheme. 1.11 Feedback received will help to shape recommendations we make to the Government on the final form of any amendments to be included in a future tax bill.

This is to ensure neutrality between different remuneration strategies and to prevent tax distorting commercial decisions to remunerate in one way rather than another. 2.2 Consequently, the current rules treat as employment income a “benefit” that arises under an employee share scheme. The “benefit” under an employee share scheme is, in the case of an acquisition of shares, the amount by which the value of the shares when they are acquired is more than the amount paid or payable for them. Share options provided to employees are generally 4 not taxed until they are exercised, at which time the tax treatment of a share acquisition applies. 2.3 The benefit arising under an employee share scheme is treated as employment income under section CE 1(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007, but unlike mo st other employment income, it is not a PAYE income payment (under section RD 3) nor is it a fringe benefit. This means that, unlike cash salary or wages, the benefit is not subject to any form of taxation at source and it is the employee’s obligation to file an IR 3 return and pay the requisit e tax. Potential problems with current collection system 2.4 The example below illustrates a potential problem with this approach. Example 1 John is offered 500 shares in his employer XCo for a purchase price of $10,000. The market value of the shares on the day he is able to acquire the shares is $50,000. If John chooses to acquire the shares, John’s employment income from the employee share scheme is $40,000 ($50,000 market value of the shares – $10,000 purchase price). As an alternative, XCo offers John a $40,000 cash bonus (which is currently his only source of income). John may choose to take either the shares or the $40,000 cash bonus. 4 Share options are taxed before exercise when they are disposed of to a non-associated party. In this case, the taxable benefit is the consideration received from the third party for the option. 4 2.5 Under our current tax rules, if John chooses to purchase the shares and receive his $40,000 employment income in this form, he would have to account for tax on this income himself. This would involve: • John filing an IR 3 – which he would not otherwise have to file; and • funding the resulting tax liability from: (a) his after-tax cash salary; (b) the sale of a portion of his shares (assuming there is a market for the shares and the employee share scheme allows him to do so); or (c) borrowings. 2.6 The receipt of the employee share scheme benefit also raises the issue of whether John will be subject to the provisional tax rules. As John’s residual income tax (RIT) in the year he receives the employee share scheme benefit is less than $50,000, the tax on his employee share scheme benefit for that inco me year is due in one instalment on the terminal tax date and therefore he will not bear use-of-money interest (UOMI) if he does not pay provisional tax. 2.7 John will be subject to the provisional tax rules in the following income year because of the inclusion of the employee share scheme benefit in the current income year. He will be required to pay provisional tax on the expectation that he will continue to be subject to the provisional tax rules whereas, in realit y, receipt of the employee share scheme benefit may have been a one- off occurrence. 2.8 To avoid having to pay provisional tax unnecessarily in the following income year, and then request a refund once his tax return is filed, John would have to file a “nil” estimate of his provisional tax. However, this will also have the effect of dropping the threshold for liability for UOMI from $50,000 to $2,500. John will therefore be liable for UOMI if the RIT on any untaxed income he receives in the following income year is $2,500 or more because of the employee share scheme benefit he received in the current income year. This would not be the case if John had not received the employee share scheme benefit. 2.9 John’s compliance costs in accounting for his $40,000 of employment income in this case would be relatively high for a potentially unsophisticated taxpayer. He would likely need to seek expert advice on how to account for tax, including negotiating the provisional tax rules. 2.10 In contrast, if John chooses the $40,000 bonus, his employer will deduct and pay PAYE and John will simply receive the after-tax bonus. 5 John will have no additional filing or provisional tax obligations and will not have to concern himself with how to fund his tax liability as a result of a potentially illiquid asset. 5 As the bonus is a PAYE income payment there could be implications for any social policy relevant to John’s circumstances. 5 2.11 The current tax collection mechanism for employee share scheme benefits may therefore make a pre-tax cash benefit more attractive to an emplo yee than an equivalent pre-tax benefit under an employee share scheme. This may provide a tax disincentive to employees participating in an emplo yee share scheme and may distort behaviour. Advantages of collecting tax at source 2.12 Based on this analysis, there appear to be compliance cost and neutrality arguments for allowing employers to account for tax on employee share scheme benefits at source on behalf of their employees. Providing at least the option for an employer to deal with the employee’s tax liability arising from participating in an employee share scheme would benefit both the employee (in the form of reduced compliance costs) and the employer (by making employee share schemes equally attractive, from a tax compliance perspective, as a cash salary equivalent). 2.13 From Inland Revenue’s perspective, the advantages of providing for taxation at source on employee share scheme benefits include: • increased likelihood of compliance and improved tax recovery in relat ion to these benefits; and • reduced administrative costs associated with auditing and enforcing compliance. 2.14 Example 2 illustrates these benefits. Example 2 YCo has 1,000 employees who participate in an employee share scheme that provides an annual taxable benefit of $4,000 for each employee. This means that for a single income year $4,000,000 of employment income is provided by way of the employee share scheme. Assuming all employees are taxable on the employee share scheme benefit at the 33% tax rate, the tax due on these benefits is $1,320,000. If the tax is accounted for at a single collection point by the employer, the likelihood of recovery is improved (as the employer is likely to be a sophisticated taxpayer with resources to ensure compliance) and the cost of any administrative action to ensure compliance will be limited to interaction with the one taxpayer. Thus tax is collected in the most efficient manner. If, alternatively, the tax must be collected from each individual employee, the chance of full recovery is reduced because this relies on voluntary compliance by 1,000 unsophisticated taxpayers who are not used to dealing with the tax filing system. In addition, the fact that each of these taxpayers owes only $1,320 may make enforcement action administratively inefficient. 6 Potential disadvantages of tax collection at source 2.15 The difficulty that arises in taxing an employee share scheme benefit in the same way as cash salary or wages is that, unlike cash salary and wages, the benefit is not payable in cash and therefore it is prima facie impract ical to subject it to a withholding tax such as PAYE because you cannot withhold from shares. 2.16 This is not, however, fatal to taxation at source – for example, the FBT system provides for source taxation of non-mo netary remunerat ion, and the provisio n of accommodation by an employer is subject to PAYE. 2.17 There may be some additional compliance costs for employers in applying a source taxation system to their employee share scheme. Officials expect, however, that the additional compliance costs should be minimal and less than those faced by individual employees trying to account for tax on the same employee share scheme benefit. 2.18 Some employee option schemes may not lend themselves to collection of tax at source. For example, under some schemes an employer may not know that an employee has sold their options, nor will they know the option purchase price. A less likely, but still plausible scenario, is that the employer may not know when the employee exercises their options and what the market value of the shares is on the date of exercise. In these cases, it is more appropriate for the employee to continue to account for tax on the employee share scheme benefit as they are in a better position to know the facts and circumstances of the sale or exercise than their employer. Officials’ preliminary view 2.19 On balance, officials consider that taxation of employee share scheme benefits at source is a better approach to collecting tax on employee share scheme benefits. In addition to the benefits already outlined previously, it is a more consistent and coherent approach to taxing employment income. It is also consistent with the general policy of simplifying employees’ tax obligations. Subjecting an employee to a potentially complex filing requirement for what may be a small employee share scheme benefit when that employee would not otherwise have to file a return is inconsistent with the policy objective of simplicity and reduced compliance costs. 2.20 In addit ion, it is unlikely that the difficulties associated with taxing non- monetary remuneration present an insurmountable challenge, as this has been achieved in other circumstances. 2.21 Having come to this preliminary conclusion, Chapter 3 sets out some possible approaches to achieving taxation at source, while Chapter 4 raises some transitional and consequential issues that will arise if we move to a taxation at source model for employee share scheme benefits. 2.22 We are interested in receiving readers’ views on our analysis of the problem as outlined in this chapter. 7 CHAPTER 3 Possible solutions 3.1 There are two key considerations in designing a solution to the identified problem of taxing employee share scheme benefits : • What is the appropriate source taxation system – PAYE, FBT or a new, specific employee share scheme withho lding tax? • Should taxation at source be compulsory for all employee share schemes or be available at the option of the employer or employee, or by agreement between them? If it is compulsory, should employers be able to choose which system they use? Source taxation system 3.2 Officials see there being three options for taxation at source – PAYE, FBT or a new employee share scheme withholding tax. In our view, it is preferable to use one of the existing employment income systems to tax employee share scheme benefits, rather than introducing a new withholding regime for employee share schemes. These systems are already well-developed and employers are familiar with operating them. There is litt le justification for considering the development of a new system. 3.3 To date, officials have received different views about whether PAYE or FBT would be the preferred system to deal with employee share scheme benefits. 3.4 One advantage of using the PAYE system is that all employers operate a PAYE system, whereas not all employers have to operate an FBT system. PAYE returns are filed monthly or twice monthly, compared with FBT returns which are quarterly (at most). Therefore, the employee share scheme benefit is likely to be taxed in a more timely manner if PAYE is used. 3.5 For existing employee share schemes, using the PAYE system would also mean that the economic incidence of tax remains with the employee consistent with the current treatment. In contrast, for existing schemes, using the FBT system could prima facie increase the cost to the emplo yer o f providing a set level of employee share scheme benefits. As discussed in Chapter 4, transitional measures could be introduced to ensure the change in the tax collection mechanism does not adversely affect current schemes. For new schemes, the economic incidence of tax can be contractually determined between the parties under either the PAYE or FBT systems, so officials do not see this as a factor influencing the choice of one system over the other. 8 3.6 Using the PAYE system would involve the employer recording the amount of the employee share scheme benefit as an “extra pay” in the Emplo yer Monthly Schedule (EMS) IR 348 in the period in which the shares are acquired 6 and paying a corresponding amount of PAYE. 3.7 The disadvantage of using the PAYE system is that it is designed to deal with cash payments. As there is no cash to be withheld in the case of a benefit under an employee share scheme, to make PAYE work, the employer would have to either recover the cost of the tax from the employee (potentially by deducting it from after-tax salary), or sell a portion of shares on the emplo yee’s behalf to fund the tax (this is only an option when the shares are relatively liquid – for example, when they are traded on an exchange). 7 The alternative is for the employee share scheme contract to provide a cash gross- up to accompany the employee share scheme benefit to fund the PAYE. 3.8 The problem of funding tax payments is the same dilemma currently faced by employees when they have to account for tax themselves on non- monetary benefits under an employee share scheme (which may involve selling some of the shares to fund the tax payment). Officials expect that the contractual arrangements associated with employee share schemes should be sophisticated enough to deal with this problem between the parties to the employee share scheme. 3.9 Officials also note that employer-provided accommodation is already dealt with through the PAYE system. Therefore, the PAYE system has already been used to account for tax on a non-monetary benefit. However, given employee share scheme benefits tend to vest in large lump-sums, there is a greater likelihood of there being a cash shortfall in a given pay period than in the case of employer-provided accommodation. If there is insufficient cash in the other PAYE income payments to meet the PAYE obligation in respect of the employee share scheme benefit in the period of vesting, the employee must reimburse the employer for the PAYE (if the emplo yer has paid it), or if the employer has not paid the PAYE, the employee must pay the PAYE to Inland Revenue. 8 This reproduces the problem with the current system – the employee has to account for the tax on their employee share scheme benefit. Accordingly, employers would need to carefully consider how to manage this issue. Officials are interested in readers’ views on this problem with using the PAYE system. 6 In the case of options sold to non-associates (or options exercised without the employer’s knowledge) the employee would still need to account for the tax on the sale proceeds in an IR 3 because the employer may not have any knowledge of the sale of the option. Officials expect this situation to be fairly rare. 7 If the ESS benefit vested in a particular pay period was large, there may not be sufficient cash from other salary and wages to fully satisfy the PAYE obligation. Therefore there may be a need to offer an income spreading option if PAYE was adopted. 8 Section RD 21(3). 9 3.10 The advantage of using the FBT system is that it is designed specifically to deal wit h non-monetary remuneration. The gross-up is therefore effectively built into the rules (via the rate structure and the cost of FBT falling on the emplo yer). There is a parallel between the tax treatment of shares provided by an employer to an employee for no consideration or below market value consideration, and the provision of goods or services by an employer to an emplo yee for below market consideration. The latter category of employment remuneration is currently dealt with under the FBT rules, which suggests that it may be an appropriate system to deal with this type of benefit. 3.11 Example 3 illustrates the tax effect of PAYE and FBT when applied to an employee share scheme benefit. Example 3 ZCo has decided that it wants to provide (after-tax) $10,000 worth of shares to a key employee – Scott. Scott is subject to the highest marginal tax rate. If ZCo accounted for tax on the shares through the PAYE system, they would need to provide Scott with $10,000 of shares and a $4,925 cash bonus (a cash gross-up). This means that Scott’s gross income is $14,925. After deduction of PAYE at 33%, Scott is left with $10,000 worth of shares. If ZCo accounted for tax on the shares under the FBT system, it would return a fringe benefit of $10,000 and be liable for FBT of $4,925 ($10,000 x 49.25%). Scott would receive an after-tax benefit of $10,000 worth of shares. Ultimately the tax collected is the same regardless of the system used. 3.12 We are interested to hear readers’ preferred source taxation system – PAYE or FBT. Should source taxation be compulsory or elective? 3.13 There are benefits to making so me form o f source taxation compulsory for all employee share schemes, as previously discussed. Additionally, having one source taxation system (FBT or PAYE) for all employee share schemes reduces legislative complexity and administrative costs associated with processing and monitoring elections. 3.14 However, officials are aware that a large number of employee share schemes currently exist and emplo yers (and employees) will have different views on their preferred tax collection approach. 3.15 Officials appreciate that existing employee share schemes’ contractual arrangements may have been negotiated on the basis that the employee will account for tax. As discussed in Chapter 4, appropriate transitional rules can deal with existing schemes. 10 3.16 Officials also appreciate there may be other reasons employers prefer the tax obligations associated with employee share schemes to lie with their employees (especially in the case of executive-level schemes). However, other employment income is subject to collection of tax at source, so there does not seem to be a compelling case to treat employee share scheme benefits differently (except in the case of certain option schemes, as previously discussed). 3.17 Even if employers were able to elect to continue with the current filing and tax payment arrangements (that is, the emplo yee is required to return the employee share scheme benefit and pay the resulting tax), this does not provide sufficient information to Inland Revenue and is therefore undesirable from a compliance perspective. Accordingly, officials propose that any election by employers to retain the current arrangement would need to be accompanied by an obligation to provide a schedule detailing the names and IRD numbers of participating employees and the value of the employee share scheme benefits provided to each employee. Officials seek feedback on: • whether all employee share schemes should be subject to source taxation or whether employers should be able to elect for employees to continue to be responsible for returning and paying tax on employee share scheme benefits, with the only obligation of the emplo yer being to provide Inland Revenue with a schedule of employee share scheme benefits granted to emplo yees; 9 • whether employers should be able to choose between using the FBT or PAYE system to account for tax; • if source taxation were to be made compulsory, whether: – employers should be entitled to elect to grandparent the tax treatment of existing employee share schemes; and/or – source taxation should be phased in over an appropriate period of time to accommodate changes to existing schemes and systems to provide for this. 9 If source taxation were to be elective, officials would prefer that the election be at the employer’s discretion, rather than the employee’s. This is to minimise the number of employees with different tax treatments within the same employee share scheme (which would increase compliance and administrative costs). 11 CHAPTER 4 Transitional and consequential matters 4.1 While the changes suggested in this officials’ issues paper are designed to affect only the collection of tax, rather than the substantive tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits, there are some important transitional and consequent ial matters that must be considered. Transitional issues 4.2 Officials are aware there are many employee share schemes currently in existence. We want to ensure that any change to the tax collection mechanism (in particular, if source taxation is made compulsory) is not a burden to taxpayers. 4.3 Accordingly, officials seek feedback on: • the range of employee share schemes currently on offer and whether emplo yers would like the abilit y to “grandparent” the existing tax treatment for employees currently participating in these employee share schemes; and • whether a phase-in of the new rules over several years would be an acceptable alternative to grandparenting. Consequential issues 4.4 There are likely to be some consequential implications of the changes suggested in this issues paper for the rest of the Income Tax Act 2007. 4.5 Officials seek feedback on any consequential issues readers may be aware of. 4.6 Three issues officials have considered are how to ensure that the suggested changes to collection do not alter: • employer deductions for the provisio n of employee share scheme benefits; • the substantive tax treatment when the employee provides services in New Zealand and overseas; and • entitlements and obligations for social assistance (Working for Families, student loans, child support and KiwiSaver, collectively referred to as “social policy”). 12 Employee deductions for the provision of employee share scheme benefits 4.7 As discussed earlier, this issues paper does not intend to alter the substantive tax treatment of employee share schemes. Therefore, any legislative amendment would seek to ensure that any deductions available to an emplo yer in relation to employee share scheme benefits would not change. Tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits that have a cross-border element 4.8 Similarly, any legislative amendment would seek to ensure that changing the collection of tax on employee share scheme benefits would not alter the substantive tax treatment where the employee provides services in New Zealand and overseas. Treatment of employee share scheme income for ACC and social policy purposes 4.9 Officials would seek to ensure that, as far as possible, including employee share scheme benefits in either the definition of “PAYE income payment” or the definit io n o f “fringe benefit” (thus changing the way tax is collected) would not alter the effect the receipt of an employee share scheme benefit currently has on social policy entitlements or obligations. That is, officials do not intend the suggested changes in this issues paper to make anyone better or worse off fro m a social policy perspective. 4.10 We propose that employee share scheme benefits should continue to be either included or excluded in the relevant measures of income for ACC and social policy purposes as follows: • ACC earners’ levy – excluded • Working for Families tax credits – included • Student loans – included • Child support – included (from 1 April 2016) • KiwiSaver – excluded. 4.11 A more detailed analysis of these recommendations is included in the Appendix to this issues paper. 4.12 Officials note that the Income Tax Act definitions of “taxable/net income” and “family scheme income” are also used by other agencies to determine other social entitlements (for example, community services cards and student allowances). This issues paper does not consider the implications of any changes for these other agencies. 13 Officials seek feedback on: • whether there are other consequential issues that have not been identified; and • whether there are practical difficulties in achieving the neutral treatment proposed – for example, would using the current FBT system make it difficult to identify the specific employee share scheme benefit provided to the employee for social policy purposes? 14 APPENDIX Social assistance policy Means testing criteria Are employee share scheme benefits included? ACC earners’ levy Levied on “earnings as an employee” which is defined as PAYE income payments, with certain exclusions. 10 • Currently not included because not “PAYE income payments”. • If the PAYE system is adopted to tax employee share scheme benefits without any further amendment, ACC earners’ levy would have to be paid on these benefits. This is consistent with the treatment of employer-provided accommodation (a form of non-monetary remuneration subject to PAYE). • It would treat employee share scheme benefits in the same manner as cash wages, maintaining neutrality. • However, this treatment would depart from the current treatment and is potentially inconsistent with the policy of the ACC system. The payment of the ACC earners’ levy on a particular level of “earnings as an employee” entitles a claimant to weekly compensation in certain cases of accident or injury of 80 percent of weekly earnings as an employee. The question is, if there were an accident, should ACC be paying 80 percent in income replacement for this payment? An employee share scheme benefit is usually a one-off benefit that provides an on-going equity interest in an employer – therefore officials are of the view that they should not be included in “earnings as an employee” for ACC purposes. They are ver y different to a regular payment of cash (or on-going provision of accommodation) which contributes to the day-to-day living costs of an employee and which needs to be covered by the ACC system. • Therefore, officials are of the view that, if the PAYE system was adopted, there would be a need to exclude employee share scheme benefits from “earnings as an employee definition” to maintain current treatment. • If the FBT system is adopted, it will not be subject to ACC earners’ levy. 10 Sections 9 – 13 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. 15 Social assistance policy Means testing criteria Are employee share scheme benefits included? Working for Families tax credits Wide definition of “family scheme income” in subpart MB. • Currently employee share scheme benefits are included, as is PAYE income and certain fringe benefits. • Regardless of treatment as a PAYE income payment or a fringe benefit, employee share scheme benefits should continue to be included in family scheme income to determine entitlement to Working for Families tax credits. It is a component of the earner’s total income and so is consistent with the Working for Families policy as targeted financial assistance to families that reduces with total income. Student loans From 1 April 2014, the definition of “income” for student loan purposes has been broadly aligned with the definition for Working for Families purposes. 11 • As for Working for Families employee share scheme benefits are currently included in income for student loan purposes. • Regardless of treatment as a PAYE income payment or a fringe benefit, employee share scheme benefits should continue to be included in income for this purpose. Child support Based on “taxable income”. • Employee share scheme benefits are currently included in taxable income for child support purposes. • Regardless of treatment as a PAYE income payment or a fringe benefit, employee share scheme benefits should continue to be included in taxable income for this purpose. KiwiSaver Based on “gross salary or wages.” • Employee share scheme benefits are currently excluded from gross salary and wages for KiwiSaver contribution purposes. • If employee share scheme benefits are treated as a PAYE income payment, the legislation would need to make it clear they are not “salary or wages” for KiwiSaver purposes. • If employee share scheme benefits are deemed to be fringe benefits, employee share scheme benefits will continue to be excluded from salary and wages for KiwiSaver purposes. • It would be difficult and impractical for the employer to withhold 3% of the value of the benefit and pay this into a KiwiSaver fund. It raises some of the practical issues of using the PAYE system for a non-cash benefit. 11 As a result of the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2013. 16

Consistent with New Zealand’s tax policy settings, GST is imposed at a single rate of 15%, across a broad base of goods and services with few exemptions. Its purpose is to tax consumption of different goods and services evenly and efficiently, without distorting consumers’ preferences between different goods and services. 1.2 As a tax on consumption, GST should not be a cost to businesses. Although businesses may be charged GST on goods and services they purchase, GST- registered businesses may recover this by deducting it against the GST they are liable to pay on their own sales. When a GST-registered business incurs more GST on these purchases than it is liable to pay on its own supplies, it will be refunded the difference. 1.3 GST is not intended to tax the consumption of goods and services outside New Zealand. Supplies exported and consumed offshore will typically be zero-rated – GST will not be charged on the supply. 1.4 While the GST system generally works well, a number of GST-related concerns have been raised by private-sector stakeholders and by officials since the last GST omnibus discussion document in 2012. 1 These concerns do not reflect issues wit h the policy underlying GST, but relate to areas where the legislation does not fully give effect to the policy intention, or areas where technical changes could improve the way the system operates. 1.5 A number of these concerns are discussed in this paper, and possible solutions suggested. 1.6 The key issues covered are: • the deductibility of GST associated with the costs of raising capital; • the eligibility of large, partially exempt, businesses to agree an alternative method of apportionment; • the ability to take a deduction for secondhand goods, for goods composed partially of gold, silver and platinum; and • the ability to zero-rate services provided in connection with land in New Zealand. 1 GST remedial issues, 18 December 2012. 1 1.7 Some technical and remedial changes are also suggested. They include: • providing more flexibility in the agency rules to agents acting on behalf of purchasers and their principals; • providing for more consistent treatment of accounting for GST on supplies of goods and services where total consideration is not known at the time of supply; • allowing zero-rating of goods and services that are provided in relat io n to ships and aircraft that are exported under their own power; and • ensuring a person remains eligible to receive a refund for overpaid tax due to a clear mistake or simple oversight where they were in a tax payable position during the relevant period. 1.8 Subject to submissions on this issues paper, it is expected that the proposals would be included in the next available omnibus tax bill. 1.9 Your comments on the solutions suggested in this paper are welcomed. We would appreciate your submissions by 30 October 2015. 1.10 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations.

This is because it is difficult to measure the amount paid for a financial service, as the financial services provider may be compensated through a margin or spread rather than an explicit fee. Due to the difficulty in taxing the value of services supplied by a financial service provider, the next best option is to effectively tax the supply by denying input tax deductions. 2.3 Since 1 January 2005, supplies of financial services to GST-registered persons whose taxable supplies equal or exceed 75 percent of their total supplies may be zero-rated when the financial services provider elects to do so. Allowing financial service providers to recover input tax in relation to their supplies to registered taxable businesses was intended to reduce the potential for tax cascades caused by the exempt treatment of financial services, where tax must either be absorbed or passed on by the business sector. Costs associated with capital raising 2.4 A longstanding issue associated with the exempt treatment of financial services occurs when businesses that primarily provide taxable goods and services incur costs to raise capital, such as through the issuing of bonds or shares. Examples of the costs that can be incurred in this way include NZX listing fees, legal fees and costs associated with preparing a product disclosure statement. The GST incurred in relation to these costs will be unrecoverable because the provision of equity and debt securities is considered to be a supply of financial services. 2.5 It is arguable that the GST costs incurred in raising capital should be attributed to the business’s broader taxable activity, rather than being viewed in iso lat ion as relating to an exempt supply of financial services. This is because the purpose of capital raising by a regular taxable business is usually to further their taxable activity, and not to add value as a supplier of financial services. 2.6 This leads to the question of whether the deductibility of input tax in relation to a supply of financial services for capital or debt raising activities should be considered on a transaction-by-transaction basis, or whether the economic substance of the transaction in the context of a business’s taxable activity should determine its deductibility. 3 2.7 GST generally applies on a transact ion-by-transaction basis – whether or not the supplier can deduct any cost incurred will ultimately depend on the GST treatment of the particular supply that the costs relate to, not the taxpayer’s broader activity. Allowing deductions for exempt supplies on the basis that the business is primarily taxable would depart from this legislative framework. 2.8 From a policy perspective, exemption makes sense when a financial service provider is in the business of supplying financial services that might otherwise be difficult to tax because of the ease by which margins and fees may be substituted. The financial service provider is adding value to the services it provides, and since it is difficult to tax the value added, one option would be to deny deductions where the services are received by unregistered customers. However, it may not be appropriate to deny deductions when a regular taxable business supplies financial services to raise funds for furthering its taxable activit y, particularly when the business is not seeking to add value to the supply of financial services. 2.9 Given that GST is a tax on consumers and not businesses, denying deductions in relation to raising capital in some contexts may be contrary to this principle. Denial of deductions may cause tax cascades in which a taxable business absorbs the GST cost or passes the cost on to its customers. A business that generally makes taxable supplies can also experience higher compliance costs when making exempt supplies to raise capital, as it will be necessary to apportion purchases between these activities when claiming input tax deductions. 2.10 On balance we consider that when a business raises capital to further its taxable activity, it is appropriate to disregard the exempt treatment arising fro m the capital raising and instead treat these costs as relating to the business’s broader taxable activity. How tax cascades arise 2.11 The following examples illustrate two ways in which a tax cascade can arise when a business is not entitled to deduct GST costs associated with raising capital. In the first example, the GST is passed on to others in the supply chain. In the second example, the GST cannot be passed on but is absorbed by the company. In practice, a combination of the two may occur. 4 Example: GST is passed on to others in the supply chain In this example, Widget Co. pays $115 (including $15 GST) for services supplied by L Co. (in relation to issuing shares) and $345 (including $45 GST) for goods provided by R Co. (for use in manufacturing widgets). Widget Co bears a total cost of $415, as it deducts $45 GST, being the GST charged on the supplies used to make taxable supplies (widget sales). Widget Co. is not able to deduct the $15 GST charged on the supply by L Co., as it was incurred to make an exempt supply – the issue of shares. Widget Co. passes this GST cost on to the retailer. The retailer pays Widget Co. $477.25 and deducts GST, bearing a total cost of $415, as it deducts the GST charged. The retailer passes these costs on to the final consumers, in a taxable supply of $477.25 ($415 plus $62.25 GST). Consumers are unable to deduct this GST. The total GST paid in this supply chain is $77.25. This is made up of $60 charged on the $400 of goods and services that were supplied to consumers, the $15 Widget Co. was unable to deduct, and $2.25 in GST charged when the embedded GST was recovered through a taxable supply. Example: GST cannot be passed on but is absorbed by the company In this example, Widget Co. is unable to pass the GST cost along the supply chain, and instead it bears this cost. The GST is effectively being paid by Widget Co. through reduced profits, rather than being shifted onto the price of the goods and services that are supplied to final consumers. The total GST paid in this supply chain is $75. This is made up of $60 charged on the $400 of goods and services that were supplied to consumers, and the $15 Widget Co. was unable to deduct. L Co. Consumers R Co. Widget Co. Retailer Share- holders $100 + $15 GST $415 + $62.25 GST $415 + $62.25 GST $300 + $45 GST Exempt – no GST L Co. Consumers R Co. Widget Co. Retailer Share- holders $100 + $15 GST $400 + $60 GST $400 + $60 GST $300 + $45 GST Exempt – no GST 5 When should an input tax deduction be available for capital-raising activities? 2.12 The ability to claim input tax deductions for the cost of raising capital should, however, only be available to the extent that the taxpayer makes taxable supplies of goods and services. Allowing a deduction for capital raising costs incurred for a taxpayer to further their exempt supplies would be contrary to the policy objective of the exemption, which is to effectively tax these supplies by denying deductions. 2.13 Consequently, for registered businesses that incur GST costs in raising capital, the exempt treatment of the supply should be disregarded, with the costs incurred being deductible to the extent that the taxpayer makes taxable supplies as a proportion of their total supplies. 2.14 Apportioning input tax deductions according to the extent to which a taxpayer makes taxable supplies is a pragmatic way to provide certainty on the extent to which capital raising costs are deductible. It is proposed that businesses would not be able to attribute the cost of raising capital to a particular activity. As money is fungible between activities, it may otherwise be difficult to determine the extent to which capital is being raised to finance the taxpayer’s taxable, as opposed to exempt, activities. The proposed solut ion would instead result in the taxpayer apportioning their capital- raising costs in the same manner as other costs that relate to their business as a who le, as they are not attributable to a particular part of the business. 2.15 Limiting input tax deductions to the extent that the capital raising costs are incurred to further the making of taxable supplies, and not exempt supplies, follows the approaches adopted in other jurisdictions. 2 2.16 We recognise that, in some cases, the direct attribution of costs may be more appropriate – such as if costs relate solely to the taxable part of a business – and would welcome submissions on this point. Example C Co. is a property developer, which makes 80 percent taxable supplies and 20 percent exempt supplies. It issues a bond to raise capital in order to finance the purchase of land. In issuing the bond, it spends $10,000 on legal fees. The suggested approach would treat these costs as being attributable to C Co.’s broader taxable activity, rather than to an exempt financial supply. This means that C Co. would be able to deduct 80 percent of the GST costs incurred. 2 The leading European case on the issue is Kretztechnik AG v Finanzamt Linz (Case C-465/03). The case established the principle in Europe that businesses are entitled to recover input tax incurred on the costs of issuing shares to the extent that they make taxable supplies. 6 Should the approach suggested apply to financial service providers? 2.17 The business-to-business financial services rules allow financial service providers to recover input tax in relation to their supplies of financial services to other registered businesses that predominantly make taxable supplies. Taxpayers that principally provide financial services are able to enter into an agreement with the Commissioner on a fair and reasonable method to apportion their costs between their taxable and exempt activities. 2.18 The costs incurred by financial service providers in issuing shares, bonds and debentures would generally be apportioned according to the extent to which the financial service provider makes taxable supplies. This is consistent with the principle that would apply to regular taxable businesses under the suggested approach. 2.19 It is questionable whether the proposal therefore needs to extend to registered persons that principally make financial supplies. In particular, as financial service providers issue securities as an integral part of their business in intermediating between borrowers and lenders, it may be difficult to draw a dist inct ion between capital raising costs that relate to their broader activities, and other circumstances. 2.20 Submissions are sought however on whether any concerns arise for financial service providers in relation to the deductibility of GST costs incurred in raising capital, and if so, how these concerns may be addressed. Which supplies of financial services should be included? 2.21 As we have outlined, a registered person must have a taxable activity to deduct costs incurred in capital raising. This means the registered person must carry out the activity continuously or regularly, and supply or intend to supply goods and services for consideration. 2.22 Section 3(1) defines “financial services” as including: (c) The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security; (d) The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security. 2.23 The key financial services that a business may supply when raising capital are the “issue” or “allot ment” of a security. The issue of a security involves the delivery of a document or an act that establishes the title of the holder of a security. The allotment of a security occurs when the person offering a security (the issuer) accepts a subscriber’s offer to purchase the security, which is generally when the contract for the issue of the security is formed. 2.24 For example, this would mean that when issuing a debt or equity security, a business would be able to recover the GST on expenses such as legal and advisory fees, the costs of preparing a product disclosure statement or other documents, valuation fees, printing and advertising. 7 2.25 This approach would not affect the current treatment of financial services supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, as they will continue to be zero-rated. Example D Co., a manufacturing company, plans to issue shares to raise capital for expansion of its operations. In issuing the shares, D Co. incurs expenses such as legal and accounting fees, advertising and printing. Under the suggested approach, the exempt treatment of the issue of equity security would be disregarded, and the costs would be attributed to D Co.’s broader taxable activity. If when disregarding the issue of shares, D Co. only makes taxable supplies, it can deduct all of the GST costs incurred in issuing the shares. Suggested solution 2.26 An amendment could be made to disregard the exempt treatment of the issue or allotment of an equity or debt security by a registered person when considering whether the costs relating to this activity are deductible. Instead, these costs would be considered to relate to the registered person’s broader taxable activity, with the costs being deductible to the extent that the registered person makes taxable supplies as a proportion of their total supplies by value. 2.27 Officials consider that it may be appropriate to exclude taxpayers that principally make supplies of financial services from this rule, as they are able to apportion capital-raising costs under the current legislat ion. 2.28 The amendment would apply from 1 April 2017. 8 CHAPTER 3 Compliance costs of apportionment for large businesses 3.1 The current apportionment and adjust ment rules were introduced in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. Under the apportionment rules, input tax may be deducted to the extent that goods and services acquired are used or available for use in making taxable supplies. In the event that acquisitions will be used in making both taxable and non-taxable supplies, input tax needs to be apportioned initially and actual use is subsequently periodically assessed and adjustments made to the apportioned deduction. 3.2 During consideration by the select committee, public submissions identified financial service providers as a group who would potentially incur significant compliance costs in applying the new apportionment rules, for little addit ional value. Consequently, amendments were made to allow a person principally making supplies of financial services to use a “fair and reasonable” method of apportionment, and of adjustment, as agreed with the Commissioner and having regard to the tenor of the apportionment rules. This is contained in sections 20(3E), 20E(b) and 21(4). 3.3 At the time, the property sector was identified as potentially being another industry which makes a mix of taxable and exempt supplies, such as the taxable sale of a newly constructed dwelling which has been rented out, producing some exempt supplies prior to sale. However, the rules for the concurrent use of land, in section 21E, were intended to specifically deal with this situation. 3.4 It is evident that retirement village operators and conceivably other kinds o f larger business who make mixed supplies may also experience substantial compliance costs, in addition to those covered by section 20(3E), in applying the apportionment rules. Current difficulties are discussed below. Activities of a retirement village 3.5 Retirement village operators provide both accommodation and a number of assisted living services to residents of their villages. There are a number of legal forms that are used to provide accommodation and related services. Accommodation may be supplied to a resident by way of a lease or other right to occupy the unit. A resident will be entitled to use certain shared facilities, such as the grounds and common areas, as well as residing in the unit. Alternatively, the village operator may sell a unit to a resident, coupled with an arrangement or option to repurchase it at the end of the resident’s stay. 9 3.6 When a resident ceases to use a unit, it will be supplied to a new resident. The new resident may acquire the unit on different terms to the original resident. For example, a resident who received a package including accommodation and full care services may be replaced by a new resident who only acquires the accommodation. 3.7 Retirement village operators may also provide residents with a wide variety of assisted living services, including nursing services, medical care, transport, group activities, and assistance with living, such as laundry, cleaning and meals. The level of assistance required will vary amo ng residents, and not all residents will require the same services. In some cases, these services will be included with the accommodation, and in other cases some services may be optional additions that a resident can choose to acquire. Retirement villages and the GST rules 3.8 The GST treatment of accommodation provided by a village operator will vary depending on the terms of the contract for the supply, rather than be based solely around the structure in which the accommodation is provided. In particular, leased or licensed accommodation will be exempt when it is provided in a “dwelling” or taxable if it is provided in a “commercial dwelling”. What would ordinarily be a commercial dwelling may instead beco me a dwelling, if the consideration is for the right to occupy the unit. Example B Co., a retirement village operator, offers individual apartments to residents for a weekly charge. The weekly charge entitles the resident to the exclusive use of their apartment, and to use shared facilities, such as the grounds, and common rooms. Residents may opt to acquire additional services – such as cleaning, rubbish disposal, eligibility to take part in organised outings, and nursing care – separately for an additional charge. However, there is no obligation to acquire these services. The supply of the apartment is GST-exempt (as accommodation in a dwelling). If a resident chooses to acquire the additional services, the supply of those additional services will be taxable and will not alter the GST treatment of the accommodation. C Co., another retirement village operator, offers care apartments to residents for a weekly charge. The care apartments are supplied as part of a larger package that also includes the use of shared facilities, meals, the periodic cleaning of the apartment, rubbish disposal, eligibility to take part in organised outings, and regular visits from a nurse. The supply of accommodation in the care apartment is taxable, as the supply will not be the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”. 3.9 The treatment of a number of incidental services, such as use of the grounds, will depend on the treatment of the accommodation. Both taxable and exempt accommodation may be provided within the same building, and residents of each kind may share the use of the same shared facilities. 10 3.10 The supply of care services such as cleaning, nursing or medical services, is generally taxable, although some goods and services (including the right to occupy the premises) supplied may be “domestic goods and services” and when provided in a commercial dwelling, be subject to an effectively lower rate of GST. 3 This recognises that they are close substitutes for exempt residential accommodation. 3.11 The proportion of taxable to exempt use of goods and services within a retirement village will likely vary depending on which part of the village is being used and what goods and services are supplied. This proportion will also vary over time. A retirement village operator will need to apply the apportionment and adjust ment rules. 4 Compliance costs in applying the apportionment and adjustment rules 3.12 When goods or services are acquired, a retirement village operator must deduct tax charged on those goods or services, based on its estimated use of those goods and services in making taxable supplies (the “intended use”), using a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. 3.13 Officials have been advised that this leads to significant compliance costs as follows: • When goods and services used within different parts of the village have different intended uses, multiple apportionment rates need to be determined, applied and tracked. For example, head office expenses may relate to the entire business activity, including multiple villages, and other costs may relate to a specific part of a village with its own unique proportion of taxable/exempt supplies. • During the construction phase of a village, costs may relate to the construction of “exempt” units, “taxable” units, and shared facilities. It may be difficult to determine the relative proportion of any particular invoice relating to constructing each of these items and what the overall apportionment should be. • The use of facilities in making taxable supplies also continuously varies, as the services provided to residents change over the lifespan of the village. Ongoing calculations are required to determine any adjustments required. • The use of supplies may not have been able to be accurately determined at the time of apportionment. For example, when an apartment may be acquired by a resident either as independent living accommodation (exempt) or as part of a care package (taxable), the GST treatment will depend on this cho ice. • When the use of a good or service in an early adjustment period differs from its use in subsequent adjustment periods, incremental adjustments may be required in the subsequent periods, as the use in the early periods progressively becomes a smaller proportion of actual use. 3 Through the operation of section 10(6). 4 The Commissioner’s view of the GST treatment of retirement villages is being considered in the Public Rulings’ project PUB00201. It is expected that the Interpretation Statement for this project will be published shortly. 11 3.14 As a result, a retirement village operator may need to apply multiple apportionment rates to different invoices and track these invoices so that subsequent adjustments can be made. The retirement village operator will need to calculate if adjustments are required in relation to these supplies. Policy considerations 3.15 The apportionment rules are intended to ensure that when a business makes exempt supplies (or the goods and services are privately consumed), deductions are not available. This ensures that exempt supplies and private consumption are still effectively taxed. 3.16 The rules were intended to be relatively simple to comply with, and provide certainty for taxpayers. This has largely been achieved, as most taxpayers are able to undertake an initial apportionment and then make limited further changes if there is little change to the relative taxable and exempt use. However, for some larger taxpayers (such as retirement village operators) apportionment, as shown, is complicated. This is undesirable. 3.17 As exempt supplies are taxed by denying deductions, it is important that any change does not affect the overall proportion of input tax that may be deducted. If the proportion of input tax that may be deducted varies from the use of the goods or services in making taxable supplies, the result would be under- or over-taxation. Suggested solution 3.18 On balance, officials consider that the ability to agree a similar alternative method to the apportionment rules wit h the Commissioner, could be extended to a wider group of taxpayers, beyond the financial services sector, subject to certain restrictions to ensure administration costs are kept relat ively low. This would provide the necessary flexibility to address the specific circumstances and difficulties faced by taxpayers most affected. 3.19 While officials are only aware of difficulties within the retirement village sector, in theory any larger business making both taxable and exempt supplies could experience similar issues. 3.20 Relief from high compliance costs could be provided by a more aggregated approach to estimating the amount of input tax that may be deducted, which takes into account the specific business circumstances of the taxpayer and reaches a similar overall outcome to that which would be available by applying the apportionment and adjustment rules. Proposed method 3.21 It is expected that the agreement would provide alternatives to applying the rules on a supply-by-supply basis, the number of periods for which adjustments may be required to be made, and the way the adjustment rules closely follow the actual use of the goods or services over their current life. 12 3.22 It is not intended to codify matters any agreement with the Commissioner must consider. It is anticipated that an alternative method would need to be fair and reasonable after taking account of the specific business circumstances of a taxpayer. However, it is expected that agreements would usually set out the following: • all relevant business activities of the applicant; • the methodology proposed (for example, calculation based on turnover, floor space, time spent, number of transactions or cost allocations); • categories of costs that can be directly attributed to either taxable or non-taxable supplies, and categories of costs that relate to both taxable and non-taxable supplies; • the methodology proposed for significant one-off acquisitions such as land; • the method by which disposals of assets will be dealt with (for example, what input tax adjustments will be made); • any adjustments that will be made in relation to goods and services that have already been acquired, including those that are subject to the current apportionment rules, transitional rules or old apportionment rules; • details of any proposed variations to the minimum number o f adjustment periods for which adjustments will be made; • details of any proposed variations to the period in which adjustments will be returned; and • an explanation of why the proposed methodology is fair and reasonable, and how it reflects the outcomes that would be reached under the apportionment rules. 3.23 Approval could be granted subject to conditions. These might include the methodology being subject to regular review by the Commissioner (such as every three years) and the taxpayer being required to notify the Commissioner of the GST recovery position taken in relation to high-value acquisit ions (such as land). 3.24 The period over which any agreed approach applied would need to be considered, as just looking at an annual position could misrepresent the degree of relative accuracy between the agreed approach and the more literal application of the legislat ion. For example, consider the situation of a good which is initially used to only make exempt supplies in the first adjustment period, before being applied to make taxable supplies in subsequent adjustment periods. An incrementally larger input tax deduction may be available in these subsequent adjustment periods, as the earlier exempt use beco mes a lower proportion o f its actual use. A method that based the deduction on the planned long-term actual use of the goods and services in making taxable supplies would bring the deduction forward (compared wit h the adjustment rules being applied) and could produce a timing advantage. An alternative method would need to take this timing difference into account, if material. 13 Scope of eligibility 3.25 The issues discussed arise in relation to larger taxpayers (including registered groups), who make both taxable and exempt supplies as these businesses have a greater number of transactions and more complex transactions. 3.26 To help ensure that an alternative agreement produces a net benefit, a threshold would restrict eligibility to taxpayers who make a large volume of supplies. We suggest that this threshold be aligned to the requirement mandating a 1-month taxable period – registered persons whose turnover in a 12-month period is $24 million or more, or expected to be $24 million or more, once their business activities fully commence. 3.27 Financial service providers covered by the existing ability to reach an apportionment agreement would not be covered by this proposed new rule. 3.28 The Commissioner could refuse to enter into agreements when the benefits arising under an agreement, such as compliance cost savings, would not justify the administrative cost of agreeing upon, and maintaining, an alternative methodology. 14 CHAPTER 4 GST treatment of alloy gold 4.1 The GST treatment of gold, silver and platinum depends on their purity. Gold, silver and platinum 5 are a “fine metal”, when they are in any form having a fineness of not less than a certain specified percentage (99.5%, 99.9% and 99.0% respectively). A supply of fine metal is generally exempt, but in certain circumstances may be zero-rated. This includes both exported fine metal, and the first supply of new fine metal to a dealer for the purpose of supply as an investment item. In addit ion, GST is not charged on fine metal when it is imported. 4.2 In contrast, gold, silver or platinum (collectively referred to as “gold") in a form having a lower purity are not a “fine metal”, and will generally be subject to the same GST treatment as other goods. However, one area where different rules will apply is in allowing deductions for secondhand goods. Deductions are not allowed to the extent secondhand goods are manufactured or made of gold. Reasons for the current treatment of gold 4.3 This treatment dates back to an amendment made through the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986, after the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 received Royal assent, but before GST began to be imposed on supplies of goods and services in New Zealand. 4.4 Previously, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 did not contain rules providing for any special treatment for supplies of gold. A supply of gold would be taxable under the ordinary rules. However, a number of concerns were raised about this treatment, as a result of fine gold also being used for investment purposes. 4.5 A major concern was that the price of gold in New Zealand would increase when GST came into force on 1 October 1986 by 10% (the rate of GST at the time) over the internationally set price. This would produce a windfall gain for persons holding gold at this time (if not required to register for GST) as they would be able to sell their gold for this increased price (as a registered purchaser would receive an input tax credit for secondhand goods), but not return any GST. The person could take further advantage of this rule by acquiring gold before 1 October, including by importing additional gold, to take advantage of this potential windfall, at the expense of government revenue. 4.6 Other concerns included the mismatch in treatment with paper dealings in gold, which were arguably an exempt financial service, the risk that gold could be treated as “money”, and that taxing gold would create a tax incentive for investment gold to be exported or held offshore. 5 Other substances can also be declared to be a fine metal by Order in Council. 15 4.7 As a consequence of these concerns, the supply of fine gold was made exempt, with a special rule zero-rating the first supply of new fine gold used for investment purposes. The effect of these rules was that GST would not be charged on or embedded in fine gold – while exemption normally effectively taxes a supply by denying deductions, zero-rating the first supply addressed the issue of embedded GST. This is because the refiner may recover GST charged when it purchases non-fine gold to be refined, with subsequent supplies of the fine gold being exempt. 4.8 Concerns remained, however, about allowing deductions for secondhand goods supplied by a non-registered to a registered person such as a refiner. These arose because, for example, an unregistered person could acquire fine gold, and turn it into a non-fine gold alloy. The gold alloy could be supplied to a registered person who would claim an input tax deduction in respect of the purchase. The registered person could then either export it (as a zero- rated supply) to be refined overseas, 6 or potentially sell the gold to a refiner, who would deduct the GST charged. The alloy could then be refined to extract the gold component, as fine gold (and reimported without GST, if applicable), and the cycle could begin again. An example of this is shown below. Completion of this cycle would result in one more deduction than corresponding GST paid. ( Note that these concerns reflect the GST rules as they were at the time GST was introduced.) Example: Carousel fraud involving gold 6 This requires supply to another registered person, who exports it, due to limitations on zero-rating exported goods where a secondhand goods deduction has been claimed. Registered person Unregistered person Dealer Refiner Third party Fine gold (exempt as not first supply) Coverts to alloy gold Non-fine gold (secondhand goods deduction) Alloy gold (GST charged and deducted) Coverts to fine gold Fine gold (zero-rated as first supply) 16 4.9 This concern was addressed by preventing input tax deductions from being taken for the gold component of secondhand goods. This was achieved by amending the definit io n of “secondhand goods” to exclude secondhand goods consisting of fine metal, and secondhand goods to the extent they are manufactured or made from gold. Industry concerns 4.10 Industry representatives have expressed their concern with this treatment, as it does not provide relief for GST embedded in alloy gold, which becomes a cost borne by registered persons in the industry, contrary to the intention underlying GST as a tax on consumption. 4.11 It is argued that the rules in this area are poorly understood, and that practice between businesses varies. In particular, some businesses may be unaware of the special rules for gold, and may be claiming deductions for secondhand goods. This is said to distort competition between businesses which claim a deduction, and those that do not, as businesses taking the deductions bear a relatively lower cost in purchasing these goods, which can allow them to offer a higher price for secondhand gold. Therefore a business taking a deduction could have a significant advantage over its competitors. 4.12 Industry representatives have raised other concerns with the current treatment. The approach of excluding goods from the treatment is said to result in high compliance costs, as the gold component must be determined and valued, so that the deductible portion can be determined. It has been noted that the rules do not recognise the widespread use of gold in a variety of consumer goods, such as in electronics. 4.13 The treatment furthermore produces an incentive for unregistered persons to transact directly with each other, or for a registered person to act as agent of the seller, rather than purchasing the goods themselves. Policy considerations 4.14 Allowing deductions for secondhand goods recognises GST that is embedded in the price paid for these goods. A GST-registered business that acquires secondhand goods from a consumer will need to return GST when they resupply those goods; however, the goods have already been taxed when they were acquired by the consumer (who could not deduct GST). The effect is that, in the absence of this deduction, the secondhand goods will be taxed twice. Allowing a deduction results in a single layer of tax on these goods, while also taxing the value added by the business. 4.15 As discussed above, the exclusion of gold from the definition of “secondhand goods” reflects the fraud risk stemming from the difference in treatment of fine and non-fine gold, and the ability to convert these metals from a fine form to a non-fine form and back again. Officials understand that the costs involved in carrying out this conversion do not necessarily outweigh the 17 value of the deduction, and the scheme remains theoretically possible. This is because of the relative ease with which gold can be altered from a fine to a non-fine state. 4.16 However, conversion into alloy gold goods that would actually be supplied to consumers (such as jewellery) is a more expensive process. Therefore, the non-fine gold produced by the carousel arrangement would not be in the form of these manufactured goods, but instead be in an unprocessed state. Consumers are not expected to acquire gold in such a form. 4.17 This distinction could allow secondhand goods deductions for alloy gold goods, or goods with an alloy gold component. Secondhand goods could include goods that have been manufactured from alloy gold, such as jewellery or electronic circuitry, but exclude alloy gold that has not undergone a manufacturing process since being produced. 4.18 While there may be real commercial reasons for gold to be in such an unprocessed form – for example, gold filings from the production of jewellery may be collected and melted together before sale to a refiner – officials understand that in these cases, the supplier is likely to be GST- registered. Therefore, GST will be returned and deducted on the supply, and the rules for secondhand goods will not apply. Suggested solution 4.19 An amendment could be made to allow a deduction in respect of secondhand goods that are manufactured from non-fine gold, silver or platinum. This would exclude non-fine gold, silver and platinum that has not undergone additional manufacturing processes, and therefore still poses a fraud risk. In that case a deduction would still be unavailable. 4.20 This would recognise embedded GST, and reduce compliance costs by removing the need to determine the gold, silver and/or platinum content of those goods. Timing 4.21 An important question is the timing of any amendment. It has been argued that the rules are unclear. The unavailability of a deduction is in contrast to the normal position for secondhand goods, and is one of a limited number of exceptions to the rule ordinarily permitting a deduction. 4.22 The Commissioner has previously published her view on the treatment of gold, silver and platinum, in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 5, Number 13, “Gold and other fine metal – secondhand goods credit”. That article discusses a hypothetical scenario of a jeweller acquiring jewellery composed of non-fine gold, and only taking a deduction in respect of other metals mixed with gold to make the jewellery. However, it has been claimed that the exception could be interpreted as referring to the industry meaning of “gold”, “silver” and “platinum”, which is the fine metal form. This would exclude the fine metal component of a good that is not composed entirely o f 18 fine metal, but allow a deduction for non-fine metal. It has been suggested that a number of businesses may have already claimed deductions on this basis. 4.23 It is likely that in some cases these transactions may not have been economic in the absence of a deduction, and would not have been entered into. The unexpected liability to repay these amounts may have a significant effect on their business. As a deduction is only denied in respect of the gold component, it may also be difficult to determine the extent to which a deduction would have been available in respect of the other components of the good. 4.24 However, it is also important that any amendment be equitable between taxpayers. Officials suggest that any amendment be retrospective by four years before the date of enactment. This would provide certainty to taxpayers by allowing previously claimed deductions, while ensuring compliant taxpayers are not disadvantaged, by being able to claim deductions within the four-year period. 19 20 CHAPTER 5 Services directly in connection with land 5.1 New Zealand’s GST system is based on the destination principle, under which supplies of goods and services are taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed. This means services supplied to non- residents who are outside New Zealand will generally be zero-rated, as the services will be consumed overseas. 5.2 An exception applies where the service supplied is so closely connected with land that the location of the land is the most appropriate place of taxation. Section 11A(1)(k) zero-rates services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, unless the services are directly in connection with land or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. Similarly, services that are supplied directly in connection with land situated outside New Zealand will be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(e). 5.3 It should be noted that owning land in New Zealand can, in certain circumstances, affect the residence status of a person receiving services. This is because the definition of “resident” for GST purposes includes a person that carries on a taxable activity or any other activity in New Zealand, while having a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. For example, a person who carries on an activity of developing, dividing or dealing in land, or residential or commercial rental of a property, will be deemed to be resident in New Zealand for GST purposes. 5.4 It is clear that services will be supplied directly in connection with land when they have a direct physical effect on land, such as the construction, repair or maintenance of a building. It has been less clear how the test applies to supplies of professional or other services that do not in themselves have a direct physical effect on land. 5.5 Leading cases on the meaning of “directly in connection with” include Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR 7 and Wilson & Horton Ltd v CIR 8 . The courts have found that a service is not supplied directly in connection with land when it merely brings about or facilitates a transaction with a direct effect on land, or when the service could be described as being “one step removed” from such a transaction. 5.6 In light of these principles, Inland Revenue issued a Public Ruling on legal services provided to non-residents relating to transactions involving land in New Zealand, which concluded that these services are zero-rated. 9 This includes legal services relating to transactions that involve the change of ownership of land, such as the drafting of agreements for the sale and purchase of land. 7 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137. 8 (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221. 9 BR Pub 15/03 “Goods and Services Tax - legal services provided to non-residents relating to transactions involving land in New Zealand” Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 27, No. 3 (April 2015). 21 5.7 This interpretation is arguably inconsistent with the policy intent of the provisio n. The “directly in connection with land” test uses the location of land as a proxy for the place that a service is consumed, when the service has a very close relat ionship to land. The test was not intended to create a distinction between services that have a physical effect on land and other services that affect the legal nature of land, such as legal services that facilitate a change to the ownership of land. 5.8 The adoption of a “one step removed” test may also arguably result in certain other professional or intellectual services falling outside the scope of the provision, even though the service is supplied with the underlying purpose of affecting the physical or legal nature of land. 5.9 For example, one interpretation would be that services provided by real estate agents in facilitating a change in ownership of land are “one step removed” from a direct transaction. Similarly, architectural services could be argued to be “one step removed” from a transaction with a direct effect on land, being the construction of a building. Other professional or intellectual services will, on the other hand, have a direct effect on land, including those which define the nature or value of property, such as surveying and valuation services. 5.10 The OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines are intended to drive international consistency in the treatment of the place of supply for cross- border services and intangibles. This will best ensure that, in applying the destination model, double taxation and double non-taxation is mitigated. 5.11 For these reasons, this chapter reviews the “directly in connection with land” test. International approaches OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines 5.12 The OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines state that for supplies of services that are directly connected with immovable property, taxing rights may be allocated to the jurisdiction in which the immovable property is located. 10 The use of “directly connected” does not have an independent meaning in this context and is intended to narrow the scope of the rule to services that have a “very close, clear and obvious link or association” wit h immovable property. 5.13 The relationship with immovable property must be at the heart of the supply for the required level of connection to be present; it cannot be merely one aspect of a supply of services. The guidelines state that this connection would be satisfied for certain intellectual services, such as architectural services that relate to a clearly identifiable property. 10 OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines, April 2014. 22 Australia 5.14 In Australia, a supply that is made to an offshore non-resident will not be GST-free if the supply is directly connected with real property situated in Australia. 11 The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) considers that a supply will be “directly connected with real property” when the direct object of the supply is the real property, including in the sense that the supply changes or affects the nature, value or ownership of the real property. 12 5.15 Following the interpretation in Malololailai, the ATO considers that the supply of real estate agent services will not be directly connected with real property when it is merely a supply of marketing services in finding a willing purchaser for the property. However, a supply when a real estate agent is selling or auctioning real property for a non-resident will be directly connected with the property if the agent has the authority to sign the sale agreement on behalf of the non-resident. 5.16 A supply of architectural services to design a building for a particular site is considered to be directly connected with real property, as it has the purpose of affecting the nature of the real property. The ruling also considers that legal services that are directly connected with the disposal, acquisit ion or transfer of an interest in real property, such as conveyancing services or the preparation of a lease agreement, will be directly connected with real property. Canada 5.17 Canada excludes supplies of a service in relation to real property situated in Canada from zero-rating. This includes supplies of an advisory, professional or consulting service in relation to real property situated in Canada. 13 In applying this test, the Canada Revenue Agency considers whether the service is designed to serve a particular need or requirement arising fro m the property, and whether the relationship between the purpose or objective of the service and the property is reasonably direct. 14 A supply of services will generally be “in respect” of a Canadian property if the service is aimed at dealing with the transfer of ownership of, claims on or rights to the property, or determining the title to the property. 11 A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Act) 1999 (Cth), section 38-190(1). 12 GST Ruling 2003/7, Goods and Services Tax: what do the expressions 'directly connected with goods or real property' and 'a supply of work physically performed on goods' mean for the purposes of subsection 38-190(1) of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999? 13 Excise Tax Act 1985, Schedule VI, Part V, sections 7 and 23. 14 GST/HST Policy Statement P-169R, Meaning of in Respect of Real Property Situated in Canada and in Respect of Tangible Personal Property that Situated in Canada at Time the Service is Performed, for Purposes of Schedule VI, Part V, Sections 7 and 23 to the Excise Tax Act. 23 European Union 5.18 In the European Union, the place of supply of services that have a “sufficiently direct connection” with immovable property is where the property is situated. 15 Services are considered to have a sufficiently direct connection with immovable property where they are: • derived from immovable property and that property makes up a constituent element of the service and is central to, and essential for, the services supplied; • provided to, or directed towards, immovable property, having as their object the legal or physical alteration of that property. 16 5.19 Services which have a sufficiently direct connection under this test include the services of real estate agents in intermediating the sale or leasing of property, and architectural services that relate to a particular property. Legal services relating to the transfer of a title to property, or to establish or transfer interests or rights in property will also have a sufficiently direct connection to the property, even if the underlying transaction resulting in the legal alteration of the property is not carried through. Policy considerations Which services should be considered to have a direct connection with land? 5.20 The key consideration is which services have such a strong connection with land that its location should be treated as their place of consumption. 5.21 The “directly in connection with land” test was intended to encompass services that have a very close relationship with land, such that they are effectively consumed where the land is located. However, it is arguable that the test currently has limited application to intellectual or professional services, even when the service is supplied with an underlying purpose or objective of affecting the physical or legal nature of land. 5.22 A number of these services may be “one step removed” from a direct transaction that affects land but have a strong connection with land as their consumption would affect the nature or value of land. In considering whether the connection to land has been satisfied, a better approach may be to instead look at the service in the broader context of the purpose or objective that it serves, rather than looking to whether the service itself has a direct legal or physical effect on land. This approach would be in line with the OECD VAT/GST Guidelines, and with the approaches of other jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and the European Union. 5.23 The “directly in connection with land” requirement could be altered to include services where there is a direct relationship between the purpose or objective of the service and the land. This would include services that have 15 EU Directive 2006/112/EC, Article 45. 16 Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011, Article 31a. 24 the purpose of affecting the nature or value of land or affecting the ownership of any interest in land. 5.24 In particular, the following services would be regarded as having such a sufficiently close connection with land that they could be considered to be consumed where the land is located: • the assessment of the risk or integrity of land; • intermediation in the sale or lease of land, including by real estate agents and property managers; • architectural or design engineering services that relate to a particular site, including the drawing up of plans for a building or part of a building; • legal services relating to transactions involving the transfer of title to land or the establishment or enforcement of an interest in land (such as the drafting of agreements for the sale and purchase of land, lease agreements or construction agreements). Which services should not be considered to have a direct connection with land? 5.25 A service should not be considered to be supplied directly in connection with land when it does not clearly relate to designated land in New Zealand. This would include services such as: • advice or information about property prices or investment in the property market in general; • market research relating to the economic viability of a particular project; • architectural services which do not relate to a particular site; • advice on the tax implications of investing in property generally. 5.26 Further, a service would not be regarded as supplied directly in connection with land if the part of the service that relates to land is only an incidental aspect of the supply. For example, this may be the case when legal services are provided to establish a trust that will subsequently hold land. Suggested solution 5.27 We are suggesting that an amendment be made to clarify or alter the scope of the services that are supplied “directly in connection with land”, to include services where there is a direct relationship between the purpose or objective of the service and land. This would include services which have the purpose or objective of affecting or defining the nature or value of land, protecting land, or affecting the ownership or any interest in or right over land. 5.28 This would mean that the services of real estate agents, architects and legal services in respect of land in New Zealand would not be zero-rated when supplied to offshore non-residents. Similarly, where these services are 25 supplied in relation to land that is situated outside New Zealand, they would be zero-rated. This change would not affect the use of the phrase “directly in connection with” elsewhere in the GST Act. 5.29 A service would not be supplied directly in connection with land if it does not relate to a designated property, or when the part of the service that relates to land is only an incidental aspect of the supply. 5.30 The application date for the amendment is expected to be 1 April 2017. However, there are possible concerns in relation to the treatment before that date – for example, uncertainty as to the correct position for some services (excluding legal services) may gave rise to refund claims from the purchaser to the vendor or from the vendor to Inland Revenue. Submissions are therefore sought on the appropriateness of a “savings” provision for past tax posit ions. Example Eleanor, who is an Australian resident, comes to New Zealand with a view to buying a holiday home. After looking at potential areas, she returns to Australia and continues her search. At first, she seeks general advice from a New Zealand firm on the local property market and on the tax implications of such an investment. She hires a New Zealand-based real estate agent to search for a suitable property and negotiate the sale on her behalf. Savannah, a New Zealand solicitor, drafts a sale and purchase agreement which is signed by both parties. As the land is vacant, Eleanor hires a New Zealand architectural firm to draw up plans for a building to be constructed on the property. Under the suggested solution, these services would be standard-rated, except for the provision of general advice which would continue to be zero-rated. 26 CHAPTER 6 Zero-rating of land – commercial leases 6.1 Supplies of land between registered persons, where the land will be used in a taxable activity by the purchaser, are generally zero-rated, meaning no GST is charged by the vendor or deducted by the purchaser. The decision to zero- rate land was based around concerns with “phoenix” fraud, often involving land sold between associated entities. The purchaser would receive a refund of GST charged on the supply, but the vendor would deliberately wind up before making payment of the GST. 6.2 To avoid introducing significant compliance costs, and given the mult itude o f existing standard-rated commercial leases, commercial leases were excluded from the requirement to zero-rate supplies of land. An exception to this exclusion was certain long-term leases, with large up- front payments. These leases may be substitutable for a sale of land – posing a risk of phoenix fraud – and are therefore zero-rated. 6.3 Section 11(8D) contains the rules governing when commercial leases, and certain associated payments, will or will not be zero-rated. However, a number of technical issues have been identified in relation to these rules. 6.4 Unless otherwise specified, the suggested changes set out in this chapter would apply from 1 April 2011 (the date section 11(8D) first came into force), and provide for past positions to be preserved. Lease-related surrender payments 6.5 The first issue concerns the rule in section 11(8D)(a) which zero-rates supplies of an assignment or surrender of an interest in land. It is not clear that both of the two conceivable types of surrender payment – specifically payments from landlord to tenant and payments from tenant to landlord, would be zero-rated. 6.6 The wording of the provision fits well in the former scenario (landlord pays tenant), as the tenant is surrendering its leasehold estate (and so, in a sense, supplying an interest in land) in consideration for the payment. 6.7 However, the landlord will arguably not supply an interest in land; they are instead agreeing not to enforce their right to payment under the lease. Consequently, it is arguable that the rule will not apply in this scenario. However, both forms of surrender payment were intended to be zero-rated. Suggested solution 6.8 An amendment to section 11(8D)(a) is proposed, to clarify that a payment from tenant to landlord can also be zero-rated, when the supply of land to which it relates is a zero-rated supply of land. 27 Lump sum lease payments 6.9 When a large payment (in excess of 25 percent of the total consideration under the lease) is made, the payments under the lease are zero-rated. In some situations, this approach may arguably apply to retrospectively change the GST treatment of payments made prior to the large payment. This is because, as currently drafted, the zero-rating could apply to the entire supply of land not just the individual payments. Example Betty makes regular payments under a lease agreement. These payments are standard-rated and not subject to the zero-rating rules. At some point a large irregular payment is made. Consequently, the entire lease could now be treated as zero-rated, meaning that past and future payments under the lease are also zero-rated. If Betty was unable to anticipate this payment, and zero-rate previous payments, she will need to unwind the GST treatment of the previous payments, so that they are correctly zero-rated. 6.10 It was not intended that the payment would affect lease payments that were made before this large one-off payment. When GST has already been correctly returned, these payments do not pose the risk which the zero-rating rule was intended to address. Suggested solution 6.11 One approach would be to preserve tax positions taken in relation to lease payments made prior to the large one-off payment being made. Instead only the large one-off payment and all future payments would be zero-rated. 6.12 Alternatively, the paragraph could be amended to ensure that only the large one-off payment would be zero-rated and all other regular payments under the lease would remain standard-rated. 6.13 We prefer the first approach as it would align better with the treatment of up- front large one-off payments and the policy intent, which is to fully zero-rate leases which are substitutable for transfers of ownership. Periodic supplies 6.14 One of the requirements for a supply of land to be standard rated is that the supply be made “periodically” (section 11(8D)(b)(i)). This wording is intended to indicate a lease agreement. 6.15 A lease arrangement generally provides for a single continuous supply of the right to use land, wit h periodic payments. The timing rules treat this supply as a series of successive supplies. In particular, section 9(3) deems a supply with periodic payments to instead be a series of successive supplies, wit h the 28 timing of each supply determined by the earlier of the time of payment becoming due or being received. 6.16 Consequently, it is intended that the lease will be treated as a continuous series of successive supplies. There is a technical question, however, about whether this series of successive supplies would satisfy the requirement that the supply of land be made periodically. Suggested solution 6.17 This question could be resolved by an amendment to align the two provisions. The test for standard rating a commercial lease could be clarified to apply to supplies of land that are treated as a series of successive supplies under the timing rule in section 9(3) (agreements to hire, periodic payments, progressive supplies). The test for large, irregular, payments 6.18 Another issue with the test for standard rating relates to the requirements that a payment in advance of, or contemporaneous with, the supply must meet. These requirements are set out in section 11(8D)(b)(ii). 6.19 The test considers whether the amount totals 25 percent or less than the total consideration specified in the agreement, and relates to the longer of one- year or the shortest possible fixed-term of the agreement (that is, not including a renewal period), and is not itself a regular payment. 6.20 When an amount satisfies these criteria, the lease will be standard-rated. However, this could arguably allow a lease to be standard-rated, despite another amount also being paid or payable that does not satisfy the test. This potentially allows the test to be circumvented. The focus of the test might be clearer if it was on whether a payment is made that does not satisfy the criteria, rather than whether a payment is made that does. Suggested solution 6.21 The test could be amended to ensure that zero-rating is triggered where an amount is paid or payable under the lease that is not a regular payment, which exceeds 25 percent of the consideration specified in the agreement and which relates to the longer of one year or the shortest possible fixed term of the lease. Procurement of a lease 6.22 The Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 inserted a new paragraph (c) in section 11(8D), to ensure that payments for the procurement of a lease are subject to the zero-rating of land rules. When a lease cannot be assigned, the current tenant may contract with a prospective tenant, to seek the landlord’s agreement to enter into a new lease agreement with the prospective tenant. It was intended that the current 29 tenant’s (the vendor’s) services in procuring this agreement would be zero- rated. However, a further amendment may be required to ensure the provision works as intended. 6.23 Currently, this paragraph provides: “a supply of an interest in land by way of a procurement by a third party of an existing lease is a supply under subsection (1)(mb) if it meets the requirements set out in that subsection”. This implies the third party acquires the existing lease. However, the reason for the procurement is because the existing lease is incapable of being assigned, so it is necessary that the vendor (the current tenant) arranges a new lease between the purchaser (the prospective tenant) and landlord. Suggested solution 6.24 An amendment could be made to clarify that a payment to the existing tenant is zero-rated when the third party does not acquire the existing lease, but instead a new lease is created and the payment is for the vendor’s services in arranging a new lease. 6.25 The amendment could apply from 30 June 2014 (the effective date of paragraph (c)). The amendment would preserve existing positions previously taken. Land acquired by non-profit entities 6.26 The zero-rating of land rules apply to a supply of land between registered persons, when the purchaser acquires the land for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 6.27 Under section 20(3K), a non-profit ent it y that is registered for GST is treated as if all its supplies of goods and services are used for making taxable supplies, except when they are used to make exempt supplies. This allows a registered person to recover GST incurred for all the non-profit body’s non- exempt activities. The zero-rating of land rules and GST-registered non-profit entities 6.28 The zero-rating of land rules do not apply to the purchase of land by a GST- registered non-profit entity, which purchases the land for use in its non-profit activities. The supply is instead standard-rated, in which case the supplier must return GST and the non-profit body may deduct this amount. This is because section 20(3K) does not apply for the purposes of the zero-rating of land rules, and only applies for parts of the apportionment and adjustment rules that allow input tax deductions. Policy considerations 6.29 The zero-rating of land rules were introduced as a method of accounting for GST on land that avoided the fiscal risk in charging and refunding GST. Non-profit bodies should be treated in the same manner as other registered persons in relation to the sale and purchase of land. Zero-rating supplies of 30 land fro m a GST-registered person to a GST-registered non-profit entit y would be consistent with this policy intention. Suggested amendment 6.30 Section 20(3K) could be widened so that a supply of land by a registered person to a registered non-profit ent it y would be zero-rated when the non- profit entity acquires the land for use other than for making exempt supplies. 31 32 CHAPTER 7 Miscellaneous issues Time of supply when consideration is unknown 7.1 In general, the time at which a good or service is supplied is the earlier of when an invoice is issued or a payment is received. A person accounting on an invoice basis will return GST on the supply in the period where the time of supply has been triggered. 7.2 An exception to this rule is when goods are received under an agreement (other than a hire agreement), but the total consideration of the supply is not known at the time the goods are appropriated under that agreement. A timing rule (section 9(6)) splits the supply into different parts based on “the extent to which any payment under the agreement is due or received or an invoice has been issued”. Hence, the time of supply for each part is determined separately, and the supplier may return GST for each separate part. 7.3 Section 9(6) is limited in application to goods that are supplied under an agreement. The Act does not provide a similar rule for supplies of services. However, the same issue can arise in relation to supplies of services – for example, when the time of supply is triggered by the payment of a deposit, but the total consideration depends on the services performed. 7.4 In addit ion, the timing rule only applies when the goods are received under an agreement. However, the difficulty in accounting for GST is not confined to when the supply is received under an agreement, but could occur in any case when the time of supply has been triggered, prior to the final consideration payable being known. 7.5 An associated problem arises if the recipient of the supply requests a tax invoice. A tax invoice must be furnished within 28 days of the request, and is required to include the consideration for the supply, which may be unknown. This creates problems with the current invoicing rules, which permit the issue of only a single tax invoice in relation to a supply. 7.6 If the consideration for a supply is altered in certain ways, a debit or credit note may be issued to account for the variation. However, it is not clear that these rules apply when the consideration is not varied, but becomes known later. Suggested solution 7.7 The section 9(6) timing rule could be extended so that it applies to any supply of goods or services where the consideration has not been determined at the time a payment is first received or an invoice issued. The supply of goods or services would be deemed to be made to the extent that payment is due or received or an invoice issued. 33 7.8 Splitting the supply into multiple supplies, based on payment being made or due, or an invoice being issued would more clearly enable a supplier to return GST as the consideration becomes known, and allow for invoices to be issued in respect of each of these supplies. Agents acting for purchasers 7.9 Generally, when an agent acts on behalf of a person in making supplies of goods and services, the GST consequences will be the same as if the person performed those actions themselves. 7.10 In certain situations, a person may elect out of these rules. When an agent acts for a supplier, the parties may elect to “opt out” of the agency rules, and treat the supply as two separate supplies – between the principal and the agent, and between the agent and the recipient. 7.11 The amendment providing for this “opt out” was made in 2013 following concerns that some taxpayers’ billing systems would automatically issue a tax invoice. Where both the principal and agents’ systems did so, it could breach the rule providing for only a single tax invoice to be issued for each supply, as only one supply would in fact take place. The amendment ensured that this practice would not be in breach of that rule by effectively creating an “extra” supply. 7.12 This amendment also provided that the principal could not take a bad debt deduction for non-payment when the agent had been paid. This was to avoid a possible GST mismatch. 7.13 Officials are aware of some concerns arising when an agent is making purchases on behalf of their principal, and their billing system automatically issues a tax invoice to their principal. Currently, this would be seen as a single transaction between the principal and the supplier (who may have issued a tax invoice themselves) and the tax invoice issued by the agent may not be permitted. A purchaser and their agent cannot opt out of the agency rules and treat this as an additional supply. 7.14 However, the costs of altering systems to comply with these requirements may be high, as the systems may also need to address situations where the person is acting not as an agent, but in their own capacity, and a tax invoice may need to be issued. 7.15 Allowing for agents acting on behalf of purchasers and their principals to agree to opt out of the agency rules would reduce compliance costs in a similar way as for suppliers acting through an agent. It would also better align the GST system with what occurs in practice. Suggested solution 7.16 An amendment could be made to include an opt-out provision for purchasers and their agents, similar to the one for suppliers and their agents. A purchaser and their agent could agree to treat a supply or type of supply as 34 two separate supplies, being between the supplier and the agent, and the agent and principal. Using this provision would be optional – principals and their agents would not be required to treat a supply as two supplies. 7.17 Similar to the rules for suppliers’ agents, this amendment would address technical non-co mpliance. It would also be appropriate to limit the scope of the amendment to this purpose. As a base protection measure, the agent would be prohibited from taking a bad debt deduction for non-payment by their principal, the purchaser. Under existing rules, the agent would not be treated as making a supply, so would not receive a deduction for non- payment. Example The agent pays consideration to the supplier, and invoices their principal for reimbursement. The principal defaults, and the debt goes bad. If the agent and principal have opted out of the agency rules, under the suggested amendment, this will be in respect of a taxable supply, as below: However, previously there would not have been a taxable supply, and the agent would not be entitled to a bad debt deduction. Allowing a deduction therefore goes beyond the issue of compliance with the tax invoice rules. 7.18 The opt-out to the agency rules should only apply when the agent is New Zealand-resident. It is possible that a non-resident agent may receive supplies of services without GST applying, which are then provided to a New Zealand resident without attracting GST. Services performed on boats and aircraft exported under their own power 7.19 GST is not intended to be a tax on consumption that occurs outside New Zealand. Consequently, a variety of supplies of goods that are exported can be zero-rated, including the supply of a boat or aircraft that is to be exported under its own power by the recipient (although export must generally occur within 60 days of the purchaser receiving possession). 7.20 In addition, certain goods and services supplied in relation to goods that are to be exported can be zero-rated. This includes services supplied in relation to goods that have been entered for export by the supplier, and also certain goods and services provided in relation to temporary imports. For example, goods that are affixed to a temporarily imported boat in the course of repairs may be zero-rated. Purchaser (principal) Agent Supplier Payment Supply Default Supply 35 7.21 Goods and services supplied in relation to a boat or aircraft purchased in New Zealand, which is to be exported under its own power, cannot however currently be zero-rated. Example Thomas purchases a yacht from a GST-registered shipwright in New Zealand, which he will sail out of New Zealand within 60 days. Before sailing the yacht away from New Zealand, he arranges to have the yacht repainted, and for new railings to be installed around the sides. The shipwright can zero-rate the supply of the yacht, as it is exported under its own power within the prescribed timeframe. The supply of the railing and the repainting cannot be zero-rated. 7.22 The inability to zero-rate goods attached to, or services provided directly in connection to, newly purchased boats or aircraft which will be exported, seems anomalous. The consumption of these goods and services is unlikely to occur in New Zealand, and their supply should be zero-rated. 7.23 A newly purchased boat or aircraft that is to be exported under its own power must generally be exported within 60 days to qualify for zero-rating. This time period may be extended when certain circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and recipient prevent export within the time period. Suggested solution 7.24 An amendment could be made to ensure that these services and goods supplied in connection to boats or aircraft exported under their own power within 60 days of sale (as a zero-rated supply) are zero-rated. The circumstances when an extension to the 60- day time limit is available should be expanded to include when export cannot occur within this time period, due to this work being performed on the boat or aircraft. Non-resident registration rules – services received by a registered person 7.25 On 1 April 2014, rules in section 54B took effect that allow non-resident businesses to register for New Zealand GST in order to claim input deductions for certain business expenditure. The rules allow non-residents to register, where they satisfy certain criteria. 7.26 A legislative mismatch has inadvertently been created between section 54B(1)(c) and section 11A(2)(b). 36 7.27 Section 11A(2)(b) provides that a New Zealand supplier cannot zero-rate a supply to a non-resident if “it is reasonably foreseeable, at the time the agreement is entered into, that \[the ultimate recipient\] will not receive the performance of the services in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies” \[emphasis added\]. 7.28 The purpose of section 11A(2) is to ensure that, for example, the New Zealand provider of education services cannot zero-rate supplies made to a non-resident company when it is clear that the non-resident will in turn on- sell those services to an individual in their own jurisdiction. This ensures that private consumption of services in New Zealand continues to be appropriately taxed. 7.29 The effect of section 11A(2) could be undermined if the non-resident company in the example was able to register for GST in New Zealand and claim input deductions on the supply, but did not return output tax on the on- supply to the unregistered person. ( In theory, the non-resident is required to be registered and return output tax on the on-supply of the services to the ultimate consumer, but it is recognised that there are practical difficulties in enforcing tax liabilities on non-residents in these situations. As a result, the tax payable on the supply subject to section 11A(2) acts as a proxy for final consumption). 7.30 Section 54B(1)(c) prevents this registration. It provides that a non-resident cannot register if their taxable activity involves “a performance of services in relat ion to which it is reasonably foreseeable that the performance of the services will be received in New Zealand by a person who is not a registered person”. Because section 54B(1)(c) refers only to a person who is not a registered person it does not deal with supplies received by a sole trader in New Zealand, and enjoyed by that person in their individual capacity. The services, although received by “a registered person”, will not be received in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies – they will be privately consumed. 7.31 A non-resident making supplies to such a person would be arguably ent it led to register under section 54B. However, this result is contrary to the policy intent behind section 54B, because the services in question are, in essence, received outside the scope of the recipient’s taxable activity. Suggested solution 7.32 In section 54B(1)(c) “not a registered person” ought to be replaced by “a person that does not receive the performance of the services in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies”. 37 Non-resident registration rules – imported goods 7.33 The base maintenance provisions in sections 20(3LB) and (3LC) broadly cover the following scenario: • A non-resident registers for GST under section 54B. • The non-resident then sells a high-value good to a New Zealand recipient who is not GST-registered. • The time of supply is triggered while the good is still offshore, so no GST is payable. • The supplier, as part of the agreement, acts as importer of the goods and pays the import GST levied under section 12. • The supplier, as a registered person, then claims this import GST as a deduction and gets it refunded. • The goods are delivered to the ultimate New Zealand customer without a further imposition of GST. 7.34 Without the base maintenance provisions, the net result of this transaction is that there is no GST paid for a good that is consumed in New Zealand by an unregistered person. The base maintenance provisions negate this result by deeming the recipient of the goods to have paid the import GST rather than the registered non-resident. If the recipient is GST-registered, they can claim a deduction for the import GST. If the recipient is not registered, no refund is available and the GST would be payable. 7.35 The base maintenance provisions only apply when the non-resident supplier is registered under section 54B. To qualify to be registered under that section, the non-resident must anticipate claiming input deductions of greater than $500 in its first return. 17 If the non-resident’s only connection with New Zealand is as an importer, they may not satisfy the $500 test. 7.36 The legislation therefore currently creates a potential circularity. In the scenario described above, because the importer cannot register, the base maintenance provisions do not apply. Therefore, if the New Zealand customer is GST registered: • the customer could not claim the input deduction on the non-registered supplier’s/importer’s behalf; and • the unregistered non-resident supplier is liable for the import GST, which it cannot recover or on-charge. 7.37 The net result is a GST impost on a business-to-business transaction. It is recognised that this may be an undesirable policy outcome. 7.38 There are so me practical solutions to this issue. The right policy outcome would be achieved if the original transaction were subject to GST. This could be contractually arranged by the parties by ensuring that the goods 17 Section 54B(1)(b) imposes this requirement. 38 were in New Zealand at the time of supply. Alternatively, the recipient customer could be treated as the importer of the goods. In either case, assuming the customer was registered, it could claim the GST. 7.39 In this respect, we note that the imposition of this GST cost would have been there before the introduction of the non-resident registration rules. So, in effect, the new rules do not appear to be making anyone worse off. 7.40 Therefore, there is a question whether legislative change is necessary given that parties presumably have the option of returning to a previous practice that achieved a neutral outcome. However, the counter-argument, is that the legislation should provide a remedy for supply chains that are using a system whereby a GST cost is borne by businesses. Suggested solution 7.41 On balance, we consider a legislative amendment should be made. This could best be achieved by eliminating the section 54B(1)(b) requirement for a $500 input tax deduction if the person’s liability to pay GST is limited to GST paid under section 12. This would allow non-residents that operate only as importers the ability to register under section 54B. This in turn would allow the base maintenance provisions to work as intended and push the GST liability onto the New Zealand customer. Goods moved offshore by GST-registered non-residents 7.42 A registered person who incurs GST on goods paid to the NZ Customs Service on importation and purchased to make taxable supplies may deduct this GST to the extent that the goods or services are used to make taxable supplies. 7.43 One requirement of a taxable supply is that it is made in New Zealand. Supplies will be made in New Zealand when the supplier is a resident of New Zealand, but not when the supplier is a non-resident unless the goods supplied are in New Zealand at the time of supply, or the services supplied are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. 7.44 An issue arises when a GST-registered person, who is only a resident to the extent they carry on activities in New Zealand, takes a deduction for GST charged on goods in New Zealand, and subsequently exports those goods while retaining ownership. 7.45 When these goods are subsequently exported, they will no longer be used to make taxable supplies, as supplies made by non-residents are generally deemed to be made outside New Zealand, with certain exceptions. 7.46 A consequence of this is that the apportionment and adjustment rules will require the person to repay some or all of the GST they deducted when they purchased those goods. This effectively taxes goods ultimately consumed outside New Zealand by the claw-back of deductions. 39 Example Virginia is an Australian singer, who comes to New Zealand on tour. She plans to sell merchandise at her concerts and is GST-registered. When she imports the merchandise, she pays GST to NZ Customs and claims a deduction for the GST in her GST return. At the end of the tour, any unsold merchandise is exported to the next destination of the tour, and sold there. As she is a non-resident and supplying goods outside New Zealand, she is no longer using the merchandise to make taxable supplies. She must therefore adjust the input tax deduction claimed. 7.47 This issue is restricted to non-residents. The Act deems goods supplied by a New Zealand resident as being supplied in New Zealand and the zero-rating rules ensure that this does not result in GST being charged on supplies of goods and services which are consumed outside New Zealand. This means a New Zealand resident may retain any GST deducted on those exported goods. 7.48 This issue is also further restricted to non-residents who are not registered under the special non-resident registration rule (section 54B). Non-residents registered under this rule may deduct GST charged on goods or services, when they are used to make supplies outside New Zealand, which would be taxable supplies if made and received in New Zealand. 7.49 This result seems inconsistent with the purpose of GST, as it results in GST effectively being imposed on consumpt ion outside New Zealand, through the denial of deductions. 7.50 It also results in a different GST outcome for the affected group compared with residents and non-residents registered under the non-resident registration rule, who may generally deduct GST incurred on goods used for business purposes, regardless of where they are used. 7.51 This is a relatively new issue. Prior to the application of the current apportionment rules, from April 2011, the non-taxable use of these goods would be taxed through a deemed supply, which was zero-rated in this situation. Consequently, the problem would not have arisen. Suggested solution 7.52 Officials consider that where a non-resident, registered under the ordinary registration rules, acquires goods and applies them to make supplies through their overseas business activities, they should be able to treat those supplies as being made and received in New Zealand. 40 Grouping limited partnerships 7.53 Currently, limited partnerships are specifically included within the “company” definition in section 2 of the Act. This change was made by the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. As a result, limited partnerships are treated differently to general partnerships, which are GST entities by virtue of the “person” definition including an “unincorporated body of persons”. 7.54 Given there are relatively few provisions in the Act that apply specifically to “companies”, it is rare that this distinction actually means that limited partnerships are treated differently to general partnerships. However, one area where this distinction results in a difference in treatment is the grouping provisions (section 55). 7.55 Under section 55(1), a company is generally only eligible to group with other companies if they are part of a “group of companies” for the purposes of section IC 3 of the Income Tax Act. A limited partnership is not usually a “company” for income tax purposes, so there is a question as to whether an limited partnership could take advantage of section 55. There is an interpretative argument that these provisions can only be read sensibly if “company” in this context takes on its GST Act definition, but this is not clear. 7.56 There is a general grouping provision that applies to allow other entities to form a GST group if two or more registered persons exercise sufficient control over a collection of entities (section 55(8)). This is achieved by application to the Commissioner and allows collections of, for example, trusts to register as a group. However, section 55(8) specifically excludes “co mpanies” fro m its ambit – on the assumption that companies will be eligible to group under section 55(1). 7.57 This combination of provisions leaves the possibility that limited partnerships may be the only entity that cannot group for GST purposes. We do not consider there is a policy justification for singling out limited partnerships in this way. The question is whether section 55(1) or section 55(8) should be amended to address this. 7.58 There is a potential difficulty in assuming that limited partner rights will always equal appropriate “voting interests”, as required to group under the section 55(1) test. In contrast, grouping under section 55(8) is governed by a control test, where entities that are controlled by each other, or the same person or partnership, may form a GST group, and this may be more easily applied in the limited partnership situation. Suggested solution 7.59 We suggest that limited partnerships be able to group under section 55(8). 41 42 CHAPTER 8 Administration Six-monthly taxable periods 8.1 The default tax filing period for GST returns is two monthly. However, if a registered person makes or is likely to make taxable supplies that exceed $24,000,000 in a 12-month period, they must file monthly. Taxpayers can choose to file GST returns on a six monthly basis if they do not make, or are not likely to make, over $500,000 in taxable supplies in a 12-month period. 8.2 Section 15C(2) provides a discretion for the Commissioner to allow a registered person to file on a six-monthly basis, even though their taxable supplies exceed this threshold. This is intended to reduce compliance costs for businesses that have only just reached the threshold, and for businesses that operate on a seasonal basis (for which accounts are generally prepared at the end of the season). For these taxpayers, the compliance costs associated with two-monthly filing may be disproportionately high when balanced against the benefit to the Government in revenue terms. Example Dwight operates a ski-hire shop, which is only open during winter. During the other months, Dwight leaves New Zealand. If Dwight filed two-monthly GST returns, he would need to file a number of nil returns while outside New Zealand. 8.3 Section 15C(2) provides factors for the Commissioner to consider in exercising her discretion to allow a registered person who exceeds the $500,000 threshold to file on a six-monthly basis. These factors are: • the person's history in filing returns and paying tax liabilities; • the person's financial reporting practices; • the nature and volume of the person's taxable supplies; • the previous use of a six-month cycle. 8.4 Inland Revenue has published guidelines on how it will exercise this discretion, which state that Inland Revenue will consider whether the taxpayer: • has a good compliance history; • has satisfactory record-keeping practices and the cost of more regular filing would be excessive; and 43 • the value of annual taxable supplies is subject to seasonal or low volume / high value cashflow peaks. 18 8.5 When the exception to the $500,000 threshold for six-monthly filing was introduced in 2000, it was created as a discretion to be exercised by Inland Revenue. This reflected the approach at the time where Inland Revenue directed taxpayers to file using particular taxable periods. 8.6 Since then, amendments have been made to reduce compliance and administrative costs by allowing registered persons to self-assess their filing basis, depending on their volume of taxable supplies. Consistent with this approach, the discretion in section 15C(2) could be replaced with a test that allows a registered person to determine whether they are eligible for six- monthly filing, even though they have exceeded the $500,000 threshold. 8.7 The test would be designed to achieve the same policy intent as the current discretion, which is targeted to apply to seasonal businesses and those that have only just exceeded the threshold. The test could allow six-monthly filing where a registered person makes most or all of their taxable supplies in one season, or for “one-off” occasions when they have exceeded the threshold but expect to remain under the threshold in future. 8.8 The “one-off” exception recognises that there may be factors that distort a registered person’s pattern of taxable supplies, which could cause them to exceed the threshold but may not be repeated. In these cases, it is appropriate to relieve the registered person from incurring the compliance costs of adjusting to file returns on a more regular basis, such as changing their accounting system and practices. 8.9 A registered person would qualify for the “one-off” exception when they have exceeded the threshold for six-monthly filing in one taxable period, but are not likely to make taxable supplies over $500,000 in a 12-month period following that taxable period. This means that, for example, if a registered person has exceeded the threshold due to a steady increase in taxable supplies over time, they would not qualify for the exception. 8.10 The exception would only be available on a “one-off” basis, as if the registered person makes or is likely to make taxable supplies of over $500,000 in a 12-mo nth period fo llowing the taxable period in which the exception is used, they would be required to change to two-monthly filing. 8.11 Consistent with the current discretion, the exception would only be available if the taxpayer has met their GST obligations to file and pay on time in the past. Taxpayers that have previously failed to comply with their obligations pose a greater future compliance risk and should not be allowed to file less regularly than other taxpayers that exceed the threshold. For the purposes of the test, the taxpayer’s compliance history could be measured over the previous two years (or since registration if they have been registered for less than two years). 18 GNL-420 Six-monthly GST return threshold (December 2001). 44 8.12 A registered person would be required to monitor their eligibility for six- monthly filing, and to notify Inland Revenue if they no longer met the requirements to file on this basis. Unless the exception applied, where a registered person had exceeded the $500,000 threshold they would be required to file on a one or two-monthly basis as necessary. Suggested solution 8.13 The Commissioner’s discretion would be replaced with a test that a registered person can apply to determine whether they are eligible for six- monthly filing despite exceeding the $500,000 threshold. 8.14 The exception would apply: • when a registered person makes most or all of their taxable supplies in one season; or • on a one-off basis, where a registered person has exceeded the six- monthly filing threshold but is not likely to make taxable supplies of over $500,000 in the 12-month period following the taxable period in which they have exceeded the threshold; and • the registered person has met their GST obligations to file and pay on time in the past two years (or since registration if they have been registered for less than two years). 8.15 This amendment could also resolve a number of minor technical issues that have been identified with the current drafting of section 15C. The changes would apply from a registered person’s next taxable period following enactment of the amending legislat ion. Notification that a refund is being withheld 8.16 If a person’s input tax deductions exceed their output tax liability, a refund is available. Section 46 provides for the Commissioner to withhold refunds that have been claimed in order to investigate the circumstances of a return. If the Commissioner wishes to withhold a payment while she investigates a return, she must notify the registered person of her intention within 15 working days. 8.17 The Court of Appeal in Inland Revenue v Sea Hunter Fishing Ltd (2002) 20 NZTC 17,468 found that this means that the taxpayer must have received the notice or have been deemed to have received the notice in the ordinary course of post in this timeframe. 8.18 The current approach of setting the time limit with reference to when the notice is received, rather than when it is issued, is not consistent with other notice provisions contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 8.19 Setting the time limit by reference to the time that the notice is issued would provide greater certainty for both parties in determining when the notice requirements under the provision have been met, as the time when the notice 45 is issued is a more definite requirement that can be more easily determined by both parties. It would also ensure that the timeframe for Inland Revenue to perform checks is not affected by changes to postal delivery schedules. 8.20 The change would also better enable Inland Revenue to conduct appropriate checks within the legislative time limit without resorting to issuing a formal notice. The proposed change would be unlikely to result in delays for taxpayers. Suggested solution 8.21 The requirement that the Commissioner notify the registered person of the withheld refund within 15 days following the day the return is received could be replaced with a requirement that the Commissioner issue the notice within the specified period. Refunds when tax is overpaid, due to a clear mistake or oversight 8.22 The time period in which a registered person may be refunded overpaid tax is generally within four years of the overpayment. When the overpayment of tax is the result of a clear mistake or simple oversight, this period may be extended by a further four years. 8.23 Currently, the extended period under section 45(4) only applies when: • tax has been overpaid as a result of an amended assessment that increased the amount payable (section 45(2)); or • tax has been overpaid as a result of the registered person being paid less than the refund that they were entitled to in the period (section 45(3)). 8.24 The extended period is not available for an overpayment of tax that falls within section 45(1), which applies when a registered person has paid tax in excess of the amount properly payable in the period. This is an anomalous outcome that does not reflect the policy intent of the provision. Suggested solution 8.25 An amendment should be made to section 45(4) to allow the extension of the time limit in which the Commissioner must refund overpaid tax to circumstances in which section 45(1) applies. Officials suggest that this amendment should apply for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005, which was the date on which the current provision applied. 46

It reduces the profit company’s taxable income and its tax liability while reducing the amount of losses the loss company would otherwise carry forward to a future period. It is commonly known as loss grouping. 1.2 Another established practice is attaching imputation credits to dividends paid by a company. These represent tax already paid by the company, or tax-paid income received by the company. A problem can arise for a profit company fo llo wing loss grouping. By reducing its tax the profit company also has fewer imputation credits to pass on to shareholders. 1.3 If the profit company is not wholly owned by another company, the lack of imputation credits may result in additional tax being payable by the shareholders of the profit company upon the payment of a partially imputed dividend. This effectively negates the benefit of loss grouping, and can result in over-taxation of corporate profits. 1.4 Because this issue does not arise when the profit company is wholly owned by a corporate parent (as a result of the inter-corporate dividend exemption), the current tax settings may create an incentive for 100 percent, rather than partial, corporate acquisitions in circumstances where this may not be the most economically efficient outcome. 1.5 This issues paper proposes that a loss co mpany be able to transfer imputation credits to a profit company in conjunction with undertaking a loss offset. The imputation credit transfer mechanism would allow the profit company to pay a fully imputed dividend despite engaging in loss grouping; thus removing any potential economic distortions created by the existing rules. This paper seeks readers’ views on whether the proposed solution is workable and appropriate.

The issue is outlined below, and the associated consequences of it are also explained. The two sets of tax rules which underlie this issue are the loss grouping rules (found in subpart IC of the Income Tax Act 2007) and the imputation rules (found in subpart OB of the Income Tax Act 2007). 2.2 When a profit company and loss company engage in loss grouping less income tax is paid which results in the profit company receiving fewer imputation credits than it would have had it not engaged in loss grouping. 2.3 Having fewer imputation credits becomes an issue when that profit company later chooses to pay a dividend to its shareholders and the companies are not wholly owned. Unless the profit company is wholly owned by a corporate parent, the dividend will be taxable, and the imputation credits in the pro fit company’s imputation credit account will determine whether it is able to fully impute that dividend. In so me cases, the profit company will have insufficient imputation credits to enable it to pay a fully imputed dividend. This results in a tax impost for the shareholder upon distribution of the loss- sheltered profits, effectively clawing back the benefit of the loss grouping. 2.4 This issues paper discusses whether this inability for non-wholly owned companies to fully impute dividends as a result of loss grouping is appropriate; and, if not, what a feasible so lut ion may be. 2.5 A brief discussion of the policy underlying the two sets of tax rules is set out below. Imputation rules 2.6 Imputation is a mechanism that allows the benefit of income tax paid at the company level to be passed through to shareholders by attaching imputation credits to dividends paid by the company to its shareholders. Resident recipients of imputation credits may use the credits to offset the amount of tax they would otherwise be liable to pay on those dividends. 2.7 Dividends paid between members of wholly owned corporate groups are generally exempt income (referred to as the inter-corporate dividend exemption). 3 Loss grouping rules 2.8 The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the sharing of losses between companies that are in the same “group of companies”, that is, they have at least 66 percent common ownership. If a company has made a loss it may elect to make the benefit of the loss available to another group company that is in profit. 2.9 Offsetting some or all of the loss against the net income of the profit company means the profit company will not be liable to pay as much tax as it would otherwise. However a consequence of paying less tax is that the company will generate fewer imputation credits than it otherwise would have. 2.10 Group companies can choose whether to effect the loss offset by way of a subvention payment, or simply by electing to offset the amount (or a combination of loss offset elect ion and subvention payment). A subvention payment is a deductible payment from the profit company to the loss company in return for the use of the loss. The subvention payment is assessable income to the loss company (thus it extinguishes the loss company’s tax losses). 2.11 There are several conditions that must be met in order for companies to undertake a loss offset. In particular, the two companies must have at least 66 percent commo n shareholding interests from the start of the income year in which the tax loss arose to the end of the income year in which the tax loss is grouped. 2.12 The policy underlying loss grouping is essentially a consolidation or “single economic entity” policy. If two companies have 100 percent commo n ownership, it is economically equivalent to conducting the same two activities through a single company. If the ultimate shareholders have a choice between operating an identical enterprise through a single company, or through two companies, tax consequences should not distort the decisio n – the choice should be made for commercial reasons. For historic reasons, 1 this consolidation policy was extended to 66 percent co mmonly owned companies for the loss grouping regime only. In contrast, the inter-corporate dividend exemption applies only to a true “single economic enterprise” scenario – that is, within a wholly owned corporate group (100 percent common ownership). 1 The grouping of profits and losses of companies with “substantially the same” shareholders or under common control was originally an anti-avoidance provision that was introduced when New Zealand had a progressive company tax rate; see section 141 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. This was designed to prevent a business being broken into a number of separate companies to avoid the higher marginal tax rates. Following amendments in 1968, the Commissioner no longer had to invoke avoidance to assess group companies (now defined to be companies with two-thirds common ownership) at the tax rate that would apply to the aggregate taxable income of the group. The corollary of this automatic aggregation of group income was the ability of group companies to use subvention payments to group tax losses. It was originally proposed that grouping of income would occur at 50 percent commonality and subvention payments could be made at 75 percent commonality. Ultimately, the two- thirds threshold was adopted for both income and losses. New Zealand’s 66 percent commonality threshold for loss grouping is substantially lower than other OECD countries – notably Australia which only allows grouping within a consolidated group (which requires 100 percent common ownership). 4 Interaction of the two regimes 2.13 Issues arise, however, when the two regimes interact and the ownership is greater than 66 percent but less than 100 percent. Losses can be grouped but tax is also reduced with consequently fewer imputation credits generated. If the profit company subsequently wishes to pay an imputed dividend to one of its corporate group shareholders the profit company may have insufficient imputation credits to be able to fully impute the dividend. 2 2.14 This is only problematic when there is a minority shareholder in the profit company, that is, commo n shareholding between the loss company and profit company is 66 percent or higher, but less than 100 percent and the profit company does not have additional imputation credits from past tax payments. If the loss company and profit company are within a wholly owned group of companies (100 percent commonly owned), the inter-corporate dividend exemption means that lack of imputation credits to fully impute dividends is not an issue. 2.15 For shareholders in a non-wholly owned profit company, the receipt of an unimputed or partially imputed dividend is an issue for them as they will be required to pay extra tax. This is particularly the case when there is an unrelated minority shareholder who may not have benefitted fro m the loss grouping, but still suffers as a result of the reduced imputation credits. 3 2.16 As discussed above, this issue arises because the underlying policy approach to groups of companies for the dividend regime and the loss grouping regime differs. Example 2.17 Diagram 1 sets out an example of how this issue arises in practice. It shows a loss company which has a 90 percent shareholding in a profit company (which makes those companies eligible to group losses). It shows the profit company making a subvention payment for the use of the loss company’s losses, 4 and the subsequent dividends paid out by the profit company being only partially imputed. This results in the shareholders of the profit company having to pay extra tax on the dividends they receive, which they would not have had to pay if t he loss grouping had not occurred and tax had been paid at the company level. The minority shareholder has not benefited from the loss offset, and, in fact, has been disadvantaged relative to the situation where no loss offset had occurred. 2 This will ultimately depend on whether the profit company has additional imputation credits from tax paid on other profit streams. 3 We note however that minority oppression rules in company law would generally require that the loss offset was done in a manner that does not disadvantage the minority shareholders. 4 In the example, the full $10,000 tax loss is transferred from LossCo to ProfitCo via a combination of a 28 percent subvention payment and a loss offset election for the remaining $7,200 tax loss. 5 Diagram 1: A loss offset by a 90 percent shareholding company 5 2.18 The following tables set out the relevant entries in the imputation credit accounts of the loss company and the profit company. Table 1: LossCo imputation credit account Debit Credit Dividend received $2,520 Tax paid $1,814 Dividend paid ($1,534) Balance $2,800 Table 2: ProfitCo imputation credit account Debit Credit Tax paid $2,800 Dividends paid ($2,520) ($280) Balance $0 2.19 This example highlights the outcome when the loss grouping rules interact with the imputation regime. Namely, the overlay of the imputation regime effectively claws back some of the benefit afforded by the loss grouping rules. The shareholders pay extra tax of $2,016 ($1,814 by the majority shareholder and $202 by the minority shareholder). The minorit y 5 All shareholders are assumed to be on a 28% tax rate to keep the diagrams and examples as simple as possible.

The majorit y shareho lder is also worse off than if the loss grouping had not occurred, provided they could have eventually used the loss against other income. 2.20 Another way of looking at this, is that if the activities of ProfitCo and LossCo were carried on directly by the corporate shareholders, the total tax payable on the $10,000 net income would be $2,800 (an effective tax rate of 28 percent). However, because ProfitCo and LossCo are not part of a wholly owned group, the interaction of the loss grouping and imputation rules means that the total tax payable on the $10,000 of group net income is $4,816 (although additional imputation credits are generated). Why is there a need to address this issue? 2.21 Officials have been advised that the interaction of the regimes described above may be causing problems in practice and distorting economic decisions. For example, a company considering acquiring 66 percent or more of the shares in another company is currently incentivised to acquire 100 percent of the target company in order to access the inter-corporate dividend exemption to avoid the issue identified above which ultimately results in an additional tax cost to shareholders. This suggests that interaction of these two regimes could be distorting potential business combinations. This could provide an incentive to shut out minority investors, and could prevent an owner/operator or key employees retaining a stake in the company when they sell more than 66 percent of that company to an investor. 2.22 Shareholder companies may be more likely to be in tax loss when they have recently undertaken a debt-financed acquisition of another company because the acquisition vehicle normally bears the interest costs on the debt funding. This suggests that this issue may be more prevalent in the context of mergers and acquisitions. 2.23 Officials have also been advised that this is one factor that could act as a barrier to partial corporate listings on the New Zealand stock exchange (NZX) – because losing 100 percent common ownership via listing means the inter-corporate dividend exemption is no longer available. 2.24 Thus removing this issue for commercially desirable transactions could have flow-on benefits for the New Zealand economy – both in terms of facilitating New Zealanders retaining a minority stake in a successful New Zealand company and increasing the attractiveness of listing on the NZX resulting in a deeper capital market. 7 8 CHAPTER 3 Suggested solution 3.1 Officials want to ensure that the current tax rules do not potentially hinder legitimate business structures or distort behaviour – for example, by driving investors to acquire 100 percent of a company solely to access the inter- corporate dividend exemption. Such a decision would not ordinarily make good business sense in the absence of tax as a factor. 3.2 Accordingly, the aim of any proposed solution will be to equalise the tax treatment between a wholly owned group engaging in loss grouping and a non-wholly owned group undertaking an equivalent loss grouping. 3.3 Officials therefore suggest that companies engaging in a loss offset should, by mutual agreement, be allowed to perform an “imputation credit transfer”. 3.4 The imputation credit transfer would involve, as part of a loss grouping arrangement, the loss company debiting its imputation credit account and the profit company crediting its imputation credit account by the same amount. It is proposed that the respective debit and credit to the imputation credit accounts would occur at the same time as the payment of the dividend by the profit company to facilitate the full imputation of that dividend. 3.5 Continuing on from the previous example the following diagrams set out how an imputation credit transfer would work in practice, and the effect on the imputation credit accounts of the loss company and the profit company. 3.6 As discussed previously, the profit company has a taxable profit of $20,000 and (through a combination of loss offsets and subvention payments) offsets the loss from the loss company of $10,000 giving a net taxable profit to the profit company of $10,000. $2800 income tax is then paid generating an imputation credit of $2800 as shown in Table 4. 3.7 Then subsequently when a dividend is paid by the profit company of its entire net of tax profit ($20,000 - $2800) = $17,200, an imputation credit transfer relating to the tax effect of loss offset $2800 can occur between the loss company and the profit company. The debit is shown in Table 3 and the credit in Table 4. 9 Diagram 2: Loss grouping by a 90 percent shareholding company with an imputation credit transfer 3.8 The following tables set out the relevant entries in the imputation credit accounts of the loss company and the profit company once the tax has been paid and the dividend made from ProfitCo to LossCo and Minorit y shareholder. Table 3: LossCo’s imputation credit account Debit Credit Balance Opening balance 0 Imputation credit transfer $2,800 $2,800 Dr Dividend received from ProfitCo $5,040 $2,240 Cr Dividend paid to Ultimate shareholder $2,240 0 Table 4: ProfitCo’s imputation credit account Debit Credit Balance Opening balance 0 Tax paid $2,800 $2,800 Cr Imputation credit transfer $2,800 $5,600 Cr Dividend to ProfitCo $5,040 $560 Cr Dividend to Minority shareholder $560 0 3.9 The imputation credit transfer would mean that the profit company received extra imputation credits. This would enable the profit company to fully Inland Revenue Minority shareholder ProfitCo $20,000 LossCo ($10,000) Ultimate shareholder $8,000 dividend: $5,760 cash + $2,240 ICs $2,000 dividend: $1,440 cash + $560 ICs $18,000 dividend: $12 , 960 cash + $5,040 ICs Group net income = $10,000 $10,000 interest $2 ,800 tax $2, 800 ICs $2,800 subvention payment $2,800 imputation credit transfer 10 impute a subsequent dividend, as if it had paid tax on its taxable income before taking into account the loss grouping. This would consequently put the shareholders of the profit company in a better position, as the dividend they receive is more likely to be fully imputed. 3.10 The after-tax return to the shareholders, the tax paid by both the loss company and the profit company, and the imputation credit account balances are the same as they would be if the inter-corporate dividend exemption applied. If ProfitCo were instead a limited partnership, the tax paid and imputation credits generated would also be the same. 3.11 Other than the imputation shopping rules in paragraph 3.19 officials do not propose changing any other rules as a consequence of allowing companies to perform this imputation credit transfer. For example, the loss co mpany would need to have sufficient imputation credits in its imputation credit account to undertake the transfer (although it may take into account the imputation credits it will receive when it receives the dividend) and no relief would be afforded if the loss company’s imputation credit account was in debit at 31 March each year as a result of debiting imputation credits for the purposes of the imputation credit transfer. 3.12 In practice, we anticipate that taxpayers would manage the imputation credits in their accounts. For example taxpayers could choose to prepay tax in order to generate imputation credits, and ensure that the loss company’s imputation credit account is not in debit at 31 March each year. Details of the suggested solution Optional mechanism 3.13 The imputation credit transfer mechanism would apply at the option of the participating companies. Companies that chose to use the mechanism would not be locked into using it every time they engaged in loss grouping in the future. 3.14 The two companies would be required to agree whether or not to use this proposed mechanism – this could not be a unilateral decision. Other corporate structures 3.15 The example above involves a parent company in tax loss and a profitable subsidiary. However, loss grouping can also occur between a profitable parent and a subsidiary with tax losses, or sister companies (one in profit and one in loss). 3.16 Officials do not believe the proposed solution needs to be extended to a corporate group where the profit company is the parent and the loss company is the subsidiary. It is the profit company (parent) that requires the addit ional imputation credits to pay a fully imputed dividend to its shareholders and there is already a mechanism in the Income Tax Act 2007 – the taxable bonus issue – that allows a subsidiary to transfer imputation credits to its 11 parent freely. Accordingly, if the loss company wanted to transfer imputation credits to its parent under the proposed mechanism, it is already able to do so under existing provisions. 3.17 Officials believe that the proposed imputation credit transfer mechanism should also be available to sister companies with a common corporate parent that owns between 66 percent and 100 percent of both the profit and the loss company. This is because the same issue arises if the profit company subsidiary has insufficient imputation credits as a result of a loss offset with its sister company to pay a fully imputed dividend to its parent company. The parent company in this scenario faces the same incentive to acquire 100 percent of the profitable subsidiary to access the inter-corporate dividend exemption. Therefore, the proposed solution should also be extended to this corporate configuration. 3.18 In this situation, as the common corporate parent rather than the profit company would receive the dividend, the profit company would not receive an imputation credit to offset the debit from the credit transferred to the loss company. 3.19 In this situat ion, compared with the examples previously outlined, there is greater potential for there to be an outstanding debit in the profit company with the attendant imputation credit shopping risks. For this reason the existing imputation credit shopping rules which apply to wholly owned groups that have loss balances will also be extended to groups where an imputation credit transfer has arisen. Requirement to maintain an imputation credit account (ICA) 3.20 Only companies that are eligible to maintain an imputation credit account (mainly New Zealand resident companies) would be able to elect to undertake an imputation credit transfer. Timing of the imputation credit transfer 3.21 Officials propose that the imputation credit transfer (both the debit and credit) should occur at the same time the profit company pays the dividend which utilises the imputation credits. This is the time at which the issue of insufficient imputation credits arises and mitigates the risk that this mechanism could be used as a way of imputation credit shopping. It removes the need for a claw-back mechanism if a loss company transfers imputation credits to a profit company and then liquidates with a debit balance in its imputation credit account. 3.22 However the imputation credit shopping risk can still arise in situations involving sister companies and so the proposal to extend those rules to companies who leave a group but have previously made an imputation credit transfer should mitigate against this risk. 3.23 Officials acknowledge that the profit company may choose the timing of its dividend payment unilaterally, and it could occur at a time that is difficult for the loss company in terms of a requirement to debit its imputation credit 12 account. For example, the dividend payment might occur very shortly before 31 March. In this case the imputation credit transfer could result in the loss company having a debit balance in its imputation credit account at 31 March and not having time to remedy this. However this is unlikely to occur as a matter of course, because: • where the loss company is the company that is receiving the dividend, it will receive imputation credits attached to that dividend that will offset the debit that has arisen to its imputation credit account as a result of the imputation credit transfer (noting that the debit does not arise unt il the profit company pays the dividend); • there is likely to be a high level of coordination between the profit and loss companies required to effect loss grouping, and the need for a mutual imputation credit transfer election, such that in practice this timing requirement should not be problematic; and • the proposed imputation credit transfer is elective, and companies are unlikely to apply it if it were to result in a loss company having a debit balance in its imputation credit account at 31 March. 3.24 There could be a substantial period of time (even years) between the loss grouping and the subsequent payment of dividends by the profit company. This would require companies to track their loss grouping transactions and ensure they complete the relevant imputation credit transfer elections at the appropriate time. 3.25 Further detail on this process is covered below. It is also possible that when the time comes for the profit company to pay a dividend, the loss company may not be in a position to be able to transfer imputation credits or may have even ceased to exist. These practical difficulties need to be balanced against the need to protect the tax base (as discussed above). Officials propose the risk to the tax base could be partially mitigated by only allowing an imputation credit transfer within four years of the balance date of the return that included the loss grouping. How many credits should be transferred? 3.26 Officials propose that the amount of credits which would be able to be credited (and debited) will be capped. The upper level which is proposed is: ( amount of subvention payment + amount of loss offset election ) × the company tax rate 6 3.27 In the example above, this means that the maximum number of imputation credits which could be transferred would be $2,800 (($2,800 subvention payment + $7,200 loss offset election) x 28%). The companies could agree to credit and debit a smaller number of imputation credits, so long as the credit and debit amounts were equal. 6 The company tax rate for the return that included the loss offset. 13 Process 3.28 Officials propose that both companies would need to inform the Commissioner of their election to engage in the imputation credit transfer as part of filing the imputation credit account return that included that transfer. Similar to the current loss grouping notification requirements, the prescribed form will require: • the names and IRD numbers of both parties to the imputation credit transfer; • the quantum of imputation credits debited and credited from and to each account; • identification of the return that included the original loss grouping transaction; • the quantum of losses grouped and the respective amounts of subvention payments/loss offset elections; and • the date of the imputation credit transfer that the dividend was declared by the profit company. 3.29 Both companies would already be filing imputation returns (the IR 4J) and therefore, in addition to the notification to the Commissioner, they would need to include the amount of the transfer in the IR 4J. The two companies would simply be required to include the amount of the imputation credit transfer in the boxes labelled “other” for their relevant debit and credit. Amended assessments 3.30 If a loss co mpany which has undertaken a loss offset has an amended assessment and its loss is consequently reduced below the level of the amount which was eligible to be offset, the Commissioner may amend the assessment of the profit company. Similarly, if a profit company which has undertaken a loss offset has an amended assessment and has reduced profits, the offset is only valid up to the amount of the reduced profits. 3.31 In these cases, corresponding adjustments may need to be made to the imputation credit accounts and other returns of the affected companies. 3.32 Officials are interested to hear whether such adjustments are likely to give rise to problems in practice and, if so, how these problems could be mitigated. 14

New Zealand companies owned by non- residents pay income tax on their net profits in the same way that all New Zealand taxpayers do. Income from interest, dividends and royalties, known as non-resident passive income, earned in New Zealand directly by non-residents is subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). 1.2 Applying income tax and NRWT in this way is intended to ensure an appropriate level of taxation on non-resident investors. 1.3 Without non-resident withholding tax, non-residents would be able to shift profits out of New Zealand, paying little or no tax. This would not be consistent with New Zealand’s tax policy settings and would clearly be an unfair outcome for New Zealand. 1.4 However, since the NRWT rules were first formulated, financial transactions have evolved and become more sophisticated. Taxpayers have developed various mechanisms for deferring or circumventing NRWT. 1.5 The Government announced in November 2014 that it would undertake consultation aimed at updating and strengthening New Zealand’s NRWT rules on related party debt. This issues paper identifies a number of issues with the application of the current NRWT rules and suggests a number of complementary changes to address these concerns. Preventing arbitrage of NRWT rules with financial arrangement rules 1.6 Officials suggest that for certain related party debt structures that would have generated financial arrangement income of a non-resident if that non-resident was subject to the financial arrangement rules, an NRWT liability will be triggered and determined by reference to the financial arrangement rules rather than the existing rules. Preventing associated persons accessing the AIL rules Back-to-back loans and other forms of indirect funding 1.7 We suggest that NRWT (rather than approved issuer levy (AIL)) be paid when New Zealand-sourced interest is paid to a third party if it is part of an arrangement for that third-party lender to be provided funds by a non-resident associated person of the New Zealand borrower. 2 Persons acting together 1.8 We suggest that NRWT (rather than AIL) be paid when New Zealand-sourced interest is paid to a non-resident who is not associated with the borrower, but is part of a group of persons who are acting together and would be associated with the borrower if they were a single entity. This would be similar to the non-resident owning body changes recently introduced to the thin capitalisation rules. Eligibility for AIL 1.9 In order to deal with issues that have arisen with the improper substitution of AIL for NRWT on interest to related persons, officials wish to explore limiting the ability to pay AIL to loans where there is a much lower risk of undisclosed association. The suggestion in this paper is to limit AIL to loans which are either to or from a financial intermediary or raised from a group of 10 or more non-associated persons. Restricting the branch exemptions Offshore branch exemption 1.10 Officials suggest limiting the existing offshore branch exemption so that interest paid by the offshore branch of a New Zealand resident is subject to NRWT or AIL to the extent that the interest is paid on money which is lent to a New Zealand resident. Onshore branch exemption 1.11 We suggest limiting the existing onshore branch exemption from NRWT so that it applies only to interest that is received by a non-resident in connection with a business carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Where a non-resident operates a New Zealand branch, New Zealand-sourced interest income not connected with their New Zealand branch would be non- resident passive income (NRPI), subject to NRWT or AIL. Banking related-party lending 1.12 We suggest allowing members of New Zealand banking groups to access the AIL rules on interest payments to their non-resident associates. This recognises that the owners of New Zealand banks are themselves margin lenders, whose funding in the main is sourced from unrelated lenders. The tax system would be improved by providing them with a transparent way to borrow from offshore with an appropriate level of tax, rather than leaving them to rely on the offshore and onshore branch exemptions, neither of which has a policy which supports its use in this context. 3 1.13 New Zealand aims to ensure that tax rules are not unduly complex or impose excessive compliance costs. The suggested NRWT changes in this issues paper are aimed primarily at companies using complex and sophisticated transactions to circumvent the NRWT rules. In order to help ensure fairness and practicality, taxpayers are invited to make a submission on any aspect of matters discussed in this paper. 1.14 Subject to consultation, amendments to the NRWT rules could be included in the next tax bill which is currently scheduled for introduction in late 2015. How to make a submission 1.15 Officials invite submissions on the proposed reforms and points raised in this issues paper. Submissions should be addressed to: NRWT: related party and branch lending C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “NRWT: related party and branch lending” in the subject line. Electronic submissions are encouraged. The closing date for submissions is 16 June 2015. 1.16 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.17 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 4 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 New Zealand has a policy of taxing non-residents on income that has a New Zealand source. When a non-resident has a branch or subsidiary in New Zealand, tax can be imposed on the income of that branch or subsidiary in the same way as it would be on New Zealanders. When the non-resident does not have a New Zealand presence, it is substantially more difficult for New Zealand to collect normal net income tax from the non-resident. Instead, a gross withholding tax is imposed on the payer of certain types of income, typically being a resident that New Zealand can enforce tax obligations upon (though the non-resident payee also has a liability to pay this tax if it is not withheld). This withholding tax is called NRWT. For interest payments, the rate of NRWT is usually 10% 1 of the interest paid. 2.2 New Zealand’s policy on taxing non-residents and the use of withholding taxes for income when the non-resident does not have a presence in New Zealand is intended to ensure that an appropriate level of tax is paid and is broadly consistent with the OECD norm. Policy framework 2.3 From an economic perspective there is little difference between debt and equity. However, interest payments on debt are deductible whereas dividends are not. Tax therefore can create a cross-border bias in favour of debt over equity. 2.4 In the case of cross-border related-party investment, NRWT reduces this bias by subjecting related-party interest payments to some amount of tax (usually 10%). 2.5 New Zealand is often characterised as a small, capital importing country. It is sometimes suggested it is not in the best interests of such countries to impose any tax (corporate tax on profits or NRWT on related-party interest payments) on non-resident direct investment. It is argued that the tax will reduce investment in New Zealand and therefore its capital stock. New Zealand would have fewer machines such as tractors, buildings and computers, making labour less productive and resulting in lower wages. Based on some strong assumptions, it is claimed that a tax on non-resident investment is borne entirely by New Zealanders. 1 The domestic law rate of NRWT on interest is 15%; this is usually reduced to 10% under a double tax agreement. 5 2.6 Nevertheless, New Zealand has decided to tax non-resident direct investment. This decision has been frequently tested, most recently by the Savings and Investment Review conducted by the Treasury and Inland Revenue in 2012. That review concluded it is in New Zealand’s best interests to tax direct investment by non-residents. If New Zealand reduced the tax on non-residents it would lose more from giving up tax revenue from non-residents than it would gain from increased investment by non-residents. 2.7 This conclusion applies to related-party debt, which can be seen as a substitute for equity. However, it is unlikely that it would be in New Zealand’s best interest to impose NRWT on third-party debt. Third-party debt is unlikely to be a close substitute for equity. At the same time, imposing NRWT on third- party borrowing would be likely to increase the cost of debt for New Zealanders. 2.8 In 1991 the effect of NRWT on the cost of capital for New Zealand borrowers was recognised and AIL was introduced to lower that cost. Lending by non- residents to unassociated New Zealand residents is subject to AIL rather than NRWT. 2.9 While the imposition of AIL may still result in a small increase in the cost of borrowing from offshore, the economic distortion this creates is likely to be minimal. It also may reduce the general tax bias favouring non-resident debt investment over non-resident equity investment. 2.10 We continue to be relatively comfortable with the AIL, imposed at an effective rate of 1.44% 2 , applying to interest on third-party borrowing. 2.11 Paragraphs 6.26 to 6.35 of this paper explore special rules for when New Zealand-registered banks borrow from related banks offshore. In the case of banks, it is suggested that AIL will be available even for related-party borrowing. The basis for this is that, as banks are margin lenders (i.e. they are largely debt financed) and conduits for ultimately unrelated non-resident lenders and domestic borrowers, there is less risk that the related-party debt will actually be in-substance equity. Rather, it is more likely to be on-lent debt sourced by the related non-resident bank. In that case, the arguments for a lower rate of tax are similar to those for third-party debt generally. Link with the thin capitalisation rules 2.12 There is an interface between the thin capitalisation rules and NRWT because they both have an impact on the effective taxation of inbound investment income. Thin capitalisation rules restrict the amount of interest deductions that can be claimed by a New Zealand subsidiary of a non-resident owned group. NRWT imposes a tax on interest payments from a New Zealand subsidiary to its non-resident owner and associates. 2 The rate of AIL is 2%; however, this is deductible for income tax. At a 28% company tax rate the effective rate is 1.44%. 6 2.13 New Zealand has a worldwide group debt test in the thin capitalisation rules which is designed, in part, to prevent debt being used as a substitute for equity. A New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational group is only able to deduct the interest on a related-party loan under the worldwide group debt test if the amount of that loan can be viewed as having been borrowed from a third party by a group member and on-lent to the subsidiary. 2.14 As things stand, however, the worldwide group test is rarely applied because firms stay within a “safe harbour” which allows them to claim deductions on all debt up to a threshold of 60% of assets without reference to their worldwide gearing position. 2.15 The OECD is currently examining rules similar to ours in the context of the BEPS Action Plan. It is possible that, as a result of this work, countries could substantially tighten their thin capitalisation rules well beyond our existing rules and the current international norm. At one end of the range, new rules could require New Zealand subsidiaries to use the worldwide group debt test as a matter of course to determine interest deductibility. In that event we would need to consider the overall picture in relation to the taxation of inbound direct investment and the extent to which it is necessary to continue to impose NRWT on interest. Avoidance concerns 2.16 Interest, dividends and royalties sourced in New Zealand and paid to non- residents are known as NRPI and are subject to non-resident withholding tax. Through Inland Revenue compliance activity, officials have become aware that the NRWT rules have limited application in relation to interest, due to the wide variety of transactions available to prevent, or delay, the payment of interest with a New Zealand source. This is explored in Chapter 3. 2.17 This ability to circumvent the NRWT rules contrasts with New Zealand’s comprehensive financial arrangement rules that ensure financing income is taxable to New Zealand residents over the term of an arrangement on some form of economic accrual basis. 2.18 Officials believe that the combined effect of the transactions outlined below is that NRWT has largely been regarded as a voluntary tax for those with sufficient resources to avoid it. Transactions to avoid the imposition of NRWT are not economically efficient. They would not make good business sense in the absence of tax as a factor. Their tax consequences are often uncertain because of the general anti-avoidance provision. Removing the tax incentive to structure into these transactions will level the playing field for other businesses who are unwilling or unable to undertake such transactions. Such transactions also risk bringing the tax system into disrepute. 7 2.19 Due to the large number of potential ways to avoid NRWT it is not considered efficient or effective to introduce specific rules to deal with each specific type of transaction. This is because each transaction would require detailed provisions and in many cases the introduction of these provisions would create the incentive for these transactions to be subtly modified so they did not fall within the new provisions. 2.20 Instead this issues paper sets out suggestions intended to cover a wide range of transactions which currently avoid, or significantly defer, the imposition of NRWT. 2.21 The suggested changes in this issues paper are aimed at helping ensure a more appropriate amount of tax is paid by non-residents on their New Zealand- sourced income, thus better aligning taxation with real economic activity and reducing current asymmetries. 2.22 This paper does not deal with all tax issues arising from related-party debt. In particular, it does not deal with cross-border hybrid issues. The timetable for dealing with those issues is linked to the OECD’s timetable. Consultation is likely to commence on them by early 2016. 2.23 This paper does not consider the potential application of section BG 1, the general anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Act 2007, to any of the examples discussed. 8 CHAPTER 3 Problems with definition and recognition of income under the NRWT rules 3.1 Liability to NRWT is triggered when New Zealand-sourced “interest” is “paid”. “Interest” is defined as a payment for “money lent”, and “pay” is defined to include, in relation to an amount and a person, distributing to, crediting for, or dealing with that amount on the person’s behalf. These definitions have not been changed since 1983. In the case of a foreign currency loan, the NRWT rules do not take into account the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on the NZ$ value of the money lent. 3.2 The financial arrangement rules, which apply to determine liability to income tax, define financial arrangement income and expense under a completely separate set of rules, based much more on economic substance. These rules require financing income and expense to be determined with regard to “financial arrangements” (rather than “money lent”), and require it to be calculated using either financial reporting methods or economic accrual methods such as yield to maturity or straight line. Using these methods, foreign currency fluctuations are taken into account. 3.3 The predominantly cash basis and single instrument approach of the NRWT rules has a number of consequences, including that:  what is treated by a New Zealand-resident borrower as a financial arrangement may not involve money lent, and therefore the return on the arrangement may not be subject to NRWT;  income is not correctly measured or allocated to income years for non- residents; and  significant mismatches can arise between New Zealand-resident borrowers and non-resident lenders. 3.4 These consequences can be particularly serious for the tax base where the borrower and lender are associated, and can structure their arrangements with less regard for commercial matters and more regard for tax benefits. For example:  NRWT can be deferred for a non-resident lender for a substantial period, with no effect on the availability to a New Zealand-resident borrower of a deduction on some form of accrual basis under the financial arrangement rules; and  because NRWT is imposed on a cash basis, it is possible for a non-resident associated lender to earn interest as an economic matter but avoid NRWT altogether by selling a loan shortly before interest is due to be paid. 3 3 Although section GB 26 may deal with aspects of this issue, it will not deal with all of the concerns. 9 Suggestions for addressing the problem 3.5 Officials have three suggestions for removing the potential for these kinds of mismatches and protecting the tax base more generally. They apply only to arrangements between associated persons. The first broadens the kind of arrangements that will give rise to NRPI, so that there is a better alignment between NRPI and financial arrangement expenditure. The second brings the rules for determining the amount of NRPI more into line with the financial arrangement rules. The third brings the time of recognition of NRPI more into line with the financial arrangement rules, for arrangements that involve a deferral of payments as compared with income measured under the financial arrangement rules. Broadening arrangements giving rise to NRPI 3.6 NRPI only arises where there is “money lent” as defined in section YA 1. Although the “money lent” definition is broad, it may not apply in all situations where there is an amount of financing provided under a financial arrangement. This means that a New Zealand borrower may incur financial arrangement expenditure where the non-resident counterpart to the financial arrangement has no NRPI. 3.7 In order to prevent this outcome being used to avoid the imposition of NRWT, we propose to widen the definition of “money lent” to include any amount provided to a New Zealand resident by an associated non-resident under a financial arrangement which provides funding to the resident, and under which the resident incurs financial arrangement expenditure. This definition will only apply if the other limbs of the “money lent” definition do not. Reducing quantum mismatches between NRPI and financial arrangement expenditure 3.8 In some cases, the financial arrangement rules may result in a different amount of income being calculated than the amount under the existing “interest” definition. Two examples are:  a purchase of goods on credit where there is no explicit interest charge but the value of the goods under the financial arrangement rules is less than the amount payable by the purchaser, resulting in financial arrangement income to the vendor; and  an optional convertible note which pays coupon interest at a rate below the rate specified in Determination G22A. 3.9 In order to prevent this outcome being used to avoid the imposition of NRWT, we propose to widen the definition of “interest” to include a payment (whether of money or money’s worth) received by a non-resident from an associated New Zealand resident, to the extent that the payment gives rise to expenditure to the New Zealand resident under the financial arrangement rules. 10 3.10 For example, take a zero coupon optional convertible note (OCN) subject to Determination G22A, issued by a New Zealand resident to an associated non- resident. Under this suggestion, the issuer would be treated as paying interest to the OCN holder when the notes were converted into shares or were redeemed in cash. The amount of the interest would be the excess of the cash redemption amount over the deemed issue price of the OCNs, applying Determination G22A, and it would be subject to NRWT (but in advance of the time of payment if the suggestions in this document are adopted). 4 Avoiding timing mismatches between NRPI and financial arrangement expenditure 3.11 It is suggested that for a financial arrangement between a resident and a non- resident associated person which:  involves a deferral of cash payments (so that income accrues in an economic sense but is not paid); and  provides funding to the resident, NRWT would be imposed annually, on an amount equal to the financial arrangement income that would have arisen to the non-resident if it were subject to the financial arrangement rules. However, in the case of a foreign currency loan, the income subject to NRWT would be calculated in the foreign currency, so that the current non-taxation of foreign currency gains and losses under the NRWT regime would be maintained. Doing otherwise might be inconsistent with tax treaty obligations. Further detail on timing mismatches: non-resident financial arrangement income 3.12 In the remainder of this chapter, we consider in more detail, the rules that would apply to impose NRWT on accruing income, rather than on payments. 3.13 NRWT is payable on (inter alia) payments of NRPI. We suggest retaining this linkage and expanding the definition of interest to include non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI), which would be a subset of NRPI. 3.14 NRFAI would arise in relation to financial arrangements involving deferral of income where a non-resident person provides funding to an associated New Zealand resident. The amount of NRFAI would have to be determined according to a YTM or expected value method. In many cases this could be the same method as that used by the borrower to calculate its expenditure. 5 3.15 The definition of “pay” would also be expanded to include the accrual of amounts of income calculated as NRFAI. 4 We recognise that under the currently applicable Determination G22A, a “low interest” OCN between members of the same wholly owned group does not give rise to any additional discount income to the holder. 5 However, foreign currency fluctuations would not be treated as NRFAI – this is discussed later in this chapter. 11 Association 3.16 For the purpose of NRFAI, the existing association test for accessing the AIL regime in section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) would be applied. It would also encompass the back-to-back and “acting together” association suggestions outlined in Chapter 4. The former element is intended to ensure a taxpayer cannot insert a third-party into what is otherwise a related-party transaction to avoid it being subject to NRWT. Coverage of non-resident financial arrangement income 3.17 NRFAI would apply only where the payments (as defined under the expanded NRWT rules for interest) under the arrangement are such that they lag behind the economic accrual of income. A typical example is a zero coupon note, issued at a discount. 3.18 There would typically be no need for NRFAI, for example, in relation to a loan where interest is paid semi-annually, and the principal advanced is due to be repaid five years after the date it was lent. However, if the interest is not in fact paid when due, then the income on the loan would become subject to NRFAI. 3.19 In order to differentiate between these two situations, we suggest that NRFAI would not arise in relation to an arrangement if, in all years up to and including the year in question 6 , the interest subject to NRWT is at least 90% of the income that would be calculated either under the YTM or effective interest method using the currency of the arrangement. Allowance would be made for arrangements entered into during the year, to recognise that interest is usually paid in arrears. Non-resident financial arrangement income and NRWT 3.20 NRFAI on an arrangement that a New Zealand taxpayer 7 is party to during an income year will trigger an NRWT liability for both the payer (as agent) and the payee at the same rates that apply under the current NRWT rules. This liability would arise in the NRWT return period that includes the New Zealand taxpayer’s balance date. 6 Separate transitional rules would apply to existing arrangements. These rules are covered in paragraphs 3.37 to 3.42. 7 In this context a New Zealand taxpayer includes a New Zealand resident as well as a non-resident engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. 12 Example 1 NZ Sub Ltd has a March balance date and is wholly owned by Aus Parent Ltd. On 1 April 2018 NZ Sub Ltd issues a five year zero-coupon bond to Aus Parent Ltd. This bond has an issue price of $100 and a maturity value of $150 on 31 March 2023. In the year to 31 March 2019, no interest would arise under the traditional interest definition. Accordingly, the difference between NRPI from interest payments and NRPI from NRFAI using YTM is more than 10%. As NZ Sub Ltd and Aus Parent Ltd are associated, the bond gives rise to NRFAI. NZ Sub Ltd’s March NRWT returns include the following amounts: NRWT return NRFAI NRWT March 2019 $8.45 $0.85 March 2020 $9.16 $0.92 March 2021 $9.93 $0.99 March 2022 $10.77 $1.08 March 2023 $11.68 $1.17 Preventing double New Zealand taxation on interest payments 3.21 To prevent a single amount of interest income being subject to NRWT twice – first as NRFAI and again when an interest payment under the current law is made – it will be necessary to have a carve-out for certain payments that are currently subject to NRWT. 3.22 The general rule will be that a taxpayer making a payment under an arrangement that generates NRFAI will not be required to withhold NRWT from the payment. Example 2 NZ Sub Ltd has a March balance date and is wholly owned by Aus Parent Ltd. On 1 April 2018 NZ Sub Ltd issues a five year 5% annual coupon bond to Aus Parent Ltd. This bond has an issue price of $80 and a face value of $100 on 31 March 2023. In the year to 31 March 2019, the amount of interest under the traditional interest definition is $5, whereas the amount of financial arrangement income applying YTM is $8.26. As the difference between NRPI from interest payments and NRPI from NRFAI using YTM is more than 10%, and NZ Sub Ltd and Aus Parent Ltd are associated, the bond gives rise to NRFAI. NZ Sub Ltd is not required to withhold NRWT on the cash interest payments to Aus Parent Ltd. NZ Sub Ltd’s March NRWT returns include the following calculations: NRWT return Cash interest NRWT on cash interest NRFAI NRWT on NRFAI March 2019 $5 $0 $8.26 $0.83 March 2020 $5 $0 $8.59 $0.86 March 2021 $5 $0 $8.96 $0.90 March 2022 $5 $0$9.37$0.94 March 2023 $5 + $20 redemption $0 $9.82 $0.98 13 Effect on obligations to the lender 3.23 When a person withholds tax from a payment it is treated as received by the payee under section RA 9. This is necessary so the payer can withhold the amount of tax while still fulfilling their payment obligation under the arrangement. Where a borrower under an arrangement that generates NRFAI pays NRWT on that NRFAI, the borrower will need to determine how to make allowance for that payment in terms of its obligations to the lender. In many cases, the borrower might take account of the payment of NRWT on NRFAI by reducing its next interest payment to the lender. Since the parties will by definition be related, this should be able to be dealt with between them. Example 3 For the bond referred to in example 2, NZ Sub Ltd has the following obligations under the current NRWT rules: Month Cash outlay by NZ Sub Ltd NRWT on interest Cash interest to Aus Parent Ltd March 2019 $5 $0.50$4.50 March 2020 $5 $0.50 $4.50 March 2021 $5 $0.50 $4.50 March 2022 $5 $0.50$4.50 March 2023 $5 + $20 redemption $0.50 + $2 = $2.50 $4.50 coupon + $18 redemption Total $45 $4.50 $40.50 As this bond is now within the NRFAI rules, Aus Parent Ltd and NZ Sub Ltd agree that the total cash interest payments by NZ Sub Ltd should remain the same, and reduce the cash payment to Aus Parent Ltd accordingly: Month Cash outlay by NZ Sub Ltd NRWT on NRFAI Cash interest to Aus Parent Ltd March 2019 $5 $0.83 $4.17 March 2020 $5 $0.86 $4.14 March 2021 $5 $0.90 $4.10 March 2022 $5 $0.94 $4.06 March 2023 $5 + $20 redemption $0.98 $24.02 Total $45 $4.50 $40.50 Alternatively Aus Parent Ltd and NZ Sub Ltd could agree that the cash interest payments received by Aus Parent Ltd stay the same. This would mean a higher cash cost to NZ Sub Ltd during the term of the bond. In this case the amount paid on redemption would reflect the higher cash cost over the term: Month Cash outlay by NZ Sub Ltd NRWT on NRFAI Cash interest to Aus Parent Ltd March 2019 $5.33 $0.83 $4.50 March 2020 $5.36 $0.86 $4.50 March 2021 $5.40 $0.90$4.50 March 2022 $5.44 $0.94 $4.50 March 2023 $23.48 $0.98 $4.50 coupon + $18 redemption Total $45 $4.50 $40.50 14 Foreign currency loans and NRFAI 3.24 As with the current rules, the calculation of NRFAI on foreign currency loans would not take into account changes in the NZ$ value of the amount borrowed. It is proposed that where a loan giving rise to NRFAI is denominated in foreign currency, the NRWT obligation be determined by:  first, calculating foreign currency income applying a YTM or effective interest method;  second, using the exchange rate on the borrower’s balance date to determine the amount of NZ$ NRPI; and  third, applying the NRWT rate to the NZ$ amount to determine the amount of NRWT owed. 3.25 Although this method gives the same total amount of foreign currency NRPI as the existing rule, the amount of NZ$ NRPI and hence NRWT may be different because of the different conversion date (since under the current rules, conversion occurs when the foreign currency interest is paid). 3.26 One option would be for this difference to be left unaddressed. The other would be for a wash-up calculation to be undertaken. If the NZ$ value of the amount of interest paid exceeds the NRFAI, the taxpayer would owe additional NRWT, and in the reverse situation, the NRWT previously paid could be adjusted downwards. 3.27 Given that the real economic cost of NRWT under the suggested new rules will be quite different from the cost under the existing rules (because of the different timing of the tax obligation), we do not consider it is necessary to introduce a special rule, with its own complexities, for the purpose of equalising the nominal amounts. 3.28 Officials invite submissions on this point. 15 Example 4 NZ Sub Ltd has a March balance date and is wholly owned by Aus Parent Ltd. On 1 April 2018 NZ Sub Ltd issues a five-year zero coupon bond to Aus Parent Ltd. This bond has an issue price of AU$100 and a face value of AU$150 on 31 March 2023. As the difference between NRPI from interest payments and NRPI from NRFAI using YTM is more than 10%, and NZ Sub Ltd and Aus Parent Ltd are associated, the bond gives rise to NRFAI. Assume the exchange rate at each balance date is: Balance date NZD/AUD exchange rate March 2018 0.9123 March 2019 0.9567 March 2020 0.8935 March 2021 0.9123 March 2022 0.9236 March 20230.8576 In NZ Sub Ltd’s March NRWT returns it has to return the following amounts: NRWT return AU$ NRFAI NZ$ equivalent NRFAI NRWT on NZ$ NRFAI March 2019 $8.45 $8.83 $0.88 March 2020 $9.16 $10.25 $1.03 March 2021 $9.93 $10.88$1.09 March 2022 $10.77 $11.66 $1.17 March 2023 $11.68 $13.62 $1.36 Total $50.00 $55.25 $5.52 This compares with the current law where NRWT is imposed on actual payments which are: NRWT return AU$ interest NZ$ equivalent interest NRWT on NZ$ interest March 2023 $50 $58.30 $5.83 Without a wash-up the $0.31 difference will not be payable. Non-deductible interest 3.29 Under the existing NRWT rules there is no exemption from withholding NRWT just because an amount of interest is not deductible to the New Zealand-resident borrower (for example if the New Zealand borrower is a tax- exempt charity). We suggest that this principle is maintained for arrangements that generate NRFAI. 16 3.30 A New Zealand borrower who exceeds the thin capitalisation thresholds will derive an amount of income under the formula in section FE 6(2). In substance, this amount is equal to the amount of interest the thin capitalisation rules disallow. Under the current NRWT rules, a New Zealand borrower deriving an amount of income under the thin capitalisation rules is still required to withhold NRWT on the interest payment. We suggest that this principle is maintained for arrangements that generate NRFAI. Australian provision 3.31 Like New Zealand, Australia has both a withholding tax system based on payments and a domestically applicable regime for taxing some financial instruments on an accrual basis (referred to as “taxation of financial arrangements” or TOFA). Australia also has a provision (section 26-25 of the ITAA 1997) which denies an Australian a deduction for interest paid to a non- Australian if withholding tax is not paid on that interest. This rule has been in place for many years. 3.32 The Australian provision can be viewed as aimed at achieving something similar in broad policy terms as the proposal in this chapter of the issues paper. But rather than accelerating NRWT to (broadly) match the deduction under the financial arrangement rules (as we suggest), the Australian rule is deferring the deduction to match the timing of the NRWT obligation. 3.33 The key difference in terms of the focus of the Australian rule (compared with our proposal) is that the aim is to buttress the borrower’s obligation to withhold NRWT. It may be that at the time this rule was enacted the deduction and the NRWT obligation would generally have fallen in the same year. It is understood that in a case where a deduction arises under TOFA but there is no payment and hence no NRWT obligation until a later year, the deduction is still claimed. However, if NRWT is not paid when the relevant amount eventually is paid, it is possible that the deduction would be reversed. Foreign tax credits 3.34 If this suggestion were adopted, officials do not believe it would adversely affect a foreign lender’s ability to claim a tax credit for NRWT in its home jurisdiction. It may mean NRWT is paid in a year before there is a liability for income tax on that income in a lender’s home jurisdiction. That earlier time of payment should not affect whether the taxpayer can claim a credit for NRWT paid. For example, under section LJ 2, a New Zealand resident is entitled to claim a credit for foreign tax imposed on foreign-sourced income regardless of when the foreign tax is paid. 3.35 It may also be the case that a foreign lender’s home jurisdiction has its own form of the financial arrangement rules, and that this suggested change in fact brings NRWT closer in line with the timing of the lender’s income tax obligation. 17 Application dates 3.36 It is suggested that the reforms outlined in this chapter would apply to financial arrangements entered into, on or after enactment of the legislation. This is expected to be in the second half of 2016. Transitional treatment of existing financial arrangements 3.37 Financial arrangements entered into before the enactment of the legislation will be required to apply the new rules for income years following enactment. This is reasonable, since the arrangements are between associated persons. Transitional rules for these arrangements are covered in the paragraphs below. 3.38 A taxpayer with an existing financial arrangement, applying the new rules for the first time, will calculate their NRWT liability for that first year as if they had applied the new rules in previous years. 3.39 In the year that the financial arrangement matures, the taxpayer will be required to calculate a wash-up to ensure that the appropriate amount of NRWT has been paid. Generally, this formula will be: NRWT liability if financial arrangement had always been subject to new rules – NRWT actually paid on financial arrangement 3.40 This wash-up would also be triggered:  if the lender ceased to be associated or was replaced by an unassociated lender; or  immediately prior to the migration of the New Zealand borrower. 3.41 For pre-existing arrangements which would be brought into the NRWT rules by the suggested changes but that do not currently give rise to NRPI, officials do not consider it appropriate to impose NRWT on income arising before the income year following enactment. Accordingly, the wash-up formula in paragraph 3.39 would not apply. 3.42 However, it is possible in relation to such arrangements that the new rules could be circumvented. A borrower could make a prepayment before the beginning of the income year following enactment. This would pre-pay funding costs likely to accrue during and after that year. The prepayment would not be subject to NRWT (subject to possible application of the general anti-avoidance rule), although it economically relates to a period when NRWT is intended to be imposed. Accordingly, we suggest a specific provision which would apply if a New Zealand-resident party to a financial arrangement makes or has made a payment to an associated person, and that payment has the effect of pre-paying for funding provided to the New Zealand resident for a period that ends after the first day of the income year following enactment. For NRWT purposes, the portion of the payment that as an economic matter relates to the period falling on or after that first day will be treated as paid on that day, and would give rise to an NRWT obligation accordingly. 18 Example 5 NZ Sub Ltd has a March balance date and is wholly owned by Aus Parent Ltd. On 1 April 2015 NZ Sub Ltd issues a five year 5% annual coupon bond to Aus Parent Ltd. This bond has an issue price of $80 and a face value of $100. In the 31 March 2016 and 2017 years NZ Sub Ltd had been paying NRWT on the $5 cash interest payments. In the year to 31 March 2018, the amount of interest under the traditional interest definition is $5, whereas the amount of financial arrangement income applying YTM is $8.26. As the difference between NRPI from interest payments and NRPI from NRFAI using YTM is more than 10%, and NZ Sub Ltd and Aus Parent Ltd are associated, the bond gives rise to NRFAI. NZ Sub Ltd is not required to withhold NRWT on the cash interest payments to Aus Parent Ltd. NZ Sub Ltd’s March NRWT returns include the following calculations: NRWT return Cash interest NRWT on cash interest NRFAI NRWT on NRFAI NRWT on wash-up March 2016 $5 $0.50 $0 $0 March 2017 $5 $0.50 $0 $0 March 2018 $5 $0 $8.96 $0.90 March 2019 $5 $0 $9.37 $0.94 March 2020 $5 + $20 redemption$0$9.82$1.66 8 Questions for submitters 3.1 Does an NRWT liability arising in the NRWT return period that includes a taxpayer’s balance date provide sufficient time for a taxpayer to calculate and pay the NRWT owing? 3.2 Do any practical difficulties arise on the effect of obligations to the lender as set out in paragraph 3.23 and example 3? 3.3 Is it necessary for differences between NRWT if calculated on actual interest payments on foreign currency arrangements, and NRWT calculated on NRFAI, to result in an adjustment to NRWT? 3.4 Is the approach of imposing NRWT on NRFAI arising after the beginning of the income year following enactment appropriate? 3.5 Is the suggested wash-up adjustment the best way to bring existing arrangements into the NRFAI regime? 8 Calculated as $4.50 - $2.84 = $1.66. 19 CHAPTER 4 Defining when payments are to a related person 4.1 New Zealand borrowers that meet the requirements of section RF 12(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 can pay AIL on a payment of interest that is NRPI. When AIL is paid this NRPI qualifies for a zero-rate of NRWT. 4.2 The requirements of section RF 12(1)(a) include that the borrower is not associated 9 with the lender. The reason for this restriction is that related-party lending can be a substitute for equity from a parent and be used to increase interest deductions thereby reducing the taxable profit that would arise if the parent invested with equity. AIL at 2% on related party interest would be inappropriately low when that interest deduction reduced the New Zealand borrower’s taxable income, which is generally subject to a 28% or higher income tax rate. 4.3 We consider the current restrictions on related parties accessing the AIL rules are not sufficiently robust, which allows associated persons to structure into the AIL rules when the policy intention is that the interest payments should be subject to NRWT. 4.4 This chapter explores changes to ensure NRPI (including NRFAI as discussed in the previous chapter) paid directly or indirectly to an associated non-resident cannot access the AIL rules. These suggestions would also be used to determine whether NRFAI was generated by that arrangement. Back-to-back loans 4.5 Unlike some other areas of New Zealand’s tax legislation, 10 the AIL rules do not look through to the ultimate lender to a New Zealand borrower. This allows a New Zealand borrower to interpose one or more third parties into what would otherwise be a loan from an associated person. An example of such an arrangement is a back-to-back loan. 4.6 Under the current legislation, subject to the potential application of the general anti-avoidance provision, a New Zealand borrower can claim it has borrowed from a non-associated third party and therefore access the AIL rules even when that third party has itself borrowed from a company that is associated with the New Zealand borrower. 4.7 In practice, due to the fungibility of money, it will often be difficult for Inland Revenue to identify specific funding flows through a third party. 9 Except by being a beneficiary of a trust established for the main purpose of protecting and enforcing beneficiaries’ rights under the registered security – this exception is not relevant for the purpose of this issues paper. 10 See for example section FE 18(3B)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 in relation to thin capitalisation, and article 11(4)(b) of the New Zealand/Australia DTA. 20 4.8 However, we do not intend that all interest paid by a New Zealand borrower should be unable to access the AIL rules just because an associated person has deposited with or lent money to the person lending money to the New Zealand borrower. 4.9 The two main reasons for this are:  the New Zealand operations of a worldwide group may only be a minor part of the entire operation. It would often be impractical for the New Zealand group entity to keep track of all worldwide financing decisions of their group to ensure no other part of the group had lent money to a person whom the New Zealand entity had borrowed from; and  where a New Zealand company borrows from the same entity that another part of their worldwide group has deposited/lent money to without the New Zealand company’s knowledge, it is more difficult to argue that this funding is a replacement for equity funding that would have otherwise been provided to the New Zealand company. Other multi-party arrangements 4.10 Arrangements have also been entered into which are not back-to-back loans in the conventional sense but which also involve the indirect provision of funding by a non-resident lender to a resident associated borrower without the imposition of NRWT, while maintaining an income tax deduction calculated under the financial arrangement rules. A typical structure involves:  a loan from a New Zealand-resident bank to a New Zealand borrower. The loan is interest only with a bullet repayment of principal, and has a five year term; and  shortly thereafter, the assignment by the bank of the right to receive the loan repayment on maturity to the non-resident parent of the New Zealand borrower. This assignment is contemplated at the time the loan is made. 4.11 In substance, this is a loan to the New Zealand borrower from:  the bank, for an amount equal to the amount of the loan less the amount received from the non-resident parent for the assignment. This loan is repaid on a principal and interest basis (like a table mortgage) by way of the interest payments; and  the non-resident parent, for an amount equal to the assignment price. This loan is in the nature of a zero coupon bond issued at a discount, where both “principal” and “interest” are repaid on maturity of the loan. 21 Addressing the problem 4.12 To deal with both back-to-back loans and other multi-party arrangements, officials suggest that payments by a New Zealand resident to another person be deemed to be in whole or in part NRPI paid to an associated person when the following requirements are present:  a New Zealand resident (the borrower) is provided with funds by a lender (the direct lender) under a financial arrangement; and  a non-resident associate of the borrower (the indirect lender) provides funds, directly or indirectly, to the direct lender in order for those funds to be passed on to the borrower; and  an arrangement was entered into between any two of the borrower, the direct lender and the indirect lender or anyone associated with any of them, by virtue of which either provision of funds, or the terms of either provision of funds, is dependent on or related to the other provision of funds. 4.13 For purposes of determining the borrower’s liability to withhold NRWT, it would be treated as borrowing from the indirect lender the amount provided by the indirect lender (except to the extent not provided directly or indirectly to the borrower), and as paying to the indirect lender the total amount paid to the indirect lender under the arrangement (except to the extent not provided directly or indirectly by the borrower). Any excess of the amount paid to the indirect lender over the amount provided by them would be NRPI liable to NRWT, which the New Zealand borrower would have to pay. The deferral test described in Chapter 3 would be applied to determine whether the borrower would have to pay NRWT on the basis of NRFAI or interest payments. 4.14 Our suggestion is that this would also cover funding chains where there are multiple non-associated parties. 22 Example 6 NZ Sub Ltd has a March balance date and is wholly owned by Aus Parent Ltd. On 1 April 2018 NZ Sub Ltd issues a five year 5% annual coupon bond to NZ Third Party Ltd. NZ Sub Ltd and NZ Third Party Ltd are not associated. This bond has a face value of $100 and is issued for $100. On 1 April 2018 NZ Third Party Ltd agrees to sell the principal component of the bond to Aus Parent Ltd on 31 March 2023. Aus Parent Ltd pays NZ Third Party Ltd $80 on 1 April 2018 and will receive $100 from NZ Sub Ltd when the bond matures on 31 March 2023. NZ Third Party Ltd will continue to receive the $5 annual coupon payments. Under the current definition there is no money lent from Aus Parent Ltd to NZ Third Party Ltd or NZ Sub Ltd therefore no NRWT is payable. Under the proposed rules Aus Parent Ltd will be treated as providing $80 to NZ Sub Ltd and NZ Sub Ltd will be treated as paying Aus Parent Ltd $100 at the end of the five-year period. The $20 excess will be treated as interest. This transaction will be treated as made up of two separate loans:  A $20 loan from NZ Third Party Ltd repaid by five annual payments of $5.  An $80 loan from Aus Parent Ltd repaid by a single $100 payment in five years’ time. As NZ Third Party Ltd is not a non-resident, only the second of these will be subject to NRWT. In the year to 31 March 2019, no interest arises under the traditional interest definition for the portion that is related-party funding, whereas the amount of financial arrangement income applying YTM is $3.65. As the difference between NRPI from interest payments and NRPI from NRFAI using YTM is more than 10%, and NZ Sub Ltd and Aus Parent Ltd are associated, the bond gives rise to NRFAI. NZ Sub Ltd’s March NRWT returns include the following calculations: NRWT return NRFAI NRWT on NRFAI March 2019 $3.65 $0.37 March 2020 $3.82 $0.38 March 2021 $3.99 $0.40 March 2022 $4.17 $0.42 March 2023$4.36 $0.44 23 Example 7 NZ Sub Ltd has a March balance date and is wholly owned by Aus Parent Ltd. On 1 April 2018 NZ Sub Ltd issues a five-year 5% annual coupon bond to Aus Third Party Ltd. NZ Sub Ltd and Aus Third Party Ltd are not associated. This bond has an issue price of $100 and a face value of $100. Also on 1 April 2018 Aus Third Party Ltd agrees to sell the bond to Aus Parent Ltd on 31 March 2023. Aus Parent Ltd pays Aus Third Party Ltd $80 on 1 April 2018 and will receive $100 from NZ Sub Ltd when the bond matures on 31 March 2023. Aus Third Party Ltd will continue to receive the $5 annual coupon payments. Under the traditional definition there is no money lent from Aus Parent Ltd to NZ Sub Ltd therefore no NRWT is payable. There is money lent from Aus Third Party Ltd to NZ Sub Ltd and NZ Sub Ltd has elected to pay AIL. Under the proposed rules, as for the previous example, the transaction will be treated as a loan from Aus Parent Ltd to NZ Sub Ltd. This transaction will be treated as made up of two separate loans:  A $20 loan from Aus Third Party Ltd repaid by five annual payments of $5.  An $80 loan from Aus Parent Ltd repaid by a single $100 payment in five years’ time. As Aus Third Party Ltd is a non-associated non-resident the interest portion of the payments to it can have AIL paid on it while the in-substance loan from Aus Parent Ltd will be liable for NRWT. In the year to 31 March 2019, no interest arises under the traditional interest definition for the portion that is related party funding, whereas the amount of financial arrangement income applying YTM is $3.65. As the difference between NRPI from interest payments and NRPI from NRFAI using YTM is more than 10%, and NZ Sub Ltd and Aus Parent Ltd are associated, the bond gives rise to NRFAI. NZ Sub Ltd is entitled to pay AIL on the payments to Aus Third Party Ltd. NZ Sub Ltd’s NRWT and AIL payments can be calculated as follows: NRWT return Cash interest YTM on third party funding AIL on third party funding NRFAI NRWT on NRFAI March 2019 $5 $1.59 $0.0318 $3.65 $0.37 March 2020 $5 $1.32 $0.0264 $3.82 $0.38 March 2021 $5 $1.02 $0.0204$3.99 $0.40 March 2022 $5 $0.71 $0.0142 $4.17 $0.42 March 2023 $5 $0.37 $0.0074 $4.36 $0.44 24 Acting together 4.15 The current association tests for accessing the AIL rules rely on the associated persons definition in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007. One of the tests in the associated persons definition states that two companies are associated if a group of persons exists whose total voting interests in each company are 50% or more. 4.16 This means that where two or more companies each have ownership interests of less than 50% in a New Zealand borrower, these companies will not be associated with that borrower unless they are themselves associated. 4.17 There are many instances where this is a desirable outcome – such as portfolio investments in listed companies. For this reason we do not recommend general changes to the associated persons definition. 4.18 However, we are aware of a number of transactions where two or more non- associated persons (investors), each with less than 50% of ownership interests in a New Zealand borrower, together provide debt funding to that borrower under an arrangement. Even though these investors may be genuinely not associated (for example three pension funds with different owners) they may make decisions about the borrower collectively, and in economic substance operate in a similar manner as if they were a single owner. 4.19 By operating in this manner the investors can make decisions in a similar manner to a single owner such as inserting high levels of debt (subject to thin capitalisation requirements) in proportion to their ownership interests and thereby receive a return on their total (equity + debt) investment with a large portion of this being deductible in New Zealand. 4.20 This problem is not unique to the NRWT/AIL rules. Until recently, the same structure could be used without engaging the thin capitalisation rules. Before the recent amendments, two or more non-associated persons (investors) could put high levels of debt into a New Zealand borrower in a co-ordinated fashion without subjecting the borrower to the thin capitalisation rules, as each investor was not associated and did not own 50% or more of the borrower. 4.21 The 2014 amendments to subpart FE of the Income Tax Act 2007 11 introduced the definition of a non-resident owning body, and provided that if a New Zealand company was owned by a non-resident owning body, it would be subject to the thin capitalisation rules. A non-resident owning body includes a group of independent owners acting together to fund a New Zealand resident. A copy of this definition is included in Appendix 2. 4.22 We suggest introducing the same concept for purposes of determining whether interest paid by a New Zealand resident is paid to an associated person. Changes will be made to the concept to the extent necessary to reflect its different application. 11 Enacted by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. 25 4.23 The main change is that the non-resident owning body definition applies to a group of non-residents. The non-resident requirement is necessary for thin capitalisation but is not sufficient for the purpose of the AIL rules. Where a group of investors with a more than 50% share of ownership interests act together to fund a New Zealand borrower and one or more of those investors is a non-resident, that investor should not be able to access the AIL rules even when one or more of the other investors in that group is a New Zealand resident. Therefore the restriction on accessing the AIL rules will apply to non-resident members of a group that is acting together even where other investors in that group are New Zealand-resident. Application dates 4.24 We suggest that the reforms outlined in this chapter apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after enactment of the legislation. This is expected to be in the second half of 2016. Transitional treatment of existing financial arrangements 4.25 Financial arrangements entered into before the enactment of the legislation will be required to apply the new rules for income years following enactment. 4.26 As with the ideas explored in Chapter 3, there would be a rule to ensure that prepayments of financing expenses relating to income years following enactment are subject to NRWT. Questions for submitters 4.1 Do you agree with the suggestions to impose NRWT on back-to-back loans and other multi-party arrangements involving associated lenders? 4.2 What practical issues and difficulties do you see with the imposition of NRWT, whether on actual payments or on NRFAI, in this context? 4.3 Do you agree that interest paid to a non-resident member of a group of investors acting together (as defined for the thin capitalisation rules) should be subject to NRWT? 4.4 Do you agree that the changes discussed in this chapter should apply on or after the year commencing after enactment of a bill containing such proposals? 26 CHAPTER 5 Eligibility for AIL 5.1 In order to access the AIL rules a New Zealand borrower must be an approved issuer and must make a payment of NRPI to a non-associated person on a registered security. 5.2 There are currently very few requirements for a person to become an approved issuer or to register a security. There is no legislative requirement that an approved issuer cannot register a security that is issued to an associated party. Instead interest is unable to legally have AIL paid on it when it is paid to an associated party. 5.3 A consequence of these limited requirements is that certain New Zealand taxpayers borrow from non-resident associates and use the AIL rules even though this interest does not meet the legislative requirements. While this approach is not in accordance with current law it can only be prevented after being detected by Inland Revenue. Registration requirement 5.4 In order to reduce the level of non-compliance, we suggest additional requirements to the application to register a security. A security will only be able to be registered if, at the time the application to register it is made, it is expected that more than 75% of the total borrowing will be from non- associated persons who are one or more of:  a financial institution in the business of lending money to the public; or  10 or more persons who are not associated with each other. 5.5 Approved issuers that are a financial institution in the business of lending money to the public will not be required to meet this test and will be able to continue to register securities as they do currently. 5.6 For the purpose of these tests it is suggested that:  a member of a registered banking group would be treated as in the business of lending money to the public; and  any other financial institution will be in the business of lending money to the public if they, or a group they are a member of, have outstanding lending to at least 100 persons. 5.7 We anticipate that these criteria will encompass the majority of current non- resident lending by non-associated persons. However, there may be other situations where it is demonstrably clear from the nature of the parties or the way or market in which funds are raised that there will be no association between the New Zealand borrower and foreign lender. For example, private 27 placements in the international financial markets are transactions which could automatically qualify for AIL registration. 5.8 We invite submissions on how to frame criteria which would qualify a security for AIL registration in addition to those set out above. We also invite submissions from any parties who consider they would be unduly affected by these suggested changes. Where this is the case we also invite submissions on what easily verifiable information may be available to satisfy the Commissioner that the issuer of the security is not associated with the likely holder(s). 5.9 We suggest that this would initially only apply to securities registered after the suggested application date and would not affect currently registered securities. 5.10 Issuers of securities that were registered before the suggested application date would have to reapply under the new requirements within two years of the enactment date. If they do not reapply, or do not meet the criteria, the registered security status would be lost and NRWT would become payable on interest after that date. AIL return 5.11 Currently the AIL return (IR 67A) does not identify who the payee is of the interest subject to AIL. In order to improve the ability to audit for AIL, or identify cases for audit, it would be beneficial if the return identified the payee, as is currently required for the NRWT annual reconciliation (IR 67S). Inland Revenue’s current computer system limitations prevent this from being cost effective at present, however, officials will reconsider this in the future. Questions for submitters 5.1 Is 75% an appropriate threshold for registered security applications? If you consider a different threshold is appropriate how would you justify this? 5.2 Are there any other groups of security holders or issuers you consider should automatically qualify for holding or issuing registered securities? 5.3 What criteria could be used to enable private placements in the international financial markets to qualify for registration? 5.3 Are there any other robust tests which could be used to determine that a security will not be issued to persons associated with a New Zealand borrower? 5.4 Is two years an appropriate period to allow existing registered securities to re- register under the new application process? 28 CHAPTER 6 How branches interact with the NRWT rules 6.1 The legislation currently has exemptions from NRPI for interest payments that are made by foreign branches of New Zealand companies or are made to foreign companies with New Zealand branches. Both exemptions are so wide in scope that they currently exempt certain interest payments that are not consistent with the policy intent for the taxation of New Zealand-sourced income earned by non-residents. Offshore branch exemption Issue 6.2 NRPI includes only income that has a New Zealand source. One of the exclusions from having a New Zealand source is the offshore branch exemption. This applies where the interest is derived from money lent outside New Zealand to a New Zealand resident that uses that money for the purposes of a business it carries on through a fixed establishment offshore. 6.3 This exemption is intended to apply to a New Zealand resident operating an active business through a branch in another country. If that offshore branch borrows money to fund its offshore operations the interest on this funding should not be subject to NRWT. This treatment ensures that the offshore branch of a New Zealand company does not have to pay NRWT when a foreign incorporated subsidiary borrowing for an equivalent business would not have to. This is shown in figure 1. Figure 1: Offshore branch exemption Offshore Branch NZ Company Foreign Lender Foreign Company OffshoreNZ Foreign Factory Foreign Factory Interest (no NRWT) Interest (no NRWT – offshore branch exemption) 29 6.4 However, this exemption also applies where a New Zealand company sets up an offshore branch which borrows money for the purpose of providing funding to New Zealand borrowers, who may be related or unrelated to the New Zealand company. 6.5 In this circumstance a New Zealand resident can borrow from a non-resident lender through an offshore branch of a second New Zealand resident without that borrowing incurring NRWT. If the first New Zealand resident had borrowed directly from the non-resident lender, the interest would be liable for NRWT (or AIL). As these are economically the same transaction they should have the same tax treatment. This is shown in figure 2. Figure 2: Offshore branch lends to New Zealand 6.6 This structure has been adopted by a number of participants in the New Zealand financial sector as a means for funding their New Zealand operations. We are not aware of it currently being used by any non-financial sector entities. 6.7 Australia also has an offshore branch exemption from NRWT. However, section 128B(2A) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 prevents this exemption being used in relation to money which is then on-lent to Australia. This is achieved by imposing NRWT on interest paid by an Australian resident (or a non-resident in connection with an Australian branch) to an offshore branch of an Australian resident. Addressing the problem 6.8 Officials wish to explore addressing this issue by defining interest paid by the offshore branch of a New Zealand resident as New Zealand-sourced income, except where that interest is paid on money borrowed for the purpose of a business outside New Zealand, which does not involve lending to New Zealand residents. This is shown in figure 3. Offshore Branch NZ Company 2 NZ Company Foreign Lender OffshoreNZ Interest (NRWT) Interest (no NRWT – offshore branch exemption) Interest (no NRWT – between NZ residents) 30 Figure 3: Proposal 6.9 This approach will remove the incentive to use an offshore branch for the purpose of removing AIL on international debt funding of New Zealand residents. This will create a consistent tax treatment for those who pay AIL on such funding because they do not have the scale, and/or other commercial reasons, to justify an offshore branch. 6.10 To ensure that such interest is appropriately subject to New Zealand tax, we intend also to require that if NRWT is not actually paid on such interest, payment of AIL will be mandatory. 6.11 An alternative approach would be to impose NRWT (or AIL) on interest payments on amounts borrowed by a New Zealand resident from an offshore branch of another New Zealand resident. This is shown in figure 4. However, in this case it would seem difficult to also subject the interest earned by the second New Zealand resident to net income tax. Giving the second resident a tax exemption is not consistent with the taxation of New Zealand residents on their worldwide income. There might also be an 31 argument that where the borrower and the branch are associated but the ultimate lender is not, AIL should be payable rather than NRWT. For these reasons we prefer the approach outlined above; we invite submissions on this point. Figure 4: Alternative to proposal (not favoured) Application date 6.12 Officials suggest that the reforms outlined in this chapter would apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after enactment of the legislation. This is expected to be in the second half of 2016. Transitional 6.13 For financial arrangements entered into by offshore branches of New Zealand banking groups before enactment of the changes, we intend to impose AIL on interest payments made in income years beginning more than five years after enactment of the legislation. This provides an extended period of grandparenting, after which it is appropriate to apply the new rules to all arrangements. Consideration will also be given to whether a prepayment rule is required. 6.14 For any existing arrangements of offshore branches of non-bank groups, we suggest imposing NRWT or AIL (depending on whether or not the lender to the branch is associated with the borrower) on interest payments made in income years following enactment. There will also be a prepayment rule. 32 Onshore branch exemption Issue 6.15 New Zealand-sourced interest income derived by a non-resident is not NRPI when the non-resident lender is engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. This exemption from NRPI is known as the onshore branch exemption. 6.16 When NRWT, and this exemption, were introduced in 1964 many retail borrowers funded their home mortgages through banks and other institutions that operated in New Zealand as a branch of their overseas parent. These branches pay income tax on their branch income in a similar way to New Zealand residents. This exemption meant these retail borrowers did not have to deduct NRWT from interest paid to New Zealand based lenders. This is shown in figure 5. Figure 5: Onshore branch exemption In figure 5, both NZ Branch of Bank Foreign Sub and Bank NZ Sub are subject to New Zealand income tax on their New Zealand net income. 6.17 However, the exemption from NRWT also applies to lending by an entity with a New Zealand branch where the lending is not made through the New Zealand branch. As with the New Zealand branch income, this non-branch (but New Zealand-sourced) income is subject to New Zealand net income tax. This treatment of non-New Zealand branch income can be contrasted with the offshore branch exemption which does not apply to all interest paid by a resident company with an offshore branch, but only to interest on money borrowed which is “used by \[the branch\] for the purposes of a business they carry on outside New Zealand”. 6.18 There are at least two problems with this extension of the onshore branch exemption. 33 6.19 First, there is no NRWT (or AIL) on interest paid on money borrowed by the non-resident which is not for the purpose of its New Zealand branch, whereas there is NRWT (or AIL) on money borrowed for the purpose of the New Zealand branch. This means it is possible for a non-resident parent to lend money to its New Zealand subsidiary with no tax payable on the interest (other than income tax on a very slim margin). The parent can simply lend the money to the head office of a non-New Zealand group company which has a New Zealand branch. The head office of that company can then lend the money to a New Zealand group company. 6.20 Second, it is more difficult practically for New Zealand to audit the non- resident’s non-New Zealand activities, which is necessary to ensure that net income tax is being paid on its non-New Zealand branch but New Zealand- sourced income. 6.21 In practice, this exemption has been used by both financial sector and non- financial sector groups to fund New Zealand entities without paying NRWT or AIL. 6.22 This structure is shown in figure 6. Figure 6: Comparison of current onshore branch exemption In figure 6 the net profit of Foreign Sub 1 NZ Branch and net profit from the New Zealand-sourced income of Foreign Sub 2 is subject to New Zealand income tax. However, unlike Foreign Sub 1, the interest payment by Foreign Sub 2 to Foreign Parent does not have a New Zealand source so is not subject to NRWT. Note that if NZ Sub borrowed directly from Foreign Parent, it would be required to withhold NRWT from the interest payments. 34 Addressing the problem 6.23 Accordingly, we suggest restricting the onshore branch exemption so that interest income of a non-resident with a New Zealand branch will only be exempted from being NRPI if the money lent is used by the non-resident for the purposes of a business it carries on through its New Zealand branch. This is shown in figure 7. Figure 7: Proposal comparison for onshore branch exemption Application date and transitional treatment 6.24 We suggest the same application date and transitional treatment for interest paid to a non-resident entity with a New Zealand branch 12 as we do for interest paid by a non-New Zealand branch of a New Zealand entity. 6.25 That is, NRWT (or AIL if the non-resident is not associated with the borrower) will apply to interest payments on all arrangements entered into after enactment of the legislation. Unless the non-resident operates in New Zealand as a registered bank, it will also apply to interest income on existing arrangements in income years following enactment. The prepayment rule, if introduced, would apply in this context. If the non-resident does operate in New Zealand as a registered bank, payments with respect to pre-enactment arrangements will be subject to NRWT/AIL if made on or after the fifth year following enactment of the legislation. 12 Excluding interest paid to the New Zealand branch, which is not subject to any change. Foreign Sub 2 NZ Branch Foreign Sub 1 NZ Branch NZ Sub Foreign Parent Offshore NZ Interest (no NRWT – onshore branch exemption) Interest (NRWT – NZ source) Interest (no NRWT –no NZ source) Interest (NRWT – onshore branch exemption does not apply) 35 Cross-border related-party borrowing by banks 6.26 On first principles, whether NRWT or AIL applies to interest paid by a New Zealand resident to either:  the offshore branch of a New Zealand resident; or  a non-resident with a New Zealand branch, where the interest does not relate to the branch will be determined by whether or not the borrower and lender are associated. However, this proposition requires further examination in the case of bank lending. 6.27 For a New Zealand bank that is part of a wider worldwide banking operation there are commercial reasons why the New Zealand bank may borrow from its parent or another associated entity. This can include the better credit rating held by the larger parent, economies of scale of a single funding operation and/or better name recognition of the parent, which allows funding to be raised more cheaply. 6.28 Unlike most other industries, even when the fungibility of money prevents it being traced through to the ultimate funding source, due to the structure of a bank as a margin lender it can reasonably be considered that funding on-lent to a New Zealand bank by its parent is largely ultimately borrowed from an unrelated third party and is largely not provided by the parent bank’s shareholders as a substitute for equity. 6.29 Interest on related-party funding to a New Zealand bank should be set according to transfer pricing principles such as the cost of funds to the parent bank, any difference in credit rating of the New Zealand bank, and different terms applied to the money lent to the New Zealand bank compared with its original borrowing. Accordingly the New Zealand bank has to accept (or not) the interest rate applied to that funding and has very little negotiating power over what that rate is. 6.30 If a foreign associate lends directly to a New Zealand-incorporated registered bank, the interest on this lending will be subject to NRWT. Whereas if that lending is channelled through an offshore branch of a New Zealand subsidiary or the head office of an offshore company with a New Zealand branch, this lending is not subject to NRWT. 13 As these arrangements have the same economic substance, the NRWT treatment should be the same. 6.31 By restricting the offshore and onshore branch exemptions, as covered above, New Zealand banks will no longer be able to rely on these structures to remove their NRWT liability. However, we recognise that, as covered above, banks are margin lenders, which means that:  they do not make large profits on any particular dollar of lending; and 13 Due to not having a New Zealand source or not being NRPI respectively. 36  their related party lending is indirectly sourced from third parties and is not a substitute for equity investment. Also, applying NRWT to bank interest would be likely to increase the cost of capital for all borrowers in New Zealand significantly, should the banks increase their level of related party funding into New Zealand. For these reasons NRWT is likely to be inappropriate for this lending. 6.32 Officials therefore suggest that banks be allowed to pay AIL on interest paid to non-resident associated lenders. This would only apply when the borrower is a member of a New Zealand banking group (as already defined for thin capitalisation purposes). 6.33 For the same reasons, the suggestions in Chapter 3 would not apply to registered banks either. 6.34 We suggest that banks would be able to pay AIL on interest payments made after the enactment of the bill containing these proposals. 6.35 There is no suggestion to extend this approach to non-banks, including other businesses operating in the financial sector. This is because, unlike other industries, banks already have a clear definition which removes boundary issues and provides confidence that related-party funding is not an economic substitute for equity investment. This is consistent with the current legislation where New Zealand-registered banks are subject to more rigorous thin capitalisation requirements and greater regulatory oversight by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, than other financial sector taxpayers. Questions for submitters 6.1 Should the offshore branch exemption apply to borrowing used to make loans to New Zealand residents? 6.2 Are there any particular reasons to apply AIL/NRWT to interest paid to an offshore branch by a New Zealand-resident borrower, rather than applying it to the interest which the offshore branch pays on money it borrows in order to make the loan to the New Zealand-resident borrower? 6.2 Should the onshore branch exemption apply only to borrowing through the New Zealand branch of a foreign lender? 6.3 Should New Zealand-registered banks be able to pay AIL on related-party funding provided by a non-resident? 6.4 Should the suggested changes apply from the dates identified above? 37 APPENDIX 1 Current law The main rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 for applying NRWT to interest that are relevant to this issues paper are set out below. RA 6 Withholding and payment obligations for passive income Non-resident passive income (2) A person who makes a payment of non-resident passive income must withhold and pay NRWT for the payment to the Commissioner under subpart RF (Withholding tax on non-resident passive income (NRWT)) by the due dates. RA 9 Treatment of amounts withheld as received Payments treated as received or derived (1) An amount withheld from a payment under this Part, unless a provision in this Part states otherwise,– (a) is treated as received– (i) by the person to whom the payment is made; and (ii) at the time the payment is made; and (b) is treated for the purposes of this Act as derived by the person at the same time and in the same way as they derive the payment from which the amount is withheld; and (c) includes a combined tax and earner-related payment. RF 1 NRWT rules and their application Meaning (1) The NRWT rules means— (a) this subpart; and (b) section LB 5 (Tax credits for non-resident withholding tax); and (c) sections LJ 1 to LJ 3, LJ 6, and LJ 7 (which relate to tax credits for foreign income tax); and (d) sections LK 1 to LK 5, and LK 7 (which relate to tax credits related to attributed CFC income); and (e) sections 32M, 49, 100, Part 9, and sections 165B and 185 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application (2) The NRWT rules apply to a person who makes a payment that consists of non-resident passive income. 38 RF 2 Non-resident passive income Interest, certain dividends, and royalties (1) Non-resident passive income means income having a source in New Zealand that a non-resident derives and that consists of— (a) a dividend other than an investment society dividend: (b) a royalty: (c) an investment society dividend when the non-resident is not engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand: (d) interest when the non-resident is not engaged in business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Inclusion: Capital value increase under inflation-indexed instruments (1B) Non-resident passive income includes an amount, arising at the time of a relevant coupon payment (the current coupon payment) equal to the amount given by the formula in section RE 18B(4) (Capital value increase under inflation-indexed instruments: RWT cap) in relation to the current coupon payment, if that current coupon payment is— (a) non-resident passive income under subsection (1); and (b) in relation to an inflation-indexed instrument. Exclusions (2) The following amounts derived by a non-resident are excluded from non-resident passive income: (a) an amount of exempt income: (b) interest arising because section EI 2 (Interest from inflation- indexed instruments) applies to an inflation-indexed instrument: (c) an amount of excluded income under sections CX 56B and CX 56C (which relate to attributed PIE income), as applicable. When subsection (4) applies (3) Subsection (4) applies in an income year when a person derives non- resident passive income consisting of— (a) a dividend other than an investment society dividend: (b) a royalty for the use, production, or reproduction of, or for the right to use, produce, or reproduce, a literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic work in which copyright subsists: (c) interest or a royalty derived by a life insurer from a company resident in New Zealand when the interest or royalty is treated as arising as a result of the life insurer’s election under section EY 49 (Non-resident life insurer becoming resident): (d) interest or an investment society dividend when the person paying and the person deriving the interest or dividend are not associated persons. 39 Final withholding (4) If the person is a filing taxpayer, the schedular income tax liability for the corresponding tax year under section BC 7 (Income tax liability of person with schedular income) for schedular income that is non-resident passive income is determined by the amount of tax required to be withheld under this Part. Exception: minimum amount (5) Despite subsection (4), if a person derives non-resident passive income consisting of interest, investment society dividends, or a royalty other than those described in subsection (3), the person’s income tax liability for the corresponding tax year is the greater of— (a) the sum of the total non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) for which they are liable and the amount that would be their income tax liability for the tax year if they had not derived non-resident passive income in the tax year: (b) the amount that would be their income tax liability in the absence of this subsection. Company deriving minimum amount (6) For the purposes of subsection (5) for a company, if the total amount of non-resident passive income and other income derived by the company in the corresponding tax year is not more than $1,000, the income tax liability of the company for the tax year is the sum referred to in subsection (5)(a). Application of financial arrangements rules (7) The financial arrangements rules do not apply to the calculation of an amount of non-resident passive income. RF 3 Obligation to withhold amounts of tax for non-resident passive income Withholding amount of tax (1) A person who makes a payment of non-resident passive income must withhold the amount of tax for the payment and pay it to the Commissioner. The obligation to withhold arises under section RA 6(2) (Withholding and payment obligations for passive income) at the time of payment RF 12 Interest paid by approved issuers or transitional residents When this section applies (1) This section applies in relation to an amount of non-resident passive income that consists of— (a) interest that— (i) is paid by an approved issuer under a registered security; and (ii) is derived by a person not associated with the approved issuer except by being a beneficiary of a trust established for the main purpose of protecting and enforcing beneficiaries' rights under the registered security; and (i) is not a payment to which section RF 12B applies: 40 (b) interest that— (i) is paid by a transitional resident in relation to money borrowed by them while non-resident; and (ii) is not paid in relation to a business carried on through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; and (iii) is derived by a person not associated with the transitional resident; and (iv) is not a payment to which section RF 12B applies. Zero-rating (2) The rate of NRWT payable on the amount is 0%. Interest paid under registered securities (3) For the purposes of the NRWT rules, an amount of interest is paid by an approved issuer under a registered security only if it is treated as paid in relation to a registered security under section 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.

The test will require income tax to be paid on any gains from the sale of residential property that is bought and sold within two years, with the exception of the main family ho me. 1.2 The purpose of the bright-line test is to supplement the “intention test” in the current land sale rules. The intention test makes gains from the sale of real property purchased with an intention of resale taxable. 1.3 The intention test can be difficult to enforce due to its subject ivit y. The bright-line test is intended to deal with the problem by supplementing the intention test with an unambiguous objective test. 1.4 The objective nature of the test means the bright-line test will make a sale o f residential property taxable when the seller did not acquire the property w it h an intention of resale and when a person needs to sell property due to circumstances outside of their control. This is unavoidable for the bright-line test to achieve its goal of being objective and unambiguous. 1.5 For the bright-line test to be effective, the number of except ions should be as few as possible, and tightly defined. However, we consider that some exceptions can be justified for types of acquisitions when the property is the main home of the seller or, in certain circumstances, when the seller did not intend to acquire the property. 1.6 This issues paper discusses the design of the bright-line test, where we have attempted to use existing rules in tax law where possible. This helps provide certainty for taxpayers, by using existing interpretations and guidance when applying the rules. Suggested wording for the charging provision and main home exception is provided in the Appendix. Officials are interested in feedback on the suggested changes outlined in this paper. How to make a submission 1.7 Officials invite submissions on the suggested changes and points raised in this issues paper. Submissions should be addressed to: Bright-line test for sales of resident ial property C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz wit h “Bright-line test for sales of residential property” in the subject line. Electronic submissions are encouraged. The closing date for submissions is 24 July 2015. 1.8 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.9 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 2 CHAPTER 2 Summary of suggested changes 2.1 Below is a summary of officials’ suggestions for the design of the bright-line test. Was there a disposal of land? Is the land residential? Was the property disposed within two years of acquisition ? Not covered by bright -line test Was the property your “main home”? Is the amount you received greater than the cost of the property? Was the property received through an inheritance? Was the property transferred to you under a relationship property agreement? The amount is included in your income tax return as ordinary income taxed at marginal rates. Was the “original date of acquisition” within two years of you disposing of it? Was the disposal of land to an associated person? No loss allowed Loss is allowed but ring- fenced so it is only able to be used against gains from other land sales. Yes No No No No No No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No 3 Acquisition date and disposal 2.2 The two-year period for the bright-line test runs from the date of acquisition to the date of disposal. The date of acquisition is the date that tit le is registered for the purchase of the property and the date of disposal is the date that a person enters into an agreement for sale and purchase for the sale. When the disposal is other than by sale (for example, a gift), the date of disposal will be determined under the ordinary rules. 2.3 If disposal occurs before registration 1 (sales of the right to buy), the bright- line period runs from the day that a person enters into an agreement for sale and purchase (for the purchase of the right) to the date that a person enters into an agreement for sale and purchase (for the sale of the right). 2.4 The suggested bright-line test will apply to properties for which an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into from 1 October 2015, and which is subsequently disposed of. When the property was acquired other than by way of sale, the suggested bright-line test will apply to properties for which registration of title occurs after 1 October 2015. Definition of “residential land” 2.5 Under the suggested changes, resident ial land means: • land that has a dwelling on it; or • land for which there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it; • but does not include land that is used predominantly as business premises or as farmland. 2.6 Farmland is land where the area and nature of the land disposed of means that it is then capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business. Main home exception 2.7 Under the suggested changes, the main home exception will apply when the land has a dwelling on it and the dwelling is occupied mainly as a residence and is the main home of: • the owner; or • if the owner is a trustee, one or more beneficiaries of the trust. 2.8 If a settlor of a trust has a main home that is not owned by the trust, the main ho me exception cannot apply to any property owned by the trust. 1 Including what are commonly referred to as sales “off the plan”. 4 Exceptions for relationship property and inherited property under the suggested changes 2.9 Under the suggested changes, inherited property is excluded from the bright- line test. This means no tax liability under the bright-line test would arise for the transfer of property under an inheritance, and the beneficiary would not be liable under the bright-line test for any subsequent disposal of the property. 2.10 Transfers of property under a relationship property agreement would not be subject to a tax liability under the bright-line test. However, any subsequent sale of the transferred property may be subject to the bright-line test. A liability would arise if the property is disposed of within two years of the registration date on the acquisition by the transferor (and the property was not the transferee’s main home). Deductibility of expenditure 2.11 Taxpayers would be allo wed deductions for property subject to the bright- line test according to ordinary tax rules. Losses 2.12 Losses arising only as a result of the bright-line test would be ring-fenced so that they may only be used to offset taxable gains arising under the land sale rules. As is currently the case, losses would not be ring-fenced if they are taxable under another land sale rule. 2.13 A person would not be able to recognise a loss under the bright-line test arising from a transfer of property to an associated person. Land-rich companies and trusts 2.14 The use of land-rich companies and trusts to circumvent the bright-line test would be addressed through an anti-avoidance rule that deems a disposal subject to the bright-line test to have occurred if any of the following are done with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the suggested bright-line test: • the disposal of shares; • a change in the trustees of a trust; • a change in the beneficiaries of a trust; • a change in the identity of any person who is able to appoint the trustee or the beneficiaries of a trust; and • a change in the ownership of a corporate trustee. 5 6 CHAPTER 3 Date of acquisition and disposal 3.1 Under the suggested changes, the bright-line test would apply to sales of property when the property is acquired and disposed of within two years. For most sales of residential property there are four relevant dates for acquisition and disposal. 3.2 There are two key objectives for defining the date of acquisit io n and disposal: • providing a certain date so that sellers and Inland Revenue know if the sale falls within the bright-line test; and • minimising opportunities for people to avoid the bright-line test by artificially deferring sales. Date of acquisition 3.3 Under the current land sale rules the acquisition date is the date that a person enters into a sale and purchase agreement (CP). Using this date for the bright-line test is problemat ic. Where a seller has a different lawyer or conveyancer for the sale than they had for the purchase, the seller may not have access to the original sale and purchase agreement. This can mean it is difficult for the seller to know the original date they entered into a sale and purchase agreement, and for Inland Revenue to verify that date. This means that using the contract to purchase date as the date of acquisition would create uncertainty. 3.4 For the bright-line test, we think that the date of acquisition should be the date that title is registered for the purchase (RP). This provides a definite date recorded on Landonline 2 that can be easily used by sellers and Inland Revenue to know when the bright-line period starts. 3 2 http://www.linz.govt.nz/land/landonline 3 A definite date would also assist implementing a withholding tax. With a definite date it is easier for purchasers of property to know whether they need to withhold because the sale is subject to the bright-line. CP Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) RP Registration of title for purchase CS Contract to sell (sale and purchase agreement) RS Registration of title for sale 7 Date of disposal 3.5 We think the date of disposal should be the date that a person enters into a contract to sell the property. This date is available to the seller at the time of the sale so provides certainty. 3.6 This would mean that the relevant date is different for acquisit io n and disposal. We think this is necessary, as using the date of registration for disposal leaves open an opportunity to avoid the bright-line test by artificially deferring a sale. 3.7 As the example above shows, the registration date could be deferred while still having the same economic outcome as a sale. This would provide a significant avoidance risk. As a result, we consider the date for disposal should be the date a person enters into a contract to sell the property. Disposals with no contract to buy 3.8 Under the suggested changes, where a disposal does not involve a contract to sell (for example, a gift), the date of disposal will be determined according to ordinary rules. Subdivision of an existing title 3.9 For the purposes of the bright-line test, the date of acquisition for subdivided land by an owner is the original date of acquisition of the undivided land by the owner. An example is a person who acquires residential land in February 2016, subdivides the land in 2022, and sells the back section in 2023. The sale of the back section will not be subject to the bright-line test. The treatment is appropriate because the sale of the existing title would not be subject to the bright-line test because it would have occurred more than two Property is rented CP Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) 1 May 2016 – RP Registration of title for purchase 1 November 2016 – CS Contract to sell 2 May 2018 - RS Registration of title for sale 1 May 2016: Alex acquires residential property (registration - RP) 1 November 2016: Alex wants to sell the property to Bob. However the sale is profitable, and Alex does not want to be caught by the bright-line test. To avoid the bright-line test, Alex enters into a deferred sale and purchase agreement with Bob. Under the agreement, registration is deferred until 2 May 2018. Alex agrees to rent the property to Bob until the date of registration. Example: If date of disposal was registration 8 years after the land was acquired. However, if the back section had been subdivided and sold in 2017, the sale would be caught by the bright-line test. Sales of the right to sell 3.10 An additional rule is needed for sales of the right to buy property (including sales “off the plan”). 3.11 A sale of the right to buy property is when a person sells their interest in property before the date of registration. When a sale of the right to buy property occurs within two years of acquiring that right, it is intended that the bright-line test should apply. 3.12 To capture these sales, we suggest that the bright-line test applies when a person: • disposes of residential property before taking legal ownership (RP); and • the disposal was within two years of the seller entering into a sale and purchase agreement (CP). Transitional rules 3.13 The bright-line test would apply to properties for which an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into from 1 October 2015, and which are subsequently disposed of. When the property was acquired other than by way of sale, the bright-line test would apply to properties for which registration of title occurs after 1 October 2015. If less than 2 years then the gain is taxed CP Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) RP Registration of title CS Contract to sell 2 June 2015 – CP Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) 1 November 2015 – RP Registration of title for purchase 1 December 2015 – CS Contract to sell This transaction would not be covered by the bright-line test as the relevant sale and purchase agreement was entered into before 1 October 2015. Example: Contract to buy before 1 October 2015 9 Disposals under insolvency 3.14 Disposals also occur as a result of individual or corporate insolvency. Officials welcome submissions on how the bright-line should apply to disposals in these situat ions. Example: Bankruptcy 1 May 2016 Emma purchases residential property for $500k 1 May 2017 Property transferred to Official Assignee as part of a bankruptcy proceeding (market value of property is $600k) 1 August 2017 Official Assignee sells property at auction for $650k $500k $600k $650k 10 CHAPTER 4 Definition of “residential land” 4.1 The bright-line test would only apply to residential land. This is because residential land has been identified as an area where there is particular difficulty in enforcing the land sale rules due to the high churn of such property and high vo lume of transactions. 4.2 Restricting the bright-line test to residential land does raise boundary issues, particularly for mixed-use land and bare land. The goal of the definition of “residential land” is to appropriately define this boundary and ensure that residential property and property developments are covered while, at the same time, not overreaching and inadvertently capturing commercial, industrial or agricultural property. Suggested change 4.3 To appropriately balance these factors, we suggest that the definition o f “residential land” be: • land that has a dwelling on it; or • land for which there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it; • but does not include land that is used predominantly as business premises or as farmland. 4.4 The second criterion of this definition is intended to capture sales where the land is bare or currently being used for commercial or other purposes but is proposed to be developed into residential properties. This will ensure sales “off the plan” and other similar developments are captured. 4.5 This definition of residential land covers all land with a house on it but carves out those which are predominantly used for business purposes. The definit ion o f “dwelling” would be the same as that currently used in the Income Tax Act 2007 but with adjustments to ensure that investors in serviced apartments are subject to the bright-line. However, a person who owns and operates serviced apartments as a business will not be subject to the bright-line due to the business premises exception. Business premises and farmland definition 4.6 The current land sale rules have definit io ns of business premises and farmland that, with modification, we think are appropriate for use for the bright-line test. 4 4.7 The suggested definit io n of “business premises” is land that is the premises of a business. 4 Sections CB 19 and CB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 11 4.8 The suggested definit io n of “farmland” is land where the area and nature of the land disposed of means that it is then capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business. 5 Definition of “land” 4.9 The definit io n of “land” under current tax law is: land — (a) includes any estate or interest in land: (b) includes an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land: (c) does not include a mortgage 4.10 This means “land” for the bright-line will include freehold and leasehold estates in land. 4.11 There is some uncertainty in the current definition of “land” as to whether it includes an interest in land. 6 We suggest clarifying that “land” does include an interest in land. Example scenario: Development Andrew buys an empty plot of land. He plans to develop the plot by subdividing it into four lots and building houses on each of the lots. Andrew sells Lot 1 off the plan to Bob. One month later, Bob sells Lot 1 to Cara. Lot 1 would be residential land and Bob would be subject to the bright-line test as Lot 1 is proposed to be used for residential purposes. 5 Capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business means land capable of producing revenue sufficient to cover all costs of holding and operating the land, including the cost of capital employed and a reasonable recompense for the proprietor’s labour. 6 The current uncertainty is a result of an unintended legislative change during the Income Tax Act rewrite. Lot 1 12 CHAPTER 5 Main home exception 5.1 The suggested bright-line test is intended to apply to most disposals of residential land within two years of the acquisition of the property. However, there are three situations when the disposal of property is not intended to give rise to a tax liability under the suggested bright-line test for any gains from a disposal. 5.2 The first situation is when the property is the main home of the vendor. Excluding a person’s main home from the bright-line test is consistent with the current land sale rules, which generally exclude the sale of a person’s principal residence. 5.3 The main home exception should be tightly defined. Where a property is used mainly for investment purposes or where a person has multiple homes the main home exception should not apply (or should not apply more than once). Suggested change 5.4 We suggest that the main home exception applies when: • the land has a dwelling on it; • the dwelling is occupied mainly as a residence by the owner; and • the dwelling is the main home of the owner. 5.5 If the property is owned by a trust, we suggest that the main home exception apply when the dwelling is occupied mainly as a residence by a beneficiary of the trust, and is the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. 5.6 If the settlor of the trust has a main home that is not owned by the trust, then we propose the main home exception cannot apply to any property owned by the trust. Mainly as a residence 5.7 We suggest that the main home exception apply when the dwelling is occupied mainly as a residence. This requirement is the key test for the residential exclusion within the current land sale rules and is intended to ensure that properties used mainly for investment or other purposes are not covered by the exception. 5.8 It is intended that this test is determined based on what a person’s actual use of the property is rather than what they intended the property to be used for. 13 Main home 5.9 A person should only be able to use the main home exception for one property at a time. To enable this, we suggest the exception applies to a property that is the “main home” of the owner and is used “mainly as a residence” by the owner. 5.10 Where a person has several residences, their “main home” is determined according to which property a person has the greatest connection. The factors that determine these connections would be similar to those used to determine whether a dwelling is a person’s “permanent place of abode” for residence rules and include: • the time the person occupies the dwelling; • where their immediate family (if any) live; • where their social ties are strongest; • the person’s use of the dwelling; • the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located; and • whether the person’s personal property is in the dwelling. Example: Multiple homes Bob has two homes. One home is a small apartment in Christchurch, which Bob lives in five days a week because he works in Christchurch. The other home is in Wellington where his family lives. Bob lives in his Wellington home during weekends and holidays. H is Wellington home is also where most of his personal possessions are located. The Wellington home is Bob’s main home as it is the place he has the greatest connection with. 14 Trusts 5.11 A significant number of family homes in New Zealand are owned by family trusts. Accordingly, the main home exception has been drafted to allow for this possibility, so that a home owned by a trust can be regarded as a main ho me. However, when a person’s family members live in different dwellings, there is a risk of trust ownership being used to claim the main home exception for more than one residence. 5.12 To prevent the inappropriate use of the main home exception by trustees, we suggest that property owned by a trust is not eligible for the exception if a settlor of the trust: • separately owns a main home; or • is a beneficiary of another trust that owns the main home for the settlor. Lot 3 Lot 4 Lot 2 Lot 1 Example: Subdivision 1 May 2016: Andrew buys a large plot of land which has a house on it. Andrew lives in the house. 1 June 2017: Andrew subdivides the land into four lots. Lot 4 contains the house Andrew lives in. 1 July 2017: Andrew sells Lot 1. Andrew cannot use the main home exception for Lot 1 because it does not have a dwelling on it. Example: Student flat Dave has two properties, a family home which he lives in, and a student flat which his son lives in while studying on a three-year course. Dave puts the student flat into a trust and makes his son a discretionary beneficiary of the trust. The trust cannot use the main home exception because the settlor of the trust (Dave) has another main home. 15 Regular pattern of acquiring and disposing 5.13 The current residential exclusion does not apply to a person who engages in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of dwellinghouses. This is intended to ensure habitual renovators cannot utilise the residential exclusio n (those who repeatedly purchase property with an intention of resale, occupy the property, renovate it and then sell it). 5.14 For the purposes of the bright-line test we consider that this provision would be unnecessary as the “habitual renovator” would be captured by the intention test in the current land sale rules. It would also be overly harsh for a person who genuinely has to move homes multiple times due to circumstances outside of their control. 16 CHAPTER 6 Exceptions for inherited property and relationship property 6.1 In addition to the main home exception, we suggest two further situations when the disposal of residential land is not intended to give rise to a tax liability under the bright-line test. The two situations are when the property is transferred: • on the death of a person; or • under a relationship property agreement. Property transferred on the death of a person 6.2 When a person dies, their property may be sold or transferred to a beneficiary, who may subsequently sell the property. It is intended those disposals will not trigger a liability for tax under the bright-line test. Transfer of property from deceased to beneficiaries 6.3 When a taxpayer dies, an estate can be dealt with in several ways, depending on whether a will exists. A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased’s estate (an administrator). 6.4 The executor or administrator is vested with legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased’s property from the time of death to the end of the period of executorship or administration. The beneficiaries have a right to have the deceased’s estate administered properly during this period but do not have a legal or beneficial interest in the assets. 6.5 The duties of the executor or administrator are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the legacies. At the end of the period of executorship or administration, the executor or administrator becomes a trustee of the residual assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. 6.6 Normally, it takes nine to twelve months to wind up an estate with real property and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries. Property that has been bequeathed or devised under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. Specific legacies are treated as taking effect from the date of death, so income arising from the property is derived by the beneficiary from the date of death. A general or residuary legacy vests in a beneficiary at the time of distribution. 17 Transfers of land subject to the current land rules 6.7 Tax law treats the distribution of property following the death of a person as two transfers. The first transfer is from the deceased person to the administrator or executor and is deemed to occur immediately before the person dies. The second transfer is from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary and occurs on the date of the relevant transaction. The current rules distinguish between: • transfers to a surviving spouse, de facto partner or civil union partner (relationship partners), a close relative or a charity; and • other transfers. 6.8 These two situations are discussed below. Certain transfers to a relationship partner, close relative or charity 6.9 The current rules provide special treatment (commonly referred to as “rollover relief”) for transfers to relationship partners, close relatives and charities (subject to certain conditions). 6.10 The effect of the rollover relief is not to tax the deceased person or their estate for any possible tax liability on the disposal of the property but to delay any tax liability until any subsequent disposal by the beneficiary. 6.11 The rollover relief is achieved by deeming the transfers from the deceased person to the executor or administrator, and from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary, as a disposal and acquisition of the property at the total cost of the land to the deceased person at the date of transfer (rather than at the land’s market value). The effect of this is that no tax liabilities under the current land rules arise under the transfers. When a major development is being undertaken on the land, it is treated as being disposed of for, and acquired at, the market value of the land at the commencement of the undertaking or scheme plus any expenditure that has been incurred on the development. This has the effect of transferring the land at its tax book value so no income tax liability is triggered on the transfer. Further, if a person holds land which would be taxable if sold within 10 years of acquisition, the person’s death will not trigger a tax liability. 6.12 Instead, the relevant time periods under the current land rules and the intentions of the deceased person are inherited by the beneficiary. This means that if the beneficiary subsequently disposes of the property, they will be subject to any of the applicable current land rules and so may be subject to income tax on any gains they derive from the sale. 6.13 Not all transfers to relationship partners, close relatives or charities are accorded rollover relief. The current rules provide certain conditions that must be satisfied for the rollover relief to apply. 18 Other transfers 6.14 Rollover relief is not accorded if the transfer is: • to a person other than a relationship partner, close relative or charity; or • to a relationship partner, close relative or charity but the relevant conditions for rollover relief are not satisfied. 6.15 In those situations, the property is deemed to be: • transferred from the deceased person to the executor or administrator at market value, which may trigger a tax liability if the market value is greater than the cost of the property; • transferred from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary at market value, which may trigger a tax liability; and • acquired by the beneficiary on the date of the transfer to the beneficiary. The beneficiary may in their own right be subject to one of the current land rules on the disposal of property. For example, a relevant zoning change may occur after they acquire the property or they may be subject to one of the 10-year rules. If that is the case, the disposal by the beneficiary may also be subject to tax. Options 6.16 Various options have been considered about how the proposed bright-line test would apply to land that was transferred following a person’s death. Specifically, consideration has been given to: • applying the current rollover relief provisions to land subject to the proposed bright-line test; • applying the current rollover relief provisions but also allowing an exemption for any subsequent disposal of the land by the beneficiary; or • extending the current rollover relief to all transfers following the death of a person and providing an exemption for any subsequent disposal by the beneficiary. 6.17 We recommend the third option. All the options are discussed below. Applying the current rollover relief 6.18 Applying the current rollover relief provisions to land subject to the bright- line test would extend the concessionary treatment only to land transferred to relationship partners, close relatives and charities (in certain circumstances). In such circumstances, the transfers to the executor or administrator, and from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary, would not generate a tax liability. However, any subsequent disposal by a relationship partner or close relative could be subject to the bright-line test if the property was sold within two years from the registration date of the acquisition by the deceased person. 19 6.19 A transfer to someone other than a relationship partner, close relative or charity (or a transfer that does not satisfy the relevant conditions) would not be accorded rollover relief. Instead, the death of a person within two years fro m the registration date of acquisition of residential property would trigger the bright-line test (subject to the exception for the main home). Likewise, the subsequent transfer from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary might also trigger the bright-line test if it occurred within two years. Further, any subsequent disposal of the property by the beneficiary within two years from the date of transfer might trigger the bright-line test. Applying the current rollover relief and an exemption 6.20 Consideration has also been given to applying the current rollover relief provisions but also providing an exemption for any subsequent disposal by the beneficiary. The basis for this approach would be that the beneficiary had not intended to acquire the property, and so should not be deemed to hold the property on revenue account just because the deceased person had held the property on that basis. This would be in contrast to the current land rules, which do deem a beneficiary to hold the property on revenue account if the deceased person held it on revenue account. Applying an exemption for the bright-line test would, therefore, be more concessionary than the current land rules. However such an approach would only apply to relationship partners and close relatives. Extending the current rollover relief to all transfers following a death and an exemption 6.21 The preferred approach for the bright-line test is to extend the current rollover relief to all transfers following a death and to provide an exemption under the bright-line test for any disposals by the executor or administrator and subsequent disposals by the beneficiaries. 6.22 The basis for extending the rollover relief is that because the bright-line test applies more broadly than the current land rules, it is appropriate to provide a broader exception for transfers following the death of a person. In that sense, it is considered appropriate the rollover relief applies no matter what the relationship is between the deceased person and the beneficiary. In other words, the relationship of the beneficiary to the deceased person should not determine the tax treatment of the transfer under the bright-line test following a death. 6.23 The basis for allowing an exemption from the bright-line test for a sale by the executor or administrator, or any subsequent sale by the beneficiary, is the same as described above. Specifically, the basis for the approach is that the beneficiary has not intended to acquire the property, and so should not be subject to the bright-line rule, which is intended as a buttress to the intention of resale rule. 20 6.24 The proposed exception for the bright-line test would not prevent the current land sale rules applying to any subsequent sale of the property by the beneficiary (if it would have been taxable had the deceased person sold it). The exception will have the effect of not bringing into the tax base any sales of inherited property that would not have been brought into the tax base under the current rules. Summary 6.25 The bright-line test is intended to apply to most disposals of residential land within two years of the acquisition of the property. However, there is an exception for land transferred as a result of a death. The current rules provide rollover relief for transfers following a death to relationship partners, close relatives or charities but not other transfers. The preferred approach for the bright-line test is to extend the current rollover relief to all transfers following a death and to provide an exemption for any disposals by the executor, administrator or beneficiaries. Property transferred under a relationship property agreement 6.26 When a relationship breaks down, property may be transferred between the spouses or partners. The property may then subsequently be sold. It is intended that the transfers of property under a relationship property agreement will not be subject to a tax liability under the bright-line test. However, any subsequent sale of the transferred property may be subject to the bright-line test. Transfer of property under a relationship property agreement 6.27 During a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, the parties hold any property according to the conventional laws relating to property. As a result, the parties are free to deal with their property during the relationship wit hout regard to the provisions of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. 1 May 2016 Mrs Higgins acquires residential rental property ($500k) 1 May 2017 Property transferred to administrator at cost ($500k) 1 June 2017 Property transferred to Henry, son of Mrs Higgins, at cost ($500k) 1 July 2017 Henry sells property to Peter for $600k 1 July 2018 Peter sells property to Paul for $800k Transferred for $500k (no gain) $500k $100k gain exempted from bright-line test $200k gain is subject to the bright-line test Transferred for $500k (no gain) $500k $500k $800k Example: Inheritance $600k 21 6.28 When a relationship breaks down, the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 may be invoked by a court order or an agreement between the parties. When the statutory regime is invoked, new property rights operate from the date of the court order or agreement. The property of the spouses or partners is reapportioned between them under principles derived from the statutory regime. Each item of property is divided into one of two statutory categories: • relationship property; and • separate property. 6.29 The fact that a particular item of property is placed within one of these two categories then produces a prima facie result in the way it is treated as between the two spouses or partners. Prima facie all relationship property is divided in equal shares, while separate property is retained by the owner. 6.30 Spouses or partners can enter into an agreement under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 in an on-going relationship (often referred to as a section 21 agreement). Such agreements cannot transfer ownership of property but may only affect the “status” of property (that is, whether it is “separate property” or “relationship property”). Transfers of land subject to the current land rules 6.31 Land that is subject to the current land rules that is transferred under a relationship property agreement is eligible for rollover relief that is similar to that described above. In other words, for such land the transfer is treated as a disposal and acquisition for an amount that equals the total cost of the land to the transferor. When a major development is being undertaken on the land then it is treated as being disposed of for, and acquired at, the market value of the land at the commencement of the undertaking or scheme plus any expenditure that has been incurred on the development. The effect of this is that no tax liabilities under the current land rules arise under the transfers. 6.32 A subsequent disposal of the land by the transferee will be taxable under the current land rules if: • the property is sold for more than the cost of the land to the transferee; and • the amount would have been income of the transferor under the current land rules if they had disposed of the land. 22 Preferred option 6.33 The preferred option is to retain the current rollover relief for transfers under a relationship property agreement for the bright-line test. This will mean that no tax liability under the bright-line test arises for the transfer of the property under the relationship property agreement. However, the transferee may be liable under the bright-line test for any subsequent disposal of the property. A liability will arise if the property is disposed of within two years of the registration date on the acquisition by the transferor (and the property was not the transferee’s main ho me). Why adopt a different approach to transfers on the death of a person to a transfer under a relationship property agreement? 6.34 As discussed above, the preferred approach for the bright-line test following the death of a person is to extend the current rollover relief to all transfers, and to provide an exemption for any subsequent disposals by the beneficiaries. In contrast, the preferred approach for the bright-line test for a transfer under a relationship property agreement, is to retain the current rollover relief and not provide an exemption for any subsequent disposal by the transferee. 6.35 Accordingly, the preferred approaches under the bright-line test differ for property transferred following a death to that under a relationship property agreement. It is acknowledged it could be argued that the same approach should be adopted to both types of transfers. It is considered, however, that there is a principled basis for distinguishing between the two circumstances, and providing for different treatments. Specifically: • In most cases, for the property to be transferred as relationship property under a relationship property agreement the relationship will have had to be in existence for at least two years’. This means that for the most part, property that is subject to the bright-line test would have been acquired during the relevant relationship. It can, therefore, be presumed that both parties to the relationship had a joint purpose or intention in relation to the property when it was acquired. In those circumstances, it is more appropriate to apply the bright-line test to either party following the end of the relationship. • A transferee following a death does not have any choice about what property is transferred to them. They can refuse the legacy or gift but they cannot choose to receive different property. The transferee, therefore, may become a reluctant landlord or property investor following a legacy or gift and it seems appropriate to allow them to dispose of the property in those circumstances without being liable to tax. In contrast, there is more opportunity to negotiate the property that a transferee receives under a relationship property agreement. In those circumstances, it seems more appropriate to apply the current rollover relief but have no exemption for any subsequent sale. 23 Example: Relationship property settlement 1 May 2016 Andrew acquires investment property for $500k Andrew also holds cash of $500k and Bridget has no assets 1 May 2017 As part of a relationship property settlement, investment property is transferred to Bridget 1 Feb 2018 Bridget sells investment property for $700k Transferred for $500k (no gain) Sale is subject to bright-line test $ $ 24 CHAPTER 7 Deductions 7.1 For property that is liable for tax under the bright-line test, taxpayers will be able to deduct expenditure according to the ordinary rules. The cost of the property can be deducted 7.2 A person who sells property that is subject to the bright-line test will be allowed a deduction for the cost of the property at the time of sale. 7.3 The cost of the property includes the amount that was paid to acquire the property (the initial acquisition price of the property). The cost of the property also includes any expenditure related to the acquisition. As a result, the costs of lawyers, valuers, surveyors and real estate agents are deductible. The incidental costs of disposing of the property are also deductible as part of the cost of the property. The cost of the property also includes any capital improvements to the property made after acquisition, such as renovations. Holding costs deductible to the extent sufficient nexus and not private in nature 7.4 While a property is owned there will be periodic holding costs (of a non- capital nature) such as interest, insurance, rates and repairs and maintenance expenses. 7.5 The deductibility of holding costs that are currently deductible will not be affected by the bright-line test. Further, holding costs that are currently not deductible will not become deductible because of the bright-line test. 7.6 To be deductible as incurred, the holding costs must satisfy the normal deduction requirements. In other words, the holding costs are deductible to the extent they have a nexus with income and are not private in nature (or otherwise subject to any of the general limitat ions on deductions). 7.7 A deduction will be of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society. This will be determined by the specific facts of any given situation. However, interest costs can automat ically be deducted if the property is owned by a company (subject to some limitations). 7.8 For example, when the property is part of a business or profit-making undertaking or scheme, and there is no private use, it is likely that the nexus will be sat isfied. Further, when the property is rented out there will likely be a nexus between the holding costs and the rental income. However, if a person purchases a bach for family use, but sells the bach within two years, the holding costs will not be deductible because of the private limitation. 25 Example: Rental property May 2016: Carla buys a rental property for $500k May 2016 to 31 March 2017: Carla pays interest of $30k and rates of $5k July 2016: Carla gets a new roof put on the building at a cost of $80k 2 April 2017: Carla sells the property for $800k Deductions in 2016–17 year = $35k (interest and rates) Deductions in 2017–18 year = $580k (Cost base of property = house and roof) Income in 2017–18 year = $800k Cost of house $500k New roof = $80k Interest = $30k Rates = $5k Rent $ Example: Beach house May 2016: Denise buys a beach house for $500k solely for private use May 2016 to 31 March 2017: Denise pays interest of $30k and rates of $5k July 2016: Denise gets a new roof put on the building at a cost of $80k 2 April 2017: Denise sells the beach house for $800k Deductions in 2016–17 year = $0 – The interest and rates are subject to the private limitation Deductions in 2017–18 year = $580k (Cost base of property = house and roof) Income in 2017–18 year = $800k Cost of house $500k New roof = $80k Interest = $30k Rates = $5k 26 CHAPTER 8 Treatment of losses 8.1 The current land sale rules allo w the cost of property disposed of in a taxable sale to be deducted without limitation. It is not relevant that it may exceed the proceeds of disposal. 8.2 Prima facie this is the correct outcome. Enabling losses to be claimed in circumstances when gains are taxable ensures symmetry and avoids economic distortions. If losses are not able to be claimed it would mean that risky assets would be undervalued and this would result in investment decisions being affected by tax. 8.3 However, an unrestricted ability to use losses from the bright-line test raises risks: • It creates an incentive for taxpayers with unrealised losses before the two-year date to accelerate sales to fall within the two-year bright-line period, and an incentive for taxpayers with unrealised gains at that time to defer the sale of property after two years. • This raises revenue risks as taxpayers are given the opportunity to maximise claimable losses and minimise taxable gains. This is especially the case as a taxpayer who falls within the bright-line test may be able to deduct otherwise non-deductible expenses. Ring-fencing losses 8.4 To minimise these risks, we suggest ring-fencing losses claimable due to the bright-line test, so they are only able to be offset against taxable gains on other land sales. 8.5 This proposed ring-fencing would apply where the sale is taxable solely because it is covered by the bright-line test. The ring-fencing would not apply if the sale is taxable under any of the other land sale rules. 8.6 Ring-fencing losses reduces the revenue risk referred to above, as taxpayers have less incentive to accelerate sales if they do not have offsetable gains and less incentive to defer sales if they have ring-fenced losses. 8.7 Ring-fencing does create a risk of a new distortion as gains and losses are not taxed symmetrically. As a result, it may discourage economically efficient activity when a person does not have any offsetable gains. We think this risk is minor. 27 8.8 Ring-fencing will not affect persons who buy and sell on a frequent basis as they are allowed to claim losses normally under the other land sale rules. For those who are not selling on a frequent basis, denying losses is unlikely to impose a large cost as they perform a relatively small economic function in the housing market. Losses from transfers to associated persons 8.9 When a property has declined in value it is possible for a person to transfer a property to an associated person in order to recognise the loss under the bright-line test without any real economic transaction occurring. 8.10 To prevent this, we suggest that a person should not be able to recognise a loss under the bright-line test arising from a transfer of property to an associated person. Y0 Y1 Mary acquires residential property for $500k Property goes down in value to $400k $500k $400k Mary wants to realise the loss in the property to reduce her tax liability on her other incomes but does not want to lose control over the property. To achieve this Mary transfers the property to her partner Ned for $400k. Example: Transfer to associated person 28 CHAPTER 9 Land-rich companies and trusts 9.1 The current land sale rules do not apply to the sale of shares in a land-rich company, 7 or to the change in terms of a land-rich trust 8 which effectively transfers the beneficial ownership of trust assets. 9.2 It is important that people cannot readily avoid the bright-line test through the use of trusts and companies. As a result, we think it is important to have a rule dealing with this issue. Two options for this are: • a comprehensive set of rules that set out when a sale of shares in a land-rich co mpany, or a change in the terms of a land-rich trust, should give rise to a taxable gain or loss; or • a specific anti-avoidance rule for land-rich companies and trusts. 9.3 The key trade-off between these two options is between accuracy and simplicity. 9.4 A comprehensive set of rules would potentially provide a robust regime covering all land-rich companies and trusts. This would ensure that the tax treatment for residential property is identical no matter what legal form the property is held in. However, such a set of rules would be complex and require detailed legislation. 9.5 A specific anti-avoidance rule would be simpler and avoid the associated risks of increased compliance costs. It would, however, be less robust. 9.6 On balance, we favour a specific anti-avoidance rule in relation to land-rich companies and trusts used to circumvent the bright-line test. At present it does not appear that there are large volumes of residential property being traded through sales of companies or amendments to the terms of trusts. As a result, we think that a comprehensive set of rules would create additional complexit y to target a relatively small problem. 9.7 If, over time, the use of land-rich companies and trusts that circumvent the bright-line test become more common this may need to be revisited. Design of anti-avoidance rules Companies 9.8 An anti-avoidance rule is suggested for the bright-line test that would deem a disposal of property held by a company to have occurred if there is a disposal of shares with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. 7 However, the sale of shares is taxable if acquired with the dominant purpose of resale. 8 “Change in terms” means any changes referred to in paragraph 9.10. 29 9.9 When this rule applies, the tax liability would be with the selling shareholder. Trusts 9.10 An anti-avoidance rule is suggested for the bright-line that would deem a disposal of property held by a trust to have occurred if any of the following is done with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test: • a change in the trustees of a trust; • a change in the beneficiaries of a trust; • a change in the identity of any person who is able to appoint the trustee or the beneficiaries of a trust; or • a change in the ownership of a corporate trustee. 9.11 When this rule applies, the income would arise either at the trust level (giving rise to liability to the trustee or settlor) or it could potentially be beneficiary income so that the relevant beneficiary would have a tax liability. Steve Co. owns residential property Tara Steve Sale of shares in Steve Co. Example: Land-rich company 1 May 2016: Steve sets up Steve Co. Steve owns all of the shares in Steve Co. 2 May 2016: Steve Co. purchases residential property. 1 July 2016: Steve sells shares in Steve Co. to Tara. If Steve had bought the property directly and sold it to Tara it would be subject to the bright-line test. The sale of shares has the effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test and as a result any gain from the share sale is taxable under the bright-line test. Steve Co. 30 APPENDIX Proposed wording for charging provision and main home exception New section CB 6A (Disposal within 2 years: residential land) CB 6A Disposal within 2 years: residential land An amount that a person derives from disposing of residential land is income of the person, if the person enters into an agreement for the disposal of the residential land within 2 years of— (a) the date on which the instrument to transfer the land to the person was registered; or (b) the date on which the person entered into the agreement for their acquisition of the land, if there is no date under paragraph (a). New section CB 6A (Main home exclusion for disposal within 2 years) CB 16A Main home exclusion for disposal within 2 years Section CB 6A does not apply to a person who disposes of residential land, if it has a dwelling on it that was the main home for— (a) the person; or (b) a beneficiary of a trust, and–– (i) the person is a trustee of the trust; and (ii) the settlor of the trust does not own a main home; and (iii) the settlor of the trust is not a beneficiary of another trust, the trustee of which owns the settlor’s main home.

DETAIL OF BRIGHT-LINE TEST 2 | Table of Contents 3 5 11 15 19 page page page page page 22 25 28 32 page page page page What is the bright-line test? Date of acquisition and disposal Definition of residential land Main home exception Inherited property Relationship property Deductibility Losses Land-rich companies and trusts 3 | What is the bright-line test? ​The bright-line test will require income tax to be paid on any gains from the sale of residential property that is bought and sold within 2 years. ​The goal of the bright-line is to supplement the “intention” test in the current land sale rules ​The intention test is difficult to enforce due to its subjectivity. The bright- line is intended to supplement the intention test with an unambiguous objective test. ​The objective nature of the test means the bright-line test will make a sale of residential property taxable in circumstances when the seller did not acquire the property with an intention of resale. However, this is unavoidable for the bright-line test to achieve its goal of being unambiguous and objective. ​In the design of the bright-line test we have aimed to use existing rules in tax law where possible. This helps provide certainty as it enables taxpayers to use existing interpretations and guidance when applying the rules. 4 | When does the bright-line test apply? Was there a disposal of land? Is the land residential? Was the property disposed within two years of acquisition? Not covered by bright-line test Was the property your “main home”? Is the amount you received greater than the cost of the property? Was the property received through an inheritance? Was the property transferred to you under a relationship property agreement? The amount is included in your income tax return as ordinary income taxed at marginal rates. Was the “original date of acquisition” within two years of you disposing of it? Was the disposal of land to an associated person? No loss allowed Loss is allowed but ring-fenced so it is only able to be used against gains from other land sales. Yes NoNoNoYes No NoNoNo No No YesYesYesYes Yes YesYes Date of acquisition and disposal 6 | Date of acquisition and disposal ​We think the date of acquisition should be the date of registration (RB) ​This provides a definite date recorded on Landonline that can be easily used by sellers, IR, and buyers (for withholding tax purposes) to know when the bright-line period starts. ​We think the date of disposal should be the date you enter into a contract to sell (CS)\* ​Using the registration date (RB) as the date of acquisition means that for consistency you would choose the date of registration (RS) as the date of disposal. ​However, we think this leaves open an opportunity for avoidance that is too great and so would prefer CS. ​There are 4 relevant dates ​Under the current land sale rules the acquisition date is the date that you enter into a sale and purchase agreement (CB). CB Contract to buy (sale and purchase agreement) RB Registration of title for purchase CS Contract to sell RS Registration of title for sale \*Where there is not a contract to sell (for example a gift) the date of disposal would be determined according to ordinary rules. 7 | Example scenario: deferring registration ​How to defer settlement ​1 May 2016: Alex acquires residential property (registration – RB) ​1 November 2016: Alex wants to sell the property to Bob. However, Alex does not want to be caught by the bright-line. ​To avoid the bright-line Alex enters into a deferred sale and purchase agreement with Bob. Under the agreement, registration of title is deferred until 2 May 2018. Alex agrees to rent the property to Bob until registration. CB Contract to buy (sale and purchase agreement) 1 May 2016 - RB Registration of title for purchase 1 November 2016 - CS Contract to sell 2 May 2018 - RS Registration of title for sale Property is rented 8 | Date of acquisition for subdivision 1 May 2016 Bill purchases residential land 1 May 2021 Bill subdivides the land into two sections and builds a house on the second section 1 May 2022 Bill sells the second section to Carl ​The date of acquisition for subdivided land by an owner is the original date of acquisition of the undivided land by the owner. ​In this situation, the sale of the second section by Bill is not subject to the bright-line test as it was disposed of more than 2 years after the original date of acquisition. 1 2 9 | Sales of the right to buy ​An additional rule is needed for sales of the right to buy (sales “off the plan”) ​This is where a person sells their interest in property prior to registration of the title. ​We want to capture these sales and so propose that the bright-line applies where there is: •A disposal of residential property where disposal (CS) occurs prior to registration of title (RB); and •The disposal was within 2 years of the seller entering into a sale and purchase agreement (CB). CB Contract to buy (sale and purchase agreement) RB Registration of title on purchase CS Contract to sell If <2 years then it is covered 10 | Transitional rules ​The bright-line will apply to sales of property bought from 1 October 2015 ​This could mean either property that a sale and purchase agreement has been entered into from 1 October (CB) or property that registration of title has been completed from 1 October (RB). ​We think the correct choice is property that a sale and purchase agreement (CB) is entered into from 1 October 2015 ​This ensures the bright-line does not apply to existing transactions retrospectively. 2 June 2015 - CB Contract to buy (sale and purchase agreement) 1 November 2015 - RB Registration of title for purchase CS Contract to sell RS Registration of title for sale ​This sale not subject to bright-line as sale and purchase agreement entered into before 1 October 2015 Definition of residential land 12 | Definition of residential land ​The bright-line test will only apply to residential land ​This is because residential land has been identified as an area where there is particular difficulty in enforcing the land sale rules due to the high churn of such property and high volume of transactions. ​This does raise boundary issues particularly for mixed-use land and bare land. ​The goal of the definition of residential property is to adequately draw this boundary and ensure that commercial property is not inadvertently caught. ​Why not use zoning rules/survey plans for definition of residential land? The initial thinking on the definition of residential land was to refer to what land is zoned for, to determine whether it is residential. However, we no longer consider this option is feasible. Councils are given wide discretion as to the form and content of their district plans. There is no uniformity across the district plans and therefore nothing concrete to plug into for the definition of residential land. For example, if we said that the definition of residential land is land zoned as residential it would not work when a council decides to call its residential area a “living area” or when a council decides to have commercial areas in which residential houses are also allowed. Using survey plans for the definition of residential land is also problematic. Developers are not required to state the purpose of development in the plan and sales can occur before a developer has made a survey plan or has title. 13 | Proposal – definition of residential land ​“Land for which there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it” ​This requirement is intended to capture sales “off the plan” where the land is bare but proposed to be developed into residential premises. ​“An arrangement means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding...” (Income Tax Act 2007) ​Business premises: •Land that is the premises of a business ​Farmland: •The area and nature of the land disposed of mean that it is then capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business ​Residential land is: •Land that has a dwelling on it; or •Land for which there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it; •But does not include land that is used predominantly as business premises or as farmland ​This captures all land with a house on it but then carves out those used mainly for business purposes. 14 | Example scenarios ​Development ​Andrew buys an empty plot of land. He plans to develop the plot by subdividing it into 4 lots and building houses on each of the lots. ​Andrew sells lot 1 off the plan to Bob. One month later, Bob sells lot 1 to Cara. ​Lot 1 would be residential land and Bob would be subject to the bright-line as there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it. ​Lifestyle block ​Lifestyle block with house and small area of farmland. Land is used for farming purposes. ​The farming exclusion will not apply as the land is not capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming business. It is a hobby farm rather than a genuine farming business. ​If the area of farmland was larger and capable of being used as an economic unit for farming purposes then it would likely be covered by the farming exclusion. Lot 1 Main home exception 16 | Current rules Main home exception The bright-line is not intended to apply to the sale of a person’s main home. Excluding a person’s main home is consistent with the current land sale rules, which generally exclude the sale of a person’s principal residence. Defining main home The main home exception should be tightly defined. Where a property is used mainly for investment purposes or where a person has multiple homes the main home exception should not apply (or should not apply more than once). Proposal We propose the main home exception applies where: a)the land has a dwelling on it; and b)the dwelling is occupied mainly as residence by the owner; and c)the dwelling is the main home of the owner. 17 | Detail of main home exception ​Mainly as a residence ​The main home exception will only apply where the dwelling is occupied mainly as a residence by the owner. This requirement is the key test for the residential exclusion within the current land sale rules and is intended to ensure that properties used mainly for investment or other purposes are not covered by the exception. ​It is intended that this test is determined based on what a person’s actual use of the property is, rather than what they intended the property to be used for when they bought it. ​Main home ​A person should only be able to use the main home exception for one property at a time. To ensure this, we propose for the exception to apply a property needs to be the “main home” of the owner as well as be used “mainly as a residence” by the owner. ​ Where a person has several residences their “main home” is determined according to which property a person has the greatest connection with. The factors that determine these connections would include: •The time the person occupies the dwelling •Where their immediate family (if any) live •Where their social ties are strongest •The person’s use of the dwelling •The person’s employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located •Whether the person’s personal property is in the dwelling ​Trusts ​If the property is owned by a trust, then we propose that the main home exception apply where the dwelling is occupied mainly as a residence by a beneficiary of the trust and is the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. ​If the settlor of the trust has a main home that is not owned by the trust, then we propose the main home exception cannot apply to any property owned by the trust. This is to ensure the main home exception cannot be used multiple times through placing property in a trust. 18 | Example scenarios ​Multiple homes ​Bob has two homes. ​His first home is a small apartment in Christchurch which Bob lives in 5 days a week due to him working in Christchurch. ​His second home is in Wellington where his family lives. Bob lives in his Wellington home during weekends. ​The Wellington home is Bob’s main home as it is the place he has the greatest connection with. ​Rental apartment ​Carolyn owns a three story house. ​Carolyn resides on the first floor of the house and rents out the other two floors. ​This house would not be covered by the main home exception as the house is not used mainly as a residence – its main purpose is instead as a rental property. ​Student flat ​Dave has two properties, a family home which he lives in, and a student flat which his son lives in while studying. ​Dave puts the student flat into a trust and makes his son a discretionary beneficiary of the trust. ​The trust cannot use the main home exception because a settlor of the trust (Dave) has another main home. Inherited property 20 | Inherited property ​Design of inheritance exception ​There are 4 relevant transfers of property following a death: a)Transfer of property from deceased to administrator b)Sale of property by administrator or transfer of property from administrator to beneficiary c) Sale of property by beneficiary d) Any subsequent sales ​We propose that the first 3 transfers are all excluded from the bright-line. The mechanism for doing so would be: •Transfers under a) and b) are deemed to have been made at cost •Sales under b) or c) are exempted from the bright-line However, a beneficiary may be taxable under the current land sale rules on any subsequent disposal of the property. ​The bright-line will not cover disposals of inherited property ​This is because a person cannot be expected to have acquired the property with any intention of resale when there is an inheritance Excluded Not excluded 21 | Example scenario 1 May 2016 Mrs Higgins acquires residential rental property ($500k) 1 May 2017 Property transferred to administrator at cost ($500k) 1 June 2017 Property transferred to Henry, son of Mrs Higgins, at cost ($500k) 1 July 2017 Henry sells property to Peter for $600k 1 July 2018 Peter sells property to Paul for $800k Transferred for $500k (no gain) $500k $100k gain exempted from bright-line $200k gain is subject to the bright-line Transferred for $500k (no gain) $500k $500k $600k $800k bright-line starts 1 May 2017 Mrs Higgins dies Relationship property 23 | Relationship property ​Why should the exception be narrower? •In most cases property subject to the bright-line would have acquired during the relationship. This means we can presume that the two parties had a joint intention in acquiring the property. •Unlike inheritance, the parties have scope to negotiate the transfer of the property. ​We think that the exception should be the same as the rollover relief available under the current land sale rules The current rollover relief deems relationship property to have been transferred at cost. The recipient is then deemed to have acquired the property at the time the transferor originally acquired it. This means the transfer of property under a relationship property agreement does not trigger the bright-line. However, the bright-line will be triggered if the recipient sells the property within 2 years of the original date of acquisition. ​The bright-line will also not apply to transfers under a relationship property agreement ​However, we think that this exception should be narrower than the exception for inheritance. 24 | Example scenario 1 May 2016 Andrew acquires an investment property for $500k Andrew also holds cash of $500k and Bert has no assets 1 May 2017 As part of a relationship property agreement the investment property is transferred to Bert 1 February 2018 Bert sells investment property for $700k Transferred for $500k (no gain) Sale is subject to bright-line as acquisition and disposal made within 2 years $ $ ​In this situation the sale of property by Bert is subject to the bright-line. This is because the date of acquisition by Bert is 1 May 2016 and the date of disposal is 1 February 2018. ​If the sale by Bert was on 2 May 2018 or later it would not be subject to the bright-line. Bright-line starts Acquisition date is still 1 May 2016 as it is rolled-over Deductions 26 | Deductions and sales ​Capital costs – always deductible under bright-line •Cost of property •Expenditure related to acquisition (legal fees, surveyors, valuers) •Incidental costs of subsequent disposal •Capital improvements – new roof etc. These will always be deductible under the bright-line as part of the cost of the property. They will be deductible in the income year the person disposes of the property. ​Holding costs – sometimes deductible under bright-line •Interest •Insurance •Rates •Repairs and maintenance ​The holding costs will be deductible if they meet the standard deductibility rules ie, the costs are deductible to the extent they have a nexus with income and are not private in nature (or otherwise subject to a general limitation). ​Holding costs are generally deductible in the income year incurred. ​The current land sale rules already provide a framework for deductibility 27 | Example scenarios ​Rental property ​May 2016: Carla buys rental property for $500k ​May 2016-31 March 2017: Carla pays interest of $30k and rates of $5k ​July 2016: Carla gets a new roof put on the building at a cost of$80k ​April 2 2017: Carla sells the property for $800k ​Deductions in 2016-17 year = $35k (interest and rates) ​Deductions in 2017-18 year = $580k (Cost base of property = house and roof) ​Income in 2017-18 year = $800k ​Beach house ​May 2016: Denise buys beach house for $500k solely for private use ​May 2016-31 March 2017: Denise pays interest of $30k and rates of $5k ​July 2016: Denise gets a new roof put on the building at a cost of$80k ​April 2 2017: Denise sells the beach house for $800k ​Deductions in 2016-17 year = $0 – Interest and rates denied by the private limitation ​Deductions in 2017-18 year = $580k (Cost base of property = house and roof) ​Income in 2017-18 year = $800k $ Cost of house $500k New roof = $80k Interest = $30k Rates = $5k Rent Cost of house $500k New roof = $80k Interest = $30k Rates = $5k Losses 29 | Losses ​Prima facie fully allowing losses is the correct outcome: •It creates symmetry between gains and losses •This symmetry means we avoid economic distortions ​However allowing unrestrained losses for the bright-line test creates risks: •It creates an incentive for taxpayers with unrealised losses to accelerate sales to fall within the two year bright-line period and an incentive for taxpayers with unrealised gains to defer the sale of property till after two years. •This raises revenue risks as taxpayers are given the opportunity to maximise claimable losses and minimise taxable gains. This is especially the case as a taxpayer who falls within the bright-line is able to deduct expenses they would not otherwise have been able to. ​The current land sale rules allow losses from disposals of land to be offset against any other taxable income the seller has. 30 | Ring-fencing losses ​Ring-fencing reduces the revenue risks as: •Taxpayers have less incentive to accelerate sales unless they have other offsetable gains •Taxpayers have less incentive to defer profit-making sales where they have ring-fenced losses Ring-fencing does create a risk of new distortions ​This is because gains and losses are not symmetrical. A person who does not have any offsetable gains will be discouraged from undertaking an investment in residential property . ​However, we think this risk is minor: •Ring-fencing will not affect dealers who buy and sell on a frequent basis. •For those who are not selling on a frequent basis, denying losses is unlikely to impose a large cost as they perform a relatively small economic function in the housing market. ​To minimise the risks we propose ring-fencing losses claimable under the bright- line so that they are only able to be offset against taxable gains on other land sales. 31 | Losses from transfers to associated persons ​Mary wants to realise the loss in the property but does not want to lose control over it. ​To achieve this Mary transfers the property to her partner Ned for $400k. ​Mary has been able to realise the loss without any real economic transaction occurring. ​To prevent this, we propose that a person is not be able to recognise a loss under the bright-line for a transfer of property to an associated person. Y0 Y1 Mary acquires residential property for $500k Property goes down in value to $400k $500k $400k Land-rich companies and trusts 33 | Land-rich companies and trusts ​Should there be a rule for land-rich companies? ​The key trade-off for a “land-rich company and trust” rule is between simplicity and accuracy. ​There are two options: a)Comprehensive land-rich company and trust rules; or b)A specific anti-avoidance rule ​Comprehensive rules would be more robust and certain, but would be complex. ​A specific anti-avoidance rule would be simpler, but would be less robust and be uncertain. ​Specific anti-avoidance rule ​Comprehensive land-rich company and trust rules would be complex and has a risk of increasing compliance costs. ​At present it does not appear that there are large volumes of residential property being traded through sales of companies or amendments to the terms of trusts. ​As a result, we do not think comprehensive land-rich company and trust rules are needed and instead a specific anti-avoidance rule would be better. A specific anti- avoidance rule would aim to deter people from avoiding the land sale rules while not being particularly complex. ​The current land sale rules do not apply to the sale of shares in land-rich companies or the change in terms of a trust ​(However, the sale of shares is taxable if acquired with the dominant purpose of resale) 34 | Specific anti- avoidance rule ​Anti-avoidance rule in section YC 9(2) ​Section YC 9(2) of the ITA contains a specific anti- avoidance rule to prevent trusts being used to disguise changes in the ownership of companies. It states that: ​Subsection (1) does not apply if any of the following has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of a continuity provision: a)the establishment of the trust: b)the termination of the trust: c)a change in the trustees of the trust ​We think an anti-avoidance rule could be based on this ​The rule could deem a disposal to have occurred if any of the following are done with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and purpose of bright-line: a)The disposal of shares b)A change in trustees of a trust c)A change in beneficiaries of a trust d)A change in the identity of any person who is able to appoint the trustee or the beneficiaries of a trust e)A change in ownership of shares in a corporate trustee

An officials’ issues paper on the bright-line test was released in June 2015 for consultation. Draft legislation for the bright-line test was introduced in August and is expected to apply from 1 October 2015 to the sale of certain property acquired after that date. 1.2 The bright-line test will require income tax to be paid on any gains from the sale of most residential property that is bought and sold within two years, with the exception of the main family home. The purpose of the bright-line test is to supplement the “intention test” in the current land sale rules. The intention test taxes gains from the sale of real property purchased with an intention of disposal. 1.3 For the bright-line test to be effective, the Government needs to have an appropriate administrative mechanism for collecting the tax – particularly when the vendor of the property is not in New Zealand. 1.4 New Zealand imposes withholding taxes on certain types of New Zealand- sourced income earned by foreign investors – we impose withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties (known as non-resident passive income). 1.5 This issues paper suggests that a withholding tax be introduced on sales of residential property from 1 July 2016 where the vendor is a foreign investor (defined as an “offshore person” as in the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill) who has owned the property for less than two years prior to the sale. This issues paper discusses the design of a withholding tax that would be consistent with the proposed bright-line test. 1.6 Officials are interested in feedback on the suggestions outlined in this paper, particularly in relation to who should be required to undertake the withholding and how the process may work in practice. How to make a submission 1.7 Officials invite submissions on the suggested changes and points raised in this issues paper. Submissions should be addressed to: Residential land withholding tax C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1 1.8 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Residential land wit hho lding tax” in the subject line. Electronic submissions are encouraged. The closing date for submissions is 2 October 2015. 1.9 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.10 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 2 Summary of proposal The proposal in this issues paper is to introduce a requirement for an amount to be withheld on the sale of residential land in New Zealand by a conveyancer or solicitor to the property transaction and paid to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”). The amount to be withheld would be the lower of: • 33% of the vendor’s gain on that property (i.e. 33% x (agreed total sales price - vendor’s acquisition price)); and • 10% of the total purchase price of that property. This proposed “residential land withholding tax” or “RLWT” would come into effect from 1 July 2016. That is, conveyancers and solicitors would be required to act as withholding agents and withhold RLWT on affected transactions where settlement occurs on or after 1 July 2016. As the proposed RLWT is intended to be a mechanism for supporting the collection of tax imposed under the bright-line test, we suggest that the withholding tax apply where the vendor of the residential property is both an “offshore person” and taxable under the bright-line test, because they have held the property for less than two years prior to the sale. Note that while the proposed bright-line test would apply to residential land regardless of the geographic location, we suggest that the RLWT be restricted to residential land in New Zealand. Under the proposed RLWT, a conveyancer or solicitor involved in the transaction would be required to withhold and pay the required amount to the Commissioner, unless one of the following circumstances applies: 1. The vendor is not an offshore person. 2. The sale of the property would not be taxable for the vendor under the proposed bright-line test because: a. the vendor acquired the property being sold before 1 October 2015; or b. the vendor acquired the property being sold after 1 October 2015, but the vendor has owned the property for two or more years. The withholding agent should be entitled to rely on the statement provided by the vendor, unless they know it to be false. In such a case, the withholding agent would be required to withhold and pay RLWT to the Commissioner. A useful precedent for this approach is in section 78F of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which permits a supplier to rely on a statement made by the purchaser that the conditions for zero rating the supply have been met. The RLWT should be withheld before any other amounts are disbursed in relation to the sale of the property. 3 The proposed RLWT is not a final withholding tax. We propose that the vendor should be able to claim a tax credit for the amount of RLWT withheld and paid to the Commissioner against their final income tax liability in relation to the sale of the residential property. In some cases this may result in a tax refund. Summary of different parties’ obligations Vendor • Provide certified evidence showing whether they are or are not an offshore person (e.g. in the case of individuals, a copy of their passport, residence class visa and a statement that they have been physically present in New Zealand for the requisite period). • Provide a certified copy of the vendor’s sale and purchase agreement from the time of acquisition, if the vendor’s title to the property being sold was registered on or after 1 October 2015, but the agreement for sale and purchase was entered into before 1 October 2015. Withholding agent (either the purchaser’s or vendor’s conveyancing agent) • Register as an RLWT withholding agent with the Commissioner. • Confirm whether the vendor is eligible for an exception from withholding (i.e. not an offshore person or the residential property falls out of scope of the two- year bright-line test). • Obtain the vendor’s acquisition price to calculate whether the standard withholding rate or default withholding rate applies. • Withhold the correct amount of RLWT at the time of settlement. • Pay the withheld amount of RLWT to the Commissioner. • Provide the required information in a form approved by the Commissioner at the time of payment to the Commissioner. Purchaser (where there is no conveyancing agent) • Verify whether the vendor is eligible for an exception from withholding (i.e. not an offshore person or the residential property falls out of scope of the two-year bright-line test). • Verify the vendor’s acquisition price to calculate whether the standard withholding rate or default withholding rate applies. • Withhold the correct amount of RLWT at the time of settlement. • Pay the withheld amount of RLWT to the Commissioner. • Provide the required information in a form approved by the Commissioner at the time of payment to the Commissioner 4 CHAPTER 2 Background Proposed bright-line test 2.1 As part of Budget 2015, the Government announced that it would introduce a “bright-line” test on the sale of residential property. The test will require income tax to be paid on any gains from the sale of residential property that is bought and sold within two years, with some exceptions. The new rule will apply to property acquired under an agreement for sale and purchase entered into on or after 1 October 2015. 2.2 The purpose of the bright-line test is to supplement the “intention test” in the current land sale rules. The intention test makes gains from the sale of real property purchased with an intention of disposal taxable. The intention test can be difficult to enforce due to its subjectivity. The bright-line test is intended to deal with the problem by supplementing the intention test with an objective test. 2.3 An issues paper on the design of the bright-line test was released in June 2015 and draft legislation was introduced on 24 August 2015 in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill, following consultation on the issues paper. 2.4 The draft legislation proposes that: • The bright-line test would apply to residential land for which an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into from 1 October 2015, and which is subsequently disposed of within two years. When the property was acquired other than by way of sale, the suggested bright- line test would apply to properties for which registration of title occurs after 1 October 2015. • Residential land would be defined as: - land that has a dwelling on it; - land on which the seller is party to an arrangement to erect a dwelling; or - bare land that because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling erected on it; but - does not include land that is used predominantly as business premises or as farmland. • An exception should apply if the property is the owner’s main home. • An exception should apply for relationship property and inherited property. • Deductions should be allowed pursuant to ordinary tax rules. 5 • Losses should only be able to be offset against other land-sale gains (“ring-fencing”). • A specific anti-avoidance rule should be introduced in relation to the use of land-rich companies and trusts to circumvent the bright-line test. Compliance and collection of taxes 2.5 New Zealand taxes its tax residents on their worldwide income. New Zealand taxes foreign investors on income that is sourced in New Zealand. When a foreign investor has a branch or controls a subsidiary in New Zealand, tax can be imposed on the income of that branch or subsidiary in the same way as it would be on New Zealanders. However, when the foreign investor does not have a New Zealand presence, it is more difficult for New Zealand to collect tax from that person. 2.6 The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) has a number of powers to enforce the tax obligations of taxpayers to assist in the collection of taxes. 1 However, these are not always administratively practical or effective, particularly when the taxpayer has no presence in New Zealand. 2.7 New Zealand can request help to collect tax from foreign investors from overseas revenue authorities under its various international agreements, including the OECD Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, double tax agreements and tax information exchange agreements. These agreements allow for the exchange of tax- related information and assistance in the collection of taxes. While these are useful tools in enabling the Government to collect tax, they are a backstop and should not be the primary tool. As a practical matter, the most common and effective way to collect tax from foreign investors is a withholding tax. Withholding taxes generally 2.8 Usually taxpayers file an income tax return which states the amount of their tax liability. The taxpayer pays their income tax once they have filed their tax return. However, in many situations that return–filing approach is supplemented, or is replaced by, a withholding tax. 2.9 Generally a withholding tax is an amount of tax that a person withholds when they make a payment to another person. The amount withheld is paid to the Commissioner and is the recipient’s (i.e. the payee’s) tax on the income fro m the payer. Withholding taxes are considered an important part of most tax administration systems because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out of the amount due to the payee before the payee gets control of the funds. This makes it easier for the Commissioner to collect tax from taxpayers. 1 The Commissioner may impose a number of monetary penalties, including, for example, late filing, shortfall, and late payment penalties. The Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out when and at what rates such penalties may be charged. This ensures that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently, at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. In addition, the Commissioner has powers available to recover amounts of unpaid tax. These powers include requiring deductions from payments made to the defaulter by any other person, and court action. 6 2.10 Withholding taxes are used to collect the tax liabilities of residents and non- residents alike, and can be non-final or final. 2.11 A non-final withholding tax is an estimate of the recipient’s final income tax liability and the recipient may be required to file an income tax return. The recipient is able to claim a credit for the tax that has been withheld. One example of a non-final withholding tax is pay as you earn (PAYE), whereby an amount is withheld from a person’s salary or wages on account of that person’s income tax liability. 2 2.12 A final withholding tax represents the final tax liability for the person fro m whom the tax has been withheld. An example of a final withholding tax is New Zealand’s non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) regime in relation to certain types of passive income, such as dividends. The obligation to withhold NRWT is imposed on the payer, who is usually resident in New Zealand – which makes enforcement and collection easier. 2.13 The Commissioner has the ability to impose penalties on taxpayers who knowingly fail to deduct withholding tax from a payment they have made and on those who have withheld tax for any purpose other than for payment to the Commissioner. 2.14 While New Zealand does not currently have a withholding tax on property- related transactions involving non-residents, many other jurisdictions do – for example, Canada, Japan, and the United States. In addition, Australia has recently announced that it is introducing a withholding tax on sales of certain interests in land by foreign investors to support its capital gains tax. 2.15 In light of the proposed introduction of the bright-line test, we have considered whether the Commissioner’s current tools for collection are appropriate and adequate. Given the general difficulty faced in collecting tax from foreign investors with no physical presence in New Zealand, we suggest the introduction of a non-final withholding tax on certain property- related transactions is needed to improve the collection of revenue. 2 In many cases, where a person earns only salary or wage income and PAYE has been withheld at the correct rate, the person is not required to file an income tax return. In such a case, PAYE is considered to be final. 7 8 CHAPTER 3 The withholding agent 3.1 In this chapter we discuss who should be responsible for withholding RLWT. 3.2 As noted in the previous chapter, we suggest that withholding obligations under the RLWT should be effective from 1 July 2016. 3.3 In this and subsequent chapters, we use the term “conveyancing agent” to refer to conveyancers and solicitors involved in the property transaction (particularly in relation to the settlement and title transfer processes). Who should have the withholding obligation? 3.4 The tax system aims to minimise the compliance burden it places on taxpayers. Therefore, as a starting point we propose that the withholding obligation fall on the conveyancing agent involved in the property transaction – rather than the vendor or purchaser themselves. That is, the conveyancing agent involved in the property transaction should be the RLWT withholding agent. This is because they already have professional obligations to discharge in relation to the conveyance of property and this would more naturally form part of those other obligations. They also have the systems and trust accounts needed to manage the funds involved in the settlement of property which is important in terms of ensuring the integrity of the withholding process. Officials appreciate that requiring conveyancing agents to withhold RLWT would impose compliance costs and require changes to systems and processes. We are interested in receiving feedback on the compliance-cost aspect of the RLWT proposed in this issues paper. 3.5 Placing the obligation on the purchaser would be very difficult both in terms of compliance and administration. Placing the obligation on the vendor does not make sense because it would defeat the purpose of ensuring the RLWT is paid as part of the settlement process. Moreover, the vendor is already liable for income tax on the sale of the property – regardless of whether or not RLWT is wit hheld. 3 3.6 The next question is which conveyancing agent should have the primary responsibility to withhold the tax – the vendor’s or the purchaser’s? There are advantages and disadvantages to either approach, which we have outlined below. 3 There is no “double taxation” because RLWT may be claimed as a credit by the vendor when the vendor files an income tax return. 9 We would like submitters to consider whether the primary obligation to withhold RLWT should lie with the purchaser’s conveyancing agent, or the vendor’s conveyancing agent. Primary obligation on the purchaser’s conveyancing agent 3.7 There are some advantages in requiring the purchaser’s conveyancing agent to be the withholding agent. 3.8 In general, withholding taxes are used to ensure that the relevant tax is paid out of an amount due to a person before the recipient gets control of the funds. The recipient may have an incentive to spend the funds before tax has been paid, which is generally why tax administrations “clip the ticket” before the money reaches the recipient. In finding an appropriate party to clip the ticket, we consider it should be the person with the least to gain from failing to comply with the rules - this is normally the payer of the amount. This is particularly relevant to the problem here, as this withholding tax is aimed at enforcing the vendor’s tax liability under the bright-line test. 3.9 New Zealand’s withholding tax regimes commonly require the payer of an amount to withhold a portion from that payment and pay it to the Commissioner. Generally, the amounts of tax withheld are on account of the recipient of the payment. For example, when an employer withholds PAYE from an employee’s salary or wages, it is on account of the employee. Wit h interest payments, the payer (e.g. a bank) is required to withhold NRWT and RWT from a payment of interest, but the NRWT and RWT relate to the payee’s tax liability. 3.10 This “payer as withholding agent” approach is the international norm for withholding taxes more generally, as well as for withholding taxes on sales of residential property. Under the withholding regime in relation to sales of real property in Canada, Japan and the United States, the primary liability to withhold is imposed on the purchaser (normally via their solicitor). In addition, Australia has recently proposed to introduce a withholding tax on sales of residential property to supplement its capital gains tax, where the primary liability to withhold would also be on the purchaser. 3.11 While the aforementioned countries place the legal obligation on the purchaser, it is expected that the purchaser will use an agent (a solicitor or conveyancer, for example) to handle their affairs. 3.12 Note that in the case of Canada, while the primary withholding obligation is on the purchaser, the obligation only arises if the seller cannot provide the purchaser with a “certificate of compliance”. We understand that the seller is generally required to notify the Canadian Revenue Authority in advance o f the property sale and square up their tax liability in relation to the property sale before a certificate of compliance is issued. Effectively, this means that withholding is only required in Canada if a non-resident has not fulfilled their tax obligations in relation to the property sale. 10 3.13 Another advantage of placing the primary obligation to withhold on the purchaser’s conveyancing agent is that the funds are likely to flow through a New Zealand solicitor’s trust account and so there would be funds in New Zealand from which RLWT can be withheld. 3.14 As a back-up, this approach allows a secondary obligation to withhold to be imposed on the vendor’s conveyancing agent. Having a “back stop” would be useful in the case of any misunderstanding between the two parties or if either the vendor or their conveyancing agent knows or discovers that the purchaser’s conveyancing agent failed to withhold or has withheld the incorrect amount. That is, the vendor’s conveyancing agent would be obliged to withhold RLWT and pay it to the Commissioner, if they know from the settlement statement and from the amount received on settlement that the purchaser’s conveyancing agent did not withho ld RLWT or withheld insufficient RLWT. In the latter case, the vendor’s conveyancing agent would be obliged to withhold the difference. This could be streamlined by including an “RLWT calculation worksheet” in the conveyancing process and settlement statement. 3.15 There are also disadvantages in placing the primary obligation on the purchaser’s conveyancer. 3.16 The ultimate tax liability arising under the bright-line test belongs to the seller, not the buyer. Accordingly, it may be perceived as unfair to impose the compliance burden of the withholding on the purchaser and their agent. We note the compliance costs may or may not be economically borne by the buyer, depending on the price that buyers are willing to pay for a property. 3.17 A further difficulty with placing the primary obligation for withholding on the purchaser’s conveyancing agent would be that that conveyancing agent would need to decide whether or not withholding is required on any given transaction. 3.18 In order to address that difficulty, RLWT could apply unless one of two exceptions is available. In determining whether one of the exceptions is available it is proposed that the purchaser’s conveyancing agent would be able to rely on: • information supplied by the conveyancer for the vendor; and • information contained in the databases established by Quotable Value or Landonline. 3.19 In summary, these are the main advantages and disadvantages we have identified in placing the primary obligation on the purchaser’s conveyancing agent: 11 Primary obligation to withhold RLWT on the purchaser’s conveyancing agent Advantages Disadvantages • International norm e.g. US, Canada, Japan (and soon Australia). • Follows other New Zealand withholding taxes which place withholding liability on the payer (e.g. employers with PAYE, banks with RWT and NRWT). • More likely for funds to flow through a New Zealand solicitor’s trust account – therefore there are funds in New Zealand from which tax can be withheld. • There is a “back stop”: if the buyer’s conveyancing agent fails to withhold correctly, a secondary liability can be placed on the seller’s conveyancing agent. • Could be seen as unfair as the ultimate tax liability belongs to the seller. • Requires the buyer’s conveyancing agent to obtain information about the seller from the seller’s agent. This may be seen as increasing the compliance burden on the buyer’s agent and adding an additional cost to New Zealand buyers. Obligation on the vendor’s conveyancing agent 3.20 The other option is to place the obligation to withhold on the vendor’s conveyancing agent. 3.21 Under this approach, the compliance burden and costs would be legally borne by the vendor. This could be seen as being fairer because the vendor is the person with the ultimate tax liability. 3.22 In addition, the vendor’s conveyancing agent is likely to be familiar wit h their client’s personal situation. This means the conveyancing agent will be in a position where they have more immediate access to information about the vendor’s offshore status. In terms o f the info rmat ion that a withho lding agent would need to collect in order to determine whether RLWT should be withheld (and at what rate), we think that determining whether the vendor is an offshore person would be the most resource intensive part of the process. 3.23 Another advantage is that the vendor’s solicitor is generally responsible for paying the vendor’s other expenses relating to the property sale out of the funds received upon settlement, before releasing the net amount to the vendor. This includes the payment of the seller’s mortgage on the property and costs apportioned between the purchaser and vendor (e.g. rates and other levies relating to the property). As the vendor’s solicitor already deals with these other expenses, it may be straightforward for them to also withhold and pay the RLWT to the Commissioner. 3.24 In contrast to placing the primary obligation on the purchaser’s conveyancing agent, one disadvantage of this approach is that it is contrary to international norms and is contrary to New Zealand’s current withholding tax regimes, where the withholding liabilities are imposed on the payer. The liability to withhold is generally placed on the payer because they are seen as the party to the transaction with the least incentive to not comply with the rules. 12 3.25 We understand that while a New Zealand conveyancing agent is required to undertake the title transfer process in Landonline, they may not be involved in the funds transfer process. As the vendor is an offshore person, there is the possibility that their solicitor is not based in New Zealand. If the New Zealand conveyancer is not involved in the funds transfer process, there are no funds from which the New Zealand conveyancer can withhold the required amount of RLWT. If the vendor uses a foreign solicitor, it may be more difficult to impose and enforce withholding obligations on that foreign solicitor. In addition, the funds may not go through a bank account controlled by a New Zealand conveyancing agent. If this is the case, a solution to this problem would need to be found. 3.26 Another disadvantage in placing the liability on the vendor’s conveyancing agent is that it would effectively place the sole responsibility for withholding on the vendor’s conveyancing agent. This is because the vendor’s conveyancing agent is the final “link in the chain” before the funds reach the vendor’s hands and so there would be no further opportunity to impose a secondary withholding liability if the vendor’s conveyancing agent fails to withho ld RLWT. 3.27 In summary, these are the main advantages and disadvantages we have identified in placing the primary obligation on the vendor’s conveyancing agent: Obligation to withhold RLWT on the vendor’s conveyancing agent Advantages Disadvantages • Could be seen as being fairer for buyers – the compliance burden and cost are legally borne by the seller (i.e. by the person with the ultimate tax liability). • The seller’s conveyancing agent may have more immediate access to information about the seller’s offshore status. • The seller’s conveyancing agent deals with other expenses at the time of settlement (e.g. mortgage and rates). • Contrary to international norms. • Contrary to New Zealand’s current withholding taxes where the withholding liability is on the payer. • The New Zealand conveyancing agent undertaking the final title transfer may not be involved in the funds transfer and so may not have access to the funds from which tax is to be withheld. • There is no “back stop”. 13 Compliance burden 3.28 In terms of the compliance burden, we do not consider there to be a significant difference between placing the obligation to withhold RLWT on the purchaser’s or the vendor’s conveyancing agent. One point to note is that the compliance burden is not necessarily borne by the party who is legally required to undertake the withholding. For example, where the withholding obligation is on the vendor’s conveyancing agent, the vendor could pass the compliance cost onto the purchaser by requiring a higher sales price. No conveyancing agent 3.29 There may be situations where a sale of residential land does not involve a conveyancing agent. 3.30 Where there is no conveyancing agent involved in the transaction, we propose that the primary withholding obligation falls on the purchaser. A secondary obligation could also be imposed on any agent or other person in New Zealand who receives payment on behalf of the vendor, similar to the obligation in section RF 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 in relation to non- resident passive income. 14 CHAPTER 4 The rate of RLWT 4.1 We propose that the rate of RLWT to be withheld would be the lower of: • 33% of the vendor’s gain (the “standard RLWT rate”); and • 10% of the purchase price of the property (the “default RLWT rate”). 4.2 The “lower of” approach suggested in this chapter allows the withholding agent to undertake a simple calculation based on publicly-available information and other information available to both parties, while also minimising the level of necessary contact between the solicitors or conveyancers for the purchaser and vendor. 4.3 We suggest that this “lower of” approach strikes a balance between creating a collection mechanism that approximates the amount of tax payable under the bright-line test and making the process straightforward for the withholding agent. The standard RLWT rate 4.4 We consider that the standard RLWT rate should generally apply to calculate the RLWT obligation – except in rare cases where it is not possible to apply or it results in more RLWT being withheld than the default rate (see below). The standard RLWT rate would be calculated as: RLWT = 33% x (total purchase price - vendor’s acquisit io n price) 4.5 In other words, the standard RLWT rate calculates the vendor’s gain based on the total purchase price agreed between the purchaser and the vendor less the cost at which the vendor acquired the property. The top marginal tax rate of 33% is then applied to the gain. 4 The resulting amount is the RLWT that should be withheld. 4.6 Where the vendor’s acquisition price is equal to or exceeds the total purchase price, no RLWT is required to be withheld. Officials consider this to be an appropriate outcome where the vendor makes a loss on the sale of the property. No other deductions allowed for determining standard RLWT rate 4.7 It is not proposed to allow any deductions other than the vendor’s acquisition price in calculating the gain for the purposes of determining the amount of RLWT to be withheld. 4 This 33% rate is consistent with the resident withholding tax rate on dividends. 15 4.8 The bright-line test allows certain deductions against the purchase price in determining the amount of the tax liability. More specifically, deductions are allowed under ordinary rules. Losses from other land sales may be offset against a gain. 4.9 The problem wit h allowing these deductions in calculating RLWT is that it would fall to the conveyancers to determine the amount and deductibility of expenditure. Often complex and technical tax issues can arise in determining whether a deduction is allowed. This would impose considerable compliance costs on withholding agents who are not in a position to determine these matters without seeking advice from tax advisors or Inland Revenue. There would also be compliance costs for withholding agents in verifying that the deductions claimed are real and genuine. 4.10 Accordingly, a taxpayer who wishes to claim other deductions against the taxable gain (including perhaps losses on transactions arising after the sale of a residential property) will need to file an income tax return. The process for this is outlined in chapter 7. At-cost disposals 4.11 In some situations, a person may be deemed to have acquired residential land from another person “at cost”. This could occur, for example, under a relationship property agreement where the transferee takes on the transferor’s cost base. 4.12 Officials do not consider that an exception from RLWT is necessary for these sorts of disposals, because the “lower of” approach would result in no funds being withheld under RLWT due to the use of the standard RLWT rate. The default RLWT rate: 10% of the purchase price 4.13 As the objective of the RLWT is to approximate the vendor’s final tax liability arising under the bright-line test, officials consider that a default 10% rate would strike a fair balance between maintaining simplicity, minimising compliance costs and not overestimating the vendor’s expected final tax liability. 4.14 Accordingly, we suggest that RLWT applies at a default rate of 10% of the total purchase price of the residential land. In general, the default rate would apply in situations where the conveyancing agent cannot calculate the standard rate because there is insufficient information regarding the acquisition price or there is no acquisition price. In rare cases, it may be that the amount that should be withheld under default rate is lower than under the standard rate. 4.15 A 10% rate is used in a number of jurisdictions including Japan and the United States. However, some countries have much higher rates – for example, the withholding rate in Canada is 25% of the purchase price (and in certain cases, 50%). Australia recently announced a 10% withholding tax 16 rate on sales of land and certain interests in land – albeit that measure is targeted at business assets and high-value resident ial properties. 4.16 Calculating the default rate based on the purchase price differs from New Zealand’s approach to RWT and NRWT, which apply on a per-payment basis. Calculating RLWT on a total purchase price basis eliminates issues that may arise when consideration for the property is made in a number of instalments. Example: Jane acquired a residential property for $800k after 1 October 2015 and after one year enters into a contract to sell the property to Paul for $900k. Jane’s gain is $100k ($900k - $800k). This means that the amount of RLWT that should be withheld under the standard rate is $33k (33% x $100k). $90k would need to be withheld under the default rate (10% x $900k). Under the “lower of” approach, $33k should be withheld by the withholding agent and paid to the Commissioner. 17 18 CHAPTER 5 Fulfilling RLWT obligations 5.1 A withholding agent’s obligations under the RLWT consist of three key elements: • the obligation to determine whether or not RLWT should be withheld and the amount that should be withheld; • the obligation to withhold an amount from the payment or other consideration provided by the purchaser of residential land to the vendor and to deposit that amount in a trust account; and • the obligation to pay this withheld amount to the Commissioner. In what circumstances should RLWT be withheld? 5.2 As mentioned above, the main objective of the RLWT is to collect tax liabilities arising under the proposed bright-line test and in particular, from foreign investors. It follows from this that the RLWT should mirror the concepts and definitions used in the proposed bright-line test where possible and practical. 5.3 This means the withholding agent would be required to withhold and pay RLWT to the Commissioner on the sale of residential land, unless the vendor qualifies for either of the following exceptions: • they are not an offshore person; • the bright-line test does not apply to the sale of the property as a result of the two-year holding period being exceeded. Not an offshore person 5.4 We suggest that the first exception should be where the vendor is not an “offshore person”. This first exception would rely on the proposed definition of offshore person in the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Informat ion) Bill. 5.5 The definition of “offshore person” in that bill covers both individuals and non-individuals (for example, trusts and companies). 5.6 For individuals, a New Zealand citizen or person who holds a residence-class visa granted under the Immigration Act 2009 will generally not be classed as an offshore person unless: • in the case of citizens, they have not been in New Zealand within the last three years; and 19 • in the case of residents, they have not been within New Zealand for the last year. Non-individuals 5.7 A non-individual will be an “offshore person”, if they would be an overseas person under sections 7(2)(b)–(e) of the Overseas Investment Act 2005 (modified to include the test for individuals described above). This test looks through structures that are New Zealand-tax resident and looks at their underlying ownership or control. The test is necessary to prevent offshore individuals circumventing the rule by interposing a New Zealand-resident structure. 5.8 Generally speaking this means a non-individual will be treated as being “offshore” if: • it is a body corporate (such as a company) and: - it is incorporated outside New Zealand; or - 25 percent or more of its shares are owned by a body corporate incorporated outside New Zealand; or - an offshore person(s) has 25 percent or more of:  any class of securities;  the power to control the composition of its governing body; or  the right to exercise or control the voting power; • it is a partnership or other unincorporated body of persons (other than a trust) and: - 25 percent or more of its partners or members are offshore persons; - an offshore person(s) has a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the profits or assets (including on winding up); or - an offshore person(s) has the right to exercise or control the exercise of 25 percent or more of the voting power at a meeting; • it is a trust and an offshore person(s): - constitute 25 percent or more of its governing body; or - has a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the trust property; or - are 25 percent or more of those that have the right to amend or control the amendment of the trust deed; or - are 25 percent or more of those having the right to control the composition of the trust’s governing body; or • it is a unit trust and an offshore person(s): - are the manager or trustee, or both; or - has a beneficial interest in, or entitlement to, 25 percent or more of the trust property. 20 5.9 While the proposed bright-line test would generally apply to all purchasers and sellers of residential land (regardless of their tax residence or physical presence), the rationale for using the offshore person test is that the issue that the proposed RLWT is addressing relates to the effective collection of tax from foreign investors who will often have no physical presence in New Zealand. We do not think the alternative of basing the exception on tax residence would be practical, because it is a tax concept that cannot easily be applied or verified by a conveyancer or solicitor. 5.10 The vendor would be required to provide certified evidence to the withholding agent in order to confirm that they are not an offshore person. This could include a New Zealand birth certificate, or a passport, or other relevant documentation (including a statement that they have been physically present in New Zealand for the requisite period). In the case of a non- individual, the vendor would need to provide relevant information or documentation regarding the ownership (or membership) of the governing body. 5.11 Copies of such documents that are certified true copies should be able to be relied upon by the withholding agent. Two-year period in bright-line test exceeded 5.12 As the proposed RLWT relates to the collection of tax arising under the proposed bright-line test, we suggest that an exception be provided where the vendor exceeds the two-year holding requirement for taxation under the bright-line test. 5.13 This means that a vendor would be able to access this second exception where: • the vendor acquires the residential land being sold before 1 October 2015; or • the vendor acquires the residential land being sold after 1 October 2015, but has owned the residential land for two or more years when it is sold to the purchaser. 5.14 The dates of acquisition and disposal for the purposes of RLWT should be consistent with the final design of the bright-line test. The Taxation (Bright- line Test for Residential Land) Bill proposes that the date of acquisition would generally be the vendor’s date of registration of the land title and the date of disposal would be the date on which the vendor and purchaser enter into an agreement for the sale of the property. 5.15 The wit hho lding agent would be ent it led to rely o n informat ion fro m Quotable Value Limited or Landonline as to the relevant dates. 5.16 Note that the proposed bright-line test would apply where an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into on or after 1 October 2015. In the case where an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into before 1 October 2015, but the date of registration does not occur until after 1 October 2015, 21 the vendor would need to provide a certified true copy of the agreement for sale and purchase (which is dated before 1 October 2015) to prove that the bright-line test does not apply. 5.17 One potential concern relates to the interaction between the intention and bright-line tests. The proposed bright-line test is intended to supplement the intention test and there may be instances where a person satisfies both tests. In such a case, RLWT should still apply – an offshore person should not be able to avoid the RLWT simply because another test also applies. This is because difficulties arise in collecting tax from foreign investors, regardless of which provision applies to impose the tax liability. 5.18 We propose that the RLWT should apply to “residential land” as defined for the purposes of the bright-line test. The proposed definition of “residential land” in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill includes: • land that has a dwelling on it; • land for which the seller is party to an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling on it; • bare land that because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling erected on it; • but excludes land that is used predominantly as business premises or farmland. When does the withholding obligation arise? 5.19 While the RLWT applies to the total purchase price of the residential property, we suggest that the obligation to withhold RLWT arises on the day the contract is settled. 5.20 The obligation to withhold an amount would be fulfilled by deducting the RLWT from the amount to be paid to the vendor or the vendor’s conveyancing agent. As a practical matter, the settlement statement documenting all the relevant calculations for the property transaction is prepared by the vendor and should include the amount of RLWT that the vendor’s solicitor expects to be withheld. 5.21 In so me situations, a deposit may be paid prior to settlement. We do not think that an obligation to withhold RLWT should arise at the time the deposit is paid as transactions can fall through even after a deposit is paid. Example: Peter agrees to purchase a residential property from Jess for $1 million who is an offshore person. Jess purchased the property one year earlier for $800k. Under the standard rate, the amount of RLWT to withhold in relation to the sale is $66k (33% x ($1m - $800k)). Under the default rate, the amount of RLWT to withhold is $100k. $66k is the amount of RLWT that should be withheld. Prior to settlement, Peter pays a $300k deposit. RLWT is not required to be withheld upon payment of the deposit. On settlement day, the $66k RLWT liability is required to be withheld from the $700k payment made to Jess. 22 5.22 If the withholding agent fails to withhold the correct amount of RLWT and pay this amount to the Commissioner, they may be liable for a monetary penalty. The Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out when and at what rates such penalties may be charged. This ensures that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed consistently, at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. Penalties under the RLWT could be set in accordance with other penalties in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Discharge of other obligations upon settlement 5.23 As mentioned, most countries place the withholding obligation on the purchaser or, in effect, the purchaser’s solicitor. This means that as a practical matter, the payment of the withholding tax occurs before any other payments are made in relation to the property. 5.24 We consider this should be the result for the RLWT, regardless of who bears the withholding obligation. If the payment of the tax ranked equally or behind other disbursements (e.g. repayment of mortgages) or other charges, RLWT could be easily avoided by taking out a loan or increasing an existing loan just before the sale of the property. In any event, our expectation is that the standard RLWT rate would be used in the majority of cases. This means that in the case where the property value has declined, there would be no RLWT and it should not affect the repayment of mortgages and other obligations of the vendor. Example: Mary purchases a residential property for $500k, with a $400k mortgage secured over the property. 18 months later Mary agrees to sell the property to Dan for $450k. Using the default RLWT rate, the amount to be withheld would be $45k. Combined with other expenses to be paid upon settlement (e.g. rates), this may leave insufficient funds to repay Mary’s mortgage. However, by applying the standard RLWT rate, no withholding is required because Mary’s acquisition price exceeds the sales price agreed between Mary and Dan. This means that under a “lower of” approach, the standard rate would be used and withholding would not be required. Example: Ben purchases a residential property for $300k, with a $300k mortgage secured over the property. One year later he agrees to sell the property to Elizabeth for $320k. Using the default RLWT rate, $32k would be required to be withheld. If the default RLWT rate applied, Ben would be unable to repay his mortgage. Applying the standard RLWT rate means that only $6,600 (33% x (320k - 300k)) would need to be withheld. This would leave sufficient funds remaining to discharge Ben’s mortgage. Payment of withheld amounts to the Commissioner 5.25 Conveyancing agents who handle large volumes of such transactions could incur compliance costs in paying each withheld sum at the time of each transaction. One possibility would be to allow conveyancing agents to pay withheld RLWT amounts on a monthly basis (or “batching”). 23 5.26 We suggest that the standard due dates for withheld amounts could apply. For example, PAYE, RWT, and NRWT due dates are set out in section RA 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 5.27 However, we also suggest that withheld amounts could also be paid on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This may be preferred by the conveyancing agent where RLWT is only occasionally withheld. The parties to the property transaction may wish to negotiate for immediate payment of RLWT to the Commissioner, for example if the vendor would like to file an interim income tax return shortly after settlement and claim a credit for RLWT (this is discussed in further detail in Chapter 7). 5.28 From an administrative perspective, it would be possible to allow both batching and payment on a transaction-by-transaction basis. For example, a conveyancing agent may wish to make payments of withheld RLWT to the Commissioner on a monthly basis, but may agree with so me vendors to make immediate payment to the Commissioner. 5.29 When completing the title registration on Landonline, an additional field could be introduced for the withholding, signifying that the RLWT obligations in relation to the transaction have been fulfilled and the appropriate amount has been withheld and has been or will be paid to Inland Revenue. 5.30 We do not consider that a delay in the payment of RLWT should delay the title registration process. No registration of title 5.31 There may be situations where a sale of residential land does not involve a registration of tit le. This includes, for example, “off the plan” sales. 5.32 If the parties to the transaction are using conveyancers and/or solicitors, we propose that the primary withholding obligation falls on either the purchaser’s conveyancing agent or the vendor’s conveyancing agent as set out in chapter 3. If there is no conveyancing agent, we propose that the primary withholding obligation falls on the purchaser (also proposed in chapter 3). 24 CHAPTER 6 Information requirements 6.1 As discussed in chapter 5, we suggest that RLWT would apply unless the vendor is eligible for at least one exception. 6.2 The first exception, which would be available when a vendor is not an offshore person, would require the vendor to provide evidence to the relevant conveyancing agent regarding their status. An example is a certified copy of their passport and/or residence class visa along with a statement that they have been physically present in New Zealand for the requisite period. In the case of a non-individual, the vendor would need to provide relevant information or documentation regarding the ownership (or membership) of the governing body. 6.3 Under the second exception, which applies when the vendor acquired the property prior to 1 October 2015 or has held the property for more than two years, the vendor would generally not be required to provide information or evidence to the conveyancing agent. 6.4 The vendor’s date of acquisition (which would align with the bright-line test) would likely be the date of registration of the title to the property, which can be obtained from Quotable Value and Landonline. The date of disposal for the purposes of the two-year test would likely be the date on which the agreement for sale and purchase between the purchaser and vendor is entered into. This date would be available to both parties, including their conveyancing agents. 6.5 There is one instance where we envisage that the vendor would be required to provide evidence to the conveyancing agent under the second exception. This would be when the vendor’s title to the property being sold is registered on or after 1 October 2015, but the vendor is not subject to the bright-line test because the agreement for sale and purchase was entered into prior to 1 October 2015. In this case, the vendor would need to provide a certified copy of that agreement for sale and purchase to the conveyancing agent in order to qualify for the second exception. 6.6 Chapter 4 discussed the rate at which RLWT should be withheld. The “lower of” approach proposed in that chapter allows the withholding agent to undertake a simple calculation based on publicly available information and other information available to both parties, while also minimising the level o f engagement between the two conveyancing agents. 6.7 To calculate the amount of RLWT to be withheld, the withholding agent would first need the total purchase price, as agreed between the purchaser and vendor, which will be available in the agreement for sale and purchase. The withholding agent would also need to obtain the vendor’s acquisition price, which is readily available from Quotable Value for a nominal fee. 25 6.8 Officials consider that in general, the conveyancing agent should be entit led to rely on a statement provided by the vendor, unless they know it to be false. In such a case, the conveyancing agent would be required to withhold and pay RLWT to the Commissioner. A useful precedent for this approach is in section 78F of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which permits a supplier to rely on a statement made by the purchaser that the conditions for zero rating the supply have been met. 26 CHAPTER 7 Tax credits and filing a tax return 7.1 New Zealand tax residents are required to pay tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on their New Zealand- sourced income. 7.2 A person’s final income tax liability under the proposed bright-line test arises whether or not they are a New Zealand tax resident. In the case of non- residents, New Zealand would only tax New Zealand-sourced residential property gains. Section YD 4(12) in the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that income derived from the disposal of property situated in New Zealand has a source in New Zealand. In the case of New Zealand tax residents, worldwide residential property gains would be taxable in New Zealand. 7.3 One of the differences between the proposed bright-line test and the RLWT is that the RLWT only applies to sales of residential land by “offshore persons”. It is expected that a large number of taxpayers with tax liabilities arising under the bright-line test would not have RLWT withheld. 7.4 Regardless of whether RLWT has been withheld, taxpayers with tax liabilities arising under the bright-line test would be required to file an income tax return. 7.5 Where RLWT has been withheld, the amount of RLWT withheld would not be final. The vendor should be able to claim a tax credit for the amount of RLWT withheld and paid to the Commissioner against their final income tax liability in relation to the sale of the residential property. The rationale for this is that the RLWT is intended to assist in collecting tax arising under the bright-line test and is not intended to be a final tax. 7.6 We acknowledge that when the final tax liability is calculated, the default rate could result in over-taxation. Allowing the use of the standard withholding rate should reduce the extent of over-taxation in most situations, because the standard rate should generally result in a lower amount being withheld than under the default rate. But even then, if too much tax has been withheld, the vendor must file an income tax return to claim the difference as a refund or use it as a credit to offset some other tax obligation (this will usually be the case where the vendor has deductible expenses to claim in relation to the property). Likewise, if more tax is owing than the amount of tax withheld, the vendor must file an income tax return and pay the addit ional tax. 7.7 We also suggest that taxpayers should be able to file an interim income tax return (depending on the circumstances) in order to obtain an RLWT refund, in the event that the amount of RLWT withheld exceeds the taxpayer’s fina l tax liability for the sale. 7.8 Where a loss has been made (i.e. the vendor’s original acquisition cost exceeds the total purchase price), no withholding under the RLWT would be 27 required. In this case, there is no over-taxation, but an income tax return would need to be filed in order to calculate losses. 7.9 Where a taxpayer has ring-fenced losses 5 carried forward from previous sales under the bright-line test, these losses should be used first to offset the person’s taxable income in relation to the property sale. Any amount withheld as RLWT would be creditable against the person’s final income tax liability. Where losses are utilised and there is no need to offset some or all of the RLWT against the income tax liability, the remaining RLWT should be refunded. 7.10 However, for an RLWT credit or refund to be available, the RLWT must be withheld and paid to the Commissioner. 6 This is to protect the integrity of the tax system and to prevent gaming where a credit or refund is issued, but the RLWT has not been withheld and paid to the Commissioner. 5 The proposed bright-line test ring-fences losses so they can only be used to offset gains on other land sales that are taxable under any of the land sale provisions. 6 As discussed in chapter 5, it would be possible for withholding agents to pay amounts of withheld RLWT to the Commissioner on a monthly or transaction-by-transaction basis. There may be cases where the vendor would like to file an interim income tax return shortly after settlement in order to obtain an RLWT refund. It would be up to the vendor and purchaser to come to an agreement that RLWT should be paid to the Commissioner as soon as possible, so that the vendor is able to obtain their refund without substantial delay. 28

This is why withholding taxes are used to collect the tax due before the money reaches the recipient – the person paying the income does not have the same incentive to spend the funds. For example, employers deduct PAYE from their employees’ wages. 4 What would the RLWT involve? Three key elements: 1.The obligation to determine whether or not withholding is required and at what rate 2.The obligation to withhold an amount from the payment made by the buyer of a property to the seller and to deposit that amount into a trust account 3.The obligation to pay this amount to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Withholding agent Inland Revenue $90 $10 Seller Buyer $100 5 We want to make the process as simple as possible for the withholder Does an amount need to be withheld? When would RLWT apply? When all of the following conditions have been met: 1.The seller is an offshore person 2.The property being sold is residential land 3.The property is sold within two years of acquisition 6 Who is an “offshore person”? Definition covers both natural persons and entities Excludes: •NZ citizens who are or have been physically present in NZ within the previous 3 years •Individuals with residence class visas who are or have been physically present in NZ within the last year Includes entities incorporated outside NZ Includes entities incorporated in NZ but owned 25% or more by offshore persons Follows the definition of “offshore person” used in the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill 7 What is “residential land”? Uses the proposed definition of residential land in the bright-line test: Land with a dwelling on it Land for which the seller is a party to an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling on it Bare land that because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling erected on it But excludes land used predominantly as business premises or farmland Follows the definition of “residential land” used in the Taxation (Bright- line Test for Residential Land) Bill 8 When the property is sold within two years of acquisition The seller acquires the residential land being sold on or after 1 October 2015 (where an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into on or after 1 October 2015) The seller owns the residential land for less than 2 years before selling it to the buyer Follows the 2-year holding period proposed by the bright-line test 1. Clock starts ticking when seller’s title to property is registered 2. Clock stops when agreement for sale and purchase entered into between buyer and seller 9 What would the rate of RLWT be? The issues paper proposes that RLWT should be withheld at a rate that is the lower of: 1.33% x seller’s gain (the standard rate) 2.10% x total purchase price (the default rate) 10 The standard rate Total purchase price: agreed sales price between buyer and seller Seller’s acquisition price: total price paid by seller to acquire the property (generally available from Quotable Value for a nominal fee) 33% is the top marginal tax rate (and is the rate used for resident withholding tax on dividends) 33% x seller’s gain Seller’s gain = total purchase price – seller’s acquisition price 11 Example In April 2017, Mark enters into an agreement for sale and purchase with James to purchase James’ residential property for $1 million. James is an offshore person and acquired the property in January 2016 for $750,000. The amount of RLWT calculated under the standard rate is $82,500 (33% x ($1 million - $750,000)). This would mean that Mark pays $1 million and James receives $917,500 after withholding. However, the amount of RLWT calculated under the default rate may be lower and should be calculated. Refer to pages 12 and 13 for further information. The default rate Total purchase price = agreed sales price between buyer and seller 10% x total purchase price Example In April 2017, Mark enters into an agreement for sale and purchase with James to purchase James’ residential property for $1 million. The amount of RLWT calculated under the default rate is $100,000 (10% x $1 million). This would mean that Mark pays $1 million and James receives $900,000 after withholding. However, the amount of RLWT calculated under the standard rate would likely be lower and that amount would be withheld instead. Refer to page 13 of this information pack. 12 Calculating RLWT: an example Example In April 2017, Mark enters into an agreement for sale and purchase with James to purchase James’ residential property for $1 million. James is an offshore person and acquired the property in January 2016 for $750,000. Standard rate: 33% x ($1 million - $750,000) = 33% x $250,000 = $82,500 Default rate: 10% x $ 1 million = $100,000 $82,500 is less than $100,000 and so $82,500 is the amount of RLWT that should be withheld. January 2016 James acquires house for $750,000 April 2017 James sells house to Mark for $1 million Amount of RLWT to be withheld: $82,500 Mark pays $1 million James receives $917,500 after withholding 13 Who should be the withholding agent? In most circumstances, the buyer and seller will be using the services of a conveyancer or solicitor. The issues paper sets out 2 options: 1.Primary obligation on the buyer’s conveyancing agent (with a secondary obligation on the seller’s conveyancing agent) 2.Sole obligation on the seller’s conveyancing agent Where there is no conveyancer or solicitor involved in the property transaction, the obligation should be on the buyer. The issues paper requests submitters’ feedback on which approach they prefer and any practical considerations. The buyer’s or seller’s conveyancer/solicitor? 14 Why not the buyer themselves? We think it would increase compliance costs and be administratively burdensome if every single buyer were to register as a withholding agent with Inland Revenue However, some countries put the actual obligation on the buyer •in the event of a failure to withhold, the tax authority would be able to enforce the obligation on the buyer for the amount that should have been withheld •It means that the withholding tax takes precedence over other expenses normally paid out by the seller’s solicitor In reality, most buyers would rely on their solicitors or conveyancers to discharge their withholding obligations 15 How it might work: buyer’s conveyancing agent 1. James buys house for $750,000 in January 2016 2. Mark agrees to buy house from James for $1 million in April 2017 Mark’s conveyancer 3. Mark puts $1 million into his conveyancer’s trust account James’ conveyancer 4. James’ conveyancer provides evidence as to whether or not James is an offshore person Inland Revenue James’ conveyancer: 8. Checks correct amount of RLWT has been withheld 9. Pays relevant expenses (e.g. mortgage and rates) 10. Pays net proceeds to James ($917,500 less expenses) Mark’s conveyancer: 5.calculates RLWT: $82,500 (see previous example) 6.Pays $917,500 to James’ conveyancer 7.Pays $82,500 to Inland Revenue 16 How it might work: seller’s conveyancing agent 1. James buys house for $750,000 in January 2016 2. Mark agrees to buy house from James for $1 million in April 2017 Mark’s conveyancer 3. Mark puts $1 million into his conveyancer’s trust account James’ conveyancer 4. Mark’s conveyancer transfers $1 million to James’ conveyancer Inland Revenue James’ conveyancer: 5.Checks whether or not James is an offshore person 6.Calculates RLWT: $82,500 (see previous example) 7.Pays $82,500 to Inland Revenue 8.Pays other relevant expenses (e.g. mortgage and rates) 9.Pays net proceeds to James 17 Advantages of each approach Buyer’s conveyancing agent International norm e.g. US, Canada, Japan (and soon Australia). Follows other New Zealand withholding taxes which place withholding liability on the payer (e.g. employers with PAYE, banks with RWT and NRWT). More likely for funds to flow through a New Zealand solicitor’s trust account - therefore there are funds in New Zealand from which tax can be withheld. There is a “back stop”: if buyer’s conveyancing agent fails to withhold correct amount, a secondary liability can be placed on seller’s conveyancing agent. Seller’s conveyancing agent Could be seen as being fairer for buyers - the compliance burden and cost are legally borne by the seller (i.e. by the person with the ultimate tax liability). The seller’s conveyancing agent may have more immediate access to information about the seller’s offshore status. The seller’s conveyancing agent deals with other expenses at the time of settlement (e.g. rates). 18 Order of priority for disbursements Regardless of which approach is taken, we think that the withholding and payment of RLWT should occur before other payments are made in relation to the property (e.g. rates, repayment of the seller’s mortgage) This is a natural result when the buyer or the buyer’s solicitor or conveyancer is the withholding agent If the payment of the tax ranked equally or behind other disbursements (e.g. repayment of mortgages) or other charges, RLWT could be easily avoided by taking out a loan just before the sale of the property In any event, our expectation is that the standard RLWT rate would be used in the majority of cases – this means that in the case where the property value has declined, there would be no RLWT and it should not impact the repayment of mortgages and other obligations of the seller. 19 Paying the money to Inland Revenue Withholding agents would need to register with Inland Revenue Batching approach: conveyancing agents who handle large volumes of such transactions could incur compliance costs to pay each withheld sum at the time of each transaction. One possibility would be to allow conveyancing agents to pay withheld RLWT amounts on a monthly basis (or “batching”) This is the approach taken for PAYE, RWT, and NRWT, for example. Standard due dates for withheld amounts could apply. Transaction-by-transaction approach: this may be preferred by the conveyancing agent where RLWT is only occasionally withheld. This would allow the seller to file an interim income tax return shortly after the sale and claim a credit for RLWT Would be possible to allow withholding agents to mix and match between the two approaches Withholding agent Inland Revenue Batched amounts held in the solicitor’s trust account and paid to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis Withholding agent agrees to pay this amount of RLWT to Inland Revenue immediately, so that the seller can claim a tax credit in an interim return 20 Failure to withhold and pay RLWT The sale (in particular, the title transfer process) would not be held up as a result of a failure to withhold and pay RLWT The issues paper proposes instead that monetary penalties be imposed on the withholding agent where there is a failure to withhold and pay RLWT The Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out when and at what rates such penalties may be charged.

International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 2 Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee has examined the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance, and recommends that the House take note of its report. The committee supports the agreement and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance was referred to us by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on 30 July 2015. We met on 12 and 19 August 2015 to consider the agreement. Committee members David Bennett (Chairperson) Andrew Bayly Chris Bishop Hon Clayton Cosgrove Julie Anne Genter Stuart Nash Rt Hon Winston Peters Grant Robertson Jami-Lee Ross Alastair Scott David Seymour AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 4 Appendix B National Interest Analysis Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance 1 Executive summary 1.1 On 8 July 2015 in Apia, Samoa, New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance (the Samoa DTA). 1.2 Double tax agreements (DTAs) are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. When income is derived from one jurisdiction (the source jurisdiction) by a tax resident of the other jurisdiction (the residence jurisdiction), both countries typically impose tax on that income. DTAs primarily relieve such double taxation by allocating taxing rights between the two jurisdictions. The negotiation of, and giving of effect to, DTAs is provided for by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. New Zealand has 39 DTAs in force, primarily with New Zealand’s major trading and investment partners. 1.3 Samoa is not a major trading and investment partner for New Zealand. On the other hand, New Zealand is Samoa’s second largest trading partner after Australia. (To demonstrate the importance of the New Zealand market to their economy, the Government of Samoa established the New Zealand Samoa Trade and Investment Commission in 2011 in order to encourage increased trade and investment flows between the two countries.) Finally, we note that New Zealand exports to Samoa are considerably higher than imports from Samoa. 1.4 New Zealand and Samoa also have a special relationship, as reflected by the 1962 Treaty of Friendship which recognised Samoa’s progression from New Zealand trusteeship to an independent state. The relationship is supported by the large number of New Zealanders with a Samoan background living in New Zealand and the influence that Samoan culture has on New Zealand culture. 1.5 As in all negotiations, the Samoa DTA represents a compromise between the starting positions of both countries. The key compromise made by New Zealand relates to New Zealand’s agreement to Samoa’s request for a tax sparing provision to be included in the treaty, with the provision terminating after a 10-year period. Under the provision, tax sparing would only apply if and when the two Governments agree to tax sparing in an exchange of letters. It is not expected that the mechanism will become operational. We have agreed a similar provision with Papua New Guinea. Tax sparing provisions were once a common feature of DTAs AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 5 between developed and developing countries. The developed country would agree to provide a tax credit for tax deemed to be paid in the developing country, but not actually paid because of a tax exemption intended to attract foreign investment. From a tax policy perspective, we do not favour tax sparing provisions as research suggests that they are ineffective in meeting their goals of attracting foreign investment and can create avoidance concerns. The tax sparing mechanism agreed with Samoa therefore represents a concession - although, as noted above, it is not expected that the provision will become operational. 1.6 An issue of note relates to Samoa’s international finance centre regime which provides certain foreign-owned entities that establish a presence in Samoa with broad tax exemptions under Samoan law, in order to encourage foreign investment into Samoa. We consider it inappropriate for these vehicles to access treaty benefits under the Samoa DTA on their New Zealand-sourced income, as such access could lead to cases of abuse of the treaty. We are, however, satisfied that these entities will not be entitled to the benefits of the Samoa DTA, as they will not qualify as “resident” of Samoa for the purposes of the DTA. 2 Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action 2.1 The Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance (the Samoa DTA) was signed in Apia, Samoa on 8 July 2015. 2.2 The proposed treaty action is to bring the Samoa DTA into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirm the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each country, pursuant to Article 26 of the Samoa DTA. 2.3 Before the treaty action is taken, the Samoa DTA must successfully undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Parliament’s Standing Orders 397-400, and must successfully be given the force of law in New Zealand by an Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 2.4 New Zealand has existing agreements with Samoa relating to the exchange of tax- related information and the allocation of taxing rights over certain types of personal income. The Agreement Between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in Respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustment, both signed in Apia on 24 August 2010, shall terminate and cease to have effect when the Samoa DTA has effect, pursuant to Article 26 of the Samoa DTA. 2.5 Like other New Zealand DTAs, the Samoa DTA does not extend to the Cook Islands, Niue, or Tokelau. AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 6 3 Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty General reasons for New Zealand’s conclusion of double tax agreements 3.1 New Zealand began entering into double tax agreements (DTAs) in 1947, and currently has a network of 39 DTAs in force, predominantly with New Zealand’s main trading and investment partners. 3.2 DTAs are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. DTAs do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. Some impediments to cross-border economic activity can be addressed unilaterally. For example, New Zealand generally relieves double taxation by unilaterally allowing tax residents who derive foreign-sourced income to credit foreign tax paid against their New Zealand tax liability. New Zealand also unilaterally reduces withholding taxes on certain forms of inbound investment. However, unilateral solutions cannot address all of the issues that arise from cross-border activity. Moreover, the country applying unilateral measures must then bear the full cost of the relief. DTAs address these problems by facilitating bilateral solutions. DTAs enable a wider range of issues to be addressed than is possible unilaterally, and also enable the parties to a DTA to share the cost of providing relief. 3.3 DTA networks make an important contribution to the expansion of world trade and to the development of the world economy, which are key objectives of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Internationally, the OECD has therefore assumed a leading role in promoting the use of DTAs. In particular, the OECD has produced a Model Tax Convention, and a comprehensive commentary, for member and non-member countries to use as a basis for concluding DTAs. As a member of the OECD, New Zealand is subject to an express recommendation issued by the OECD Council in 1997 for all member countries: 1. to pursue their efforts to conclude bilateral tax conventions ... with those member countries, and where appropriate with non-member countries, with which they have not yet entered into such conventions ... 2. when concluding new bilateral conventions or revising existing bilateral conventions, to conform to the Model Tax Convention, as interpreted by the Commentaries thereon. 3.4 At a practical level, DTAs are complex technical documents that provide an interface between two, often conflicting, tax systems. The key stakeholders in cross-border economic activity generally favour DTAs for the following reasons: Taxpayers. A primary concern for any taxpayer contemplating entering into commercial activity in another jurisdiction is that they must comply with the tax and other legal obligations of two separate jurisdictions. This can be perplexing, and obtaining professional advice or tax rulings can be costly and time consuming. Unique issues also arise from cross-border activities, ranging from complex matters such as transfer pricing disputes, to more mundane considerations such as whether taxes paid in the other jurisdiction are creditable against home jurisdiction tax. DTAs help alleviate many of these problems. They establish a framework for the taxation of cross- AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 7 border activity and establish a mutual agreement procedure for resolving tax disputes. Investors. Investing across an international border always involves risk. Tax laws are often complex and can change suddenly. DTAs assist investors by specifying the maximum rates of tax that can be applied to dividends, interest and royalties. These “headline” rates reduce compliance costs for investors by making it easier to determine the after-tax returns on potential investments. The tax rates are “locked in” by the treaty, which means that investors can make business decisions with confidence. To encourage greater inward investment, governments can unilaterally reduce their taxation of investment income. However, lowering tax rates in a bilateral treaty setting ensures that the rates are also reduced on a reciprocal basis by the treaty partner. This provides benefits to domestic investors. Governments. As double taxation distorts business decisions and generally hinders cross-border economic activity, most jurisdictions unilaterally relieve double taxation of their tax residents. (For example, New Zealand tax legislation provides a general tax credit mechanism.) However, in the absence of a DTA, a jurisdiction bears the full cost of relieving double taxation itself. DTAs allow the cost of relieving double taxation to be shared. They do this by allocating taxing rights between the jurisdictions concerned, on the basis of internationally accepted principles as set out in the OECD Model Tax Convention. Additionally, most countries tax their residents on income earned worldwide. International cooperation between tax authorities is therefore needed to enable tax authorities to verify that income earned in other countries is reported correctly by tax residents. DTAs facilitate this by authorising the exchange of tax-related information (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information). The exchanged information assists tax authorities to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. This is a key benefit of DTAs for governments. Specific reasons for the double tax agreement with Samoa 3.5 New Zealand generally only enters into DTAs with countries with which it has an existing or potential significant economic relationship. Samoa is not a major trading and investment partner for New Zealand. However, New Zealand is Samoa’s second largest trading partner. To demonstrate the importance of the New Zealand market to the Samoan economy, the Government of Samoa established the New Zealand Samoa Trade and Investment Commission in 2011 in order to encourage increased trade and investment flows between the two countries. 3.6 New Zealand and Samoa also have a special relationship, as reflected by the 1962 Treaty of Friendship which recognised Samoa’s progression from New Zealand trusteeship to an independent state. The relationship is supported by the large number of New Zealanders with a Samoan background living in New Zealand and the influence that Samoan culture has on New Zealand culture. AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 8 4 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand 4.1 The Samoa DTA involves a trade-off between advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand. On balance, entering into the Samoa DTA is expected to be in New Zealand’s overall interests. Advantages of the treaty entering into force 4.2 The advantages to New Zealand of the Samoa DTA entering into force can be summarised as follows:  The DTA can be expected to foster all forms of bilateral economic activity (such as services, trade and investment). This will benefit New Zealand in terms of employment and business opportunities and offshore earnings. As noted below in the section titled 8 The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty, DTAs can generally be expected to give rise to a prima facie revenue cost. However, in the case of Samoa, these costs are expected to be negligible.  For New Zealand business interests, the DTA will reduce the cost of importing capital.  For investors in both jurisdictions, the DTA will reduce compliance costs and provide the certainty of low headline withholding tax rates, locked in by the treaty.  For investors, businesses and taxpayers from both jurisdictions, the DTA will provide safeguards such as a mutual agreement procedure, which will facilitate the resolution of tax disputes (including disputes in complex areas such as transfer pricing).  For taxpayers engaged in certain short-term income-earning activities in the other jurisdiction, the DTA will reduce compliance costs and provide cash-flow advantages by eliminating the need to pay tax in that jurisdiction and then claim that tax against their tax liability in their home jurisdiction.  For New Zealand, the DTA will provide an equitable framework for sharing the cost of relieving double taxation between the two jurisdictions.  In some circumstances, New Zealand will no longer need to provide credits for foreign tax paid.  There is currently a tax information exchange agreement or TIEA in place between New Zealand and Samoa (The Agreement Between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes). The TIEA provides for the exchange of tax-related information upon request, and will be replaced by the Samoa DTA which contains a broader exchange of information mechanism to further assist in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. The mechanism will also be a general deterrent against evasion and avoidance activity, and will further reduce the opportunities available to residents to escape legitimate New Zealand tax. AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 9 4.3 A final advantage of the Samoa DTA is that New Zealand and Samoa share many treaty policy positions. As a result, New Zealand was able to get agreement on all of its key negotiating positions (apart from a compromise made in relation to tax sparing). The Samoa DTA represents a good precedent for New Zealand in future negotiations with other countries. Disadvantages of the treaty entering into force 4.4 As noted above, DTAs offer bilateral solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to solve unilaterally. However, a potential downside to DTAs is that those solutions are then locked into place by the treaty and are difficult and costly to change. This can create difficulties if treaty provisions need to be changed urgently. Practical experience indicates that in genuine cases, treaty partners are usually amenable to making necessary changes. However, in extreme cases, if the treaty partner were to refuse to cooperate, the treaty could need to be terminated. 4.5 A second general disadvantage of DTAs is that they typically give rise to an up- front revenue cost. This is because DTAs lower withholding tax rates on investment income and allocate taxing rights between the two jurisdictions. The allocating of taxing rights means that New Zealand will lose the ability to tax some income streams that it previously could tax (this applies on a reciprocal basis). However, as noted below in section 8 below, titled The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty, in the case of Samoa, the prima facie revenue costs are expected to be negligible. 4.6 A third general disadvantage of DTAs is that costs will need to be incurred in administering the exchange of information provisions of the DTA. If a treaty partner makes requests for information under a New Zealand DTA, New Zealand will incur costs in complying with those requests. However, in the case of Samoa, we currently have a TIEA in place, although the provisions are slightly narrower in scope. This means that the costs of administering the DTA’s exchange of information mechanism will not be significantly different from the current costs incurred in administering the TIEA’s provisions. 4.7 A fourth general disadvantage of DTAs is the potential for abuse, in particular, as regards “treaty shopping”. However, the Samoa DTA incorporates treaty provisions which are likely to become international best practice, which should provide protection against abuse (discussed further under Access to treaty benefits in section 5, at paragraphs 5.6-5.11, below). 4.8 As noted above, New Zealand and Samoa share many treaty positions, and New Zealand was therefore able to get agreement on all of its key negotiating positions. The key compromise made by New Zealand in the Samoa DTA relates to New Zealand’s agreement to Samoa’s request for a tax-sparing provision to be included in the treaty, with the provision terminating after a 10-year period. Under the provision, tax sparing would only apply if and when the two Governments agree to tax sparing in an exchange of letters. It is not expected that the mechanism will become operational.We have agreed a similar provision with Papua New Guinea. Tax sparing provisions were once a common feature of DTAs between developed and developing countries. The developed country would agree to provide a tax credit for tax deemed to be paid in the developing country, but not actually paid because of a tax exemption intended to attract foreign investment. From a tax policy perspective, we do not favour tax sparing provisions as research suggests AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 10 that they are ineffective in meeting their goals of attracting foreign investment and can create avoidance concerns. The tax sparing mechanism agreed with Samoa therefore represents a concession - although, as noted above, it is not expected that the provision will become operational. Advantages of the treaty not entering into force 4.9 It is an option not to have a DTA with Samoa. In that case, the disadvantages identified above will not arise. Disadvantages of the treaty not entering into force 4.10 If the Samoa DTA does not enter into force, there may be tax barriers for New Zealand investors investing into Samoa and Samoan investors investing into New Zealand. Further, if the Samoa DTA does not enter into force, an opportunity to strengthen ties with Samoa will be missed. 5 Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms Summary of key legal obligations 5.1 DTAs do not impose requirements on taxpayers. The Samoa DTA will not (and cannot) require the imposition of a tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. Thus the entry into force of the Samoa DTA will not change underlying tax policy. The obligations that the Samoa DTA imposes are on the New Zealand and Samoa Governments. 5.2 When income is derived from one jurisdiction (the source jurisdiction) by a tax resident of the other jurisdiction (the residence jurisdiction), both countries typically impose tax on that income. DTAs primarily relieve such double taxation by allocating taxing rights between the two jurisdictions. The key allocation of taxing rights in the Samoa DTA is as follows:  Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the enterprise is resident, unless profits are derived through a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction. In that case, the profits may also be taxed in the source jurisdiction (Article 7 refers). The term “permanent establishment” is generally defined in the Samoa DTA as meaning a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. However, this general rule is supplemented by a number of clarifications and deeming rules which follow New Zealand’s preferred formula, and which will ensure that New Zealand can continue to impose tax on significant business activities such as natural resource exploration or exploitation (Article 5 refers).  Investment income (dividends, interest and royalties) may generally be taxed in both jurisdictions. However, the amount of withholding tax that can be imposed by the source jurisdiction is limited to 5% for dividends if the dividend is paid to a company that directly owns at least 10% of the voting power of the company paying the dividends, 15% for all other dividends (Article 10 refers), and 10% for interest and royalties (Articles 11 and 12 refer). The limitation does not apply if the dividends, AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 11 interest or royalties are derived in connection with a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction.  Income from employment will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the employee is resident unless the employee is present in the source jurisdiction for more than six months in a twelve-month period or the employer is a resident of the source jurisdiction (or is non-resident but the employee’s remuneration is borne by a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction). In that case, the employment income may also be taxed in the source jurisdiction (Article 14 refers).  Pensions will generally be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the recipient is resident (Article 17 refers). This largely mirrors the corresponding provision in the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in Respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustment. However, the Samoa DTA excludes the provision that provides that the country where the pension is sourced may tax the pension if the country where the person is resident does not. 5.3 A number of exceptions to the above rules also apply. These include:  Income from real property (referred to as “immovable property” in the Samoa DTA) will always be taxable in the jurisdiction where the property is situated (Articles 6 and 13 refer).  Profits of an enterprise from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic will be taxable only in the jurisdiction in which the enterprise is resident. However, profits from domestic carriage by ship or aircraft will always be taxable in the source jurisdiction (Articles 8 and 13 refer).  Directors’ fees will always be taxable in the jurisdiction in which the company paying the fees is resident (Article 15 refers).  Income from the activities of entertainers and sportspersons will always be taxable in the source jurisdiction (Article 16 refers).  Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one jurisdiction will generally be exempt from tax in the other jurisdiction (Article 18 refers). This largely mirrors the corresponding provision in the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in Respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustment. 5.4 Where the allocation of taxing rights permits both jurisdictions to tax an item of income, the Samoa DTA will require New Zealand to relieve double taxation of its residents by allowing a credit for the tax paid in Samoa (Article 22 refers). This is consistent with the unilateral relief mechanism that already applies under New Zealand domestic law. The obligation also applies reciprocally, so Samoa must allow its residents a credit for New Zealand tax paid. AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 12 5.5 In addition to the above obligations, New Zealand will be required to comply with various administrative requirements imposed by the Samoa DTA. These are as follows:  Mutual agreement procedure. New Zealand must comply with the procedures for settling disputes set out in the mutual agreement procedure article of the Samoa DTA (Article 23 refers). This is discussed below, in the section Dispute resolution.  Exchange of information. The Samoa DTA includes an Article that provides for the exchange of tax-related information between tax authorities, for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax evasion and tax avoidance (Article 24 refers). New Zealand will be required to respond to requests for information from Samoa. If Inland Revenue receives a valid request, and if it does not already hold the requested information, it must use its information-gathering powers to obtain the information. Inland Revenue can similarly request information from Samoa. Note that the Samoa DTA exchange of information obligations will replace the exchange of information obligations that are currently in place under the TIEA between New Zealand and Samoa. Thus, it is not expected that there will be any significant additional administrative costs to comply with the exchange of information obligations in the Samoa DTA. Access to treaty benefits 5.6 New Zealand has been actively involved in the on-going work at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) under its 15-point action plan to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) concerns. The action plan was released in 2013. Of particular relevance to New Zealand’s DTA network is the work being done under Action 6, which has identified treaty abuse, and in particular, treaty shopping, as a BEPS concern. Part of the work under Action 6 is to develop model treaty provisions to prevent the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances. This work will likely result in changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and its commentary, on which New Zealand bases its negotiating model. At this stage, the work is well progressed. 5.7 The Samoa DTA contains provisions that will likely form the basis of the new OECD minimum standard on preventing treaty abuse, as that work under Action 6 currently stands. These safeguards should future-proof the Samoa DTA, ensuring that it does not create opportunities for double non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through “treaty shopping”). 5.8 The Samoa DTA includes an entitlement to benefits Article, which applies to the whole DTA. It provides that a benefit under the DTA in relation to an item of income will not be granted if it is reasonable to conclude that one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction was to obtain that benefit (either directly or indirectly). Benefits under the DTA will not be denied if it is established that granting the benefit in the relevant circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of the DTA. 5.9 An issue of note particular to Samoa regarding potential abuse of the Samoa DTA concerns Samoa’s international finance centre regime. In order to encourage AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 13 foreign investment into Samoa, Samoa has an international sector which is monitored and supervised by the Samoa International Financial Authority (SIFA). This international sector has its own internationally-focused suite of Samoan laws which provides preferential treatment for foreign-owned entities that establish a presence in Samoa. 5.10 Except for trustee companies, all entities and arrangements registered under Samoa’s international sector legislation can benefit from tax exemptions. Specifically, international companies, segregated fund international companies, international insurance companies, international partnerships and limited partnerships, international trusts, international banks, and international mutual funds are exempt from all taxes or duties (whether direct or indirect) on their profits or gains, or upon transactions and contracts. 5.11 Due to the broad tax exemptions that these vehicles are granted in Samoa, if such vehicles could access benefits under the Samoa DTA, it is possible that the Samoa DTA could be abused. More specifically, there is a risk that such vehicles would use Samoa as a conduit jurisdiction to access benefits under the Samoa DTA on their New Zealand-sourced income that would otherwise be unavailable. We are, however, satisfied that these entities will not be entitled to the benefits of the Samoa DTA, because they would not be a tax resident of Samoa for the purposes of the DTA (Article 4 refers). Dispute resolution 5.12 The Samoa DTA establishes a “mutual agreement procedure” for resolving disputes. Under this procedure, a taxpayer who considers that they have been taxed incorrectly under the treaty, including in transfer pricing cases, can approach their local tax authority under Article 23 to invoke a mutual agreement procedure. If the tax authority considers the case to be justified, and is unable to resolve the case through its own actions, it must approach the tax authority of the other jurisdiction to seek a bilateral resolution. This bipartisan approach is particularly appropriate in the tax treaty context because a single issue will generally affect a person’s tax position in both jurisdictions. The mutual agreement procedure is not a true disputes resolution mechanism, as the two sides are only obliged to “endeavour” to reach resolution. However, the taxpayer remains free to pursue a case through the courts (including if they do not agree with the decision reached under the mutual agreement procedure). 5.13 The mutual agreement procedure also authorises the tax authorities of the two jurisdictions to collectively resolve any difficulties or doubts about the correct interpretation or application of the Samoa DTA. Reservations 5.14 The Samoa DTA does not allow parties to make a reservation upon ratification. 6 Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 6.1 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Samoa DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 provides for the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 14 However, the override relates only to tax matters, and applies only in respect of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. 6.2 The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the core provisions of the Samoa DTA, which may provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act 1982 is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other jurisdiction do not have to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act 1993 is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the treaty. 6.3 Article 26 of the Samoa DTA provides for the agreement to be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Contracting States. The Samoa DTA will enter into force on the date of the last of these notes. New Zealand will be able to notify Samoa that all procedures required by domestic law have been completed once the Order in Council has entered into force, which will be 28 days after its publication in the New Zealand Gazette. 6.4 Thereafter, the provisions of the Samoa DTA will have effect from various dates, according to the terms of the DTA. In New Zealand, the provisions relating to withholding taxes will take effect on the first day of the second month after the date of entry into force. The provisions relating to other taxes will have effect for income years beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the DTA enters into force. 6.5 As an alternative to the above Order in Council mechanism, the Samoa DTA could be given legislative effect by means of the enactment of a dedicated statute. However, this option would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation, and is therefore not preferred. 7 Economic, social, cultural, and environmental costs and effects 7.1 New Zealand and Samoa have a special relationship, as reflected by the 1962 Treaty of Friendship which recognised Samoa’s progression from New Zealand trusteeship to an independent state. The relationship is supported by the large number of New Zealanders with a Samoan background living in New Zealand and the influence that Samoan culture has on New Zealand culture. Signing the Samoa DTA will support the special relationship that the two countries share. 7.2 As noted elsewhere in this National Interest Analysis, the overall economic effects of the Samoa DTA are expected to be favourable to New Zealand. This is because the Samoa DTA can be expected to encourage growth in trade and investment between New Zealand and Samoa. The overall economic benefits of signing the Samoa DTA are expected to outweigh the costs. 8 The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 8.1 DTAs constrain New Zealand from taxing certain income and limit the rate at which tax on dividends, royalties and interest can be imposed, and therefore typically can be expected, prima facie, to result in some reduction of New Zealand tax. AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 15 8.2 This potential upfront revenue cost is typically offset by other factors. For example, there will be an offsetting effect to the New Zealand tax base from the reduction of tax in the other country, and the reduced need for New Zealand to allow foreign tax credits. There will also be some revenue gains from the expected reduction in tax evasion and tax avoidance resulting from the DTA exchange of information provisions. 8.3 Data limitations prevent officials from accurately estimating the actual revenue cost of the Samoa DTA. However, due to the limited existing trade and investment flows between Samoa and New Zealand, any reduction of New Zealand tax is expected to be negligible. 8.4 The tax sparing provisions of the DTA are not expected to give rise to specific costs. The provisions will apply only in circumstances agreed to between the two Governments in an exchange of letters. Furthermore, the provisions will terminate after a 10-year period. 8.5 In general, as discussed above, DTAs are also expected to give rise to favourable economic benefits, such as increased cross-border services, trade and investment. Again, officials cannot quantify the economic benefits of the Samoa DTA but, overall, the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. 8.6 Compliance with the exchange of information provisions of the Samoa DTA will result in some administrative costs for Inland Revenue, arising from the need to respond to requests for information from Samoa. However, as noted above, a TIEA is already in place between New Zealand and Samoa. Although the exchange of information provisions in the Samoa DTA are of broader effect, the costs of complying with the exchange of information mechanism in the Samoa DTA are likely to be substantially equivalent to those that would be borne under the existing TIEA. Based on previous experience, the numbers of requests are not expected to be significant. If requests are received, Inland Revenue already has efficient systems in place for administering the exchange of information provisions of New Zealand’s other DTAs and TIEAs. 8.7 Compliance costs for New Zealand businesses are expected to be reduced under the Samoa DTA. This is because New Zealand businesses will have clear guidance about when they will be liable for tax on activities in Samoa, in line with internationally recognised norms. 9 Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 9.1 The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade were consulted about the content of this extended National Interest Analysis. 10 Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 10.1 The Samoa DTA does not expressly set out the process for amendment of the agreement, and no specific amendments are currently anticipated. However, New Zealand will consider any future amendments on a case-by-case basis. Future amendments will be subject to New Zealand’s normal domestic approvals and procedures for DTAs. AGREEMENT ON DOUBLE TAXATION, EVASION, AND AVOIDANCE: NEW ZEALAND AND SAMOA 16 11 Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 11.1 Under Article 27 of the Samoa DTA, after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force, either party may terminate the agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. Article 27 generally follows the approach used in New Zealand’s other DTAs. 12. Agency Disclosure Statement 12.1 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis (NIA). Inland Revenue has analysed the issue of implementing the new DTA between Samoa and New Zealand, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, Inland Revenue considered the option of not entering into the treaty. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. The policy aligns with the Government Statement on Regulation. 12.2 The allocation of taxing rights under the Samoa DTA is consistent with the New Zealand negotiating model, which in turn is based on the OECD’s Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital. The revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the allocation of taxing rights under the DTA is expected to be negligible. 12.3 The tax sparing provisions agreed with Samoa represents a potential risk. However, the provisions will apply only in circumstances agreed to between the two Governments in an exchange of letters. Moreover, the mechanism will terminate after a ten-year period. Therefore, it is a manageable risk over which New Zealand has some control. 12.4 An Order in Council will be required to give the new DTA effect in New Zealand law. The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is provided for under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the new DTA. 12.5 The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted about the content of this extended NIA. 12.6 Inland Revenue’s view is that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business interests; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles.

rates 160 Cash-out of research and development tax losses 1 2 ELIGIBILITY Clauses 192 and 213 Issue: Qualifying companies should be eligible Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Qualifying companies should not be excluded. Losses from qualifying companies do not flow through to shareholders as they do for look-through companies and limited partnerships. The intent behind their exclusion is not clear. Comment The initiative is targeted at simple companies without complicated structures. The decision to exclude qualifying companies was based on the fact that they have their own regime. Eligible qualifying companies in a current tax loss position may have been in a tax loss position for a number of consecutive years as new companies have not been able to elect into the regime since 2011, while many qualifying companies will have transitioned into the look-through company regime so that losses can continue to flow through to shareholders. Evidence provided by submitters indicates, however, that qualifying companies remain a large group of taxpayers. Based on this feedback, and that qualifying companies no longer have flow- through treatment of losses, officials support including qualifying companies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Excluding companies within a group that includes a foreign company is not appropriate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY) Companies in a group that includes a foreign company should not be excluded. It will prevent companies from expanding offshore, which is common as the domestic market is small. There are a number of reasons why New Zealand companies may set up offshore subsidiaries: • Locally incorporated companies are often preferred by overseas investors and venture capitalists. 3 • Overseas businesses may prefer to enter contracts with companies incorporated in their own jurisdiction. • Attracting overseas clients through sales and marketing subsidiaries. It will also cause a difference in treatment between companies owned by non-resident non- corporate bodies including individuals and partnerships, which are eligible, and non-resident corporate bodies, which are not. Comment The exclusion was intended to prevent subsidiaries of non-resident parent companies from being able to cash out their losses. These subsidiaries were not within the target group of the reform as they were considered to have sufficient funding for their R&D activities. R&D expenditure undertaken overseas is excluded when calculating the amount of the tax credit. This exclusion, in conjunction with the requirement for companies in a group to meet the wage intensity criteria on a group basis, should be sufficient to achieve the policy intent of targeting the relief at R&D performed in New Zealand by New Zealand-based start-ups. We can therefore relax the requirement to exclude companies with a foreign company in the group. The proposed amendment will allow New Zealand-based start-ups with an overseas subsidiary to qualify if they satisfy the eligibility rules. It will continue to prevent New Zealand subsidiaries of non-resident parent companies from accessing the scheme as the group will not be able to satisfy the wage intensity requirement. It will be necessary to change proposed section MX 6(a)(ii) to ensure that establishing an overseas subsidiary does not trigger R&D repayment tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Provide clarity on the exclusion of special corporate entities (and companies majority-owned by a special corporate entity) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY and TaxTeam) The exclusion of special corporate entities (and companies which are indirectly or directly 50 percent or more owned by a special corporate entity) should be reconsidered and/or revised. This could exclude incubator entities in the health and tertiary sector operating on commercial terms. It could also prejudice the ability of R&D companies owned by an incorporated society that does not issue shares to apply for a tax credit. It should also be clarified whether the exclusion of companies 50 percent or more owned by a special corporate entity is also intended to cover a situation where multiple special corporate ent it ies own 50 percent or more of the company when aggregated. 4 Comment The main target of exclusions within the special corporate entities rules is publicly funded entities like public and local authorities, Crown Research Institutes, and state-owned enterprises, as they have access to other types of R&D funding. The exclusion will be refined to exclude only these entities. Companies that are majority-owned by one or more of this group of entities will also be excluded from the initiative. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Look-through companies have not been excluded Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The commentary on the bill states that look-through companies are excluded from the proposals but they are not excluded in proposed section MX 2. Comment Only a “company” is eligible for the tax credit. Look-through companies are not included in the definit ion o f “co mpany” in the Income Tax Act for the purposes of cashing out R&D tax losses. Therefore there is no need to explicitly exclude them in proposed section MX 2. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inclusion of limited partnerships within definition of “group of companies” for R&D tax loss credit purposes Submission (EY) It is not clear how including “limited partnerships” in the definition of “group of companies” for cashing out R&D tax losses purposes will apply without modifying defined terms like “voting interest” and “shareholder decision-making right”, and related provisions for determining groupings of companies. 5 Comment Our concern is that companies could use a structure involving a limited partnership and an R&D subsidiary to avoid the grouping requirement, and access a cashed-out loss they would otherwise not be able to access. The submitter has pointed out that the existing drafting is difficult to apply to partnerships as they use different terms and concepts than companies. We will update the drafting to ensure it achieves the policy intent of grouping associated partners and companies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement that companies must have complied with tax obligations Submission (Independent Advisor to the Select Committee) The proposed eligibility rules require taxpayers (and other companies in the taxpayer’s group) to have complied with all of their tax law obligations. This should be amended to disqualify taxpayers only in cases when the non-compliance has been material. Otherwise, there is a risk that taxpayers could be excluded from applying by, for example, a dispute over an unrelated matter or a delay by Inland Revenue in processing a payment. Comment Officials agree that taxpayers should only be excluded from cashing out R&D tax losses in cases when the non-compliance has been material. However, defining materiality or compiling an exhaustive list of material offences is unlikely to provide the necessary level of certainty, or even be possible. Instead, existing provisions already allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to use certain refundable tax credits to satisfy a tax liability. This tax credit will be included as one of those refundable tax credits. This should be sufficient for the purposes of preventing non-compliant taxpayers from accessing a tax credit with an outstanding tax liability. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 6 WAGE INTENSITY CRITERIA Clauses 192 and 213 Issue: 100 percent of contractor R&D consideration should be included as total R&D labour expenditure Submission (KPMG) Including only 66 percent of contractor R&D costs in the total R&D labour expenditure calculation (used for calculating wage intensity and the amount of the tax credit) should be reconsidered. It is acknowledged that this excludes non-labour and profit amounts from the contract cost, but these costs remain a genuine R&D cost to a business and the total amount should be taken into account in determining whether the proposal applies. Comment The 66 percent amount is intended to cover the wage component of the contracting cost, and provides a simple way of determining this amount. Contracting costs are likely to include a profit margin and, in certain cases, other costs like materials. These costs should not be included in the calculation to determine the R&D wage intensity. The 66 percent amount is very similar to the UK equivalent, which allows 65 percent of contract staff costs as qualifying expenditure for their R&D tax incentives. It is also consistent with the multiplier used when calculating the amount of the tax credit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Work performed for below-market remuneration Submission (Deloitte) The R&D wage intensity calculation may not be representative of the actual R&D intensity of the company when an employee (likely a shareho lder-employee) works for below-market remunerat ion. This will detrimentally affect the level of the company’s R&D wage intensity. This could be remedied by deeming a shareholder-emplo yee’s remuneration at market value for the purpose of calculating R&D wage intensity when the shareholder-employee has a significant ownership interest. 7 Comment The situation described above would enable “sweat equity” to be included in R&D wage intensity calculations. We have excluded this from the wage intensity calculations because no expenditure has been incurred by the company at this point in time. Deeming shareholder-emplo yee’s remuneration at market value would create an opportunity for abuse. Remuneration may be inflated above market value to ensure the wage intensity criteria are met. Even though section GB 25 of the Income Tax Act protects against excessive remuneration to shareholders, directors or relatives in a close company, it is possible that inflation could occur at the margins. It would also require an adjustment to total R&D labour expenditure to remove this deemed market value remuneration when calculating the amount that can be cashed out, as it would not be appropriate to cash out an amount of expenditure that has not been incurred. This would further increase the complexity of the calculation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Calculating total R&D labour expenditure when an employee’s role is only partly dedicated to R&D activities Submission (Deloitte) Some employees will be splitting their time between R&D and non-R&D activities. The process for determining how the amount should be pro-rated has not been outlined by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue should release guidance on the level of evidence they require to substantiate the time spent on carrying out R&D activities. This amount can be pro-rated by basing it on the actual time spent on R&D, or estimating this. Calculating actual time spent on R&D can be complicated, with innovative start-ups unlikely to have sophisticated methods for recording time spent on R&D. In light of this, an estimation method is more appropriate. Comment Inland Revenue will communicate its expectations of taxpayer record-keeping for the purposes of pro-rating labour expenditure between R&D and non-R&D activities. Inland Revenue is committed to lowering compliance costs to the extent this does not create opportunities for gaming or re-characterisation of expenditure. In this case, requiring only estimation can create a risk of non-R&D expenditure being characterised as R&D expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 8 Issue: Clarify meaning of “the part of the income year” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The phrase “or for the part of the income year for which the person exists if that is not the whole income year” in proposed section MX 3(1) should have the words “(the part of the income year)” following it to clarify the use of “the part of the income year” in the definit io ns o f “total R&D labour expenditure” and “total labour expenditure” in that section. Comment Officials agree with this submission, and will make changes to this effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify that the use of “acquiring” does not exclude contractor R&D consideration from being considered R&D material or R&D expenditure Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The definitions of “contractor R&D consideration” and “R&D expenditure” exclude the provision of goods and services to the extent they relate to an activity described in proposed schedule 22 (Proscribed R&D activities). One of the proscribed activities is acquiring intellectual property or know-how. The definit io ns of “intellectual property” and “know-how” are sufficiently broad to make the application of the provisions uncertain. It is difficult to envisage what “R&D material” could be provided by a contractor that is not excluded by schedule 22 due to the use of the word “acquiring”. It should be made clear that the development of new intellectual property or know-how from carrying out R&D is not included within what is meant by “acquiring” for the purposes of the above definitions. Comment “Acquiring” refers to existing intellectual property or know-how already developed. When a company (Company A) provides R&D on behalf of another company (Company B) that Company B will retain the rights over, this should not be considered as acquiring intellectual property or know-how, and is valid R&D expenditure for company B only. On the other hand, if company A carries out R&D and claims the tax credit, and then sells the R&D asset to company B, expenditure incurred by company B on acquiring company A’s existing R&D asset should be excluded from cashing out R&D tax losses. Further guidance on this will be provided. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 9 Issue: Clarify references to “external contractor” in definitions of “R&D expenditure” and “R&D material” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The use of “external contractor” in the definitions of “contractor R&D consideration” in proposed section MX 3 and “R&D material” in section YA 1 could be confusing as they refer to different parties of a respective contract. Comment It should be clarified which party is the contractor company (Company A above) that is doing R&D on behalf of the contracting company (Company B above). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify who the user of R&D material is when providing a service of R&D to a third party Submission (New Zealand Law Society) In the definition of “R&D material”, the user of the R&D in the contracting situation should be clarified. The words “by the recipient or, if the recipient is a member of a group of companies, by a member of the group” after “are used” has been suggested. Comment An addit io n similar to that suggested above would provide further clarity that when a company (Company A) performs R&D on behalf of another company (Company B), that provision of R&D by company A (or provision by another group member) is not considered “R&D material” for Company A for the purposes of cashing out R&D tax losses. Company B can consider this “R&D material” though. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 10 AMOUNT OF THE CASH-OUT Clauses 192 and 213 Issue: The refundable amount should be capped at the lesser of the maximum cap and the tax value of a company’s tax losses Submission (KPMG) Requiring businesses to calculate the various amounts (total dollar threshold cap, total losses of the business, total qualifying R&D expenditure and R&D labour expenditure times a multiplier) on the amount that can be cashed out will disproportionately increase compliance costs. The refundable amount should be capped at the lesser of the total dollar threshold and the tax value of the company’s total tax losses. No other caps are necessary. Comment The initiative is targeted at innovative start-ups, as this is where the existing tax treatment (of carrying forward losses) creates the most serious cashflow constraints and distortions on investment decisions. The two calculations relating to R&D expenditure are necessary to target the initiative and reduce opportunities for gaming. Capping the cash-out at total qualifying R&D expenditure ensures that only losses derived from R&D expenditure can be cashed out. Capping the tax credit at 1.5 times the R&D labour expenditure reduces opportunities for non- R&D expenditure to be characterised as R&D expenditure, a problem identified from the previous R&D tax credit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Change “0.28” to “the company tax rate” for the relevant income year Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) References to “0.28” should instead refer to “the corporate tax rate” that applies to that income year. This would allow the legislation to reflect that the corporate tax rate is subject to change when calculating the amount to be cashed out or calculating repayment tax, for example. Ideally, R&D repayment tax and loss reinstatement deductions should reflect the company tax rate that applied when the tax credits were cashed out. 11 Comment Officials agree with this submission as it will allow changes in the company tax rate to take place without requiring legislative amendment. If the company tax rate does change, R&D repayment tax and loss reinstatement deductions will reflect the new company tax rate. Applying the same tax rate to ordinary business income and repayments of tax credits will reduce overall compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: References to “tax year” should read “income year” Submission (EY) References to “tax year” should refer instead to “income year” as these references do not specify a credit level for those companies with a non-standard balance date. Comment Officials will review the use of “income year” and “tax year” to ensure the above situation does not arise. This will ensure the proposed legislation is effective for taxpayers with non-standard income years. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 12 R&D EXPENDITURE Clauses 213, 217 and schedule 1 Issue: Specific and relevant guidance should be provided on defined terms and excluded activities Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) Inland Revenue should issue specific and relevant guidance on the definition of “research and development”, “excluded activities” and “expenditure” with commercially relevant examples to help minimise compliance costs and provide greater certainty. An example would be clinical trials or software development, for which expenditure goes through a number of stages. Industry-specific guidance would also be useful. Some of the terms in schedule 22 are too broad or open to interpretation. Comment Inland Revenue will publish appropriate guidance on its website soon after the legislation is enacted. Special attention will be paid to clinical trials and software development because these are areas where it is more difficult to determine when the activity ceases to be R&D. Inland Revenue will have access to expertise from Callaghan Innovation to advise on the eligibility of R&D activities. This service should enable R&D performers to discuss their R&D activities with experts. The exclusions listed in schedule 22 are similar to the exclusions used for Callaghan Innovation’s business R&D grants and Statistics New Zealand / OECD guidance on how to measure R&D for statistical purposes (the Frascati Manual). For this reason many R&D performers will already be familiar with these exclusions, which should reduce overall compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 13 Issue: Certain expenditure undertaken overseas should not be excluded Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) It may not be appropriate to exclude all R&D expenditure undertaken overseas. Some testing is integral to the product’s development. For example, products that require approval by the US Food and Drug Administration must be tested and approved in the US. Research on product packaging may also be required to be undertaken in the target overseas country itself because of legislative requirements. This could be done by exempting expenditure that is integral to product development. Comment The measure is targeted at R&D performed in New Zealand as this R&D is likely to generate higher benefits for the New Zealand economy than R&D conducted offshore. It is simpler to maintain an exclusion for overseas expenditure than create an exemption to the exclusion when the expenditure is integral to product development. Some of this expenditure may also be excluded by another item; item 11, for example, excludes expenditure on activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Finance leases should not be excluded from the definition of “R&D expenditure” Submission (Deloitte) Taxpayers who enter into operating leases will have an advantage over taxpayers who enter into finance leases. This difference should be removed so that all leases are treated equally as R&D expenditure. Comment Finance leases more closely resemble debt instruments, such as a loan, than an ordinary lease. The proposed rules do not allow interest deductions to be cashed out as these are funding costs, rather than R&D costs. This includes the interest component of finance leases. The tax treatment is therefore the same regardless of whether a finance or operating lease is used. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: The definition of “R&D expenditure” should include capitalised expenditure Submission (KPMG) Eligible “R&D expenditure”, as defined in section YA 1, excludes expenditure for which no deduction is available. This means that any “R&D expenditure” must be directly deductible. Capital expenditure will be excluded despite the company incurring real costs – for example, salary and wage expenditure. The intent behind this exclusion of capital expenditure should be clarified. Comment The intention is to cash out R&D tax losses that arise from expenditure on R&D. Capital expenditure does not generate losses, and therefore is excluded from the definition of “R&D expenditure”. This ensures that the amount calculated for the cash-out using “R&D expenditure” in proposed section MX 4(1)(h) does not include capital expenditure. To clarify a further issue, it is possible that “total R&D labour expenditure”, used to calculate the tax credit amount in proposed section MX 4(1)(i), could include capital expenditure. 1 If this occurs, we expect that the amount calculated in section MX 4(1)(h) based on “R&D expenditure”, which does not include capital expenditure, will be lower than the amount calculated in section MX 4(1)(i). Consequently, it is unlikely capital expenditure will not contribute to the tax credit. We do not wish to add further complexity to the definition of “total R&D labour expenditure” by requiring taxpayers to remove capital expenditure from the eligibility calculation when calculating the tax credit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interactions with section EJ 23 (Deferred deductions arising from expenditure on R&D) Submission (Deloitte) Section EJ 23 allows taxpayers to defer deductions until the taxpayer derives taxable income from the corresponding R&D. It is possible that the drafting of this section and the “R&D expenditure” definition could enable this deferred expenditure to be cashed out in an inco me year after the expenditure was incurred. 1 This will likely take place when the asset recognition criteria in the relevant accounting standard (NZIAS 38) is met for the R&D asset. 15 Comment This is not the policy intent. Only R&D expenditure incurred in that income year should be eligible for a tax credit. Officials will make the necessary changes to ensure that this situation cannot arise. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: References to disestablished business R&D grants Submission (EY) Section CX 47(4) references to “technology development grant” and “technology transfer voucher” should be removed or replaced by more appropriate descriptions of the current grants. These grants have special tax treatment because of a timing issue where the grant is derived in a later income year than that in which the related expenditure is incurred, and a deduction is denied by section DF 1 (this matches the treatment of government grants as excluded income). This situation could arise in any situation, not just for business R&D. Consequently, references to the superseded grants should be removed. If it must be retained, the terminology should be updated to reflect the current grants that the section should apply to. Comment The reference to this section will be removed from the definition of “R&D expenditure”. The taxpayer’s treatment of the government grant as either “excluded income” under section CX 47 or “inco me” will provide the correct result for the purposes of the R&D tax loss credit. Officials will look to update section CX 47(4) when possible. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 16 REINSTATEMENT OF LOSSES Clauses 99, 117, 192, 194, 195 and 213 Issue: Cashed-out loss should only be repaid to the extent a profit is made on the deemed sale of R&D assets when a loss of eligibility or liquidation occurs Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The calculation of R&D repayment tax proposed to apply in cases of loss of eligibility and liquidation should be amended so that it is the lesser of the tax credits received minus income tax paid and earlier payments of R&D repayment tax, and the profit on the deemed sale at market value of the intellectual property. Comment This measure is to protect the integrity of the new rules by ensuring that companies cannot liquidate or migrate to an overseas jurisdiction without paying back the tax credit balance. As either event will likely mean the entity will no longer have tax liabilities in New Zealand, it is appropriate to require the tax credit balance to be repaid. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: R&D repayment tax should not exceed the market value of the shares sold Submission (Matter raised by officials) The calculation of R&D repayment tax proposed to apply upon the sale of more than 90 percent of the company as set out in proposed section MX 6(4) should be amended so that it is the lesser of the tax credits received minus income tax paid and earlier payments of R&D repayment tax, and the market value of the sale of the shares in the company. Comment This change ensures that taxpayers who sell the company for less than the tax credit balance are not liable to pay back the ent ire amount, as they are unlikely to be in a position to do so. If the tax credit balance is not fully paid off, it will remain attached to the company. The new shareholders will remain liable to repay this amount. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 Issue: Imposing repayment tax on liquidation of the company may not be appropriate in all cases Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Imposing R&D repayment tax in all cases of liquidation may not be appropriate. A company which fails and liquidates its assets may have no value, meaning that the R&D repayment tax is unlikely to be recoverable. When companies are liquidated because they cannot meet their debts and continue trading, the proposed R&D repayment tax will increase the amount of outstanding debt. It is assumed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would rank with other unsecured creditors in respect of R&D repayment tax debt claim, but this should be clarified. Comment We have anticipated that a number of R&D companies will be liquidated because they cannot meet their debts. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be an unsecured creditor. The unrecoverable nature of much of this debt is included in the estimated fiscal cost of the policy. However, requiring R&D repayment tax on liquidation remains an important integrity measure because companies may liquidate for other reasons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amalgamating companies should not impose repayment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY) A company that has cashed out losses previously should not be required to repay them because it has amalgamated with another company (especially when the company continues as the amalgamated company). The company may be constrained by the same cashflow constraints and market failures before amalgamation. One submitter proposed allowing amalgamations between related parties or at least within a wholly owned group of companies. Others proposed allowing amalgamations between all companies. Comment An amalgamation would trigger R&D repayment tax as this is an event that would otherwise transfer repayment obligations from the amalgamating company(ies) to the amalgamated company, creating a risk of greater non-compliance. As noted above, amalgamation does not necessarily reduce cashflow constraints and market failures faced by the company. 18 We are prepared to relax this requirement to allow amalgamations to proceed without requiring the tax credit balance to be repaid. The amalgamated company will take on any liability to pay R&D repayment tax of the amalgamating companies. Any deemed disposals of property owned by the amalgamating companies that occur when an amalgamation takes place should not apply for the purposes of subpart MX, so as not to trigger R&D repayment tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify when a company is an “amalgamating company” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Amalgamations can take some time to complete, and may cover multiple income years. It should be clarified when the company is an “amalgamating company”. Comment Officials recommend removing the requirement to pay R&D repayment tax when a company amalgamates. There is no need to clarify this issue further. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repayment should not take place when the business continues after the R&D asset is sold (disposed of) Submission (KPMG) When the business continues after the R&D asset is sold, the R&D repayment tax rule should not apply. Comment It would be too difficult for Inland Revenue to ensure taxpayers continued to meet a business continuity test. There are also questions surrounding its design. For example, how long would the business have to continue for? 19 Requiring the tax credit balance to be repaid on disposal of an R&D asset fits with the policy intent as these taxpayers are in a position to repay the amount when a return on the investment has been made. It is also an important integrity measure. We note that taxpayers are not required to pay back the full tax credit balance when an asset is sold; they are only required to pay back the market value of the asset (if this is less than the tax credit balance). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Loss repayment penalises successful companies Submission (PwC) While appreciating that the aim of the initiative is to be as fiscally neutral as possible, requiring the tax credit balance to be repaid by successful companies will penalise the small group of successful companies. They will still be in a high-growth mode and require cash to grow further. This requirement does not align with R&D schemes in similar jurisdictions such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Comment The initiative intends to provide a timing benefit to the company with regard to the use of its tax losses, where the Government assumes the risk of an amount of those tax losses (arising from R&D expenditure) instead of the company. It is not an R&D subsidy like those in Australia or the UK, hence the requirement to return the cashed-out loss amount when a company is in a position to do so after making a return on its investment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: It is not clear what the R&D repayment tax obligations are for a company that elects to become a look-through company Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section MX 6(1), which details when taxpayers will be liable to pay R&D repayment tax, does not address the consequences of a taxpayer becoming a look-through company. 20 Comment Look-through companies (LTCs) are not considered a “company” for the purposes of the tax credit. This means that the entity will fail to meet the eligibility requirement in section MX 2(a) and will therefore be required to pay R&D repayment tax. This will make transitioning to an LTC unattractive for companies that have accessed a cashed-out loss. However, losses carried forward by a company before becoming a look-through company are extinguished also. As we expect these companies to also have losses carried forward because not all losses can be cashed out, it is unlikely these companies would elect into the LTC rules anyway. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Imposing repayment tax on the sale of an R&D asset developed before the 2015–16 income year is not appropriate Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The commentary on the bill states that the tax credit balance should be repaid when the company makes a return on their investment. This seems to presuppose that the intangible asset sold was created by R&D expenditure for which a cashed-out loss was received. It is possible that the intangible sold was the product of R&D done before the 2015–16 tax year. In this situation, it is not appropriate that the cashed-out loss amount is repaid. Comment It is not practical to allocate the credit to a particular R&D activity. For example, a tax credit may be allocated to a newer project but it will permit the business to spend more of its own money on an older project. When the business makes a return on its investment, it is in a position to repay the tax credit balance, even if that R&D was not directly funded by the tax credit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 Issue: Inconsistency between use of the term “intangibles’ market value” for cashing out R&D tax losses and black hole expenditure Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The term “intangibles’ market value” is used (and defined) in determining the amount to be repaid when a company sells an R&D asset. There is an inconsistency between this approach and the “consideration” approach in proposed section CG 7C upon the disposal of a depreciable intangible asset that has been written off. Comment Valuing the asset through a market value measure ensures that if the asset is disposed of for less than its market value – for example, in a transaction between associated parties, the amount of R&D repayment tax is not reduced. The consideration approach used in proposed section CG 7C is to provide consistency with similar sections, such as section CG 7B. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Repayment could be triggered by death or relationship property transfers Submission (EY) It is not clear how existing provisions governing property transfers arising from matrimonial relationship changes or death would apply. These could affect SMEs particularly by requiring payment of the R&D repayment tax through an effective sale of the company when no return has been made. Relationships between business investors and family groups can also break down, which could also require repayment. These changes are not likely to affect the company’s activities or ability to raise funds, and should not require repayment. These issues could be addressed by excluding associated person ownership changes, possibly limited to closely held company situations, from being counted towards or resulting in loss reinstatement. Comment Changes will be made to prevent repayment obligations arising when a relationship property transfer or death would otherwise require payment of the R&D repayment tax. We do not propose excluding the situation when a relationship breakdown takes place between business investors as there are no precedents within the Act for relieving tax obligations in these cases. 22 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Clarify amount of repayment required when intellectual property is disposed of Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The policy intent of proposed section MX 6(1)(a)(i) is unclear and the subsection needs to be redrafted to make it clear how much intangible property, core technology, intellectual property or know-how a company needs to dispose of before it must repay its cashed-out losses. Current drafting suggests that if a company were to dispose of any R&D assets the tax credit balance must be repaid, even if this is a very small amount. This seems neither sensible nor equitable. Comment When a small amount of any R&D assets is so ld, this will not require repayment of the ent ire amount of the cashed-out loss. Twenty-eight percent (or the company tax rate fraction) of the market value of the asset that has been disposed of will be paid as R&D repayment tax if this amount is less than their tax credit balance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Change “before and including” to “up to and including” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) “Before or including” is used in section MX 6(2)(a)(i) and (ii). It is not used elsewhere in the Income Tax Act with a similar effect. It should be changed to “up to and including”. Comment Officials agree that changes to this effect should be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 23 Issue: Clarify when a company is “put into liquidation” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Liquidation is a process that can take some time to complete. It should be clarified when liquidation takes place. Comment Officials agree that more clarity should be provided. Liquidation, for the purposes of part MX, takes place on the appointment of a liquidator. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify treatment of the loss reinstatement deduction under proposed section DV 26 Submission (Deloitte, EY) The loss reinstatement deduction should be redrafted as a stand-alone provision. The existing drafting which refers to other sections creates uncertainty and circularity. Comment The submitters have suggested a much simpler and more practical way to draft the provision. It would be sensible to allocate the deduction to the income year in which the R&D repayment tax is repaid. This would prevent circularity where the loss reinstatement deduction could reduce the liability arising from the R&D repayment tax, and provide a more certain approach for taxpayers to take. Accordingly, the incorporation of section EJ 23 will be removed. Losses arising under this section will be forfeited if shareholder continuity is breached but it prevents having to substantively redraft section EJ 23 to fit the circumstances of loss reinstatement. It is also possible R&D repayment tax may arise because a 90 percent or greater change in shareholder continuity has occurred; in this case, the deduction will arise after the shareholder continuity breach has taken place so will not be forfeited under the existing shareholder continuity rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 24 Issue: What amounts should be treated as “income tax paid” Submission (EY) The meaning of the term “income tax paid” requires clarification. Should the focus be on payments of income tax made or the annual income tax impost for each income year in the relevant period? How should tax paid, transferred or purchased through the pooling system be treated? “Paid” suggests the amount is limited to amounts of tax payments paid or credited. If this is the case, it should be clarified whether this includes payments or deductions on account: for example, by way of provisional tax instalments or source deductions such as resident withholding tax on interest. Amounts paid or transferred through the tax pooling system should also be clarified. “Income tax” refers to the income tax imposed for income years comprising the relevant period. Some of these amounts may not be due until after the time of calculation of R&D repayment tax. Should any tax credits be taken into account for section MX 6 purposes? Calculations of income tax take place without deducting any tax credits arising, for example, by way of foreign tax credits or imputation credits attached to dividends received. Comment Officials will make the necessary changes to ensure it is the annual income tax impost for the relevant period. This will enable taxpayers to reduce their current balance of R&D tax loss credits by any tax paid, or due to be paid, before calculating the R&D repayment tax amount. Foreign tax credits will be excluded as they do not generate an imputation tax credit but other tax credits that give rise to an imputation credit will be included in the calculation. As this information also has to be collected for imputation purposes, this approach is practical . 2 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Imputation debit adjustment Submission (Matter raised by officials) As worded, proposed section OB 47B only creates an imputation debit in years in which a company has a tax credit. It should instead apply to all periods for a company that has had a tax credit in the current year or previous years. 2 No credit balance will arise in the imputation credit account of a company that has a tax credit balance remaining until that company has repaid the tax credit balance in full. This is to maintain neutrality with taxpayers who are not able to cash out losses. 25 Comment This should be corrected so that companies do not have a credit balance in their imputation credit account until they have repaid their tax credit balance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 26 ADMINISTRATION Clauses 180, 181, 187, 230 and 238 Issue: Information sharing with Callaghan Innovation and MBIE Submission (Matter raised by officials) Inland Revenue proposes sharing taxpayer information under a specific exception in section 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the purposes of: • referring difficult or marginal decisions on the R&D eligibility of applicants to Callaghan Innovation for advice; • making use of an existing ICT system owned by MBIE to implement and administer the initiative (rather than develop or adapt an Inland Revenue system); and • enabling Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) policy officials to have access to taxpayer information for policy research, development and evaluation purposes. Comment The information sharing proposed is of a limited nature and involves only the sharing of company information rather than individual data. This work is a joint initiative between Inland Revenue and MBIE; joint initiatives involving Inland Revenue require transparent information- sharing provisions because of the strict taxpayer secrecy rules in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposed information-sharing makes use of existing skills and IT infrastructure within Callaghan Innovation and MBIE respectively. Inland Revenue will use Callaghan Innovation expertise to help build capability to assess R&D expenditure and eligibility. Part of this arrangement includes being able to refer particularly difficult or marginal applications to the Callaghan Innovation Grants group to provide support for Inland Revenue’s decisio n-making on R&D eligibility. MBIE owns the ICT system that administers the business R&D grants programme. Inland Revenue’s ICT systems are highly constrained, and making use of MBIE’s existing system is efficient from a customer and cross-agency perspective. This initiative is the joint responsibility of Inland Revenue and MBIE. It is reasonable for policy officials from MBIE to have access to taxpayer information for policy research, development and evaluation purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 27 Issue: Statements accompanying the income tax return should be filed with the income tax return Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section 70C(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires taxpayers to file their statement detailing the tax credit amount they are claiming and any R&D repayment tax (R&D statement) they must pay within 14 days after filing their return of income. Inland Revenue proposes removing this 14-day period. Instead, it will require taxpayers to file the R&D statement at the same time they file their return of income. This change is recommended after consultation with operational areas of Inland Revenue. Comment Removing the 14-day period would prevent the creation of a new due date, while the taxpayer should already have all the relevant information necessary at the time they file a return of inco me. Having two different due dates increases the risk of the taxpayer neglecting to file the required informat ion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Required statements on R&D information should be simple Submission (Deloitte) Under the previous R&D tax credit regime, statements detailing R&D activities could exceed 20 pages, a significant compliance cost to taxpayers. It was possible that the compliance costs of preparing the information could outweigh the benefit of the tax credit. Consequently, the statements required should be as simple as possible. Statements exceeding four pages would impose significant compliance costs that could outweigh the benefits. Comment Officials agree that the statements should be kept as simple as possible and taxpayers will be encouraged to be concise. However, the benefits are significant, with tax credits of up to $140,000 in the first year rising to $560,000 in five years, and ultimately the onus rests on taxpayers to demonstrate that their activity is eligible R&D. We would expect the compliance costs to reduce in subsequent years as taxpayers become more familiar with the statements, especially for taxpayers who cash out losses over a number of years. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 28 Issue: Taxpayers should be able to manually file a separate statement with an income tax return Submission (Deloitte) In practice there are a number of other forms or elections that are required to be filed with an income tax return. It would be appropriate to allow taxpayers to manually file a statement for tax credit and R&D repayment tax purposes with their manually filed income tax return as an appropriate alternative to electronic filing. Comment Inland Revenue accepts that taxpayers may have important reasons for filing an income tax return manually, and that requiring taxpayers to file electronically may inconvenience some taxpayers. Manually filed returns of income will be permitted. The requirement to file the accompanying statement for tax credit and R&D repayment purposes by electronic means will remain in order to employ existing ICT infrastructure owned by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment in the administration of the initiative. Taxpayers will be permitted to manually file the accompanying statement in exceptional circumstances at the Commissioner’s discretion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Delays in releasing cash-outs should be mitigated Submission (KPMG) Administration of the regime should reflect the fact that a key objective is to ease cashflo w constraints on innovative start-ups. Delays in processing and releasing the tax credit should be mitigated wherever possible. Administration of the proposal should not be based on the previous R&D tax credit regime. Comment Inland Revenue will endeavour to release tax credits as quickly as possible while taking the necessary steps to ensure the taxpayer meets the criteria for the tax credit. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 29 Issue: A communications strategy to educate taxpayers is necessary Submission (PwC) It is important that taxpayers are sufficiently educated in order to be able to apply the rules and provide the necessary information required. They will be reliant on guidance provided by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue should put in communication strategies to ensure taxpayers are adequately equipped to apply the new rules. Comment Inland Revenue is preparing a communication strategy as part of the initiative’s implementation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Uncertainty around the administration process in the first year – extension of time to file Submission (Matter raised by officials and the Independent Advisor to the Select Committee) The retrospective application of this proposed legislation will make it more difficult for taxpayers to comply in the first year of the policy compared with other years. The administration process cannot be established and communicated with certainty until the proposed legislation is enacted. Comment In recognition of this, the Commissioner will allow taxpayers without tax agents to extend the time to file their return (and accompanying statement) for the 2015–16 income year until 31 March 2017. This will allow taxpayers further time to prepare their return if required. Taxpayers must still apply to the Commissioner for this extension of time. After discussing this issue with the Select Committee’s independent advisor, an extension of time to file will be granted when taxpayers have reasonable grounds to believe that an application for the tax credit will be made. Taxpayers will still be able to apply for extensions of time to file after the 2015–16 income year, but intention to apply for the tax credit will no longer be sufficient to obtain the extension of time to file. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 30 Issue: Better communicating other types of government R&D assistance Submission (KPMG) The 20 percent R&D wage intensity test means the proposal will be of limited value to most medium and large businesses. However they may qualify for other assistance. Much of this is outside the tax system. There is a role for the Government and its agencies in better communicating and socialising the available R&D assistance with the business community and advisors. Comment The Government has a broad suite of measures to support business innovation and R&D. Most of these programmes are delivered by Callaghan Innovation and are outlined on their website, and are promoted through publications such as their Accelerate newsletter, the Business Growth Agenda publications the National Statement of Science Investments and media articles. A summary of some of the main programmes is provided below. Callaghan Innovation’s R&D Grants Programme provides three different types of grants which are designed to increase the amount of private sector R&D activity occurring in New Zealand, and incentivise New Zealand companies to spend more on R&D. The three types of grants are: R&D Growth Grants (about $122m per year): • provide a long-term and certain incentive for larger R&D performers to expand their R&D programmes; • the public co-funding rate is 20 percent of the New Zealand company’s qualifying R&D, capped at $5m per year. R&D Project Grants (about $36m per year): • targeted at firms with smaller R&D programmes and those that are new to R&D; • are allocated for specific R&D projects which are beyond the firm’s normal R&D programme; • fund up to 40 percent of the research project. R&D Student Grants (about $4m per year): • provide opportunities for students and recent graduates to work within R&D active firms. R&D Growth Grants are non-discretionary and are automatically allocated to business applicants that meet the published criteria. These include the requirement to spend at least $300,000 annually and 1.5 percent of revenue on R&D in New Zealand for at least two years. R&D Project Grants and R&D Student Grants are awarded to applicants following an independent assessment from Callaghan Innovation’s Grants Committee. 31 All companies receiving R&D grant funding must conduct their research in New Zealand. Claw-back provisions can require firms to pay back their grants if they cease to meet their research commitments. Callaghan Innovation also backs innovative start-ups by providing funding for company accelerator and incubator programmes: • There are five founder-focused incubators spread across the country that work with entrepreneurs to develop their business ideas. • These were recently joined by three technology-focused incubators. These incubators identify a suitable intellectual property-based idea or technology and then work to build a business team around the IP. Repayable grants of up to $450,000 are available for businesses that are incubated by a technology incubator. • The accelerator programme run by Lightning Lab works with digital and ICT entrepreneurs to develop their ideas over 12 weeks into an investment pitch. Other key parts of Callaghan Innovation’s work are linking businesses with public and private- sector research experts (through National Technology Networks, Global Expert and Student R&D Grants) and providing specialist research and technical services to firms. The Ministry for Primary industries provides funding of around $65 million a year for Primary Growth Partnerships to drive substantial economic growth in the primary and food sectors, through joint investment by government and the industry. These partnerships require at least 50 percent industry co-funding and are aimed at market-driven innovations, including R&D, and encourage collaboration and connections between research organisations and business. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Self-assessment Submission (PwC) Will the application of the rules be based fully on self-assessment? Comment To a significant extent, yes. Inland Revenue is likely to pay particular attention to the R&D activity or activities of the taxpayer in order to support compliance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 32 Issue: Pre-approval process relating to R&D eligibility Submission (PwC) Will there be an initial approval process or “certification” as an R&D company? Comment Taxpayers will be required to register for the initiative but no pre-approval of the taxpayer’s R&D activity will take place. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: To what degree will Inland Revenue officials have the capability to make informed decisions on R&D eligibility? Submission (PwC) To what degree will Inland Revenue officials have the capability to make informed decisions on R&D eligibility? Comment Callaghan Innovation has agreed to provide investment managers to support Inland Revenue officials with making judgements on R&D eligibility in the early years of the tax credit while Inland Revenue develops capability in this area. Callaghan Innovation investment managers have experience in adjudicating on R&D eligibility for the Government’s Business R&D grants programme. This will enable consistent decision-making across government in relation to R&D eligibility. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 33 UNINTENDED DRAFTING ERRORS Submission (Matter raised by officials) There are two unintended errors in the drafting. These are: • proposed section MX 1(e) reads “the person has R&D expenditure relating to research or development”, which should read “the person has R&D expenditure”; and • the proposed definition of “intellectual property” in section YA 1 mentions “Part 11” rather than “Part II”. Comment These should be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 34 Black hole expenditure 35 36 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE ON DERECOGNISED NON-DEPRECIABLE ASSETS Clause 85 Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC) Five submitters expressed their general support for the proposals. We welcome the extension of the scope of the proposals from the original proposals consulted on in a Government discussion document, such that it is now proposed to allow tax deductibility for both successful and unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure towards intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax purposes (that is, not listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007). This extension of the scope of the proposed reforms should further assist in reducing distortions against investment in R&D caused by the current rules. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We are pleased that officials have acted on submissions made in response to the original proposals consulted on. (PwC) Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Deductibility of impaired capitalised development costs Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) It needs to be made clear that, when an asset has been impaired for accounting purposes and its carrying value is reduced by that impairment, the amount available to be deducted for inco me tax purposes upon derecognition of the asset for accounting purposes is the capitalised amount and not the book value of the asset net of impairments. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Deductions should also be allowed for impairment expenses, preferably in the years they occur for financial reporting purposes or, alternatively, a deduction should be allowed for any such amounts in the year of final derecognition or write off (other than on disposal). ( EY) 37 Comment The policy intent is that upon derecognition (other than on disposal) of an intangible asset for accounting purposes, the amount that the taxpayer may deduct is the full amount of capitalised development expenditure they incurred, and not merely the book value of the asset net of impairments. It is officials’ view that, as drafted, the proposed legislation achieves the policy intent. Existing section DB 34(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows a taxpayer a deduction for expenditure they incur on research or development, if various circumstances described in any of subsections (2) to (5) are applicable to the taxpayer, and provided that the expenditure is not excluded by subsection (6). As a “trigger” for a deduction under proposed new section DB 34(3), the proposed legislation refers to derecognition (using the terminology of the new reporting standard) or write off (using the terminology of the old reporting standard) of an intangible asset for financial reporting purposes. The amount available to be deducted under proposed new section DB 34(3) is further qualified to expenditure incurred on or after 7 November 2013 and before the occurrence of the “trigger” event. Aside from this qualification on when the expenditure must have been incurred, proposed new section DB 34(3) does not impose any restriction on the amount of expenditure able to be deducted under it. Therefore, the full amount of expenditure incurred within this time period will be able to be deducted under proposed new section DB 34(3), provided that section DB 34(1) is satisfied (that is, it is expenditure the taxpayer has incurred on research or development and it is not expenditure that is excluded by section DB 34(6)), and the taxpayer has not already deducted the expenditure (for instance, under section DB 34(2) for research or development expenditure incurred prior to asset recognition for financial reporting purposes). For the purposes of the income tax legislation, it is irrelevant whether an asset has been impaired for financial reporting purposes and its carrying value reduced by that impairment. Therefore, officials do not consider that legislative clarification is required. Officials do not consider that deductions should be allowed for impairment losses in the years that they occur for financial reporting purposes. The income tax legislation has its own tax depreciation framework that is separate from the accounting treatment. Because of the impact on tax revenue raised that tax depreciation deductions can have, officials consider that there is good reason for the tax system to have its own depreciat ion rules, and not merely fo llow the accounting treatment, which may not necessarily approximate true economic depreciation. While officials support the use of derecognition for accounting purposes as the trigger for a tax deduction for capitalised expenditure in the specific instance of R&D-generated non-depreciable intangible assets, allowing tax depreciation to mirror the accounting treatment in the case of these assets would be inconsistent with the tax depreciation treatment of other assets under existing policy settings. Officials do not consider such an inconsistency to be justified. Recommendation That Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand’s submission be declined. That EY’s submission as to their first preference be declined, and their submission as to their second preference be noted, together with officials’ comments. 38 Issue: Clarification of whether expenditure incurred when R&D “work in progress” is purchased is able to be deducted Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) It appears that the amended section DB 34 will apply to unsuccessful R&D that has been acquired from a third party. For example, this can occur when Business A has incurred expenditure developing an intangible asset but ultimately decides that, due to the direction of its business, it does not require that asset. It therefore sells the “work in progress” to Business B, who intends to continue the R&D and complete the asset. However, after some initial work, Business B abandons the project. Alternatively, Business B could complete the asset but later derecognise it for accounting purposes. We would appreciate that officials confirm, in a subsequent commentary, that it is intended that Business B receives a tax deduction for the value of the unsuccessful R&D under the proposed amendment to section DB 34. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) It does not seem clear whether or not proposed new section DB 34(3) would allow a deduction upon derecognition or write off of purchased non-depreciable intangible assets. The posit ion should be clarified, and if the deduction is intended to be limited to expenditure incurred on a taxpayer’s own R&D work, it may be preferable, for instance, to refer to “capitalised development \[or R&D\] expenditure”, rather than to “expenditure... on an intangible asset”. (EY) Comment The policy intent is that only expenditure incurred by a business in carrying out R&D is deductible under proposed new section DB 34(3). It is not intended that expenditure on purchasing non-depreciable intangible assets is deductible to the purchasing business upon derecognition for accounting purposes. In the absence of a capital gains tax applying to the sale of an asset, allowing the purchaser a deduction for the purchase cost upon derecognition of the asset for accounting purposes would be an asymmetrical tax treatment, and would pose a significant risk to the revenue base. It is intended that a purchaser of a non-depreciable intangible asset is able to receive a deduction upon derecognition of the intangible asset for any development expenditure they incurred on further developing the asset after purchasing it. For example, assume Business A has carried out some R&D and recognised an intangible asset for accounting purposes. Assume Business A has incurred $200,000 in capitalised development expenditure further developing the asset subsequent to recognising the asset for accounting purposes. Assume the intangible asset is not depreciable for tax purposes as it is not listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Now assume Business A sells the incomplete intangible asset to Business B (which intends to continue the R&D and complete the asset) for $10 million. Business A has made an untaxed capital gain of $9.8 million. Assume Business B incurs $300,000 in capitalised development expenditure further developing the asset before abandoning the project and derecognising the asset. It is intended that Business B is able to receive a deduction under proposed new section DB 34(3) for the $300,000 they incurred in capitalised development expenditure. It is not intended that Business B is able to receive a deduction for the $10 million cost of purchasing the asset from Business A. 39 Officials’ view is that, as drafted, the proposed legislation is consistent with this policy intent. However, there may be some room to improve drafting clarity, and we will refer it to drafters. Recommendation That Corporate Taxpayer Group’s submission be declined. That EY’s submission be accepted, and that the drafting be revisited with a view to refining it, in accordance with the policy intent. Issue: Legislation should cover taxpayers not required to prepare general purpose financial statements Submission (EY) Many taxpayers are no longer required to prepare formal general purpose financial reports, by virtue of the provisions of the Financial Reporting Act 2013. Technically, neither the old nor the new reporting standards referred to in section DB 34 will apply to them. In principle, these taxpayers should be able to take advantage of the proposed deduction, just as much as those who are preparing formal general purpose financial reports and clearly applying the old or new reporting standards in doing so. It should be clarified that taxpayers who are not required to, and who choose not to, prepare such statements may also claim deductions for capitalised development expenditure when it is written off in so me manner. Comment The new reduced minimum financial reporting requirements under the Tax Administration Act 1994 that apply to many businesses are minimum requirements. Businesses subject to these minimum requirements can choose to comply with a higher level of accounting standard in relation to R&D, so are able to receive the deductions in this way. We note that compliance with a higher level of accounting standard than the new minimum requirements is generally required to receive tax deductibility for any R&D expenditure under the existing section DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007, so this is not exclusive to the proposed allowance of deductibility for capitalised development expenditure under proposed new section DB 34(3). Because the aim of R&D is to create an asset, it is arguable from an economic perspective that all R&D expenditure should be capitalised. However, the tax rules follow the treatment for accounting purposes in allowing immediate deductibility for R&D expenditure up until the point that an intangible asset is recognised under the relevant accounting standard. This is arguably a concessionary tax treatment, but reflects the fact that the success of investment in R&D in resulting in a valuable asset is particularly uncertain, and the perceived desirability of investment in R&D. It would be inappropriate, from an economic perspective, to allow immediate deductibility for R&D expenditure incurred subsequent to the recognition of an intangible asset under the relevant accounting standard because the rules in the accounting standards are conservative about the recognition of an intangible asset and require a high degree of confidence that a valuable asset has been created. 40 Since it is not appropriate for all R&D expenditure to be immediately tax deductible, there should be a certain degree of rigour applied to the question of which R&D expenditure can be immediately deducted and which R&D expenditure should be capitalised. Adherence to the accounting standards referred to in section DB 34 provides a sufficient degree of rigour. Therefore, officials’ view is that taxpayers that wish to receive deductions for R&D expenditure should have to adhere to one of these accounting standards. While this will mean higher compliance costs than businesses will incur under the new minimum requirements, businesses would only incur these additional costs if they considered the benefit to them of the allowance of deductions for R&D expenditure outweighed these compliance costs. It might be argued that businesses applying the new minimum financial reporting requirements should at least be able to receive a deduction for their R&D expenditure if the R&D undertaken is no longer of any value. However, since these businesses would never apply a test for intangible asset derecognition like those that adhere to the higher accounting standards, there would be no means of determining that their expenditure is of no on-going value, such that a tax deduction would, in principle, be warranted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 CLAW-BACK FOR DERECOGNISED NON-DEPRECIABLE ASSETS Clause 73 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) A deduction taken for capitalised development expenditure on a derecognised non-depreciable intangible asset should not be clawed back, as income, if the intangible asset becomes “available for use”. If a company’s auditors have determined that an asset must be written off for financial reporting purposes that should be sufficient and the deduction should not be clawed back if the asset is “available for use”, which is a very subjective test. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Proposed paragraph (b) of new section CG 7C(1) should be deleted. That is, there should be no claw-back where a derecognised non-depreciable intangible asset is subsequently used or becomes available for use. We acknowledge the policy objective of including such claw-back provisions as an integrity measure and the general similarity of the proposed new section CG 7C to the existing section CG 7B, but consider that proposed paragraph (b) of new section CG 7C(1) is expressed too broadly and could render the proposed extended deductibility of R&D expenditure meaningless in some cases. (EY) Comment Upon further consideration, officials agree that clawing back deductions if a derecognised intangible asset subsequently becomes “available for use” may not be workable in the case of intangible assets as, so long as the taxpayer retained relevant records and/or personnel, the asset may be regarded as “available for use”. We accept that an “available for use” test is too subjective for intangible assets. Officials acknowledge EY’s argument that even a claw-back based on subsequent “use” may be problematic because arguably some intangible assets, such as know-how, can never be disposed of or discarded. As the submitter points out, an absence of expected future economic benefits from an asset’s use or disposal (that is, the test for derecognition), may not preclude that know- how from informing subsequent R&D work. The know-how may thus be regarded as continuing to be “used” in any event, arguably meaning that taxpayers could effectively never receive deductions under proposed new section DB 34(3). The claw-back upon subsequent “use” was not intended to apply in such circumstances. Rather, it was intended to apply when a previously derecognised intangible asset becomes substantively useful again. For example, if an intangible asset had been derecognised because it became apparent that the market it was believed existed for the technology developed did not actually exist but then, several years later, the market conditions changed and there was a market for the technology. In these sorts of situations, officials consider that a claw-back is appropriate and an important integrity measure. However, in light of the concerns raised about the “use” test, officials consider that it is preferable that a clearer test is used as a proxy for “use”. Officials consider that reinstatement for financial reporting purposes of the previously derecognised intangible asset would be a more appropriate trigger for a claw-back of a deduction. 42 Recommendation That Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand’s submission be accepted. That EY’s submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments, and that the drafting be amended accordingly. 43 NEW DEPRECIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS Clauses 72, 87, 104, 107, 111 to 116, 213(2), (9), (10) and (12), and 216 Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG) Three submitters expressed their overall support for the proposals to make the following intangible assets depreciable: design registrations, applications for the registration of a design, and copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially. Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Expenditure that is eligible for depreciation Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed reforms should allow for depreciation deductions for all expenditure (to the extent that it is not otherwise deductible) on intangible assets created on or after 7 November 2013, not merely expenditure incurred on these assets on or after 7 November 2013. Comment The date of 7 November 2013 was chosen as the boundary for eligible expenditure for all of the proposed black hole expenditure amendments in the bill that represent policy changes. It was the date of release of the Government discussion document, Black hole R&D expenditure, which contained the Government’s initial proposals for providing tax deductibility for capitalised R&D expenditure and was chosen to avoid creating an undesirable incentive for businesses to defer their spending in anticipation of new tax rules. Allowing deductibility for expenditure incurred before this date would be giving windfall gains to businesses that made an economic decision to incur the expenditure under the expectation that it would not be tax deductible. It would also increase the fiscal cost of the proposed changes. While the discussion document did not specifically propose making three new intangible assets depreciable, the proposed amendments are the result of submitters’ feedback. Therefore, for consistency with the proposed black hole R&D expenditure amendments in the bill, officials consider that the eligibility of expenditure for depreciation as part of the costs of these new depreciable intangible assets should be based on the same boundary date. The proposed 44 addition of these intangible assets to the list of depreciable intangible assets in the Income Tax Act 2007 is not remedial in nature; rather, it represents a change in policy. Officials do not, therefore, consider that allowing additional historical expenditure to be depreciable is justified. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reference to Copyright Act 1994 in relation to the copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially Submission (EY) We appreciate the policy desire to incorporate the criteria and definitions used in section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994 in relation to the copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially, but consider that the straight cross-reference may cause some confusion and uncertainty for users of the income tax legislation. For example, it is not clear when section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994 can be said to apply to a particular copyright. A defined standalone term may be preferable. We assume that the legal life of the copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially is intended to equate to the 25 and 16–year periods running from the times artistic works are applied industrially, as defined in section 75(3) and (4) of the Copyright Act 1994, and should be triggered once any one or more of the paragraph (a) to (c) criteria in section 75(4) are met. In other words, the use of “or” in that provision should not be read as intending the alternatives to be “one only” qualifications for income tax purposes. Some clarification would be desirable. Comment Officials agree that the legislative clarity could be improved and, accordingly, recommend some drafting changes, including deleting the words “to which section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994 applies” and inserting a standalone definition into section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Officials consider that the preferable drafting approach is for this definition to incorporate a cross-reference to section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994. Section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994 contains a definition of “applied industrially”, exclusions of some specific types of artistic work, and time periods, in relation to specific types of artistic work, from industrial application before the special exception from copyright protection applies. The policy intent is that only the copyright in an artistic work that (i) has been “applied industrially” as defined in section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994, and (ii) is not one of the excluded artistic works in section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994, should be depreciable for income tax purposes. Furthermore, it is the policy intent that the legal life over which the copyright is to be depreciated for income tax purposes should reflect the time period, for the specific type of artistic work, running from the time the artistic work is applied industrially until such time as protection against infringement of the copyright in the artistic work is no longer available due to the operation of section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994. Officials consider that including a cross-reference to section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994 is desirable as it ensures that any changes to the relevant parts of that section, which it is the policy intent to mimic for income tax purposes, are incorporated automatically into income tax law. 45 Officials note that the submitter’s assumption that the legal life, for tax depreciation purposes, of the copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially is intended to equate to the 25 or 16–year period (depending on the type of artistic work) running from the time that the artistic work is applied industrially, as defined in section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994, and should commence once any one or more of the paragraph (a) to (c) criteria in section 75(4) of the Copyright Act 1994 are met, is the correct interpretation of the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 46 DEPRECIABLE COSTS OF CERTAIN DEPRECIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS Clauses 105, 106, 109 and 110 Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (KPMG) We support the proposed amendments to include capitalised development expenditure relating to patents, patent applications and plant variety rights as part of the depreciable costs of these assets. Comment Officials note the submitter’s support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Guidance on the meaning of specific words used Submission (PwC) Proposed new section EE 18B of the Income Tax Act 2007 will enable taxpayers who have created an intangible asset that is depreciable for tax purposes to include capitalised expenditure that relates to the asset as part of the depreciable costs of the asset. It would be helpful if officials provided some guidance on the meaning of “gives rise to, supports, or is an item in which the person holds, the amortising item” in proposed new section EE 18B(a). It would also be helpful if the guidance included some examples using some of the types of intangible property listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment These words describe the requisite relationship between an underlying item of (non-depreciable) intangible property and an item of depreciable intangible property for amounts of expenditure incurred by a taxpayer for the underlying item to be included in the depreciable cost base of the item of depreciable intangible property. Officials intend to provide some guidance on what is meant by these words, including examples, in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published following enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 47 OTHER SUBMISSIONS Issue: Further “black hole” expenditure issues Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) While welcoming of the proposals in the bill to address certain types of black hole expenditure, there are still other areas of black hole expenditure that need to be addressed. Consideration should be given to the development of a comprehensive solution to address black hole expenditure, such as a “catch-all ” provision that provides tax deductibility for expenditure that is not otherwise deductible. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) There should be a broader review looking at all areas of black hole expenditure. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials’ approach is to consider black hole expenditure issues on a case-by-case basis. A comprehensive solution to black hole expenditure, such as a catch-all provision, is not currently under consideration. Different black hole expenditure issues will require individual policy solutions to ensure that their tax treatment remains neutral, consistent and fair. Given policy resource and fiscal constraints, policy consideration of further areas of black hole expenditure must be weighed against other Government priorities when setting the tax policy work programme. Officials do not support developing a comprehensive solution to black hole expenditure, such as the Australian approach of allowing all business expenditure that would otherwise be black ho le expenditure to be deducted over five years. Under that approach, deductions would be given for expenditure towards creating assets that would not decline in value over time if they were successful, which would be an inappropriate outcome from an economic perspective. This would artificially incentivise investment in such assets, which would be inconsistent with the goal of encouraging productivity and growth. Furthermore, it would be fiscally expensive, and any time period chosen would be arbitrary. Moreover, Australia has a comprehensive capital gains tax, so providing tax deductibility for capital expenditure leads to fewer fiscal pressures. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 48 Issue: Alternative approaches to the current tax depreciation framework should be explored Submission (KPMG) The proposed allowance of a tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure on a non- depreciable intangible asset when the asset is derecognised allows no deductibility during the life of the asset. This is a consequence of the framework of New Zealand’s tax depreciation rules, which allow depreciation only when an asset can be demonstrated to have a finite economic (or, in the case of intangibles, legal) life. Other countries have different approaches, which could be considered. Comment The policy framework underlying New Zealand’s tax depreciation rules is that tax depreciation should approximate true economic depreciation, so that, as far as possible, tax does not distort investment decisio ns. As a general principle, expenditures that result in an asset of enduring value should not be deducted. The classic example is land. The tax depreciation rules for intangible assets, however, differ in some notable respects from the rules for tangible assets. The first is that intangible assets have to be expressly listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for them to be depreciable. This is because the potentially uncertain form, value and useful lives of intangible assets make the risks of allowing tax depreciation deductions much greater than in the case of tangible assets. Secondly, in the case of intangible assets, the estimated useful life on which depreciation is based is generally the asset’s legal life – for example, 20 years in the case of a patent. Some might argue that the true economic life of a patent is much shorter than 20 years, so a shorter estimated useful life should be used for tax depreciation purposes. However, the issue that arises is determining what an appropriate economic life for patents as an asset class is, given that all patents are different. For example, it may well be that some mechanical patents become obsolete prior to expiry of legal life, while others like pharmaceutical patents may be held for the full legal life. Different classes of mechanical and pharmaceutical patents may also have varying economic lives. Also, the costs of holding a patent are unlikely to be significant (just renewal fees) which may mean that taxpayers are more readily able to “carry” patents, even though they are not being used in the income-earning process (for example, as a defensive ploy to prevent a competitor from extracting rents from a patented technology, product or process). A seven or 10-year economic life, for instance, would therefore be no less arbitrary than the current estimated useful life, which is based on the legal life of a patent. Officials recognise that the legal life of an intangible asset, such as a patent, is unlikely to be an accurate reflection of true economic life in all instances, but then depreciation is not meant to be a perfect reflection of how assets actually depreciate. Rather, it is an approximation and, as with any approximation, there will be some assets in the class that depreciate faster and others that depreciate slower than the average. 49 In the case of an intangible asset, “legal life” is arguably one of the better proxies available as it provides a cap on the life of an asset. Also, when an event occurs that has the effect that the owner of an intangible asset is no longer able, and will never be able, to exercise the rights that constitute or are part of the asset (for example, where a patent lapses because it is not renewed), the tax rules allow the remaining book value to be written off. We therefore do not consider that the general approach of depreciating intangible assets over their legal life should be changed. In the case of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives because there is no legal limit on their lives, allowing a tax deduction before it is clear that the expenditure is of no on-going value would be inappropriate from an economic perspective as the asset may not actually be declining in value over time. Even if the asset was declining in value over time, if its useful life is incapable of being estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty, it would not be possible to determine what the economically appropriate life to be used for depreciation purposes should be. A broad review of New Zealand’s tax depreciation policy settings, involving consideration of approaches in other countries, is not currently under consideration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Unsuccessful software development Submission (Matter raised by officials) A remedial amendment should be made to section DB 40B of the Income Tax Act 2007, to ensure that taxpayers can obtain a deduction for expenditure they incur in unsuccessful software development. Comment The bill contains an amendment in clause 105 that clarifies that capitalised expenditure incurred by a person in the successful development of software for use in their own business is depreciable. The clause achieves this by inserting new section EE 18B into the Income Tax Act 2007. This enables the capitalised costs incurred in developing the software to be included in the depreciable cost of “the copyright in software”, which is already listed as an item of “depreciable intangible property” in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007, rather than making “software” a separate depreciable intangible asset, by adding it to schedule 14. The primary reason for this drafting approach is that it is preferable to have one general provision that includes expenditure incurred on a non-depreciable intangible asset in the depreciable costs of a related depreciable intangible asset. Otherwise, separate legislative amendments would be necessary whenever a legislative interpretation is reached about what the depreciable costs of an item of depreciable intangible property are that is inconsistent with the policy intent. 50 Officials have identified that, as a consequence of this drafting approach, a remedial amendment to the wording of existing section DB 40B of the Income Tax Act 2007, which allows a taxpayer a deduction for expenditure they incurred in the unsuccessful development of software for use in their own business, would be desirable. To obtain a deduction, section DB 40B(1)(b) requires that “the software would have been depreciable property ... if the development had been completed”. Under the drafting approach adopted in the bill, “software”, in its own right, will still not be depreciable property. Therefore, on a literal interpretation, a deduction under section DB 40B could never be obtained because the requirement in section DB 40B(1)(b) could never be met. Therefore, officials recommend that a remedial amendment be made to section DB 40B of the Income Tax Act 2007, to ensure that taxpayers can obtain a deduction for expenditure they incur in unsuccessful software development. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 51 52 Other policy matters 53 54 CALCULATION OF FRINGE BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LOANS Clause 203 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (KPMG, PwC) Two submitters have expressed support for the proposal. Comment The proposed amendment will allow persons in the same group of companies as a person who lends money to the public to use the market interest rate method of calculating the fringe benefit arising fro m an employment-related, low interest loan. Currently, the method is restricted to employers who themselves lend money to the public, as the method requires the employer to assess what the market interest rate would be on a comparable loan to an unrelated third- party borrower. Officials welcome the support for the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Transitional rule Submission (PwC) Proposed section RD 45(4C) should refer to a period ending “with the finish of the” year, rather than “with or after the finish of the” year. Comment Under existing legislation, when an employer chooses to use the market interest rate method, they must use the method for at least the income year following that in which the election was made and the following income year – in other words, for two income years. They must also give advance notice of a change in method at least one year before the start of the income year to which the method is to apply. These minimum periods are intended to deter “flip-flopping” between calculation methods to get the lowest calculation rate. 55 The proposed amendment that allows a wider set of organisations to use the market interest rate method includes transitional provisions modifying both the normal minimum notification period and the minimum application period so that an employer can apply the market interest rate method soon after enactment of the amendment. As this may result in a change of method part- way through an income year, the intention was that the method would then be applied for at least the rest of that income year and the following income year. The submitter argues that, as drafted, proposed new section RD 45(4C) would allow a person to apply the method indefinitely whereas the existing rule entitles a person to use the method for only a two-year period, unless they make a further election. Officials do not agree that the existing rule can only be applied for two years unless a further election is made. Both the current and transitional minimum application periods are intended to allow an employer to apply the elected valuation method for an indefinite period of time, so long as it is at least as long as the specified minimum time period. However, officials acknowledge that the two provisions express this concept differently, which could be confusing. Officials therefore agree that the wording of the proposed transitional rule in section RD 45(4C) should be better aligned with that in the existing minimum application period to make it clearer that both provisions are intended to allow an employer to apply the elected valuation method for an indefinite period of time, so long as it is at least as long as the specified minimum time period. Accordingly, the matter has been referred to drafters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: “Income year” versus “tax year” Submission (PwC) Proposed section RD 45(4C) should refer to “income year” rather than “tax year”. Comment The existing minimum application period is expressed in terms of income years whereas the transitional application period refers to tax years. Given this difference, and the submitter’s previous argument that the application period rule only entitles a person to use the method for a two-year period, the submitter is concerned that the interaction of the two application rules could result in the market valuation method not being able to be applied continuously when a taxpayer has a non-standard balance date. As noted above, the rules are intended to allow an employer to apply the chosen valuation method indefinitely, provided the minimum application period is met. Therefore, there should not be a problem with applying the method continuously. 56 However, when the employer has a non-standard balance date, so their income year does not align with the tax year, the transitional rule will produce a result that is inconsistent with the previously stated intent that the rule should treat the period of application for part of an income year as if it were for a whole income year. Officials therefore agree that references in the proposed section RD 45(4C) to “tax year” should be replaced with “income year”. This will also necessitate a further minor change to address the situation where the first quarter for which the method is used straddles two income years – for example, when the method is first used for the October to December quarter 2015 and the income year ends on 31 October 2015. The matter has been referred to drafters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 57 GST AND BODIES CORPORATE Issue: Support for the proposal Clauses 248 to 254 Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC, Retirement Villages Association) Four submitters expressed their general support for the proposals. We believe this proposal is a sensible solution and will provide bodies corporate with clarity and certainty. We wish to record our thanks to the Minister of Revenue and officials for listening to feedback on earlier proposals and for developing a well thought-out solution. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposed changes introduced in relation to bodies corporate. In particular, excluding from the definition of “body corporate” a body corporate that is part of a retirement village registered under the Retirement Villages Act 2003. (Retirement Villages Association) Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Definition of “body corporate” Clause 249 Submissions (PWC, KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The bodies corporate amendments apply from 1 October 1986, which is necessary to preserve past tax positions taken by bodies corporate. Due to the retrospective nature of the rules, they apply to bodies corporate established under both the Unit Titles Act 1972 and Unit Tit les Act 2010. However, as currently drafted, the rules may not apply to bodies corporate that were established under the Unit Titles Act 1972, after the commencement of the Unit Titles Act 2010. This is because the Unit Titles Act 2010 defines “body corporate” as a body corporate of a unit title development created under section 75 of that Act. A body corporate created under the Unit Titles Act 1972 is not a body corporate created under section 75, as instead it is deemed to be a body corporate by section 219 of the Act. 58 Comment Officials agree with the submissions, and recommend that the rules be amended to ensure that they apply to bodies corporate established under the Unit Titles Act 1972, and that the new definition of body corporate applies only for the purposes of the new rules. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Definition of “funds” Clause 250 Submission (PWC, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) If a body corporate decides to register for GST, or is required to do so, proposed section 5(8AB) provides that the total value of a body corporate’s funds on the day of registration will be treated as consideration received for the supply of services in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity. A definit io n o f “total funds” for these purposes should be included in the amendments and the definition should be the same as that in the Unit Titles Act 2010. Comment Proposed section 5(8AB) ensures that bodies corporate cannot obtain a tax advantage fro m the ability to choose to register for GST. In the absence of section 5(8AB), a tax advantage could be achieved by a body corporate accumulating untaxed funds while it is not registered and then registering immediately before it spends the funds to claim input tax deductions. There are some risks associated with a narrow definition of “total funds” as a body corporate could re-characterise its funds to avoid the application of GST upon registration. The Unit Titles Act 2010 defines “funds” as “the operating account, the long-term maintenance fund, the optional contingency fund, and the optional capital improvement fund”. This definition is tailored to the purposes of that Act and may not be sufficiently broad to encompass the total funds of the body corporate, which would include all cash and non-cash investments held by the body corporate. Officials recommend that the meaning of “funds” for the purposes of proposed section 5(8AB) should be clarified as including money and investments held by the body corporate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 59 Issue: Income tax treatment of bodies corporate No clause Submission (Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, EY) The income tax treatment of bodies corporate should be clarified by the Commissioner. For example, there is some uncertainty as to how any distributions should be treated in the hands of the unit holders for income tax purposes. Comment The income tax treatment of bodies corporate is an interpretative matter that is outside the scope of the proposals in this bill. Inland Revenue would welcome discussions with bodies corporate about this issue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Guidance on the amount of output tax deemed upon registration Clause 250 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Inland Revenue should provide guidance to make it clear that the effect of proposed section 5(8AB) in treating the total value of the body corporate’s funds as consideration received for services supplied upon registration is that output tax must be paid on 3/23 of those funds, rather than 15 percent. Comment Officials agree that the effect of proposed section 5(8AB) is to treat the total value of a body corporate’s funds on the day it becomes “a registered person” as consideration received, deeming output tax to be paid on the fraction of 3/23 of the funds. This is consistent with the meaning of “consideration” under the GST Act which includes the tax fraction of the value of the supply (see section 10(2) of the GST Act for the meaning of “value of supply”). This information will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin when the new rules are enacted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 60 Issue: The effect of receipt of insurance payments by bodies corporate Clause 253 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Section 5(13) of the GST Act 1985 provides that, where a registered person receives a payment under an insurance contract in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, the payment is deemed to be consideration received for a supply of services performed by that registered person. It should be clarified that receipt of insurance payments by a body corporate would not create a liability to register for GST under section 5(13), either by acknowledging that current law is sufficient to deal with the issue or by an amendment to the current rules as part of this bill. Comment Under the proposed rules, bodies corporate will be required to register for GST if their supplies to third parties exceed the $60,000 registration threshold. The intention is that the receipt of insurance payments by an unregistered body corporate should not in itself create a liability to register for GST. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Remedial amendment to the transitional rules relating to the treatment of dwellings No clause Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 amended the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”. Section 21HB of the GST Act was subsequently inserted as a transitional rule that enables persons affected by the change in these definitions to elect not to treat a supply of accommodation, in certain circumstances, as a taxable supply. The Law Society is concerned that the changes to section 21HB do not achieve their desired effect, because it appears that section 21HB(4) requires that the property was previously treated as a “dwelling” and is now treated as a “commercial dwelling”. However, not all dwellings (for example, a holiday home) affected by the amendment are now treated as “commercial dwellings”. 61 A remedial amendment should be made so that the transitional rule also applies where a property was previously treated as a dwelling and is now no longer treated as a dwelling because of the changes to the definitions, as GST liability can also arise in this situation. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Section 21HB(4) was inserted by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 to allow a person affected by the change in the definitions of “dwelling” the option of not including a commercial dwelling as part of their broader taxable activity. It has since been identified that this transitional rule does not capture situations when a property that was previously treated as a dwelling no longer fits into either the definition of “dwelling” or “commercial dwelling” as a result of these changes. Officials recommend that an amendment should clarify that the transitional rule applies where a person is no longer able to treat a property as a dwelling because of the amendment to the definit ion by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. This amendment should take effect from 1 April 2011, the same date as section 21HB came into effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Adjustments for assets acquired prior to registration Clauses 248 to 254 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 21B of the GST Act should not apply to allow a body corporate that registers for GST to make an adjustment and claim an input tax deduction in relation to goods and services acquired before the body corporate registered for GST. Comment Officials consider that section 21B should not apply to a body corporate that registers for GST, which would otherwise allow them to make an adjustment and claim an input tax deduction in relation to goods and services acquired prior to registration. The policy intent behind the proposed rules is to ensure that bodies corporate are GST-neutral, which is achieved by imposing an output tax liability on the total funds held by the body corporate at the time of registration. This prevents a body corporate from obtaining a tax advantage by accumulating untaxed funds prior to registration, and then registering so that it can claim input tax deductions when the funds are spent. 62 However, a body corporate could achieve the same result by using untaxed funds to acquire goods and services prior to registration, and then making adjustments to deduct amounts in relation to these assets once it is registered. Therefore officials consider that a body corporate that registers for GST should not be able to make an adjustment under section 21B for goods and services acquired prior to registration. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of body corporate Clause 249 Submission (Matter raised by officials) As “body corporate” is used with a different meaning in the existing definitions of “company” and “equit y securit y” in the Act, the proposed definition of “body corporate” should be clarified as applying only for the purpose of the new rules. Comment Officials consider that the new definition of body corporate should apply only for the purpose of the new rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 63 GST RATIO METHOD FOR CALCULATING PROVISIONAL TAX Clauses 200 and 201 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The criteria for using the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax should be relaxed to allow all taxpayers the option to use this method. The operational requirements should be simplified. Comment The remedial amendment is to clarify the circumstances in which a person must stop using the GST ratio method of calculating provisional tax. The submitter is requesting a relaxation of the current policy settings that allow a person to use the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax. Officials note that this submission raises issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 WORKING FOR FAMILIES Clause 188 Issue: Main income equalisation account withdrawals Submissions (Matter raised by officials) The remedial amendment to section MB 1(5D) should be clarified to ensure that when a Working for Families (WFF) recipient’s associated entities draw on funds deposited into their main income equalisation accounts it does not reduce the recipient’s WFF tax credit entit lement, but that withdrawal of interest earned on the accounts should continue to reduce the WFF tax credit entit lement. Comment Section MB 9 in the Income Tax Act 2007 ensures that when WFF recipients or their associated entities (listed in sections MB 4 and MB 7) deposit amounts into the main income equalisation accounts the deposits are added back for the purposes of the calculation of family scheme inco me. This prevents a person or their associated entities from depositing income into main income equalisation accounts in order to artificially deflate the person’s family scheme income, and hence increase their WFF tax credit entit lement. When a person or their entities withdraw the deposits and associated interest earned on those deposits, it is treated as taxable income. Section MB 1(5D) is intended to ensure the WFF recipient’s WFF tax credits entitlement is not reduced a second time when they or their associated ent it ies withdraw the deposits. However, when a WFF recipient or their associated ent it ies wit hdraw the interest that has accrued on deposits in their main income equalisation account, it should be included in family scheme income and reduce the WFF recipient’s WFF tax credits entitlement. An amendment has been made to section MB 1(5D) in the bill that ensures when a person’s associated entities withdraw interest that has accrued on deposits in their main income equalisation account it reduces their WFF tax credits entitlement. However, the current drafting of the part of section MB 1(5D) that ensures a WFF recipient’s WFF tax credits entitlement is not reduced a second time when their associated entities withdraw the deposits is still unclear and should be amended to be clear that withdrawal of a deposit by associated entities is not counted as family scheme income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 65 Issue: Main income equalisation account associated entities attribution rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) A further remedial amendment is proposed to clarify the part of section MB 9 that indicates when a WFF recipient’s associated entities make a deposit into or receive a refund from their main income equalisation account, the WFF recipient’s family scheme income (and therefore WFF tax credits ent it lement) should only change by the proportion of the interest the WFF recipient has in the associated company and trusts. Comment It is intended that when a WFF recipient’s associated company makes a deposit into their main income equalisation account, the WFF recipient’s family scheme income should only increase by the percentage share the WFF recipient has in the associated company using the formula in section MB 4. Similarly, a deposit made by a WFF recipient’s associated trust should reflect the number of settlors and the formula in section MB 7. Likewise, when the WFF recipient’s associated entities draw on these deposits, the WFF recipient’s family scheme income should only decrease by the proportion attributable to the recipient by the associated company and trusts. However, the wording in sections MB 9 and MB 1(5D) that aims to achieve this intent is unclear and it could be read as including the whole amount of the deposit made by the recipient’s entities, not just the proportion attributable to the WFF recipient. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and apply from the beginning of the 2011–12 tax year. 66 CFC and FIF remedials 67 68 CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANY AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND RULES Issue: Attribution of income for personal services Clauses 125 and 166 Submissions (KPMG, PwC) The submitters support the proposal to clarify that either the personal services attribution rules or the controlled foreign company rules can be used if personal services are provided through a foreign co mpany. There should be an appropriate communication strategy on the application of the CFC rules to individual taxpayers in this context and also in a wider context as the taxpayers who are likely to fall within these rules may not always have access to the same level of tax advisors that corporate taxpayers do. (PwC) Comment Officials welcome support for the proposal. The proposal clarifies that a taxpayer who derives inco me fro m providing personal services through an associated foreign company, and who attributes that income under the CFC rules, is exempt from attributing that income under the separate attribution rule for income from personal services (under section GB 29). For example, Dr Paul could provide medical services to his patients, but incorporate a company to be the contractual provider of those services. The company would then employ Dr Paul, who would see the patients and carry out the services. Dr Paul may be required to attribute income derived by the company in relation to his services under the attribution rule in section GB 29. If the company were a CFC and the services were performed in New Zealand, the CFC rules would also attribute the services back to Dr Paul. Under the proposed amendment, Dr Paul would be able to make a one-off election to determine whether he attributes the income earned by the company for his services under the CFC rules or the rule in section GB 29. If Dr Paul would like to attribute under the rule in section GB 29, his one-off election would be in the form of filing an income tax return that includes the amount attributed to him under the rule in section GB 29 after the date of Royal asset of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2015. The practical effect of the proposal is that a taxpayer who derives only personal services income through an associated foreign company can attribute this income either under section GB 29 or under the CFC rules. The rules are duplicated and have the same tax effect for a taxpayer who derives only personal services income from the foreign company, but the CFC rules are generally more complex to apply, as they require attribution of personal services income and other forms of passive income. Officials will work to ensure that the communication strategy is appropriate to inform taxpayers who derive personal services income through a foreign company of their obligations. Recommendation That the submissio ns be noted. 69 Issue: Support for prepaid expenditure proposal Clause 126 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter supports the proposal to apply the prepaid expenditure rules to CFCs, so that deductions for prepaid expenditure would need to be spread over a number of periods. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Prepaid expenditure – correctness vs compliance Clause 126 Submission (KPMG) It should be considered whether the proposed rule, which increases the “correctness” of the amount attributed, is necessary when compared with the costs of complying. Comment Under New Zealand’s domestic tax law, New Zealand taxpayers are able to claim deductions for expenses incurred in generating taxable income. If a taxpayer incurs an expense in one year for something that will last more than one year, adjustments are made so that the deduction is spread over the relevant income years (subject to certain exclusions and exemptions). These rules, known as the prepayment rules, are separate to the depreciation rules, but have a similar function. Officials consider that the application of the prepayment rules to CFCs is necessary to protect the integrity of the CFC rules, and that any additional compliance costs should be relatively minor, particularly as many taxpayers should be familiar with the prepayment rules (as a long- standing part of New Zealand’s domestic tax laws). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 Issue: Anti-avoidance rule for the test-grouping concession Clause 165 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter supports the proposal to introduce an anti-avoidance rule relating to the test- grouping concession. Comment Officials welcome support for the proposed anti-avoidance rule to prevent taxpayers from using the test-grouping rules, which were introduced as a compliance concession, to gain an unintended tax advantage. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Anti-avoidance rule for the test-grouping concession – guidance Clause 165 Submission (KPMG) Guidance should be provided on the criteria that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will apply to the application of the anti-avoidance for the test-grouping concession. The concern is that the “consistency” requirement has been drafted as an anti-avoidance rule to allow the Commissioner to reject a test-grouping election, but there may be legitimate reasons for changing test groups. Comment Officials understand the submitter’s desire for clarity on the operation of the proposed rule, and will provide appropriate guidance when drafting the Tax Information Bulletin item for any changes. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 71 Issue: Support for part-year exemption in Australian FIFs Clause 134 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) Under current rules, a person’s income interest in certain Australian-resident foreign investment funds is exempt from the FIF rules for an income year if the income interest is 10 percent or more at all times in the year (on average). The submitters support the proposal in the bill to instead limit the 10 percent requirement for exemption to the period in the year over which the interest in the FIF is held. Comment Officials welcome support for the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inconsistency in the part-year exemption for Australian FIFs Clause 134 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposal to apply the test for exemption to the period in the year over which the Australian FIF is held gives rise to inconsistencies. The example given is that a taxpayer who holds no income interest in the FIF in the first half of the year, but a 15 percent interest in the second half of the year, would meet the test for exemption, but a taxpayer who holds a 4 percent income interest in the FIF for six months of the year, then increases their holding to 15 percent for the remainder of the year, would not – even though in the second situation, the taxpayer would hold a greater interest in the FIF over the entire period of the year. Further thought should be given to an alternative test – for example, one that focuses on whether the 10 percent threshold was met for a minimum period of time. Comment The current rule provides an exemption from the FIF rules for an income year when a taxpayer holds an income interest of 10 percent or more (a non-portfolio interest) in certain Australian FIFs at all times during the year. In determining whether a person’s income interest in the FIF satisfies the 10 percent threshold, the taxpayer’s interest in the FIF is averaged out across the year irrespective of whether the taxpayer had an interest in the FIF at all times in that year. 72 The proposed change relates to the situation when a taxpayer acquires an interest in an Australian FIF part-way through the year. Depending on the extent of the taxpayer’s income interest in the FIF, they may fail the 10 percent threshold test because they held a zero percent interest for part of the period, even if they satisfy the test in all subsequent years. The proposed change allows the taxpayer to effectively ignore the period in the year when they held no interest in the Australian FIF when undertaking the averaging-out calculation. The averaging-out calculation means that in the example identified by the submitter, the taxpayer would not have the requisite 10 percent holding at all times of the year, as the taxpayer’s holding averages out to 9.5 percent. The concern raised by the submitter is a common feature of threshold tests. However, officials consider that the issue is sufficiently mitigated in most cases by the use of an averaging-out calculation, which allows for fluctuations in shareholdings. Furthermore, officials note that the same averaging-out calculation is used in the CFC rules and certain other rules for non-portfolio interests in FIFs, and consider that the introduction of a minimum-holding period in the threshold test for this provision could introduce further complexity and create an inconsistency in the application of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for indirectly held FIF proposal Clauses 136, 140 and 213 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PwC) The submitters support the proposal to align the treatment of directly held and indirectly held FIFs. Comment Officials welcome submitters’ support for the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 73 Issue: Definition of “indirect attributing interest” Clauses 136, 140 and 213 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) For the purposes of section EX 58, the proposed definition of “indirect attributing interest” does not appear to be correct. The definition is also used for the purposes of section EX 50, where it does make sense. An addit ional definit io n should be drafted for section EX 58. Comment Officials have reviewed the proposed definition for “indirect attributing interest” and agree that the current proposed drafting does not work as intended for the purposes of section EX 58. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the matter referred to drafters. Issue: Disregarding the CFC Clauses 136, 140 and 213 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) To make the provision clearer, section EX 58 should be rewritten to essentially disregard the CFC interest and apply the FIF rules as if the person held the interest in the FIF directly. The proposed rules still apply the calculation rule “to the CFC and the CFC’s interest in the FIF” and only restrict it to the period in which the person held the indirect attributing interest. There may be situations when looking through the CFC gives rise to unintended tax consequences – for example, if an individual owns an interest in a FIF directly, they may be able to use the comparative value method, which is not available if the individual owns the FIF interest via a CFC. Comment Officials consider owning an interest in a FIF via an interposed CFC to be fundamentally different from owning an interest in a FIF directly. As a result, the two situations should be treated differently under the income tax rules. For example, in the case of direct ownership in a FIF, if the FIF makes a distribution to the interest holder, it is made directly to the person – they have little control over when the funds will be repatriated to them. However, where the FIF distribution is made to the CFC, the person is likely to have control over when the FIF funds will be repatriated back to them, because of the control that the person has over the CFC’s affairs. 74 To maintain the distinction between directly held FIF interests, and FIF interests held through CFCs, officials consider that the reference “to the CFC and CFC’s interest in the FIF” to be a necessary feature of the proposed rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Other anomalies relating to indirectly held FIFs No clause Submission (PwC) Further work is required to identify and address other legislative anomalies that exist with respect to indirectly held FIFs. The most common example is the interaction of sections EX 58 and EX 59. The attribution of FIF income is the only taxable income applying to attributable FIF investments, and section EX 59(2) provides for this policy intent for directly held FIFs. However, section EX 59(2) does not adequately deal with indirectly held FIFs. As a result, dividends paid by the CFC in respect of underlying FIF investments will be taxed in the hands of New Zealand-resident shareholders (that are not corporate taxpayers). Corporate taxpayers are not adversely exposed to this issue due to the foreign dividend exemption they enjoy. Therefore, individual and trust taxpayers are liable to a different level of taxation due to the existence of a CFC. The legislation should be amended to ensure that the dividend income of underlying FIFs is included within section EX 59(2). This would align the New Zealand tax treatment of dividends received by directly and indirectly held FIFs. For this to work, a tracking account may be required to record what income has already been returned for New Zealand tax purposes to ensure only the relevant dividends fall within the scope of any section EX 59(2) amendment. Comment While the basis of this submission is slightly different fro m that raised in the previous submission, officials consider the analysis to be relevant in this context. As noted above, officials consider owning an interest in a FIF via an interposed CFC to be fundamentally different from owning an interest in a FIF directly. As a result, the two situations should be treated differently under the income tax rules. An interest holder in a CFC has more influence over that foreign company’s affairs than an interest holder in a FIF would. This additional level of control presumably extends to decisions relating to whether dividends are paid out or not. For example, in the case of direct ownership in a FIF, if the FIF makes a distribution to the interest holder, it is made directly to the person – they have little control over when the funds will be repatriated to them. However, when the FIF distribution is made to the CFC, the person is likely to have control over when the funds will be repatriated back to them because of the control the person has over the CFC’s affairs. 75 As noted by the submitter, section EX 59(2) does not apply to a dividend ultimately received by the individual from a CFC. However, officials note that double taxation is relieved in another manner. Individuals are taxed on dividends paid by CFCs, but can claim a tax credit for tax paid under the CFC rules (and the FIF rules if the person is required to return FIF income on an indirectly held FIF interest). This is because individuals can maintain a “branch equivalent tax account” or BETA. The BETA rules provide a credit for tax paid on attributable CFC income and tax paid in relation to indirectly held FIF interests. A BETA credit for the latter is provided for in section OE 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Officials note that the BETA rules operate similarly to the tracking account proposed by the submitter to record what income has already been returned for New Zealand tax purposes. Officials are satisfied that this relieves any double taxation concerns relating to the payment of dividends by CFCs when the CFC also has an interest in a FIF. The submitter notes that individual and trust taxpayers are subject to a different level of taxation than companies are on dividends paid by a CFC in relation to underlying FIF investments. Officials note that before the introduction of the foreign dividend exemption, foreign dividends received by New Zealand-resident companies were taxable but companies, like individuals, maintained BETAs to relieve double taxation. However, the foreign dividend exemption does not extend to taxpayers other than companies. This preserves equivalent treatment between individuals who hold their foreign investments directly and those who hold their interest through a New Zealand company. The latter group will be taxable when the New Zealand company subsequently distributes its profits relating to the dividend. In general, officials consider that while there should be some alignment between the treatment of directly held and indirectly held FIFs, this does not necessarily require identical tax treatment due to underlying differences in the level of control exercised over the investment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Foreign tax credits in relation to dividends paid by CFCs when there is an indirectly owned FIF No clause Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) There is an inability to claim foreign tax credits in some circumstances when a New Zealand taxpayer holds a FIF through a CFC in the same jurisdiction. For example, when a New Zealand taxpayer holds an Australian CFC that in turn holds an Australian FIF, the FIF income is directly attributed to the New Zealand taxpayer rather than to the CFC. However, the withholding tax is deducted by the CFC on repatriation (there is no withholding tax paid when the FIF distributes income to the CFC as no funds have crossed a border). The outcome is that no foreign tax credit is available in New Zealand for the amount withheld, because the 76 underlying income has been derived from the FIF rather than the CFC. This can be contrasted with the situation when the New Zealand taxpayer holds the FIF directly and a distribution is subject to withholding tax for which a foreign tax credit is available under section LJ 2(6). Interposing a CFC should not distort the outcome in this situation. Comment As noted above, officials consider owning an interest in a FIF via an interposed CFC to be fundamentally different from owning an interest in a FIF directly and, as a result, the two situations should be differentiated under the income tax rules. An interest holder in a CFC has more influence over that foreign company’s affairs than an interest holder in a FIF would. This additional level of control may extend to decisions relating to whether dividends are paid out, and when. In the case of direct ownership, if the FIF makes a distribution to the interest holder, it is made directly to the person – they have little control over when the funds will be repatriated to them. The difference between the issue raised by this submitter and the one raised by the submitter in “Issue: Other anomalies relating to indirectly held FIFs” is that the New Zealand interest holder is likely to be a company in this case (as opposed to an individual). New Zealand-resident individuals are subject to tax on dividends received from foreign companies, but they are able to maintain a BETA which takes into account income tax they have paid under New Zealand’s international tax rules and may be able to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign income tax paid on the foreign dividend. Dividends received by New Zealand companies from foreign companies are generally exempt from New Zealand income tax under section CW 9. Previously, New Zealand tax was payable on such foreign dividends under the foreign dividend payment (FDP) rules. However, the FDP rules generally took account of the foreign tax paid (both withholding tax levied on the dividend and underlying company tax paid) and also provided for credits under the BETA rules. When the CFC rules were substantially reformed at the time the active income exemption was introduced, the FDP rules and the BETA rules as they applied to companies, were repealed. This means two things for New Zealand companies receiving foreign dividends: a credit is not available for foreign income tax withheld on the dividend, but at the same time, that foreign dividend is exempt from New Zealand tax. The former is a consequence of the latter. Officials note that a distribution made by a CFC to a New Zealand interest holder will reflect the overall income earned by the CFC, not just the income that the CFC derives from the FIF. Designing a rule that would allow a New Zealand taxpayer to provide a foreign tax credit for the part of the withholding tax levied on the CFC distribution to be credited against income tax paid in relation to the indirectly held FIF interest would be complex and could be difficult to administer. This would especially be so when there is more than one interposed CFC. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 Issue: Reference to section EX 21(33) in section EX 58(1)(b) Clause 140 Submission (EY) An additional amendment to section EX 58(1)(b) is required to remove or modify its current reference to FIF income or loss not being taken into account in calculating the net attributable CFC income or loss of the CFC for the period, because section EX 21(33) applies. Section EX 21 applies for several purposes, including determining whether a CFC is a non- attributing active CFC under the default test in section EX 21D, and calculating net attributable CFC income or loss under section EX 20B. Section EX 21 does not apply in determining whether a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC under the accounting test in section EX 21E. If a CFC is a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21E, there is no need to calculate net attributable CFC income or loss under section EX 20B. Accordingly, it is arguable that section EX 58 does not apply in such circumstances, so it would be preferable to remove any remaining possible source of confusion. Comment Officials note that the proposed amendment to section EX 58(6) clarifies that the provisions of section EX 58 apply regardless of whether the CFC is a non-active attributing CFC or a non- attributing Australian CFC. However, officials acknowledge that the reference to section EX 21(33) in section EX 58(1)(b) may create confusion in relation to FIF interests held by non- attributing active CFCs when their non-attributing active status is determined under section EX21E. Officials agree that this potential confusion could be resolved by removing from section EX 58(1)(b) “because section EX 21(33) applies”, while still retaining “FIF income and FIF loss is not taken into account in calculating the net attributable CFC income or loss of the CFC for the period for the person”. However, if the Committee accepts the submission, officials will consult with drafters to ensure that the removal of the reference to section EX 21(33) in section EX 58(1)(b) would not result in any unintended changes to the section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the matter referred to drafters. 78 Issue: Four-year rule for FDR annual and periodic methods Clauses 137, 138, 139 and 213 Submission (KPMG) The submitter can see the rationale behind the proposed change, as taxpayers are able to undertake the calculation with the benefit of hindsight (and switch between methods to minimise income for a FIF interest under the fair dividend rate (FDR) method). Comment The proposal is that the choice between an annual or more frequent basis (the periodic method) for calculating FDR income for a FIF interest will be available only once every four years. Officials acknowledge the submitter’s acceptance of the rationale for the proposed change. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition to four-year rule for FDR annual and periodic methods Clauses 137, 138, 139 and 213 Submissions (Baucher Consulting Limited, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society) The submitters do not support the proposed amendment to limit switching between the fair dividend rate (FDR) annual method and the FDR periodic method for calculating FIF income for a FIF interest to once every four years. Why has the practice sought to be countered only now been identified as being contrary to the original policy intention? The proposals would prevent taxpayers who are unable to use the comparative value method from being able to adjust their position in the event of a dramatic market event, like the Stock Market Crash in October 1987 or the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. (Baucher Consulting Limited) There are a number of instances where a choice of calculation method is available for each year – for example, individual taxpayers are able to choose between the FDR method and the comparative value method. Similarly, taxpayers should be able to choose between applying the FDR annual method and FDR periodic method for each year. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 79 A lock-in period of four years is likely to be regarded by taxpayers as unacceptably long, with no self-evident reason for such a lengthy restrictive period. As an alternative, a similar policy objective could be achieved by requiring a global change across the full portfolio when an election to change method is made. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The FDR periodic method was originally only available for unit-valuing funds such as portfolio investment entities (PIEs), which determine the value of an investor’s units in the fund’s investments on a periodic basis. However, the Taxation (Business Matters and Remedial Amendments) Act 2007 introduced an amendment which allows any other person to choose to use the method for an attributing interest in a FIF. This amendment was effective from 1 April 2008. The FDR periodic method is information-intensive as it requires taxpayers to calculate the market value of their interest in the FIF on a daily basis. The policy intent behind the amendment to allow certain taxpayers to choose to use this method is that taxpayers who have access to such detailed information about their investments should be able to use that information to calculate their income. However, it was not envisaged that these taxpayers would only use the information-intensive FDR periodic method for the years in which its use resulted in a lower tax liability for the year, thereby gaining a tax advantage over the FDR annual method. Addit ionally, unit-valuing funds are required to use the FDR periodic method and are not able to choose between the FDR annual and periodic method. Officials note that there is a general requirement in the FIF rules that once a person uses a particular calculation method to calculate their FIF income or loss for an attributing interest in a FIF for a year, they must use the same method the following year (section EX 62). However, section EX 62 only limits taxpayers from switching between the FDR method and other methods. It does not deal with switching between methods that fall under that wider FDR method umbrella. Officials consider the proposed four-year rule would be consistent with the general requirement in section EX 62 that limits switching between FIF calculation methods, while also providing taxpayers with some flexibility to switch between the FDR periodic and annual methods from time to time. The New Zealand Law Society has suggested an alternative proposal – that a global change across a taxpayer’s full portfolio could be required when an election to change method is made. Along similar lines, the effect of section EX 46(8) is that a taxpayer who chooses to switch to the comparative value method to calculate FIF income for one FIF interest must not use the FDR method for their other FIF interests. Note that this is not the same as requiring a global change across the taxpayer’s portfolio. The FIF rules do not generally require a taxpayer to use the same calculation method for all of their foreign invest ments. This is because the rules recognise that a taxpayer may have a varied investment portfolio with investments in a number of different types of FIFs and a particular income calculation method may not be practical or even possible for all of their investments. Officials consider that requiring a global change across the full portfolio when an election to change method is made could be complex and may be impractical in a number of situations. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 80 Issue: Four-year rule – prospective application Clauses 137, 138, 139 and 213 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The introduction of the four-year consistency requirement should be prospective, so that decisions made by taxpayers up to the introduction of the consistency requirement do not limit their ability to change methods going forward. Taxpayers should only be bound by the method decisions they make from the 2017 income year and after. This could be achieved by amending the drafting so that the period for which decisions under the FDR method are taken into account begins from the start of the 2015–16 income year. Comment Officials understand the submitter’s concern that the introduction of a consistency requirement should be truly prospective, otherwise taxpayers may be locked into a specific method based on decisions they made before introduction of the bill. Officials consider that the proposed four-year rule should strike a fair balance between maintaining the integrity of the FIF rules and acknowledging the decisions that taxpayers have taken in previous income years under the current rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the matter referred to drafters. Issue: Four-year rule – drafting Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We recommend that officials revisit the wording of the proposed new section and consider whether it can be simplified. In addition, the positioning of the proposed new section could create some confusion among taxpayers. Comment Officials understand the concerns raised by the submitter in relation to the drafting of new section EX 51B, with respect to the clarity of the drafting and the placement of the provision. Section EX 62 of the Income Tax Act 2007 deals with limitations on changes of method and officials are considering whether it would be appropriate to insert the provision there instead. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and the matter referred to drafters. 81 Issue: Exclusion for certain types of passive income No clause Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) There are a number of same jurisdiction, non-attributing active CFC exemptions (royalties, rent, financial arrangements) that can be applied in determining “removed passive” under section EX 21E(9) and the attributable CFC amount under section EX 20B. However, an exemption is not provided for a deductible foreign equity distribution or a distribution from a fixed-rate foreign equity received from an associated non-attributing active CFC. There should be an exclusion for these types of passive income from same jurisdiction active CFCs. Comment Officials contacted the submitter for clarity on the submission and understand that this concern was remedied in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: General support Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) The submitter supports the proposals in the bill relating to CFCs and FIFs and is pleased that the remedial issues they and others have identified are being addressed. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter is generally supportive of the policy behind most amendments in the bill, subject to comments within the submission. (EY) The submitter is supportive of the minor technical remedials in the bill relating to international tax. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials welco me submitters’ support. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 82 Issue: Test grouping for part-year acquisitions and disposals Clauses 128 and 129 Submission (KPMG) The submitter is supportive of the proposal to allow groups of foreign companies acquired (or disposed of) during a year to be included in CFC test groups. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposal, but note that the proposal the submitter is referring to is to allow taxpayers who acquire or dispose of a group of foreign companies at the same time to have access to the test group concession in that year for those companies. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Test grouping proposal too limited Clauses 128 and 129 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The 50 percent grouping requirement should be amended to make it clear that same-jurisdiction CFCs that are only held for part of an accounting period are able to form a test group with each other as long as the interest holder has a more than 50 percent interest in the CFCs for that part of the income year that the interest is held by the person. There is no reason why a group of target companies all acquired during the period should not be able to be grouped under the active business tests. The same argument applies to groups disposed of during the period that could otherwise have been grouped in prior years. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the intent of the proposed amendment and the retrospective application date. However, the drafting of the amendment is too restrictive and there are a number of legitimate instances where the proposed amendment will not apply in practice. In particular, the test grouping concession should be able to be accessed where sister CFCs are acquired or disposed of during the year. The requirement that the New Zealand interest holder acquires or disposes of the relevant CFCs “at the same time” is also too restrictive as acquisition or disposal transactions can take a variety of forms in practice. This rule should also be extended to apply to income interests held by companies that are members of a wholly owned group of companies that include the interest holder (in line with section EX 21E(2)(c)(ii)) and not be restricted to CFCs held by one interest holder alone. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 83 Any concerns regarding a CFC being a member of more than one test group for an accounting period (which is unlikely) could be removed by requiring the part-year test calculation option detailed below to be utilised for the purposes of the test group calculations if this part-year grouping approach is utilised. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The intent of the proposed amendment is to account for situations when a pre-existing structure of companies is acquired or disposed of, and to maintain the treatment that this structure of companies would otherwise be subject to. Officials understand that acquisitions and disposals can take a variety of forms and that these transactions may not occur at the same time. While the original intent of the proposed amendment focuses on a very particular type of disposal or acquisition, officials consider that it is appropriate to extend the proposed part-year test grouping proposal to include sister companies acquired or disposed of in the same accounting period, as well as income interests acquired or disposed of by members of a wholly owned group of companies that includes the interest holder. However, to maintain the integrity of the test-grouping rules, officials would consider it necessary to distinguish between CFCs acquired during the same accounting period and CFCs disposed of during the same accounting period. Regarding the submission on a part-year test calculation option, please refer to “Issue: Other matters relating to part-year acquisition and disposal – calculation of ownership interest” and “Issue: Other matters relating to part-year acquisit io n and disposal – calculation of income” for further discussio n. Officials consider that further work needs to be undertaken in relation to the part-year test calculation option proffered by the submitter to ensure that any change in this area does not create unintended consequences in the operation of New Zealand’s international tax rules. Recommendation That the submissions, subject to officials’ comments, be accepted. Issue: Other matters relating to part-year acquisition and disposal – calculation of ownership interest No clause Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) A number of sections in the international tax rules refer to the need for a 10 percent or more income interest in the CFC/FIF for the relevant accounting period for the section to apply. 84 In particular, section EX 46 provides that at all times in the accounting period the person must hold an income interest of 10 percent or more in the FIF to apply the attributable FIF income method. This means that if a FIF is acquired or disposed of during the year, the taxpayer would not meet the 10 percent threshold at all times in the accounting period, and would be unable to apply the attributable FIF income method. Sections CQ 2 and EX 14 provide that a person has an attributed CFC income or loss only if the person has an income interest in the CFC of 10 percent or more for the relevant accounting period. If a CFC is acquired or disposed of during the year, then they may not meet the requirements to attribute under the CFC rules and may be considered a FIF in the relevant period. The issues are the same as that being addressed by the proposal concerning the part-year exemption for Australian FIFs. The rules should be amended by providing that the 10 percent or more income interest required under section EX 46 and 14, and section CQ 2 applies to the total period in the year in which the person has rights in the CFC/FIF, as proposed for section EX 35. The amendment should be retrospective back to the start of the new regime. Comment Officials consider that the proposed amendment to section EX 35 (the FIF exemption for Australian FIFs) is different from the issues raised by the submitter in relation to part-year acquisitions and disposals of CFCs and non-portfolio FIFs. The issues that the submitter raises relate to rules that determine whether income should be attributed to the interest holder. This is more complex than determining whether an exemption from the FIF rules applies. Officials note that one potential issue relating to part-year acquisitions or disposals of attributing interests in CFCs and non-portfolio FIFs is whether the interest holder has the ability to get the required information to correctly apply the attribution rules. Officials consider that this submission should be analysed in conjunction with “Issue: Other matters relating to part-year acquisition and disposal – calculation of income” as both matters relate to the complexities of dealing with part-year acquisitions and disposals. Further work needs to be undertaken to ensure that if any change is made to how income interests are calculated in years of acquisition or disposal, there would be no unintended consequences in the operation of New Zealand’s international tax rules. This could raise wider policy considerations, which would need to be further considered and consulted on. For these reasons it would not be appropriate to advance this suggestion in the current bill but we will consider this issue as part of our future policy work on CFCs and FIFs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 85 Issue: Other matters relating to part-year acquisition and disposal – calculation of income No clause Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The active business test is performed based on the full accounting period for CFCs (or FIFs applying the attributable FIF income method). This is the case even for CFCs/FIFs that are not held for the full accounting period (that is, they are acquired or disposed of during the year). In order to use the accounting method active business test in section EX 21E, audited IFRS accounts (or US GAAP for FIFs under section EX 50) are required for the full accounting period. There is often a problem in the year of acquisition and disposal as the New Zealand interest holder’s IFRS accounts will only cover the period for which the CFC/FIF is held. In addit ion, when a CFC is sold, it is often very difficult for taxpayers to obtain financial information from the purchaser for the period in which they do not own the CFC/FIF. For commercial and accounting purposes there is no reason to have this information and therefore it is not usually able to be obtained. This means that taxpayers are forced to use the default (tax) method which is significantly more complex and compliance-intensive, or alternatively adopt a pragmatic approach of simply applying the accounting test based on 100 percent of the IFRS results for the period for which the CFC/FIF is held. An option should also be included for taxpayers to apply the active business test and undertake attribution calculations for the period for which the CFC/FIF is held. This will allow taxpayers to use the reduced compliance accounting test, as they will in other years when the CFC is held for the entire accounting period, as IFRS accounts for this period will be available. For calculation purposes, the income interest would be treated as 100 percent such that the calculations would reflect 100 percent of the result for the ownership period and would more accurately reflect the position of the New Zealand interest holder. The application date for this change should be retrospective back to the start of the new regime. Comment Officials consider that this submission should be analysed in conjunction with “Issue: Other matters relating to part-year acquisit io n and disposal – calculation of ownership interest”. There are complexities in undertaking the active business test calculation when a CFC is only held for part of an accounting period. Officials consider that further work needs to be undertaken to ensure that if any change is made to how the active business test is calculated in years of acquisition or disposal, there would be no unintended consequences in the operation of New Zealand’s international tax rules. This could raise wider policy considerations, which would need to be further considered and consulted on. For these reasons it would not be appropriate to advance this suggestion in the current bill but we will consider this issue as part of future policy work on CFCs and FIFs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 86 Issue: Review of the FIF rules No clause Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited) There should be a full review of the FIF regime’s impact and effectiveness. As part of this review, the underlying growth assumption for some FIF calculation methods (such as the fair dividend rate and costs methods) should be revised as the current 5% rate ignores the effect of events such as the global financial crisis. A lower rate, say 3%, should apply. In addition when the FIF interest is not paying dividends, the investor should be allowed to roll up his or her FIF liability until such time as the shares are sold or a dividend is paid. Comment There is no full review of the FIF regime planned, and officials do not consider that a review is necessary at this time. Officials regard the 5% annual growth rate used in some of the FIF calculation methods as an accurate representation of medium- to long-term investment growth rates. Events like the global financial crisis are temporary and the growth rates of many financial asset classes have recovered quickly. Officials note that if the investor is an individual or a trustee of a family trust and the return is less than 5%, tax can be paid on this lower amount using the comparative value method, with no tax payable when the total return is negative. Availability of the comparative value method means that the 5% growth rate acts as an upper limit for many investors. As noted by the submitter, the current FIF regime was introduced as part of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. As noted in the Tax Information Bulletin item related to that legislation, the rationale for taxing offshore portfolio investments in shares on accrual is that dividend-taxation is not feasible for taxing investments in companies resident in jurisdictions whose tax systems do not encourage the payment of dividends: “Dividend-only taxation was, in many instances, an inappropriate tax base because many foreign companies have a policy of paying low or no dividends. The investor could still, however, derive an economic gain from the investment via an increase in the share price. It was therefore quite easy to achieve a low tax or no tax result for direct portfolio investment in shares outside New Zealand. This could give higher income or more sophisticated taxpayers significant scope to minimise their tax burden by investing offshore.” 3 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 3 https://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2006/2006-81/2006-81-offshore/ 87 88 Other remedial matters 89 90 REPEAL OF THE SIMPLIFIED FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS LEGISLATION Clauses 225(4) and (8), 240, 243, and section 33AA of Tax Administration Act 1994 Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) CAANZ understands the rationale for the repeal of the simplified filing requirements for individuals legislation and therefore supports it. However, we are surprised that it was not foreseen in 2012 that the SFRI legislation would be “overtaken by events” and that the cost of developing and enacting the SFRI legislation could have been avoided. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) KPMG supports the repeal of the recent changes to the tax return filing requirements for individuals which were intended to apply from the 2016–17 income year, in anticipation of Inland Revenue’s Business transformation changes. (KPMG) Comment Officials welcome this support. We also note at the time the SFRI legislation was enacted in 2012, Inland Revenue’s Business transformation programme was in its very early stages and it was not clear how it would address the problem that the SFRI legislation sought to address. The SFRI legislation addressed concerns of fairness by removing the ability for people to “cherry pick”, and removing the requirement for others to file tax returns. These initiatives were seen as a “back-end” solution (that is, stopping the practice of filing tax returns in those years in which an individual is due a refund and not filing when they have tax to pay) to a “front-end” problem of inaccurate PAYE deductions during the year, leading to the need to square-up and file a tax return at the end of the year. Current Business transformation thinking is for more streamlined processes, with salary and wage earners’ information being provided by third parties such as employers and banks to Inland Revenue, and Inland Revenue undertaking the necessary calculations. This should lead to a more accurate PAYE structure, which means fewer people in a refund or tax-debt posit ion at the end of the year. The problem of filing a tax return only in those years in which an individual is due a refund would be reduced. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 91 EXTENSION OF THE GRACE PERIOD FOR DEREGISTERED CHARITIES Issue: Eligibility for the grace-period for deregistered charities is too narrow Clause 264 Submission (Community Housing Aotearoa) The proposed extension of the grace-period for deregistered charities will apply too narrowly. One of the requirements under clause 264 of the bill is that the “person’s activities are predominantly the provision of housing”. Some of Community Housing Aotearoa members may face deregistration due to the extent of their housing programmes. However, because these charities also provide other charitable activities they will not meet the “predominantly” test under clause 264, and therefore will not be afforded protection against the imposition of tax on net assets upon deregistration. Clause 264 should be amended to require only that the “person’s activities include the provision of housing, as part of achieving the person’s stated objectives or purposes, before de-registration by Charities Services”. Comment We agree with the submission. We consider that all providers involved in the provision of housing and who are deregistered by the Charities Services following its compliance review of community housing providers should be eligible for relief under the extended grace-period for reasons of equity. The “predominantly” test is an unfair and unnecessary constraint on the relief offered by the grace-period for providers who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves facing potentially significant tax liabilities. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The grace-period for deregistered charities does not fix the underlying problem Clause 264 Submission (Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust) We support the amendment in clause 264 but are concerned that it simply provides a two-year extension and does not resolve the underlying lack of certainty of tax-exempt status for community housing providers after this two-year period. 92 Other concerns include: • Any permanent fix to the problem should be centred on the objects and purposes of the community housing provider and not on the specific characteristics of the recipients of the housing assistance. • A properly constituted community housing provider sees housing stress in all sorts of ways within their communities and it is not easy for central government to try and set the guidelines for determining what constitutes housing stress and how each communit y housing provider should be addressing it. Comment The Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 provided for a specific income tax exemption for a specific class of community housing providers (referred to as community housing entities) with the details to be set by Regulation. It was expected that the Regulation would be in place by 1 April 2015. However, owing to delays in setting the detail of the Regulation – in particular, the income threshold for determining who can be a recipient of a community housing entity – the tax exemption has not yet been finalised. Ministers are expecting to finalise these details over the coming weeks. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date is contrary to policy intent Clause 264 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 264 as currently worded allows the extension of the grace-period for deregistered charities to apply to community housing providers who voluntarily deregister as well as to those who are deregistered by Charities Services. This result was unintended. Comment The grace period was only intended to apply to community housing providers deregistered by Charities Services, but due to an oversight in the current drafting, also included those that voluntarily deregistered. As a specific tax exemption for community housing entities is currently being finalised, it was considered appropriate to provide relief for community housing providers who, through no fault of their own, would have found themselves facing potentially significant tax liabilities. Community housing providers who voluntarily deregister should not be afforded the same relief provided by the grace-period as they have made a conscious decision not to have the grace-period apply to them. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 93 TERTIARY EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS Issue: Section CW 42 applies too narrowly Clause 76 Submissions (EY, KPMG) Clause 76 of the bill amends section CW 55BA to allow wholly owned subsidiaries of tertiary education institutions to be treated as exempt from income tax on their business income and incorporates certain provisions of section CW 42 in that regard. Section CW 42 gives rise to an unintended policy outcome by excluding businesses carried on by a company for charitable purposes, and owned by a charitable trust, from the income tax exempt ion for charit ies and for community housing entities. This unintended policy outcome was specifically addressed in clause 76 in relation to the wholly owned subsidiaries of tertiary education institutions and should be extended to the wholly owned subsidiaries of charities and community housing entities. Comment Under current interpretation, section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007 excludes businesses carried on by a company for charitable purposes and owned by a charitable trust, from the income tax exemption for charities. This is because the charitable trust is deemed to have control over the business and is able to direct or divert amounts from the business for its own benefit or advantage. Practically, the application of section CW 42 as currently drafted means that a charity is not able to derive tax-exempt charitable business income in a subsidiary company (which may be desired for legal limitation of liability purposes, for example), but that same income would be tax-exempt if derived directly by the shareholder charitable trust. This is an unintended consequence. In defining “tertiary education subsidiary”, the proposed amendment to section CW 55BA fixes this unintended consequence for tertiary education institutions, as it allows tertiary education subsidiaries to remain tax-exempt by adding the words “other than the tertiary education inst itution” in the context of the control requirements. The effect of this is that when a tertiary education institution has control over its subsidiary, the subsidiary will remain tax-exempt. KPMG has suggested that this problem could be resolved by amending section CW 42(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and adding the words in italics: (c) no person, other than a charitable entity referred to in section CW 41(1), with some control over the business is able to direct or divert, to their own benefit or advantage, an amount derived from the business. We agree with the general tenor of KPMG’s suggested amendment in relation to wholly owned companies of charitable entities. 94 We also agree that a similarly worded amendment should be made to section CW 42B (the tax exemption for community housing entities) which also has control requirements similar to section CW 42. This amendment would ensure that when a community housing entity is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of a charitable trust or another community housing entity, the wholly owned subsidiary is eligible for the community housing entity tax exemption. EY has suggested that this matter be resolved by granting the Commissioner the discretion to approve entities for income tax exemption under sections CW 42 and CW 42B. As mentioned earlier, we accept the need to resolve this matter but consider that it is best dealt with by clarifying the intended scope of the exemptions, rather than leaving it to the discretion of the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Support for section CW 55BA reform Clause 76 Submission (PwC) PwC supports the intent of clause 76. Comment Officials welcome this support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Section CW 55BA is too narrow Clause 76 Submission (Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiarangi) The proposed section should be widened to include tertiary education companies which are wholly owned by one or more tertiary education institutions. The Wānanga sees no policy reason why the exemption should not apply if each shareholder is individually a tertiary education institution. Furthermore, extending the exemption would assist with planning structures for jointly owned tertiary education companies in the future. 95 Comment Officials agree with the submission that the exemption should apply in circumstances when a tertiary education subsidiary is wholly owned by more than one tertiary education institution. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 96 ACCOMMODATION No clause Issue: Employer-provided overseas accommodation Submission (Matter raised by officials) The rule in section CE 1C of the Income Tax Act 2007 for valuing overseas accommodation provided by employers to their staff should be amended to also cover accommodation payments and accommodation allowances. Comment We are recommending a remedial fix to clarify that the section CE 1C rule for valuing overseas accommodation provided to employees was intended to cover both actual accommodation and accommodation payments, including allowances. The special report published on the Tax Policy website soon after the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 was enacted indicated this intention. Currently, the rule is inadvertently limited to actual accommodation provided, which means that there is a different tax outcome depending on how the overseas accommodation benefit is provided. In the case of accommodation payments, the specific valuation rule in section CE 1C would only be able to be applied when the allowance or other payment provided either reflects the actual cost to the employee for the accommodation or is a reasonable estimate of the expenditure likely to be incurred. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Project of limited duration Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definit ion o f “project of limited duration” in section CW 16B of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to clarify that it is intended to apply to employees when their employer is the contractor or a subcontractor who undertakes the work rather than the person who has hired the contractor. 97 Comment When an employee is required, because of their job, to work away from their normal place of residence, the employee can be eligible for an income tax exemption of up to two years on any accommodation or accommodation payment that their employer provides. However, when an employee is involved in “a project of limited duration”, such as the building of a dam, the employee can be eligible for an income tax exemption on accommodation of up to three years. This longer exemption reflects the likelihood that the emplo yee’s stay at the distant workplace will be lo nger because of the nature of such projects. Given that it is a relatively generous exemption, the definition of “project of limited duration” is intended to be tightly defined, focusing on work projects whose principal purpose is to create, build, develop, restore, replace or demolish a capital asset. The projects would be carried out under a contract of service between an employer and one or more persons who are not associated with the employer. It is this latter aspect that needs to be clarified to emphasise that the intention is that the employer being referred to is the contractor or a subcontractor and not the ultimate client – for example, the construction company that builds the dam or the specialists who install the turbines, not the client that has contracted the construction company to undertake the work. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 98 TAX POOLING RULES Clauses 207 to 212 Issue: Support for aspects of the reform Submissions (Tax Management New Zealand, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) Submitters supported the amendments to the tax pooling rules to enable purchased tax pooling funds to be used to meet outstanding interest obligations on increased amounts of tax resulting from an amended assessment or the resolution of a tax dispute. The group strongly supports the proposed amendments, which restore the original intent of the tax pooling rules. The group is pleased that this issue is resolved in the bill having been the subject of discussions with officials since late 2012. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials welcome this support and recognise the assistance provided by the industry in working through this issue. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Extend tax pooling to disputes where proceedings are stayed Submission (Tax Management New Zealand) The tax pooling rules are framed as if every taxpayer will settle a dispute in a timely manner or proceed through to challenge proceedings before a court. This is often not the case. Where a taxpayer’s dispute is the same or similar to that of another taxpayer whose dispute is before the courts, the Commissioner and the taxpayer can agree to stay proceedings and be bound by the outcome of the dispute before the courts. This is a sensible course of action for all parties, as it saves both sides the cost of preparing lengthy statements of position, and reduces the pressure on the court system by not requiring cases to be needlessly filed with the courts. Currently, when a dispute is stayed and does not proceed to court, a taxpayer may not be able to access tax pooling funds when the dispute is finally settled. However, if the dispute had proceeded to court the taxpayer would be able to access tax pooling funds. This is an unintended policy outcome. 99 The amendments within the bill should be extended to ensure that these taxpayers are not disadvantaged by staying dispute proceedings pending the outcome of a similar case before the courts. Comment Officials agree with the submission and support the amendment proposed by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of use-of-money interest and penalties rules Submission (KPMG) Although the amendment to the tax pooling rules is a positive step, the need for tax pooling reflects underlying concerns about the application of use-of-money interest and the penalties rules generally. These need to be addressed more fundamentally. If use-of-money interest and the penalties rules are not reviewed, KPMG supports a wider application of tax pooling funds to meet tax liabilities, which could potentially reduce the historic tax debt. Comment The Government recently released a green paper setting out its initial thinking about how to modernise New Zealand’s tax administration. This paper outlined the Government’s intention to review the provisional tax rules and how the use-of-money interest rules apply to businesses. The green paper also signalled that, at the same time, a review of the tax pooling rules should be undertaken to identify if they can be improved and made available to more taxpayers. Officials therefore consider that the Government’s work on modernising New Zealand’s tax administration will include consideration of the issues raised by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 100 Issue: Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the current legislation Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Tax Management New Zealand, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The tax pooling rules were drafted in a very prescriptive manner and are producing unintended and unnecessarily restrictive consequences, particularly in the settlement of tax disputes. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Tax Management New Zealand) The amendment in the bill is the latest in a series of legislative changes to the tax pooling rules that have been required because Inland Revenue has not interpreted the existing legislation in the spirit in which it has been intended. This has caused significant uncertainty for taxpayers and tax pooling intermediaries, and the group is hopeful that Inland Revenue will adopt more of a pragmatic operational approach in the future to any remedial tax pooling issues. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials acknowledge that the tax pooling rules are prescriptive. To enable the smooth running of the tax pooling scheme Inland Revenue interprets the rules in line with their underlying policy intent. When the legislation is clear but does not achieve the intended policy outcome, remedial legislat ion is required. As noted earlier, the Government has signalled its intention to review the tax pooling rules to see if they can be improved or made available to more taxpayers. Officials consider that the issue raised by submitters will be addressed as part of this review. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Inconsistency between the commentary and the bill Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Tax Management New Zealand) There is an inconsistency between the officials’ commentary on the bill and the bill itself, in relation to the timeframe for adjustments to be made to the interest transfers. The commentary states that interest transfers must be made within 60 days of the date of enactment of the legislation whereas the bill refers to the timeframe of 60 days from the date on which the Commissioner notifies the amount of interest payable for the transfers to be made. The application date should be clarified. The timeframe proposed in the legislation is more realistic for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 101 Comment Officials confirm that the timeframe contained in the bill is correct. The timeframe in the commentary is an error and officials propose to clarify this error in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, which details the tax changes to the public once the legislation is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 102 INCOME STATEMENTS AND INCOME TAX FILING EXEMPTIONS Clauses 231, 225 and 226 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) This amendment is a sensible way of reducing the number of people required to file tax returns and therefore is a sensible way of reducing both Inland Revenue administrative costs and taxpayer compliance costs. There are many other “small” changes that could be made to the current rules that would simplify tax and reduce compliance and administrative costs. A real effort should be made to identify and implement them as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation or, where possible, in advance of Business Transformation. Comment This submission has been referred to Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation project for consideration in future tax bills. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 103 FINANCIAL MARKETS (REPEALS AND AMENDMENTS) ACT 2013 – RELATED CHANGES Clauses 213(55) and 266 Issue: Effective date of change of reference Submission (KPMG) We strongly support this remedial amendment to the definition of “public unit trust” to reverse an unintended change made on the introduction of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, the relevant section of which took effect from 1 December 2014. The amendment is currently proposed to take effect from enactment of the tax bill. As the unintended change was effective from 1 December 2014, the proposed amendment should take effect from that same date. Comment Paragraph 30(5)(f) of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Regulations 2014 applies for two years from 1 December 2014. This section treats, for the purpose of the public unit trust definition in the Income Tax Act 2007, a regulated offer made under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 as including a reference to an offer that would have been an offer of securities to the public under the Securities Act 1978 if the Securities Act 1978 had not been repealed. This transitional provision is intended to ensure that a public unit trust that qualified under the Income Tax Act 2007 definition before 1 December 2014 would continue to do so until a permanent solution could be enacted in this tax bill. Officials will refer to these regulations in the Tax Information Bulletin to assist taxpayers to be aware of them. A principle of law drafting is that retrospective application dates should only be used when necessary. Officials do not consider them to be necessary in this instance. Further, due to the reduction in the threshold in paragraph (b)(vi) and (vii) from 25 percent to 5 percent, there may be a small number of unit trusts that previously were public unit trusts but that will no longer meet the new criteria. Officials consider it would be inappropriate to retrospectively remove the public unit trust status of these entities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 104 Issue: Change to the level of allowed investment Submission (KPMG) We do not support the amendment to reduce the 25 percent shareholding percentage in paragraph (b)(vi) and (vii) of the “public unit trust” definition, to 5 percent. This is not a remedial amendment resulting from changes to financial markets regulation. This change could have significant impacts for unit trusts that currently rely on paragraph (b) of the “public unit trust” definition, who will be caught unawares and potentially lose their status as a result. The change has not been consulted upon and it is not clear that the amendment is required or justified to address any perceived or real concerns. This change should be omitted from the tax bill and subject to wider consultation, rather than being enacted as a remedial amendment, which it is not. Comment Before 1 December 2014 a unit trust that qualified as a “public unit trust” under paragraph (b) of the definition could have unit holders who met one or more of a number of categories. These categories included: • a person with a 25 percent shareholding interest or less in the unit trust, treating all associated persons as one person, if the unit trust offered securities to the public under the Securities Act 1978; • a person with a shareholding interest of 25 percent or more in the unit trust, treating all associated persons as one person, if their interest is 25 percent or more because of unusual or temporary circumstances, such as the recent establishment or forthcoming termination of the unit trust, and if the unit trust would meet the requirements of any of paragraphs (a), (c), (d) and (e), and if the unit trust offers securities to the public under the Securities Act 1978. The Securities Act 1978 was replaced by the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 on 1 December 2014. The current legislation, as amended by the Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Act 2013 to include regulated offers in respect of the unit trust made under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, covers certain offers that are not covered under the previous wording but also omits other offers that could result in certain unit trusts who currently meet the definition of “a public unit trust” no longer qualifying. The Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 does not include a concept equivalent to “securit ies offered to the public” so it is not possible for the inco me tax definit io n o f a “public unit trust” to remain ident ical to its original outcome. The bill proposes to remove the criteria regulated offers are made in paragraphs (a), (b)(vi) and (vii), and will instead rely on the existing criteria, which relate to the number of unit holders, the widely held status of those unit holders and other similar criteria. In the absence of other changes this would make it much easier for unit trusts who do not make regulated offers or who would not have offered securities the public to meet the public unit trust definition. 105 For paragraph (a) the existing 25 percent threshold is considered appropriate as it will still be necessary to have at least 100 unit holders, which would usually only occur when the units are offered to the public. For paragraph (b)(vi) and (vii), if there were no threshold changes, this would allow a public unit trust to not make regulated offers and have as few as four unit holders, each with a 25 percent interest. Officials do not consider this would be consistent with the general concept of a public unit trust. By reducing the threshold to 5 percent a public unit trust that satisfies paragraph (b)(vi) will have to have at least 20 unit holders. It would not be tenable to remove the regulated offer requirement and leave the current threshold in place. Officials note that a public unit trust only has to meet one of paragraphs (a) to (e) therefore a unit trust that no longer met the requirements of paragraph (b), due to these changes, could still qualify under one of the other paragraphs, such as having more than 100 unit holders (paragraph (a)) or having less than 100 unit holders but being reasonably regarded as a widely held investment vehicle for direct investment by members of the public despite its number of unit holders or investors (paragraph (c)). Officials consider it is appropriate that any unit trust that, because of the changes in this bill, no longer satisfied paragraph (b) of the definition, and did not meet any of paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (e), would be excluded from being a public unit trust. As this provision applies from enactment of the bill, this change could only affect a public unit trust on a prospective basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 106 THIN CAPITALISATION No clause Issue: Introductory provision to the rules Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section FE 1(1)(a)(iii) refers to an entity that is “controlled by a group of entities, including non- residents and entities controlled by non-residents, that act together”. The phrase “act together” appears have been picked up from earlier versions of the thin capitalisation reforms that were proposed in 2013, however that phrase was ultimately not adopted and does not appear elsewhere in the thin capitalisation rules. Section FE 1(1)(a)(iii) should be removed from the Act, as it creates confusion as to the scope of the thin capitalisation rules. Comment The submitter is correct that the concept of non-residents who act collectively for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules is expressed in the definition of “non-resident owning body” as set out in section FE 4. There is one exception to this. For trustees of a trust, this concept is expressed as “a group of persons who act in concert”. Thus trustees of a trust are subject to the rules if 50 percent or more of the settlements on the trust are made by a group of persons who act in concert and those persons are themselves subject to the rules. Officials therefore recommend that section FE 1(1)(a)(iii) be amended to clarify that the rules apply when a taxpayer is a trustee and when the majority of settlements have come from people subject to the rules who are acting in concert. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 107 Issue: Double counting rule Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section FE 2(1)(cb)(i) provides that thin capitalisation rules apply when the members of a non- resident owning body have, on aggregate, a 50 percent or larger ownership interest in a New Zealand company. However, as a person’s ownership interest in a company includes any direct ownership interests that an associated person has in that company, this can potentially result in a person’s ownership interest being counted more than once. To prevent this double counting, the section provides that the aggregate ownership interest of a non-resident owning body should be determined as if the members are associated. The intention of treating the members as associates is to utilise the rule in section FE 41 that prevents double counting. From a technical perspective, however, this does not work as section FE 41 applies only in relation to section FE 40. Comment Officials recommend the rules be amended to clarify that the ownership interests of a non- resident owning body should not be counted more than once. This amendment should apply from the beginning of the 2015–16 income year to align with the application date of section FE 2(1)(cb)(i). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 108 DESIRABILITY OF CONSULTATION ON DRAFT LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS – MATTER NOT IN THE BILL No clause Submission (Russell McVeagh) Inland Revenue should more frequently release, for consultation, exposure drafts of amending legislation, so that interested parties can comment on the drafting prior to the relevant bill being introduced to the House. Related to the need for greater focus on the clarity and correctness of legislative drafting, Inland Revenue should maintain resources dedicated to improving tax legislation, through greater consultation on draft amendments, and by identifying drafting errors and other aspects of legislative uncertainty, and proposing remedial amendments where required. Comment Officials will continue to release draft legislation for consultation when this is appropriate and feasible to do so – for example, the GST treatment of bodies corporate discussion document released in June 2014. It will not always be appropriate, or possible, to provide draft legislation with consultation documents. Due to the many changes that frequently occur through consultation under the generic tax policy process it would often be inefficient for officials to prepare, and for submitters to consider, draft legislation that may be subject to significant revision before it is introduced in a tax bill. Officials have an internal process for identifying and proposing remedial amendments to tax legislation. We will continue to refine this process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 109 TAXATION OF FOREIGN SUPERANNUATION Issue: Support for changes Clauses 71 and 213 Submission (KPMG, PwC) The submitters support the proposed change that the new foreign superannuation rules, rather than the FIF rules, apply to an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while the person is a New Zealand tax resident for domestic law purposes, but is considered to be non-resident for the purposes of a double tax agreement. KPMG expressed general support for the proposed amendments that: • reinstate the FIF exemption for Australian regulated superannuation schemes; • allow individuals below the minimum FIF threshold of $50,000 to use the foreign superannuation rules for determining their tax liability; and • confirm that where pensions have been returned as taxable income prior to 1 April 2014, individuals will not be penalised for non-compliance under the FIF rules. Submission Officials welcome support for the proposed changes in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Residence test under double tax agreements – drafting Clauses 71 and 213 Submission (PwC) The wording in the proposed amendment to section CF 3 that the foreign superannuation rules should apply where a person is a New Zealand resident under domestic tax law, but treated as non-resident under a double tax agreement when they acquire the rights in their foreign superannuation scheme should be revised to be more technically correct. The proposed amendment includes the phrase “when the person is a non-resident or is treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand”. 110 From a technical perspective, a person is not treated as being a non-resident of New Zealand under a double tax agreement, but rather, they are treated solely as being a resident of the other jurisdiction for the purposes of the double tax agreement. We propose that the wording should be amended to read “or is treated under a double tax agreement as a resident solely of the Contracting State other than New Zealand”. Comment The Income Tax Act 2007 contains a number of references to New Zealand’s double tax agreements, and in particular, to situations when dual-residence has been dealt with by a double tax agreement. Officials have undertaken a survey of these references and it does not appear that the use of the phrase “is treated under a double tax agreement as a resident solely of the Contracting State other than New Zealand” or something similar has been used before. Officials note that the phrase “treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand” is used elsewhere in the Income Tax Act 2007, and therefore do not consider that any further amendment is required. However, a slight variation has also been used, which refers to treatment under, and for the purposes of, a double tax agreement. The use of this variation may provide additional clarity and officials have raised this with drafters. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and the matter referred to drafters. Issue: Low-value FIF superannuation interest – transfers into KiwiSaver should be exempt Clause 71 Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited) A transfer of a low-value FIF superannuation interest to a KiwiSaver scheme should be treated as an exempt transfer. Comment A similar submission was made when the foreign superannuation rules were considered by the Committee as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The Committee declined the submission that transfers into locked-in New Zealand superannuation schemes (for example, KiwiSaver) should be exempt from New Zealand tax. Officials noted at page 24 of the Officials’ Report that “exempting transfers into locked-in schemes would create a significant inequity between New Zealand residents with foreign superannuation schemes and those with other financial assets such as New Zealand superannuation schemes, shares, or bank deposits”. 111 This argument applies to all transfers into locked-in schemes, including transfers of low-value FIF superannuation interests into KiwiSaver schemes. Officials note that a low-value FIF superannuation interest is not a FIF superannuation interest that is valued at less than $50,000, but rather a FIF superannuation interest where the total value of all of the person’s interests in FIFs is less than $50,000. Exempting the transfer of a low- value FIF superannuation interest would raise significant equity concerns, not only between foreign superannuation schemes and other financial assets, but also between low-value FIF superannuation interests that would be exempt from tax under the submitter’s proposal and foreign superannuation schemes that are taxed on receipt under the foreign superannuation rules or on an annual basis under the FIF rules. Officials also consider that the submitter’s proposal would encourage New Zealand residents to accumulate funds offshore in a foreign superannuation scheme and only transfer their funds to a KiwiSaver scheme immediately before they are able (and wish) to use their funds, without paying any New Zealand tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Low-value FIF superannuation interest – formula method should be available Clauses 71 and 213 Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited, KPMG) A person should be able to use the formula method to calculate the tax payable in relation to their low-value FIF superannuation interest. Comment The FIF rules apply to a foreign superannuation interest that has been acquired while a person is a New Zealand resident. This ensures that the FIF rules that apply to foreign portfolio investments held by New Zealand residents are not undermined. A minimum threshold is available in the FIF rules, whereby an individual is not required to pay tax on an accrual basis under the FIF rules if the total cost of their interests in FIFs is less than $50,000. Instead, tax is paid on receipt of any distributions from their FIFs under other tax rules that may apply to their interest (such as the rules for distributions from trusts or companies). The aim of this minimum threshold is to reduce compliance costs for those with relatively small foreign investments, as these people are likely to be unsophisticated investors. The bill proposes to introduce the concept of a “low-value FIF superannuation interest” to mitigate some of the complexities of the FIF minimum threshold. As the minimum threshold is intended to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, allowing a person to apply the schedule method in relation to their low-value FIF superannuation interest would be a balanced approach in reducing some of the complexities of the FIF minimum threshold as it applies to foreign superannuation interests, while also maintaining the integrity of the FIF rules. 112 Officials consider that allowing taxpayers with low-value FIF superannuation interests to use the formula method would not be in line with the aim of the FIF minimum threshold to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, because the formula method requires a person to have substantial information about their scheme. In addition, the FIF minimum threshold is not compulsory and it is possible for people to opt out of the threshold into the accrual rules, if they are able and would like to return accurate economic income arising from their investment. This brings them into the same position as someone who is above the minimum threshold and cannot defer their tax liability. Officials consider this to be a reasonable trade-off; while the schedule method approximates the gains on which an individual should be paying tax, the individual is able to defer the actual payment of tax for several years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Low-value FIF superannuation interest – exemption period should be available Clause 213 Submission (KPMG) A person should be eligible for a four–year exemption period when calculating the amount of tax payable arising from their low-value FIF superannuation interest. Comment The foreign superannuation tax rules contain a four–year exemption period that is designed to mirror the transitional residence exemption for new migrants. Under New Zealand’s domestic law, new migrants are provided with a four–year exemption on certain foreign-sourced income when they first become New Zealand–resident. The underlying intent is to provide new migrants with time to familiarise themselves with New Zealand’s tax rules and get their foreign investments in order. The transitional residence exemption is also available to returning New Zealanders if they have been non-resident for 10 years or more. Under the foreign superannuation rules, all individuals receive an exemption period in relation to their foreign superannuation interests as long as they satisfy the requirement that they acquired the interest while they were non-resident. This is because in the context of foreign superannuation interests, an individual who is non-resident for nine years should not be treated materially different from someone who has been a non-resident for 10 years (or more). 113 However, officials do not consider it appropriate to extend the four–year exemption period to low-value FIF superannuation interests. As the bill also contains a proposal to allow individuals who were resident under domestic law but non-resident for the purposes of a double tax agreement to pay tax under the foreign superannuation rules, rather than the FIF rules, officials consider that the majority of individuals with low-value FIF superannuation interests will either have sufficient ties to New Zealand to remain New Zealand-tax resident while living overseas or will be living in New Zealand permanently when they invest into the foreign scheme. Providing these individuals with an exemption period would provide them with a tax exemption for four years’ worth of gains derived by their scheme. This would create significant equity concerns between the tax treatment of low-value FIF superannuation interests and other financial assets that a New Zealand resident may invest in (particularly at the same time), held both domestically and offshore. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 114 TAXATION OF FOREIGN SUPERANNUATION: MATTERS NOT IN THE BILL Issue: Change to the United Kingdom’s pension transfer rules – transfers out of KiwiSaver No clause Submission (Charter Square Services) As a result of a change to the Qualified Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme (QROPS) rules under the domestic law of the United Kingdom (UK), no KiwiSaver schemes qualify as QROPS and therefore a person who has transferred their UK pension scheme into a KiwiSaver scheme cannot even transfer to any other KiwiSaver scheme. The only feasible way to address this issue is with an urgent change to New Zealand legislation that allows those that have previously transferred their UK pension funds into a KiwiSaver to transfer out either back to a UK pension scheme or to another QROPS. This will require urgent action on behalf of the New Zealand Government. Comment This submission does not relate to any of the remedial amendments contained in the bill and is not a New Zealand tax issue. The UK’s QROPS rules set out the conditions under which a person with a UK pension scheme may transfer their funds to an overseas pension scheme. One of the reasons that the UK allows transfers of pension savings to be made free of UK tax is so that individuals leaving the UK permanently can simplify their affairs by taking their pension savings with them. However, there are safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the UK tax system and pension regime. In order to transfer out of a UK scheme, the receiving overseas scheme must be a QROPS. To qualify as a QROPS, a number of requirements must be met, including that the scheme is locked in until retirement. If a transfer is made from a UK scheme to a non-QROPS scheme, the individual is subject to a penalty of up to 55 percent of the transfer. This could be to discourage individuals from transferring to schemes where individuals have easy access to their funds or where HMRC does not have access to information about an individual’s funds. After this, there may be little that the UK is able to do to control what happens to the funds. Officials understand that the QROPS eligibility rules have recently changed, in particular with respect to the “pension age test” that schemes must satisfy. Officials understand that under the pension age test, funds must remain locked in until at least the age of 55, with early withdrawal only in cases of serious illness. This change came into effect on 6 April 2015 as part of the UK’s new policy on “pension flexibility”, which allows individuals to withdraw their entire UK pension as a lump sum, rather than requiring them to use a certain portion to fund a “pension for life”. As part of this policy change to make it easier for people to access their funds at and after the age of 55, they have tightened access to the QROPS regime. 115 Previously, for a New Zealand scheme to qualify as a QROPS they either had to be a KiwiSaver scheme or they had to satisfy the pension age test. From 6 April 2015, officials understand that all schemes must satisfy the pension age test and carve-outs are no longer provided. While KiwiSaver schemes are locked in until the age of 65, there are a number of permitted early withdrawals which mean that KiwiSaver schemes breach the pension age test. These include for example, withdrawals for the purchase of a first home and in the case of financial hardship, as well as the tax withdrawal facility. New Zealand officials are engaging with HMRC officials in order to fully understand the nature and implications of the recent changes to the QROPS regime. Officials understand that KiwiSaver schemes will not be able to qualify as QROPS on a go-forward basis, because of inherent differences between the UK and New Zealand retirement savings systems, but are working towards finding a practical solution in relation to “legacy transfers”. These legacy transfers are where a UK scheme and New Zealand QROPS scheme have signed off on a transfer, but the funds were not received by the New Zealand scheme until after 6 April 2015 (or have not yet been received). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The United Kingdom’s pension transfer rules – New Zealand receiving scheme should pay the tax liability out of a client’s transferred funds directly to Inland Revenue No clause Submissions (Baucher Consulting Limited, Charter Square Services) The foreign superannuation tax liability should arise upon the transfer of a foreign superannuation interest into the New Zealand scheme and the tax liability should be paid directly by the New Zealand receiving scheme to Inland Revenue out of the individual’s transferred funds. This would ensure a more prompt payment of tax. There is uncertainty about whether withdrawals from KiwiSaver are allowed under the UK’s QROPS rules and whether they could be classed as an unauthorised payment. Payment of the tax directly to Inland Revenue would not be an unauthorised payment under the UK’s rules and therefore would not be subject to an unauthorised payments charge. (Baucher Consulting Limited) The foreign superannuation tax withdrawal mechanism is preventing KiwiSaver schemes from qualifying as QROPS. If the tax liability were paid by the scheme, then no payment has been made to the member and therefore no issue exists. (Charter Square Services) 116 Comment Officials note that under the foreign superannuation rules, a tax liability is triggered at the time the foreign superannuation interest is transferred into a superannuation scheme in New Zealand. However, as with other forms of taxable income where there is no withholding, the income needs to be included in a person’s income tax return at the end of the income year. As part of the introduction of the new foreign superannuation rules, a new category of permitted withdrawal was introduced into the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to allow individuals who have transferred their foreign superannuation interest into a KiwiSaver scheme to withdraw the amount of tax payable on the transfer (schedule 1, clause 14C). This recognises that people may wish to transfer their foreign superannuation into a locked-in New Zealand scheme such as KiwiSaver, but may not have the funds available to pay their tax liability. Officials note that this facility is available to transfers from all foreign superannuation schemes, not just those originating in the UK. Officials also note that the legislation already mandates direct payment of the tax liability to Inland Revenue in certain circumstances when the tax withdrawal facility is used. Clause 14C(5)(b) provides that “if payment to a person other than the member is possible, \[the trustees or the manager of the KiwiSaver scheme must\] pay to the Commissioner the amount of the withdrawal.” Impact on ability to qualify as QROPS Charter Square Services’ submission is on the basis that the foreign superannuation tax withdrawal mechanism is what is preventing KiwiSaver schemes from qualifying as QROPS. They submit that if the tax liability were paid by the scheme, then no payment has been made to the member and therefore no issue exists. As noted above, the KiwiSaver rules already require the direct payment of the tax liability to the Commissioner in certain circumstances. At the time that the foreign superannuation withdrawal tax facility was designed, officials confirmed with HMRC that the introduction of the withdrawal facility would not in itself impact the ability of KiwiSaver schemes to qualify as QROPS. This was stated on page 27 of the Officials’ Report on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Officials understand that the QROPS eligibility rules have recently changed, in particular with respect to the “pension age test” that schemes must satisfy. Officials understand that under the pension age test, funds must remain locked in until at least the age of 55, with early withdrawal only in cases of serious illness. This change came into effect on 6 April 2015 as part of the UK’s new policy on “pension flexibility”, which allows individuals to withdraw their entire UK pension as a lump sum, rather than requiring them to use a certain portion to fund a “pension for life”. As part of this policy change to make it easier for people to access their funds at and after the age of 55, they have tightened access to the QROPS regime. 117 Previously, for a New Zealand scheme to qualify as a QROPS they either had to be a KiwiSaver scheme or they had to satisfy the pension age test. From 6 April 2015, officials understand that all schemes must satisfy the pension age test and carve-outs are no longer provided. While KiwiSaver schemes are locked in until the age of 65, there are a number of permitted early withdrawals which mean that KiwiSaver schemes breach the pension age test. These include for example, withdrawals for the purchase of a first home and in the case of financial hardship, as well as the tax withdrawal facility. New Zealand officials are engaging with HMRC officials in order to fully understand the nature and implications of the recent changes to the QROPS regime. Officials understand that KiwiSaver schemes will not be able to qualify as QROPS on a go-forward basis, because of inherent differences between the UK and New Zealand retirement savings systems, but are working towards finding a practical solution in relation to “legacy transfers”. These legacy transfers are where a UK scheme and New Zealand QROPS scheme have signed off on a transfer, but the funds were not received by the New Zealand scheme until after 6 April 2015 (or have not yet been received). Unauthorised payments Officials understand that under the QROPS rules, once a person has transferred their pensio n scheme to a QROPS (with no UK tax or penalty), if they make a withdrawal and have been a UK tax resident in any of the five preceding tax years, the withdrawal could be deemed to be an “unauthorised payment” and could be subject to an unauthorised payments charge and surcharge of up to 55 percent. Baucher Consulting Limited submits that there is uncertainty about whether withdrawals from KiwiSaver are allowed under the UK’s QROPS rules. These withdrawals could be classed as unauthorised payments and could be subject to a penalty charge and surcharge in the UK. They also submit that payment of the tax directly to Inland Revenue would not be an unauthorised payment under the UK’s rules and therefore would not be subject to an unauthorised payments charge. Note that unauthorised payments are not exhaustively defined in the UK’s legislation, but are simply payments that do not meet the legislative definition of an “authorised payment”. Officials understand from HMRC guidance that whether the payment is made to or on behalf of the member is not relevant in determining whether a withdrawal from the person’s transferred funds is an unauthorised payment. Immediacy of tax payment The submitters state that having the tax liability created at the time of transfer and paid directly by the receiving scheme to Inland Revenue would mean that Inland Revenue “would not have to wait for a year-end income tax return to determine the tax liability and payment would be made immediately” (Charter Square Services) and that “it should also ensure prompter payment of the relevant tax liabilities on transfer” (Baucher Consulting Limited). Officials understand that the basis of these submissions is that the tax should be withheld when a transfer is made from a foreign superannuation scheme into KiwiSaver. A clip-the-ticket approach was considered when the foreign superannuation rules were designed, but was not chosen partly due to the costs and complexities associated with implementation, both for Inland Revenue and providers. 118 An important feature of the foreign superannuation tax withdrawal facility is that the use of the facilit y is optional. It provides taxpayers with flexibility in the event that they wish to use other funds to pay their tax liability, or if the laws of their previous country of residence place strict restrictions on what can be done with their funds post-transfer, as with the UK’s QROPS rules, for example. Including the relevant amount in their income tax return ensures that the individual pays the correct amount of tax depending on their circumstances, as the amount of tax payable depends on a number of factors, including the gains derived by the foreign superannuation while the person has been a New Zealand resident, the person’s total taxable income for the year, and whether they are eligible to take any deductions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Taxation of UK pension schemes No clause Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited) There should be a less regressive tax treatment of UK pension schemes to encourage funds into New Zealand. Comment The decision to transfer a financial asset, such as a pension scheme, to New Zealand is a significant one and tax should not be the only consideration. The intent of the foreign superannuation rules is to provide a tax-neutral setting in which an individual can make a fully informed decision about whether or not to transfer their foreign superannuation interest to New Zealand. The rules were designed to create a level-playing field between foreign superannuation assets and other financial assets, while recognising special features of retirement savings – particularly the fact that superannuation schemes are often locked in until retirement. The amount of tax payable as calculated under the foreign superannuation rules is dependent on the gains that have accrued in the person’s foreign superannuation scheme while they have been a New Zealand resident. The amount of tax payable reflects the amount that should have been paid on accrual, but rolls up the tax liability until a lump sum is received with an interest factor to account for the deferral benefit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 119 Issue: Tax rate on foreign superannuation transfers should be lower No clause Submissions (Baucher Consulting Limited, Charter Square Services) Transfers to schemes should be taxed based on an individual’s prescribed investor rate. (Baucher Consulting Limited) There should be a flat tax rate on the transfers, rather than a variable income tax–related rate. The rate could be set with reference to income tax and if it is we would suggest a rate between 15% and 17.5%. (Charter Square Services) Comment Officials note that similar submissions were made following the release in 2012 of the issues paper on the taxation of foreign superannuation and again when the foreign superannuation rules were considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill. While not identical to these submissions, they similarly provided that lump sums should not be taxed at a person’s marginal tax rate and instead should be subject to a lower rate of tax. Officials noted on page 47 of the Officials’ Report on submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill that the general issue also exists in relat ion to other lump-sum payments (for example, compensatory payments). No relief is provided in relation to other lump sums, so a change here would set a precedent for other lump- sum payments. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 120 Issue: Drafting clarification – further contributions to a foreign superannuation scheme while New Zealand tax-resident are taxed under the foreign superannuation rules No clause Submission (Independent Advisor to the Select Committee) The rules should be amended to clarify that when an individual first acquires rights in a foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident (and is therefore subject to the foreign superannuation tax rules in section CF 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007), any subsequent contributions made to the scheme while they are New Zealand-resident are considered to be part of the interest in the superannuation scheme acquired while non-resident, and are taxed under the foreign superannuation rules, rather than under the FIF rules. Comment An interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is taxed under the foreign superannuation tax rules in section CF 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, if the rights in the scheme are acquired while the person is non-resident for tax purposes. If they are a New Zealand tax resident at the time of acquisition, they must account for tax under the FIF rules. When an individual first acquires an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while non- resident, and continues to contribute to the scheme while New Zealand-resident, the policy intent is that the person is taxed under the foreign superannuation tax rules in relation to the whole interest. On pages 6 and 7 of the Officials’ Report to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill, officials considered that in such a case, the individual should not be required to apportion their interest in the scheme between the foreign superannuation rules and the FIF rules as this would be highly complex and compliance-heavy. Officials consider that the current drafting achieves this policy intent, but could be clarified to provide greater certainty, particularly when the foreign superannuation scheme is constituted as a trust because each contribution to the scheme could constitute a new settlement on the trust and could therefore be considered a separate interest in the foreign superannuation scheme. When a person first acquires interests in a foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident and makes additional contributions to the scheme while New Zealand-resident, these together should be considered a single interest in the scheme for the purposes of the foreign superannuation rules. Officials consider that the amendment should be retrospective to the beginning of the new foreign superannuation rules, 1 April 2014, as it clarifies the existing position. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 121 MIXED-USE ASSETS – INTEREST EXPENDITURE Clauses 91 to 93 Submission (EY) As presently drafted, the proposed amendments to section DG 11 would seem to result in so me overlap of the apportionment and limitation rules, so far as interest expenditure is concerned. The proposed amendments to section DG 11 appear to provide a self-contained set of apportionment and limitation provisions for interest expenditure when mixed-use assets are owned by certain close companies. Yet the general section DG 9(2) apportionment formula would still apply and would still include interest as part of the “expenditure” item. We assume no such element of double limitation is intended. Comment The submitter has correctly identified the intended interaction between the proposed new formula for interest expenditure apportionment in section DG 11(3B), and the current formula in section DG 9(2), in that there should be no double limitation. Officials agree that this aspect of the drafting should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 122 DISPUTES PROCEDURES Clauses 236 and 241 Issue: Commissioner’s ability to truncate the disputes process by agreement under a taxpayer-initiated dispute Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The proposed amendments should be deleted. (EY) Alternatively, the proposed amendments should be revised so that neither the taxpayer nor the Commissioner is bound by the exclusion rule. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Comment Under current law, the Commissioner must issue a Statement of Position in response to a taxpayer’s Statement of Posit ion. When the Commissioner and taxpayer agree that a dispute should proceed to the challenge phase, this has the potential to delay a dispute unnecessarily and impose unnecessary administration costs. The proposed amendments ensure that truncation is allowed in a taxpayer-initiated dispute after the taxpayer has issued a Statement of Position without requiring the Commissioner to first issue a Statement of Position. The Commissioner and taxpayer must agree in writing to truncate a dispute. Submitters were concerned that applying the exclusion rule only to a taxpayer in a truncated dispute could place the Commissioner in a different and stronger position than the taxpayer. Officials consider that a taxpayer could avoid the application of the exclusion rule in this way by not seeking to truncate the dispute after issuing their Statement of Position. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Commissioner’s ability to truncate the disputes process under a taxpayer- initiated dispute Submission (Matter raised by officials) The scope of the remedial change should be expanded so that in a taxpayer-initiated dispute when a taxpayer has issued a Statement of Position, the Commissioner should not be required to issue a Statement of Position if any of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply. The exclusion rule should not apply in a taxpayer-initiated dispute after a taxpayer has issued their Statement of Position if any of the exceptions other than the exceptions for truncation by agreement apply. 123 Comment Under current law, the Commissioner must issue a Statement of Position in response to a taxpayer’s Statement of Position even if one of the exceptions to completing the disputes process applies. Agreement between the Commissioner and a taxpayer to truncate the disputes process is only one of the circumstances set out in section 89N(1) when the requirement to complete the full disputes process does not apply. The other circumstances are if: • in the Commissioner’s opinion the taxpayer has in the course of the dispute committed an offence that has effectively delayed the process; • a taxpayer involved in a dispute, or an associated person of the taxpayer, has taken steps to relocate their assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax; • the taxpayer has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute or an associated person of the taxpayer involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun review proceedings; • during the dispute, the taxpayer fails to comply with a request under a statute for information relating to the dispute and fails to comply within the period that is specific in the request; and • the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree in writing to suspend the dispute pending a decision in a separate test case that is being challenged. Officials consider all of these situations could potentially apply in the period between the taxpayer issuing their Statement of Position and the Commissioner issuing hers. It would be contrary to the policy intent of the exceptions in section 89N(1) if the Commissioner was required to issue a Statement of Position when one of the exceptions applied. In these other circumstances it would not be appropriate for the taxpayer to be bound by the exclusion rule. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 124 PROPERTY TRANSFER RULES Clauses 149 to 152 Issue: Definition of “settlement of relationship property” Submission (Ne w Zealand Law Society) The definition of “settlement of relationship property” in proposed section FB 1B defines the transactions that are eligible for the concessionary rollover relief under subpart FB. The proposed amendment to the definition broadens the range of transactions that are eligible for the rollover relief. The Commentary on the bill explains that the reference to “between parties” is to be deleted so that transfers of property between one of the parties to the agreement and a third party (such as a family trust) are included. However, the proposed definition of “settlement of relationship property” goes further than that, in that neither the transferor nor the transferee need to be parties to the relationship property agreement. The consequence of this approach appears to be that transactions between two trusts (such as a resettlement) under a relationship property agreement will be subject to the concessionary treatment in subpart FB. The concessionary treatment should extend to such situations (as was the case prior to the Income Tax Act 2007), but we are concerned that Inland Revenue may “read down” the new definition, given that the Commentary on the bill implies that the transferor must be a party to the relationship property agreement. Officials should clarify that the change in the meaning of “settlement of relationship property” means that neither the transferor nor the transferee need to be a party to the relationship property agreement and, as such, subpart FB will apply to the resettlement of trust property under a relationship property agreement. Comment Officials agree that the proposed amendment to the definition of “settlement of relat ionship property” is intended to broaden the category of transactions that are eligible for rollover relief, including a resettlement of trust property. However, officials have concerns about the breadth of the submitter’s proposal to extend the definition. Specifically, officials consider that it may not be appropriate to provide rollover relief for transactions between a party to the relationship property agreement and a third party. Officials consider that the proposed amendment should be limited to transactions between the parties to the relationship property agreement or associated persons. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, by clarifying the proposed amendment to the definition of “settlement of relationship property” should limit the rollover relief to transactions between the parties to the relationship property agreement and associated persons. 125 Issue: Application date of definition of “settlement of relationship property” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed change to the definition of “settlement of relationship property” will affect whether the transferor or the transferee bears the income tax liability arising from the transfer of property (such as depreciable property) under a relationship property agreement. These tax implications would (or at least should) have been taken into account by the parties in determining a fair split of relationship property. If the change to the definition of “settlement of relationship property” is enacted with retroactive effect, this could have a significant impact on the financial position of parties who have settled relationship property in good faith, before the date of enactment. Comment Officials agree with the submission that a retroactive change could affect the financial positions of people who have previously settled relationship property. Officials propose, therefore, that the application date for the changes to the definition of “settlement of relationship property” should be the date of enactment of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Tax treatment of transfers of relationship property Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section FB 1C is intended to be a rollover relief provision to deal with settlements of relationship property not otherwise dealt with by a specific provision in subpart FB. Section FB 1C ensures: • the transferor has no tax consequences on disposal; and • the transferee acquires not only the property, but all the characteristics of the transferor with respect to that property – for example, date of acquisition, cost at acquisition, and intent ion of acquisit io n. There is arguably a mismatch between proposed section FB 1C(1) (which suggests that a transferor is liable for any tax arising on transfer of the property to the transferee) and proposed section FB 1C(2) (which states that a transferor is not liable for a tax obligation that would otherwise arise as a result of disposing of the property). 126 Comment Officials consider section FB 1C should be clarified so, for tax purposes, the disposal and acquisition under the relationship property agreement is disregarded. The amendment should also clarify that the transferor is liable for any tax obligations that arise before the transfer under the relationship property agreement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Distribution by a trustee under an arrangement Submission (Matter raised by officials) Under sections FC 1(1)(c) and FC 2(1), a distribution of property from a trustee to a beneficiary of the trust is deemed to be a disposal and acquisition at market value. In some circumstances this is an inappropriate outcome. The proposed amendment to section FC 1(1)(c) provides that a distribution will not be deemed to be at market value when it is part of an arrangement under which a beneficiary pays an amount for the property. The exception should only apply where the beneficiary pays an arm’s length amount of money. Comment Limiting the exception to situations when an arm’s length amount has been paid will better align with the general approach that deems the disposal to be at market value. When a beneficiary pays an amount that is not at arm’s length then it seems appropriate to deem the disposal and acquisition to be at market value. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 127 APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT RULES TO NON- RESIDENTS Clause 120 Submission (EY) The proposed replacement for section EW 9(4)(b) does not achieve the stated aim. It is inappropriate for the section to refer to the trustee, together with the trust, as a trust, is neither a separate legal entity nor recognised as a person for income tax purposes. Section EW 9(4)(b) should be rewritten more simply and directly along the lines that the amount is assessable income of the trustee under section HC 25. Comment Because the drafting is expressed by way of negative statements, the submitter believes this will give rise to confusion rather improving clarity. Officials agree that the drafting of the proposed amendment should be reviewed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 128 PETROLEUM MINING RULES Clauses 97, 98, 100, 101, 213(49), (50), (72) and (73) Submission (Chapman Tripp) We support the amendments to the petroleum mining rules, with the exception of clause 213(73). The savings provision for the definition of “petroleum permit” in clause 213(73) is not appropriate. Comment Section DT 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies to arrangements under which a taxpayer incurs petroleum exploration expenditure and subsequently receives economic reimbursement of that expenditure. The section applies to reduce the deductions for petroleum exploration expenditure to the extent of the economic reimbursement. Section DT 2 is not intended to apply to an arrangement under which petroleum exploration expenditure has been allowed and related property transferred and the consideration derived is fully liable for income tax. However, section DT 2 should continue to apply to such arrangements entered into before the introduction of the bill to the extent non-taxable economic reimbursement may occur in the future. We agree the savings provision should be amended to address the concern of the submitter about consideration derived that is fully taxable in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 129 TRANSITIONAL RESIDENTS – DEFINITION Clause 176 Submission (PwC) PwC supports the clarification to the definition of transitional resident. Further work is required, however, to identify and address other legislative anomalies with the current transitional residence rules. In particular, greater clarity is still required over when taxpayers are eligible to access their transitional residence exemption period. Comment The policy intent for the transitional resident rules is to reduce tax barriers to international recruitment and to encourage New Zealanders who have lived overseas to return to New Zealand to live and work. The tax relief granted is an exemption from income tax on certain foreign-sourced income during the period of relief. The submission raises separate policy issues relating to the transit ional resident rules. The amendment in the bill is of a remedial and clarifying nature only and is not intended to change the effect of the transitional resident rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 130 BAD DEBT DEDUCTION AND APPLICATION OF THE CAPITAL LIMITATION Clauses 84(4), (7) and 257 Issue: Clarifying that the general capital limitation will not prevent a deduction for a bad debt of a financial arrangement Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, Russell McVeagh) The Group strongly supports the proposed amendments to clarify that the general capital limitation will not prevent a deduction for a bad debt of the principal amount of a financial arrangement (subject to the Group’s comments on aspects of the proposed amendment). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) KPMG supports the remedial amendments to the bad debt deductibility rules to clarify that the capital limitation does not apply to prevent a bad debt deduction for a loan if the lender has entered into the debt in the normal course of business. (KPMG) Russell McVeagh agrees with the need to clarify, with retrospective effect, the application of the capital/revenue distinction to the deductibility of bad debts (subject to their comments on aspects of the proposed amendment). (Russell McVeagh) Comment In general terms, the principal amount of a financial arrangement (for example, a loan) is on capital account. This was explicitly stated in the Income Tax Act 1976. Again in general terms, a bad debt deduction is not allowed for a loss of capital. To achieve that policy outcome, the current bad debt deduction rule is subject to the capital limitation (which denies a deduction for an expenditure or loss of capital). An exception to the capital limitation for bad debts applies to taxpayers (business holders or dealers) who carry on a business of holding or dealing in financial arrangements. This is because, under common law, the principal amount of loans entered into in the ordinary course of a moneylending (banks, for example) or dealing businesses are on revenue account and not on capital account. The Commissioner applies the law consistent with the policy objectives, so that: • financial arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of carrying on a holding or dealing business are not considered to be subject to the capital limitation; and • financial arrangements held by a business holder or dealer outside the holding or dealing business are subject to the capital limitation. 131 While the current law achieves the intended policy outcome, the Rewrite Advisory Panel recommended the amendment in the bill as an improvement to the legislation to clarify the policy intention of the relationship between the bad debt deduction rule and the capital limitation. This fo llowed a submission to the Panel that the current bad debt deduction rule contained a potential unintended legislative change arising from the rewrite of income tax legislation. The amendment is made at the recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel to limit the application of the capital limitation rather than leave that to a matter of interpretation. This is intended to reduce compliance and administration costs. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Consistency of bad debt deduction rule with pre-2004 position Submissions (Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) The proposed new test is not consistent with the position prior to 2004 and not appropriate for financial arrangement debt. (Chapman Tripp) The Income Tax Act 2004 removed the 1994 automatic exclusion from the capital limitation for deductions determined under part E, which included financial arrangement bad debts. (Chapman Tripp) The amendments to section DB 31(6)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section DB 23(6)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be omitted. (Chapman Tripp) Section DB 31(6)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section DB 23(6)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2004 be replaced with “the general limitations apply, except that subsections (2) and (3) override the capital limitation.” (Chapman Tripp) The test of “entered into in the ordinary course of business” is not consistent with the position prior to 2004. (Chapman Tripp) The words “for a financial arrangement entered into in the ordinary course of business” should be removed from proposed new section DB 31(6)(b)(iii) (and the equivalent amendment to the 2004 Act) on the basis that these words introduce a new requirement not present in the pre- rewrite section, and which appear to defeat the purpose of the proposed amendment and substantially limit its effectiveness. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Amendments addressing the bad debt deduction and the capital limitation do not achieve their stated purpose. (Russell McVeagh) The words “for a financial arrangement entered into in the ordinary course of business” should be omitted from clauses 84(4) and 257. (Russell McVeagh) 132 Comment The drafting of the bad debt deduction rule in the Income Tax Act 2004 (and re-enacted in the Income Tax Act 2007) was intended to clarify the policy intention for financial arrangements of a business holder or dealer not entered into in the course of carrying on their business. Such clarifications were considered to be within the scope of the rewrite of income tax legislation. The Commentary on the bill noted that the policy for the bad debt deduction rule for a business holder and dealer was recommended by the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure (the Brash Committee). 4 The policy is that the bad debt deduction rule for financial arrangements should maintain the common law position in relation to bad debt deductions, except for bad debts entered into between associated persons. Under the common law, a bad debt suffered by a business holder or dealer which related to a financial arrangement entered into in the ordinary course of business was considered to be on revenue account. In this circumstance, common law held that a bad debt deduction was allowed for a loss of principal and accrued interest, provided some procedural requirements were satisfied. Common law also considered that a debt entered into outside the normal or ordinary course of business would be usually treated as a non-deductible capital loss as a result of applying the capital/revenue tests. Chapman Tripp suggests the comments in the Commentary on the bill referring to Brash Committee recommendations are simply referring to the fact that deductions for losses were not to be universally available. Officials note that the comments in the Commentary are directly concerned with the policy for bad debt deductions. A statement relating to the deductibility of expenditure and losses (that is, economic interest costs) under the financial arrangement rules was set out later in the Brash Committee’s report. 5 Officials agree that the bad debt deduction rule in the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007 has the potential to produce a different outcome for financial arrangements held outside a holding or dealing business from that given by the Income Tax Act 1994. Officials consider that non-deductibility of a bad debt for a business holder or dealer would be a rare occurrence. Officials also agreed with the Panel, that there is some uncertainty over whether a special purpose vehicle that is a holder of financial arrangements would be allowed a bad debt deduction under the existing law. The amendment is intended to clarify the law to address this uncertainty. 4 Report of the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure, April 1987, paras 32-41, comment on drafting para 2.632-41, comment on drafting para 2.6. 5 Report of the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure, April 1987, paragraphs 64-67. 133 The following examples illustrate the type of situation when it could be considered appropriate that no deduction be allowed for a loss of capital. Example 1 A financial institution enters into a joint venture with other financial institutions through a joint venture company to develop an activity that relates to the business structure of each of the financial institutions (such as a data clearing house operation that serves all partners). The joint venture company is not an associated person of any of the financial institutions (25% interest for each of the financial institutions). Each institution individually carries on a business of either holding or dealing in financial arrangement (for example, banking). The joint venture partners contribute their capital by debt. If the joint venture operation is not successful, its value is dissipated and the joint venture company becomes unable to pay its debts. The debt becomes uncollectible, and is bad. From a policy perspective, a debt of this nature relates to the capital structure of the financial institution’s business. If the debt becomes bad it is a loss of capital and no deduction should be allowed. Example 2 Company X’s business includes the supply of certain goods and the making of loans to customers. Company X entered into an arrangement with a major customer, Company Y, which indicated it could buy goods from another supplier. Under the arrangement Company X made a loan to Company Y and Company Y agreed to buy certain goods exclusively from Company X. The loans are the same as or similar to loans made to other customers (having similar interest rates and other terms). However, the bad debt under the loan to Company Y is a capital loss because the main purpose of the loans was to obtain a capital advantage (an exclusive supply agreement). This type of loan is generally not made in the ordinary course of business because a moneylending business is usually concerned with interest returns rather than securing a long-term capital advantage. Example 3 A company in financial difficulty is lent money by a minority shareholder to protect the shareholder’s investment in that company. That type of loan is generally not made in the ordinary course of business because a moneylending business does not usually provide funds to an entity having significant credit risk unless the interest rate is high enough to compensate for the credit risk. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 134 Issue: Financial arrangements are on revenue account Submission (Chapman Tripp) Financial arrangements are necessarily on revenue account. Comment The principal amount of a financial arrangement is generally considered to be an item of capital. This was very clearly stated in the Income Tax Act 1976 and the policy remains unchanged from that time. The only exceptions to this general principle are: • the principal amount of financial arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of a holding or dealing business, which are treated as being on revenue account; • discounts or losses on disposal that are part of the economic interest return or cost of the arrangement. The policy of the financial arrangement rules is primarily to determine the timing and quantification of income and expenditure relating to the economic interest arising under a financial arrangement. The economic interest under a financial arrangement is the return or cost to the lender and borrower respectively over the term of the arrangement. These returns or costs include a discount to face value. For income tax purposes, the economic interest incurred or derived from a financial arrangement is treated as being interest and placed on revenue account, and spread over the life of the arrangement. The deductibility of economic interest incurred under a financial arrangement must satisfy the general permission (the business test or nexus with income test). Economic interest derived is always income of the recipient. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarifying the application of the capital limitation to bad debts Submissions (Chapman Tripp) It is not clear how the test of “entered into the ordinary course of business” is to be applied. It is not clear when the “carrying on a business of dealing/holding” test would be met. The proposed “ordinary course of business” test would apply to deny a deduction. 135 Comment Officials consider it is a matter of fact of whether and when a financial arrangement was entered into in the ordinary course of business. Officials think this test is implied in the current law when considering the bad debt deduction rule. Officials consider the wording is intended to reflect that implied test but accept that the new wording can be interpreted as a separate test. Officials agree that the proposed “ordinary course of business” test would deny a deduction for a bad debt on capital account. This is an intended policy outcome. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Application of the capital limitation to bad debts Submission (Chapman Tripp) The capital limitation is not intended to apply to bad debts and this is reinforced when a person sells a debt for a loss because of a decline in creditworthiness: • the same test as that set out in section DB 31(3)(b) and (c) applies; and • there is no capital limitation. Comment When a loan is disposed of at a discount because of a decline in creditworthiness of the borrower, the policy intent is that a decline in value on disposal due to creditworthiness factors is not normally deductible. However, an exception to this general rule applies for a business holder or dealer if the loan was held within a holding or dealing business. Officials consider the law allows a bad debt deduction to a business holder or dealer for a decline in creditworthiness for a financial arrangement held within that business (but not otherwise) and this outcome is entirely consistent with the policy intention. The bad debt deduction rule is an important provision for business because it allows a business holder or dealer to effectively advance the timing of the deduction for the discounted value of the loan to when the loan is considered unrecoverable. In the absence of the bad debt deduction rule, the business holder or dealer would have to wait until disposal or maturity of the loan to have the deduction for the decline in creditworthiness. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 136 Issue: Special purpose vehicles holding financial arrangements Submissions (Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh) It is unclear how the capital limitation would apply to bad debts in the context of: • covered bond arrangements where the provision will only become applicable at the point the covered bond guarantor ceases to maintain Financial Institution Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) status and is deemed to acquire a financial arrangement; and • securitisations where the financial arrangements are acquired at the outset of the arrangement and where no further financial arrangements are acquired following that time. (Chapman Tripp) A special purpose vehicle may acquire a portfolio of assets and hold those assets until maturity. As the acquisition of the portfolio would be a one-off transaction, could it be said that each financial arrangement was “entered into in the ordinary course of business”? (Russell McVeagh) Comment These submissions relate to an SPV holding financial arrangements under a securitisation or covered bond arrangement. The key questions relate to whether: • the SPV is a business holder or dealer; or • a financial arrangement for which a bad debt deduction is sought meets the requirement that the arrangement was entered into in the ordinary course of business. For income tax purposes, an SPV may hold financial arrangements as either: • a stand-alone taxpayer that acquires and holds a portfolio of loans in consideration for issuing a securitised asset; or • a transparent entity, where the SPV acquires a portfolio of loans from a bank in consideration for issuing the bank with a securitised asset. For income tax purposes, if the SPV meets certain requirements, the SPV’s portfolio is treated as continuing to be held as part of the bank’s business. If those requirements cease to be satisfied, the SPV is deemed, for income tax purposes, to acquire the financial arrangements from the bank. Chapman Tripp and Russell McVeagh consider that the proposed amendment raises uncertainty about whether a stand-alone SPV is allowed a bad debt deduction for a principal amount of a financial arrangement if the acquisition of the portfolio of loans is a one-off transaction and no other lending activity occurs. Russell McVeagh comments that this uncertainty would not arise if the law is restored to the position under the Income Tax Act 1994. As a stand-alone taxpayer, a bad debt deduction for the principal amount of a loan is allowed if the SPV satisfies the requirements of the bad debt deduction rule for business holders or dealers. This is because financial arrangements entered into, held, or dealt with in the course of a holding or dealing business are normally on revenue account, and the capital limitation would not apply. 137 The submissions raise the following issues: • Is an SPV carrying on a business of holding, dealing or carrying on a passive investment activity if it makes a one-off transaction to acquire a portfolio of financial arrangements and does nothing more than hold those assets to maturity carrying on a business of holding or dealing? • If it is assumed that an SPV carries on a business of holding or dealing, are there circumstances in which a one-off transaction made by the SPV to acquire a portfolio of financial arrangements to be held to maturity is not made in the ordinary course of carrying on that business? It is a question of fact whether a SPV is a business holder or dealer if it acquires its portfolio of financial arrangements in a one-off transaction. If such a SPV is not a business holder or dealer, officials consider it would not have been allowed a bad debt deduction for the principal amount of a financial arrangement under any of the bad debt deduction provisions of the Income Tax Acts –1976, 1994, 2004 or 2007. The SPV should however be allowed a bad debt deduction for accrued interest income that has been written off as a bad debt. If the SPV is assumed to be a business holder or dealer, it is a question of fact whether the first one-off transaction is made in the ordinary course of that business (on revenue account) or is made to establish that business (a capital transaction). If the facts show that such a one-off transaction is on capital account, officials consider an SPV that is a business holder or dealer: • might have been allowed a bad debt deduction for the principal amount of a loan acquired in that one-off transaction under the Income Tax Act 1994; and • might not have been allowed a bad debt deduction under the Income Tax Act 2004 or Income Tax Act 2007 for the principal amount of a loan acquired. We are not aware of any circumstance in which this has occurred. Officials note that: • The wording of the proposed amendment should be reviewed to ensure that the capital limitation does not deny a bad debt deduction for a financial arrangement held or dealt with within a holding or dealing business. • This submission raises issues relating to the business test for special purpose vehicles holding securitised loans or covered bonds that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Chapman Tripp has raised a concern that the proposed amendment gives rise to uncertainty about the tax treatment of the SPV in relation to bad debts after the SPV loses its “transparent status”. We note that the “transparency” provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 were enacted after the Reserve Bank introduced its Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities scheme in 2008 in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. From this time, securitisation and covered bond arrangements entered into by banks were after enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 2007. The bad debt deduction provision in both of these Acts is clear that the capital limitation applied to the bad debt deduction rule. 138 Officials note that: • this submission raises the same issues for the application of the bad debt deduction provision to an SPV that is a stand-alone taxpayer; • the wording of the proposed amendment should be reviewed to ensure that the capital limitation does not deny a bad debt deduction for a financial arrangement held or dealt with within a holding or dealing business; • this submission raises issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme; and • the Panel recommended that a review of the application of the financial arrangements rules in relation to securitisation vehicles be a matter that is placed on the tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Application to “mum and dad” investors Submission (Mark Scott) The clauses as proposed represent a back-dated narrowing of existing law that will unfairly penalise taxpayers such as Mum and Dad investors who have already returned taxable income arising under financial arrangements before the creditor company became unable to repay its debts and was placed into liquidation (for example, failed finance companies). Comment Officials consider the amendments to the capital limitation in the bad debt deduction rule have no effect on investors who are not carrying on the business of holding or dealing in financial arrangements. An example of this type of investor would be those who have derived interest income that has been accrued by the borrowing company (such as a finance company) and would be paid out on maturity of the investment. If the borrower is liquidated, the accrued income would never be paid out. The investor is normally allowed a bad debt deduction for unpaid interest on liquidation of the borrowing company. We note that recent amendments relating to this deduction mean that the “write-off” procedural requirements do not apply to such investors. If the investors are carrying on the business of holding or dealing in financial arrangements, as discussed above, the investor is normally allowed a deduction for the principal amount of a “bad” financial arrangement that was entered into in the course of carrying on that holding or dealing business, provided that certain procedural requirements are satisfied. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 139 Issue: No regulatory impact statement Submission (Chapman Tripp) There should be a regulatory impact statement on the amendment given the departure from the position before 2004. Comment The current bad debt deduction rule has been in place since the beginning of the 2005–06 income year, a period of almost 10 years. The amendment to the bad debt deduction rule proposes to amend the law to better reflect the lo ng-standing policy intention. The amendment is therefore remedial in nature. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Retrospectivity and savings Submissions (Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh) If the new “ordinary course of business” test is to be enacted, then: • The capital limitation for bad debts should be repealed with retrospective effect to 2004. • The capital limitation should be applied prospectively from the income year beginning 1 April 2016. (Chapman Tripp) The retrospective application would call into question the treatment of bad debts under previous tax posit ions. (Russell McVeagh) Comment The Panel did not recommend a “savings” provision for taxpayers who have relied on the application of the bad debt deduction rule in the Income Tax Act 1994. This is likely because it is anticipated that very few taxpayers would be affected by the Income Tax Act 2004 drafting of the bad debt deduction rule. Under the bad debt deduction rule for business holders or dealers in the Income Tax Act 1994, it is necessary to consider whether the bad debt relates to a financial arrangement connected to the ordinary course of holding or dealing business. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to clarify that the capital limitation applies to a bad debt arising in the rare circumstance that a business holder or dealer holds a financial arrangement outside the ambit of its business. 140 These submissions seem to be concerned that a risk exists for taxpayers who have previously taken a tax position that a bad debt deduction is allowed for the principal of a financial arrangement not connected with the carrying on a holding or dealing business. To take such a position, the taxpayer must have assumed that the application of the bad debt deduction rule remained constant through the 1994, 2004 and 2007 Income Tax Acts. The Finance and Expenditure Committee commented on such assumptions in its report on the Income Tax Bill 2002 (which became the Income Tax Act 2004) as follows: The provisions contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 are unclear and frequently subject to understandable misinterpretation. We recognise the risk that some practitioners, having previously misinterpreted some provisions in the old Act, may fail to realise that the rewrite Act clarifies the correct interpretation that applies to those provisions, and continue to apply their erroneous interpretation to the new Act. Such a situation should be minimised as far as possible, and we therefore encourage the Inland Revenue Department to undertake an education programme to inform practitioners that they cannot necessarily rely on their current understanding of the law, and should actively check the provisions contained in the new Act. This point raised by the Committee was referred to and commented on within the Tax Information Bulletin items for both the Income Tax Act 2004 (Vol 16, No. 6, June 2004) and Income Tax Act 2007 (Vol 20, No. 2, March 2008). The Finance and Expenditure Committee considering the Income Tax Bill 2002 also noted that Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (then known as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) and the New Zealand Law Society had advised officials on their preferred approach for transit ioning fro m the old legislat ion to new legislat ion, as fo llows: 6 The transitional provisions should allow the new Act to have effect while preserving, to the extent possible, the usefulness of existing case law and commentary and providing some protection for taxpayers against unintended change. This means the transitional provisions should be a sign-post and interpretative guide, and provide protection to taxpayers against unintended changes. We acknowledge that this leaves unintended changes to have effect where the new law is clear and unambiguous. This means that reliance must be placed on: 1. the commitments to retrospectively amend unintended changes; 2. the Rewrite Review Committee process; 3. Inland Revenue stating that it will continue to apply its published views and that it will only do otherwise on a prospective basis; 4. protection being provided to taxpayers who rely on either the old or the new law from a penalties and interest perspective. As noted on the Panel’s website, it has always been anticipated that the Government would decide to either: • promote an amendment to the rewritten legislation to reinstate the outcome given under earlier corresponding provisions; or • retain the unintended change in the legislation. 6 Letter from Institute of Chartered Accountants and the New Zealand Law Society to chief drafter, dated 30 June 2003. 141 The Panel considered whether a “savings” provision should be implemented but decided against this. Officials agree with the Panel that a savings provision is inappropriate as we are not aware of any instances in which a person carrying on a holding or dealing business has been denied a deduction for a bad debt that is not connected to that business. However, officials are aware of some instances where a bad debt deduction was sought under the business holder or dealer rule, but the facts showed in each case that the taxpayer was not carrying on that type of business. It would be appropriate in these cases that no bad debt deduction is allowed for the principal amount of the loans. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The new requirement will cause confusion in practice because it overlaps with the existing criteria for claiming a bad debt deduction Submission (Russell McVeagh) The proposed amendments will introduce a new requirement for claiming a bad debt deduction (being that the relevant loan was “entered into in the ordinary course of business”). That new requirement will cause confusion in practice because it overlaps with (and arguably contradicts) the existing criteria for claiming a bad debt deduction. Comment The proposed amendment is consistent with the Commissioner’s interpretation of the “same as or similar to” test in the existing bad debt deduction rule. The language was recommended by the Panel to explicitly state in the legislation the effect of the test implied in the “same as or similar to” wording in the bad debt deduction rule. Officials note that KPMG supports the clarification offered by the proposed amendment. We agree that there is a risk that the proposed amendment may overlap with the existing criteria that allow a bad debt deduction for a business holder or dealer. We agree the proposed amendment be reviewed to ensure that the potential overlap is addressed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 142 Issue: Application of capital limitation to section DB 31(2) and (4) Submissions (Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh) Section DB 31(2) should be amended to clarify that the capital limitation does not apply. (Chapman Tripp) The amendment should extend to bad debts losses under section DB 31(2) and (4). (Russell McVeagh) Comment The bad debt deduction rules in section DB 31(2) and (4) ensure that taxpayers are not taxed on amounts which may have been derived and included as assessable income – for example, trade debtors. If those amounts are never actually received, and deductions for bad debts were not allowed, taxpayers would pay too much income tax because they would be assessed on income which substantively was not received. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 143 CHILD SUPPORT REMEDIALS Issue: Definition of income in the child support formula Clause 14 Submission (William Somerville) Clause 14, which repeals section 35(1) to (5) of the Child Support Act 1991, should be deleted. This would have the effect of preserving the reforms made in 2013, which included indirect sources of income in the child support formula. Comment The submitter has asked that the wider definition of “adjusted taxable income” be kept in the Child Support Act 1991 and used in the child support formula assessment. “Adjusted taxable income” is used in the child support formula assessment to determine a parent’s child support income 7 and is defined in new section 35(1) as “taxable income with adjustments”. “Taxable income” is a defined term in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the adjustments include those set out in subpart MB when calculating family scheme income and Working for Families entitlements. The adjustments include attributing income in trusts and close companies to the parent in proportion to their interest in those entities. While the law change came into effect on 1 April 2015, section 35(2) of the Child Support Act 1991 states that for the first child support year only (1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016), “adjusted taxable income” is to be treated as if it were taxable income only. The adjustments are to apply from 1 April 2016 onwards. The bill seeks to amend the Child Support Act 1991 so that “adjusted taxable income” no longer includes those adjustments under subpart MB of the Income Tax Act 2007 that are used to calculate family scheme income. The result would be that “adjusted taxable income” would now refer to taxable income for the relevant tax year that is adjusted by either inflation, based on a calendar-year of employment income if the parent only has income from which withholding tax applies, or as estimated by the parent. A broader definition of “income” that includes adjustments in subpart MB could result in a fairer income measure and would reduce the need for parents to avail themselves of the departure 8 process. However, the drawbacks would be: • potentially higher administration and compliance costs; • a high implementation cost to receive, store and use the income information; and • parents may not understand the wider definition. 7 Section 12 of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 inserting new section 34 in the Child Support Act 1991. 8 In certain circumstances, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or the court may make an order allowing a departure from the formula assessment for calculating child support to reflect matters outside of the standard formula. 144 Recent analysis of the size of the potential benefit of the change found a very limited number of child support parents are expected to be affected (less than 0.5 percent of possible parents). However, all parents would be required to complete the disclosure forms. Ultimately, the costs of implementing the change now outweigh any benefits derived from the broader definition of “income” for child support purposes. However, the implementation costs are expected to be reduced following the Business transformation programme. In the meantime, there are other avenues that might be available to parents should they wish for a broader definition of income to be taken into consideration in relation to their child support relat ionship. Where the parents agree, and the receiving carer is not a social security beneficiary, the parents can agree to a private arrangement or to a voluntary agreement that reflects a broader definition of income. Alternatively, a mechanism for parents to seek a change in their entitlement or payment outside of the formula is through the departure process. The departure process provides an appropriate way of dealing with special situat ions when the formula set out in the Child Support Act produces an unfair result due to the income, earning capacity, property or financial resources of either of the parents or the qualifying child. The approach enables each child support relationship to be scrutinised on an individual basis by an Administrative Review Officer or the Family Court, according to its merits, and then an order made that is just and equitable as for the child, the receiving carer and the liable parent. The process can be initiated by a parent or by the Commissioner. For the period 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, there were around 2,900 administrative reviews initiated by parents on grounds relating to income, earning capacity, property or financial resources. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that a broader definition of income for use in the calculation of the child support formula will be reviewed again as part of the work Inland Revenue is undertaking on its Business transformation programme. Issue: Off-setting child support debt Clause 41 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 106B(3)(c) of the Child Support Act should be changed so that it clarifies that offsetting child support debt through the departure process cannot apply when the liability has already been offset by virtue of repealed sections 34 and 35 of the Act (when parents have a current liability to each other because they both care for a different child of the relationship). 145 Officials further propose that section 106B(3)(c) be amended to clarify that when offsetting has previously taken place – for example, for a particular month – further offsetting in that month cannot apply, even if there are still amounts outstanding over and above what has been previously offset. Comment In order to still provide some ability to recognise situations when a person with a current liability is owed child support payments in the past from the other parent, the bill proposes that a new departure ground to the formula assessment be established in section 105(2) of the Child Support Act 1991. Proposed section 106B(3)(c) in this bill clearly indicates that a departure for offsetting cannot apply if a child support liability has already been offset under section 152B (when parents have a current liability to each other because they both care for a different child of the relationship). As offsetting under the new departure ground can affect assessments raised before the 2013 reforms, officials propose that section 106B(3)(c) be clarified to state that offsetting cannot apply when offsetting has taken place by virtue of repealed sections 34 and 35 of the Child Support Act. These sections had been repealed and replaced by section 152B. Officials further propose that section 106B(3)(c) be amended to clarify that when offsetting has previously taken place – for example, in relation to a particular month – further offsetting in that mo nth cannot apply, even if there is a remaining liability in that month. Applying an automatic section 152B offsetting and a section 105(2) offsetting in the same month is administratively complex. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Objections to child support assessments Clause 29 Submission (Matter raised by officials) To meet fairness requirements, receiving carers should be given the right to object to child support assessments from 1 April 2015 rather than the date of enactment of this bill. Comment The bill proposes to amend the Child Support Act to give receiving carers and other payees the same object ion rights to an assessment as liable parents. 9 9 “Payees” is a term that covers domestic maintenance as well as formula assessments but there is a need to specifically refer to receiving carers because some receiving carers are not “payees” as their entitlement is nil. 146 Although the proposed amendment is to apply from the date of enactment, and therefore the right to object only becomes available to receiving carers after this date, liable parents can avail themselves of the objection right already as it is in existing law. A person should be able to object to their assessment if their liability or entitlement has increased, decreased or has not changed (but a component within the formula has – for example, a new income amount has been used that does not affect the liabilit y or ent it lement amount but is otherwise objected to). The legislation states that an objection has to be given within 28 days after the date on which notice of the decision or assessment objected to was given by the Commissioner. The child support year beginning 1 April 2015 is the first year under the new formula assessment and a number of receiving carers have made objections. To meet fairness requirements, and in recognition of the time restrictions for making objections, receiving carers should be given the right to object to child support assessments from 1 April 2015 rather than the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Commencement date for sole-parent students claiming benefit during university breaks Clause 2 Submission (Matter raised by officials) To avoid a retrospective administrative change, there should be an alternative commencement date in relation to the proposed amendment to the definition of “social security beneficiary” in the bill. Comment The proposal is for an amendment to the definition of “social security beneficiary” in section 2 of the Child Support Act to exclude from the scope of that definition full-time students who are in receipt of jobseeker student hardship support between academic years. The proposed change would allow so le–parent students who are on the student hardship benefit over the summer break to be treated as “off benefit” for child support purposes. This will significantly simplify compliance costs for these students and remove a potential discouragement to continuing study. While the proposed change is expected to come into force on the day after the date of enactment, it would apply to benefits granted on or after 1 October 2015. When the bill was drafted, the rationale for a fixed future date was to provide the Ministry of Social Development time after the law had changed to make changes to the benefit data exchange between the Ministry and Inland Revenue. However, it is possible that the bill will be enacted after this date. 147 Officials recommend that to avoid retrospective administrative changes, that the law change apply to benefits granted on or after the first day of the month following enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “child support debt” Clause 61 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend that the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 be amended to ensure that the legislation reflects the policy intent that the Commissioner may write off some or all of an amount of assessed child support and related penalties payable by: • the estate of a liable person if the liable person has died and the Commissioner is satisfied that the liable person’s estate is insufficient to pay the amount (section 180B); • a liable person if the receiving carer has died and the Commissioner is satisfied that the amount is likely to be unable to be recovered (section 180C). Comment The Child Support Amendment Act 2013 introduced sections 180B and 180C with the intention of enabling the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to write off assessment and penalty debt when either the liable parent or receiving carer in a child support relationship is deceased and the debt is uncollectable. Both of these sections refer to writing off “child support debt”, although this term is not defined. “Child support” is defined in section 2 of the Child Support Act 1991 to mean “any payment required to be made under this Act by any person towards the support of a qualifying child, whether under a formula assessment or a voluntary agreement or an order of the court”. This definition clearly does not include penalties. The use of the term “child support debt” in sections 180B and 180C of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 could be interpreted as relating to assessment amounts only rather than these amounts and penalties as the policy intended. If the legislation is not amended, situations could arise where penalty debt cannot be written off despite the fact that the Commissioner has determined that the debt is uncollectable and has already written off the associated assessment debt. The remaining penalty debt would simply continue to accrue further penalties on a monthly basis unless the Commissioner could find some basis to write the debt off under an alternative provision at a later date. 148 Officials recommend that the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 be amended to ensure that the legislation reflects the policy intent that the Commissioner has the discretion to write off some or all of an amount of assessed child support and related penalties payable by: • the estate of a liable person, if the liable person has died and the Commissioner is satisfied that the liable person’s estate is insufficient to pay the amount (section 180B of the CSAA 2013 refers); • a liable person, if the receiving carer has died and the Commissioner is satisfied that the amount is likely to be unable to be recovered from the liable person (section 180C of the CSAA 2013 refers). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 149 FOREIGN INVESTMENT VEHICLE DEFINITION IN SECTION HM 3 No clause Submission (KPMG) Section HM 3(2) currently states that: A trust that is, for Australian tax purposes, a managed investment trust under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Australia) is a foreign PIE equivalent if it meets the requirement in subsection (1)(a). We understand that the definition of a “Managed Investment Trust” is to shortly be moved from the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Australia) to the Income Tax Assessment Act 2007 (Australia). Once enacted, this will potentially make the above provision inoperative. To “future proof” section HM 3(2), we recommend that the words “or successor Act” is added after Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Australia). Comment The approach suggested in the submission is not consistent with the Parliamentary Counsel Office’s drafting practice. This is why the Income Tax Act 2007 does not include the phrase “or successor Act” in any existing provision. Furthermore, as the Taxation Administration Act 1953 is not being repealed, it is not clear that “or successor Act” would cover moving a provision from one existing Act to another. A suitable alternative would be to add “or a corresponding provision in another Act”. However, the approach typically taken in updating cross-references in tax legislation is to wait for the underlying enactment to be amended then update the cross-reference accordingly, rather than insert a general “or successor” terminology. Officials have reviewed the proposed definition of Managed Investment Trust in Subdivision 275-A of the exposure draft of the Tax Laws Amendment (New Tax System for Managed Investment Trusts) Bill 2015. This definition is not exactly the same as that in the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Officials, however, consider it continues to be consistent with the policy intent of the foreign PIE equivalent requirements. Until Australia enacts changes to this definition no certainty can be obtained in the fina l definition, or even whether any changes will occur. Officials consider the appropriate cross- reference can be more clearly drafted once any Australian amendments have been enacted. This should instead be added as a remedial item to the tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 150 REINSTATEMENT OF SECTION 68C Clause 228 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill repeals a number of provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 that relate to the earlier research and development tax credit scheme, as they are no longer necessary. A draft ing error would result in the incorrect repeal of section 68C which is situated next to the sections that were intended to be repealed. Section 68C relates to the processes supporting the payment of member tax credits for KiwiSaver members. We recommend that the clause which repeals section 68C be deleted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 151 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS – IFRS FINANCIAL REPORTING METHOD Clauses 121 and 146 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group) An amendment to section EW 15D of the Income Tax Act is proposed which would require amounts associated with a financial arrangement that are taken directly to equity for financial reporting purposes to be recognised as taxable income. A catch-up will be required in respect of past income years. The Group wishes to raise a point of clarification in respect of this amendment. The question is whether there is supposed to be a distinction drawn between “equity reserves” and “equity or other comprehensive income” as proposed to be used in sections EW 15D and EW 15G respectively. Comment Officials agree that clarification is required and have proposed amendments accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 152 BAD DEBTS – LIMITED RECOURSE ARRANGEMENTS Clause 84 Submissions (Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh) The remedial amendments to ensure the tax rules are effective in limiting bad debt deductions to the actual economic loss are supported but may need to be further amended to deal effectively with bad debts funded by certain limited recourse arrangements. Clauses 84(1) to (3), as currently crafted, are arcane and very difficult to understand, even for tax lawyers. Furthermore, it is quite likely that they do not fully achieve their intended objective. We propose to address this further with officials in advance of appearance at the Select Committee to see whether a better outcome can be proposed. (Chapman Tripp) In summary: • We agree with the need to clarify, with retrospective effect, amendments enacted by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 intended to limit bad debt deductions to reflect a person’s true economic loss. • A further remedial amendment is necessary as the provisions as drafted may not in all cases achieve a correct matching of the deduction for the bad debt loss to the income year in which income is recognised under the limited recourse arrangement. Comment Tax rules for bad debts introduced in 2014 were largely designed to limit bad debt deductions to the amounts of the debts excluding amounts funded by limited recourse arrangements. The amounts funded by limited recourse arrangements are obviously not an economic loss to the creditor/lender. This approach was supported by submitters to the original bill and is supported by submitters to this bill. The remedial amendments in the bill help to ensure that the 2014 amendments work effectively, and the changes were signalled as being necessary in the Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 26, No 4) which discussed those 2014 changes. Both submissions concern one aspect of the rules introduced in 2014 for bad debts funded by limited recourse arrangements. A bad debt deduction that is otherwise allowable in an income year may be deferred until the related limited recourse arrangement matures. However, there may be income from the limited recourse arrangement in the earlier income year when the bad debt deduction was otherwise allowable. In this case a taxpayer would have income for a tax year and no deduction for the related bad debt until a subsequent year. This may cause significant timing disadvantages and even permanent disadvantages in some cases. Officials agree there may be inappropriate results for some taxpayers in some situations when debts/loans are funded by limited recourse arrangements. The accounting and tax rules in these situations are complex and officials have been analysing them and discussing the impacts with some taxpayers and their advisers over the past few months. The final outcome of the analysis is not yet completed and it is proposed that it continue to identify a complete solution to the issue. 153 Recommendation That the submissions be noted but that officials complete their current analysis of the issue with a view to proposing remedial amendments in the next appropriate tax bill. This will include consideration of the appropriate application date of any further remedial amendments. Issue: Application dates Submission (EY) The timing commencement and application aspects relating to clause 84 and the proposed new section DB 31(3) should be reviewed and revised, if necessary, to achieve full effectiveness. Comment Irrespective of the commencement date, all provisions have a clear application date. However, we agree that each of clauses 84(1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) are addressing the same policy matters and the question of commencement should be reviewed to ensure drafting consistency. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 COMPLYING TRUSTS Clauses 167 and 170 Submissions (Crowe Horwarth, EY) 1. The amendment does not necessarily ensure that all trustee income is subject to tax in New Zealand at the trustee rate. (Crowe Horwarth, EY) 2. Clarification of the drafting may be necessary, particularly in relation to the making of elections and references to “income tax liability” criteria, to ensure the proposed provisions apply as intended. (Crowe Horwarth, EY) 3. Trusts that have previously identified their settlors as being non-resident and have chosen not to be a complying trust should be able to elect to become complying trusts by retrospectively paying tax on the world-wide trustee income. (Crowe Horwarth) 4. Previous income tax legislation should also be amended so the amendments clearly apply for pre-2008–09 income years. (EY) Comment Submissions 1 and 2 The proposed amendment seeks to ensure that trustees of complying trusts are not disadvantaged if a settlor of a trust migrates from New Zealand: • resulting in the trust not having a settlor resident in New Zealand from that time; and • the trustee is unaware that the settlor has migrated from New Zealand. The submission states that if a trust does not have a settlor resident in New Zealand, the proposed amendments do not ensure that the taxable income derived by the trustees is liable for tax at the trustee rate if all trustees are non-resident and the income includes interest, dividends or royalties derived from New Zealand. The submitter considers the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules may continue to cap the income tax payable on that income to the NRWT rates. This would occur if the NRWT was a final tax. We also note that a double tax agreement may limit New Zealand’s taxing right on interest, dividends or royalties, even if the NRWT is not a final tax. The policy intention is that a complying trust is one on which the worldwide trustee income of the trust is taxed (after taking into account allowable deductions) at the trustee rate. This means that if NRWT on interest, dividends or royalties is a final tax or relief is available under a DTA, a trust would not pay tax on its worldwide trustee income at the trustee rate. We agree with the submitter that: • the amendments do not ensure that a trustee’s income is subject to tax at the trustee rate; and • the proposed amendment requires clarification to ensure the policy intention is achieved. 155 We agree with the submission that these concerns would be substantively addressed by ensuring that the election to be a complying trust requires: • the trust to pay tax on its worldwide trustee income at the trustee rate; and • the trust to be treated as if it had a settlor and a trustee resident in New Zealand. Submission 3 The main benefit of a trust being a complying trust is that distributions to the trust’s beneficiaries are not taxed to the beneficiary unless the distribution is beneficiary income (distribution of the current year’s earnings of the trust). We agree that the proposed amendment would apply when the trustee has continued to pay tax at full rate in the mistaken belief the trust is a complying trust. The submission seeks a change in policy in relation to trustees who, at some time in the past, had knowledge that no settlor of the trust was then resident in New Zealand. The trustee has a period of time in which to choose to pay tax on worldwide trustee income at the trustee rate or be treated as a foreign trust or a non-complying trust. Given that these trustees have considered these options at the time the settlor becomes non- resident, we consider that this submission raises a policy question that goes beyond the scope of the current amendment. Submission 4 EY considers that the retrospective application to the beginning of the 2008–09 income year may not fully protect the treatment of distributions and the New Zealand income tax position of beneficiaries. In particular EY focuses on whether distributions from a trust enjoy the exemption given to distributions from a complying trust. A distribution from a trust to a beneficiary is exempt from income tax if the trust has been a complying trust at all times, from the time the trust was either settled or a settlor migrates to New Zealand, until the distribution was made. We agree with EY’s submission that, under the proposed amendment, a trust may not be a complying trust from the 2008–09 year if: • the trust did not have a New Zealand resident settlor prior to the 2008–09 year; or • the proposed amendment does not apply to a trust prior to the 2008–09 year. We agree that the drafting of the proposed amendment should be clarified so that it achieves the policy intention. Recommendation That submissions (1) and (2) be accepted. That submission (3) be declined. That submission (4) be accepted. 156 REMOVAL OF DUPLICATE PROVISIONS No clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 147 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 (2014 Act) amended schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (which relates to expenditure on agricultural improvements). This was intended to replace section 104 of the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 (2013 Act) which had made the same amendment but with an incorrect application date. However, the 2014 Act did not repeal the amending provision in the 2013 Act. Likewise section 60 of the 2014 Act amended section DO 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (which relates to horticultural replacement planting) and was intended to replace section 33 of the 2013 Act which had made the same amendment but with an incorrect application date. The 2014 Act did not repeal the amending provision in the 2013 Act. Comment Sections 33 and 104 of the 2013 Act are redundant as they were intended to be replaced by sections 60 and 147 of the 2014 Act. Two identical provisions with different application dates should not be maintained, and therefore sections 33 and 104 of the 2013 Act should be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 157 TREATMENT OF DUAL RESIDENT BY DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT – STANDARDISING DESCRIPTION Clauses 71, 192, 213(23), (24) and (26) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Several clauses in the bill contain amendments with taxation effects on a person who is a dual resident. The effects may depend on whether there is a double tax agreement treating the person as being resident in New Zealand or on whether there is a double tax agreement treating the person as being resident in a foreign country or territory. The references to the relevant treatment differ in detail between the clauses and should be standardised. Comment Reference to the tax treatment of a dual resident under a double tax agreement should be standardised in the current bill. There is also some variation between such references in existing provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. It is proposed that those provisions be standardised in a future bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 158 SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER NO.77 – CHILD SUPPORT DEBT Two submissions were received on Supplementary Order Paper No. 77. Overall the submissions are supportive of the proposals to address child support legacy debt. Submitters have raised issues which can be categorised as follows: • discretion for write-off of penalty debt where “fair and reasonable”; • apply “fair and reasonable” to other tax types; and • reduction in penalty rates. Issue: Discretion for write-off of penalty debt where “fair and reasonable” Clauses 44A, 44B and 55 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the rationale for the proposed amendments: that the penalty regime should support rather than discourage the payment of child support. In regards to the proposal to introduce a discretion to write off penalty where it is “fair and reasonable” the submitter encourages a “fair, large and liberal” interpretation of the phrase “fair and reasonable” to ensure the desired effect is achieved. Comment The proposed penalty debt write-off provision is a Commissioner discretion where doing so would be “fair and reasonable” and will replace the current “inefficient use of resources”-based test. As this is a discretionary measure it will be for the Commissioner to determine when a circumstance is fair and reasonable. Guidelines will be developed for what is “fair and reasonable” covering what the Commissioner will consider when determining what is “fair and reasonable” and therefore whether or not a penalty will qualify for write-off. Development of the guidelines will draw on the depth and breadth of experience of Inland Revenues child support staff who understand the range of circumstances that can affect a parents ability to repay debt. It will also consider the objectives of the Child Support Act 1991. Adopting a “fair and reasonable” test would enable penalty relief to be applied in circumstances when it makes sense to do so but where the current “inefficient use of resources”-based test would not allow relief. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 159 Issue: Apply “fair and reasonable” to other tax types Clauses 44A, 44B and 55 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the “fair and reasonable” test for a write-off of debt be considered for application more widely to other tax areas such as income tax, student loans and Working for Families tax credits. Comment The “fair and reasonable” phrase is used in some parts of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Applying the phrase more widely to other areas such as income tax and Working for Families would require comprehensive consideration within the context of those areas. The submitter’s comments have been noted by officials. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reduction in penalty rates Submission (Baucher Consulting Limited) Further changes should be made to penalty rates to align the initial late payment penalty for child support with income tax and GST, and further reduce the incremental monthly late payment penalty from 2% to 0.5%. The submitter provides a number of reasons for suggesting penalty rate reductions, including: the extent of essentially uncollectable debt resulting from the current penalty rules; the higher penalty rates for child support than income tax and GST, low incomes of many child support debtors and compliance costs for tax agents. Comment Reduction to penalty rates for child support was considered as part of the comprehensive review of the child support scheme, which has resulted in the penalty rate reductions to come into effect on 1 April 2016. These reductions focus on penalty rates looking forward and can be summarised as follows: • a two-stage late payment penalty with an immediate 2% late penalty, with the remainder of the current 10% penalty only being charged if the debt remains unpaid after seven days; and • a reduction in the on-going monthly penalty rate from 2% to 1% after a year. 160 These changes had majority support through consultation on the review of the child support scheme. The review did not recommend aligning rates across child support and income tax on the basis of differences between the regimes, such as use-of-money interest for income tax and the collection of payments for receiving carers rather than the Crown. Any further review of the penalty rates could be considered following a post-implementation review of the proposed measures and as part of the Generic Tax Policy Process at the appropriate time. Officials have noted the submitter’s comments in this context. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 161

(Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill proposes a new objective “bright-line” test for disposals of residential land. The bright-line test will require income tax to be paid on any gains from residential property that is disposed of within two years of acquisition, subject to some exceptions. This measure was announced as part of Budget 2015. The primary goal of the bright-line test is to create an easy to enforce rule to supplement the “intention” test in the current land sale rules. The intention test is difficult to enforce due to its subjectivity. The bright-line test is intended to supplement the intention test with an objective test. Matters raised in submissions Ten submissions were made on the bill. Two submissions supported the bright-line test and four did not support it. Submissions in favour of the bright-line test submitted that the bright-line test appeared to be a reasonable addition to the current intention test, to ensure that property investors declare the income they are required to. Submitters who did not support the bright-line test believed the test to be unprincipled and likely to apply only to persons who are forced to sell due to circumstances outside of their control. A number of submissions were received on the technical detail of the proposed design of the bright-line test. There were five main areas of concern raised by submitters. These were: • the start date for the bright-line period; • additional exceptions to the bright-line; • the deductibility of holding costs for property subject to the bright-line; • ring-fencing losses; and • the proposed land-rich company rule. These submissions are explained in more detail in the report. Matters raised by the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee asked officials for example scenarios to demonstrate how the bright-line test would work in practice. The Committee also asked for further information on the provisions for inheritance in the bill and whether there were any changes planned to the current intention test as a result of the new bright-line test. 3 SUPPORT/OPPOSITION TO REFORM Clauses 4 to 15 Issue: Support for bright-line test Submission (EY, PwC) Two submitters supported the proposed bright-line test. They stated that the bright-line test appeared to be a pragmatic approach to address concerns regarding enforcement of the intention test. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition to bright-line test Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, nsaTax, KPMG) Four submitters did not support the proposed bright-line test. The reasons for this included: • that instead of piecemeal change, problems with the land sale rules need to be looked at in a comprehensive manner; • better enforcement of the existing rules would be preferable to the bright-line test; • better enforcement should be possible with the better information available as a result of the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill; • the burden of proof already lies on the taxpayer to prove they did not purchase with an intention of resale; • the bright-line test will only tax those who are forced to sell property due to circumstances outside their control; • the proposal could lead to a proliferation of bright-line tests, for different asset classes, depending on the issue of the day; and • speculators will change their behaviour to hold for longer than two years. 4 Comment The goal of the bright-line test is to create an easy to enforce rule to supplement the “intention test” in the land sale rules. The rule is intended to address the difficulties that Inland Revenue has in enforcing this rule, particularly in relation to residential property because of its high volume and turnover. We consider the bright-line test a pragmatic measure to address these difficulties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 CHANGING BRIGHT-LINE TEST TO A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION Clause 4 Submission (Matter raised during oral submissions) During oral submissions to the Committee it was suggested that the bright-line test could be changed to a rebuttable presumption that property acquired and disposed within two years was acquired with an intention of disposal. Comment The primary goal of the bright-line test is to provide an easy to enforce rule. This is due to difficulties in enforcing the current intention, test which is difficult to enforce because of its subjectivity and the ability for taxpayers to argue that they did not acquire property with an intention of resale. We do not consider that designing the bright-line test as a rebuttable presumption of intention would achieve the goal of creating an easy to enforce rule. With a rebuttable presumpt ion, taxpayers would still be able to argue that they did not have an intention of resale. As a result, this would be materially the same as existing law and contain the same subjectivity and enforcement difficulties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 6 APPLYING BRIGHT-LINE TO OTHER ASSETS Clauses 4 to 15 Submission (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc) It is unfair that the bright-line test only applies to property investments. There should be a bright-line test for share or business traders. Comment The bright-line test is intended to address the problems of enforcing the land sale rules in the situation of high turnover of residential property. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 7 LEGISLATIVE COHERENCE Clauses 4 to 15 Issue: Coherence of reforms Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The bright-line test is the second of the three stages of reform package to the taxation of land (with the first being the recent information requirements in the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Informat ion) Bill and the third being the proposed residential land withholding tax). The Select Committee should undertake a review of the reforms included in the three bills to ensure that the reforms form a coherent whole. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The coherence and consistency of the overall policy should be considered as part of the bill containing the residential land withholding tax. If necessary, remedial amendments for the first and second parts should be considered as part of that bill. (KPMG) Comment A post-implementation review is a recognised part of the generic tax policy process. We consider that the bill containing the proposed residential land withholding tax will provide an opportunity to consider any amendments to the bright-line test that would assist in maintaining coherence with the other reforms. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Coherence with current land rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The concepts underlying the bright-line test and the other reforms and the definitions relied on should be consistent with those in the current land rules. 8 Comment In the design of the bright-line test we have used existing land rules where possible. However, as submitters have noted there are some areas of departure for the bright- line test. We consider that these areas of departure are necessary to ensure that the bright-line test meets its goal of being an easy to enforce rule. For example, the current “residential exclusion” in section CB 16 is not fit for bright- line purposes. The existing “residential exclusion” is not limited to one property. A person may use the exception for both their main home as well as their bach or holiday house. In addition, a person can use trusts to obtain the “residential exclusion” a multitude of times for properties that the person does not live in. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 TIMEFRAME FOR SUBMISSIONS Clauses 4 to 15 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The period for making submission should be extended so that proper consideration can be given to the proposed reforms. Comment The bright-line test is intended to apply to land acquired and disposed after 1 October 2015. A longer submission period would result in enactment being delayed and the degree of retrospectivity of the bill would increase. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 ALTERNATIVE DESIGN OF BRIGHT-LINE TEST Clauses 4 to 15 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The Government could achieve its key policy objective of supplementing the “intention test” more simply and coherently by amending section CB 6. This could provide that when any land is disposed of within two years of acquisition that land is treated as if it were acquired with the purpose or intention of disposing of it. Differences between the proposed bright-line test and the current land sale rules are likely to increase uncertainty and cause confusion. Instead, the current rules regarding section CB 6 and intention should be used. Comment The proposed design differs from the current design in many ways. This includes the scope of land that the bright-line test applies to as well as other areas such as the abilit y to claim lo sses. For the reasons outlined we believe that the design of these features needs to be different from the intention test. Generally this is to ensure that the bright-line test meets its goal of being an easy to enforce rule. For example, as outlined for Issue: Coherence with current land rules, the current rules regarding the “residential exclusion” are not fit for purpose and can result in a person obtaining the main home exception multiple times. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 ORDER AND STATUS OF PROPOSED SECTION CB 6A Clause 4 Issue: Ordering of sections Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) The proposed section CB 6A supplements section CB 6 and, as a result, should fo llo w rather than precede it. Furthermore, positioning an inserted section “CB 6A” before section CB 6 seems to go against the numbering convention normally followed in the tax legislat ion. Comment The position o f section CB 6A provides greater clarity in how the existing provisions relating to the land sale rules apply to the bright-line. Where existing provisions currently refer to section “CB 6 to CB 14” it will be clear whether they are intended to apply to the bright-line as they will instead refer to section “CB 6A to CB 14”. The correct numbering convention for tax bills is being followed by placing section CB 6A before section CB 6. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Status of section CB 6A Submission (nsaTax, EY) Section CB 6A should apply only when other provisions taxing land transactions do not apply. The current approach can result in uncertainty. For example, if both section CB 6A or section CB 12 could both apply, it is unclear whether the main home exclusion would exempt them from tax. In that circumstance it should be section CB 12 that applies. It would also be unclear what the result would be for sections DB 27 or DB 28 or whether the ring-fencing applies if more than one land provisions applies. As a precedent note that sections CB 13 and CB 14 are expressed as applying only if a taxpayer’s land disposal is not taxed under any of sections CB 6 to CB 12. 12 Comment We agree that the relative priority of the bright-line test in the land sale rules should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 13 YEAR INCOME DERIVED UNDER BRIGHT-LINE Clause 4 Issue: Income year bright-line income derived Submission (EY) Proposed section CB 6A includes a specific definition of “date of disposal”. The use of this term may suggest that income is to be derived at the date of disposal rather than at the date of settlement. Confirmation is required that the income year in which any bright-line rule income is regarded as derived for income tax purposes will generally be the income year in which the transaction is settled, in accordance with general principles relating to income derivation from the land sales, and will not be determined by the “date of disposal” as proposed to be defined for bright-line purposes. There should be express confirmation that the general timing rules are intended to apply. Comment Income taxable under the bright-line rule is intended to be recognised in the year in which it is derived under general principles rather than solely by the “date of disposal”. We propose to change the term “date of disposal” to remove any doubt. We will also clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of term “date of disposal” Submission (EY) The use of the term “date of disposal” may cause confusion for the reasons outlined by the previous submission. It should be replaced with words along the lines of “bright-line period date” or something similar. This ensures the distinction between characterisation of a transaction as taxable and the timing of recognition of that inco me. 14 Comment We agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Specific allocation rules and express provision against possibility of double taxation Submission (EY) If income which is taxable under the bright-line rule is intended to be recognised in the year of the “date of disposal”, a specific allocation rule should be expressly included in the legislation and there should be express rules to prevent double taxation if it is also taxable in a later year under another of the land sale rules. Comment Income taxable under the bright-line rule is intended to be recognised in the year in which it is derived under general principles rather than solely by the “date of disposal”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 INTERNATIONAL TAX ISSUES Clause 4 Issue: Limit to property situated in New Zealand Submissions (Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The bright-line test should not apply to property situated outside of New Zealand. Covering property outside of New Zealand goes beyond the scope of the bright-line bill which is to address high turnover in the New Zealand residential property market. It would also require additional resources from Inland Revenue to track overseas transactions. Existing provisions sufficiently cover overseas property owned by New Zealand residents. It should not be assumed that the land registration system in overseas jurisdictions is as accurate and reliable as the New Zealand land transfer system. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment New Zealand residents are taxed on their worldwide income. It would be inconsistent with this general principle for New Zealand residents to be taxed only on their New Zealand land sales. The bright-line test is intended to supplement the intention test in the land sale rules which already applies to properties situated outside of New Zealand. As a result, we consider that the bright-line test should apply to properties situated outside of New Zealand when they fall within the bright-line period. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Claiming foreign tax credits Submission (Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Applying the bright-line test to foreign land risks creating double taxation where a foreign jurisdiction applies a capital gains tax to the same sale of land. 16 New Zealand domestic law and our double tax agreements are unlikely to provide for a foreign tax credit for capital gains tax paid on overseas land. If the submission to limit the application of these rules to land in New Zealand is not accepted, the international tax issues should be given further consideration and it should be clarified that foreign tax credits are available. (Deloitte) Comment The normal foreign tax credit rules will apply to foreign land subject to the bright-line test. Therefore if sellers satisfy the existing foreign tax credit requirements they will receive a foreign tax credit. These tax credit rules apply to sales that fall within the existing land sale rules. We would not want to give preferential treatment to sales that are made within the bright- line period. The transitional residence rules also reduce the scope of this issue for new migrants. Under these rules, new migrants are not taxed on their foreign-sourced income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-resident foreign-sourced income Submission (Deloitte) The bright-line should not apply to land outside of New Zealand that is purchased and sold by non-residents as this should fall within “non-residents’ foreign-sourced income”, as defined under existing section BD 1(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment New Zealand does not tax non-residents on their foreign-sourced income under section BD 1(4). This section will mean that the bright-line test will not apply to overseas land sold by a non-resident. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 17 TWO-YEAR PERIOD Clauses 4, 15(2), (3) and (4) Issue: Start date for two-year period Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax, New Zealand Law Society, PwC, Chapman Tripp, KPMG) Several submitters proposed that the start date for the two-year bright-line period should be the date that a person enters into an agreement to purchase the land rather than the date they obtain registered title to the land. The reasons given for this included: • the current land sale rules regard the acquisition date as the date a person enters into an agreement to purchase the land. The start date for the bright-line period should be consistent with this; • using the date of registration unfairly shortens the bright-line period; • using the date a person enters into a contract to purchase land as the start date would minimise the number of sales purchased without an intention of resale; • it would be fairer for the start date of the bright-line test to be consistent with the end date for the bright-line test; • there would be no difficulty for taxpayers in determining the start date as they are required to keep documentation of this and know it for the purposes of the other land sale rules; • using it as the start date would mean that there does not need to be a separate rule for sales “o ff the plan”; • it better reflects that people are committed to buying the property from the date they enter into an agreement for sale and purchase; and • using the registration date is a policy reversal from the section CB 15B approach enacted in 2014. Comment The bright-line test is intended to be an objective, easy to enforce rule. To achieve this, the start date for the bright-line test needs to be a recorded, verifiable date. A recorded, verifiable date would also make the proposed withholding tax easier to apply. The only date recorded on Landonline is the registration date. As a result the registration date needs to be the start date for the bright-line test. We consider that for the majorit y of people, having a separate date for the bright-line test from the other land sale rules will not cause significant difficulty. 18 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Sales “off the plan” Submission (PwC, Deloitte) The proposed separate rule for sales “off the plan” can lead to outcomes that are unduly harsh and the application of the bright-line test is likely to be misunderstood by taxpayers. Take the following situation: 1 July 2016: Person enters into a contract to purchase 1 September 2018: Person obtains registered tit le 1 March 2019: Person enters into contract to sell In this situation the person will be captured by the proposed bright-line rule because they entered into a contract to sell (1 March 2019) within two years of obtaining registered title (1 September 2018). In contrast, if the person had entered into a contract to sell on 1 August 2018, they would not be covered by the proposed bright-line rule because they entered into a contract to sell (1 August 2018) more than two years after entering into a contract to purchase (1 July 2016). Comment We agree that the situation outlined by the submitter would be ano malous. To resolve this we propose amending the start date in the circumstances when a person has a sale “off the plan” which they later obtain registered title to. In this circumstance we propose that the person would be able to start the two-year period at the date they entered into a contract to purchase the property. In the scenario outlined by the submitter, the proposed amendment would mean the bright-line period would start from 1 July 2016. The sale on 1 March 2019 would not be covered by the bright-line test. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 19 Issue: Reducing two-year period Submission (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc) The bright-line test is intended to make gains from speculators taxable. It is not intended to capture gains from property investors that purchase property to use as rental property. The bill should send a message to the general public that rental property is not intended to be captured by the test by reducing it to one year or eighteen months. This would prevent some rental property owners from unintentionally being caught by the new test, but would still capture the traders that the test is actually intended for. Comment The period of the bright-line test is intended to balance the need provide an easier to enforce rule to target short-term speculation while minimising the number of sales made taxable that were acquired without an intention of resale. We consider that the two-year period best meets these competing objectives. It creates an easy to enforce rule to address the key difficult of enforcement where there is a high turnover of properties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Start date for third-party nominations Submission (nsaTax) The bill does not adequately cover the circumstance where the purchaser of a property nominates another third-party person to be the purchaser under a Deed of Nomination. The nominees in these situations may not be in any way privy to the transaction when the sale and purchase agreement is entered into. Furthermore, the nominee may not even have been in existence at the time the agreement is entered into. The acquisition date should be consistent with other taxing provisions and existing law that is the date the “first interest” in the property is acquired being the date of the Deed of Nomination in the case of nominations if the “nominator” has already acquired their “first interest” in the property. 20 Comment In the situation o f a third-party nomination the result would be the same as under a sale of the right to buy land. A purchaser of land acquires an interest in the land by entering into a contract to purchase the land (they acquire a right to buy the land). If they enter a Deed of Nomination, they are transferring this interest (the right to buy the land) to another party. Under the bill, the start date of the bright-line for this person is the date the person entered into the contract to purchase the land. This is the correct result because the “date of acquisition” in the bill is the latest date in which they acquired an interest in the resident ial land. For this person the latest date they acquired the interest is the date they entered into the contract to purchase. The end date of the bright-line would be the date they entered into a deed of nomination. This is the result as the “date of disposal” is the date that the person entered into an agreement for the disposal. The Deed of Nomination is an agreement for the disposal of the land. Therefore, we think the current bill adequately caters for nominations. We intend to clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Start date for associated-party nominations Submission (nsaTax) The bill does not adequately cover the circumstance when the purchaser of a property nominates an associated person to be the purchaser under a Deed of Nomination. This acquisition date should be the date the purchaser acquires their “first interest” in the property, which is the date the contract to purchase is entered into. Comment No rollover relief is proposed for transfers of property to associated persons (see Issue: Rollover relief for associated persons). As a result the start date for associated-party nominations would be the same as for third-party nominations. 21 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification required for “date of acquisition” Submission (EY) Clarification is required of the intended meaning of the latest date on which a person acquires an estate or interest in the land. Given the broad definitions for income tax purposes of the “estate” or “interest” in relation to land and the use of the indefinite article, it does not seem to make sense to refer to a “latest date” for acquiring any such interest. A particular estate or interest will be acquired at a single particular date, not at a number of successive dates. If the “latest date” is intended to refer to the date on which the last action required to complete or perfect a person’s title occurs, we consider the wording should be revised to that effect. If it is intended to refer to the date when a person acquired the particular estate or interest, the disposal of which is in question, we suggest the reference should be to the date of acquiring that particular estate or interest. Comment We agree that the wording could be clarified by referring to the date of acquiring that particular estate or interest. However we consider that the “latest date” requirement is necessary to address situations where there may be several stages involved in acquiring the same interest or where an interest is converted into an estate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Clarification for Land Transfer Act reference Submission (EY) Clarification would be desirable on whether the reference to “if the land is not registered as described” in proposed section CB 6A(1) should be to the instrument of transfer of the land in this regard, rather than to the land itself. 22 Comment We agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Subdivided land Submission (EY) Proposed section CB 6A(2) refers to disposals of residential land that result “from the person subdividing other land”. To make clear that this applies when that other land is not already “residential land” the words “whether or not that land is residential land” should be added. Comment “Residential land” and “land” are both specifically defined terms. Where the section uses the term “land” and not “residential land” we believe it is clear that the wider definition of “land” applies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 RESIDENTIAL LAND Clause 15(5), (7) and (11) Issue: Bare land Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, KPMG) The definition of “residential land” should be changed to refer to “land that is zoned resident ial” or “land that is zoned for residential purposes” rather than land that “because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling erected on it”. The current definition is too vague and difficult to apply. In addit ion, most bare land would appear to meet this test. Comment We agree that the definit io n could be improved by referring to zoning rules rather than the area and nature of the land. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comment. Issue: Farmland Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, KPMG) Lifestyle blocks should be eligible for the farming exclusion. This is consistent with the current taxing rules which treat small farm ventures as businesses. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed definition of farmland is not appropriate for the bright-line test. The current definition is uncertain and many farms currently would not earn sufficient income to meet the test. If officials’ main concern is to exclude hobby farms and lifestyle blocks, then it should be defined by reference to that rather than using this definit ion. (New Zealand Law Society) If the current definition of farmland is retained, there should be further guidance provided in the Tax Information Bulletin. (New Zealand Law Society) In practice this may be a difficult test for many farms as they may not, initially at least, provide a return sufficient to cover all of the costs. To prevent confusion, 24 farmland should be defined simply as “land that is capable of being worked on as a farming or agricultural business”. (KPMG) Comment Genuine farming businesses should be able to utilise the farmland exception even if they may have had a few bad years. We consider that farmland could be defined more simply by removing the concept of an economic unit and instead defining it as “land that is capable of being worked on as a farming or agricultural business”. We also consider that the definition of farmland should be amended to ensure that the exception is available when a person may be running a farming business on several plots of land, but the individual plot of land they own is not of itself capable of being used for a farming business. This situation could arise in the following example. A farmer owns a small plot of land that they run a farm on. The plot of land by itself is too small to be capable of being worked on as a farming business. However, the farmer is able to run a successful farming business on the land because the farmer’s neighbours allow the farmer to use their land for the business. This farmer would not be able to use the current farming exclusion because the land they own is not capable of being worked on as a farming business even though they are actually running a successful farming business on it. To resolve this we consider that the farmland exclusion be available where the owner of the land uses the land for a farming business. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Residential leases Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) It appears that the bright-line could apply on the termination (that is expiry) of a short- term lease. The Commissioner’s draft statement (PUB0219: Income Tax – Whether the cost of acquiring an option is part of the cost of acquiring revenue account land) states that the termination of an option over land is a disposal of that interest in land for the purposes of the land rule. The logical consequence of this position is that the termination of a lease is a disposal of an interest in land. 25 A specific exclusion is required in the legislation to ensure that the bright-line test does not apply on the disposal or termination of a lease of residential land. Comment We do not agree that the expiry of a lease is a disposal of the lease. This was not stated in draft PUB0219. As a result we do not consider the proposed amendment is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extent of land that is “business premises” Submission (EY) It should be clarified that the reference to business premises is not intended to be restricted to buildings or to buildings and their immediate surrounding land. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s recent draft item, PUB00201 says that “premises” is difficult to interpret and can have different meanings depending on the context. Comment We consider that “business premises” in the context of the bright-line would include land, buildings, appurtenances, and parts of lands or buildings for use in the carrying on of a business. This is similar to what was concluded in PUB00201. We do not consider further detail in defining a business premises is necessary or desirable given that it is meant to be applied in a wide range of circumstances and is intended to have its ordinary meaning. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 Issue: Use of business premises or farmland by transferor Submission (EY) It should be clarified that the business premises or farmland does not need to be used for a farming or agricultural business by the transferor to use the exception. Comment The proposed business premises and farmland exclusio n (as presently drafted) requires the land be used predominantly as business premises or farmland. It does not require the land to be used as business premises or farmland by the transferor. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Land used for rental purposes Submission (EY) It should be clarified that “business premises” may include land used for rental purposes (whether residential or commercial) if the transferor’s rental activities constituted the carrying on of a business rather than a passive investment. The treatment of serviced apartments, in particular, should be clarified. Comment To obtain the business premises exclusion, the relevant land must be used predominantly as business premises. The business premises exclusion is intended to be available if the land is rented out to a third party who occupies the land as their business premises. It is not intended to apply when it is rented out to a third party who occupies the land for residential purposes. We do not consider that the ordinary meaning of “business premises” would include land that is occupied by a third party for residential purposes. Where property is occupied partly for residential purposes and partly for business premises (for example, serviced apartments) it will be a boundary situation that would need to be determined on the facts and circumstances of the specific case. 27 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extending bright-line to all land Submission (Matter raised during oral submissions) During oral submissions it was suggested that the bright-line test could apply to all land rather than being restricted to residential land. Comment The bright-line test is targeted towards the particular problems of enforcing the current land sale rules in relation to residential land. Residential land causes particular difficulties for enforcement as there is a high volume and turnover of transactions. These difficulties are not evident to the same extent with other land. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 MAIN HOME Clauses 6, 15(5), (10) and (11) Issue: Alignment with current residential exclusion Submission (KPMG, EY) The principal residence exemption in section CB 16 should be used instead of the proposed main ho me exception. This would align it with the intention test the bright- line test is intended to supplement, and remove uncertainty. (KPMG) The scope of application of the “main home” exclusion in relation to trusts differs from those in the section CB 16 resident ial exclusion, and is more complicated to understand and apply. This should be simplified, if not aligned with the section CB 16 provision. (EY) Comment The “residential exclusion” in section CB 16 does not fit the policy of the bright-line test. The resident exclusion is not limited to one property. A person may use the exception for both their main home as well as their bach or holiday house. In addition, a person can use trusts to obtain the residential exclusion a multitude of times for properties that the person does not live in. It is the policy intent that a person can only use the main home exception in the bright-line test for one property at a time. As a result, the proposed main home exception in the bright-line test differs from the current residential exclusion as it can only be used for one property at a time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 Issue: Lifestyle blocks Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax) If the submission to include lifestyle blocks within the farmland exclusion is not accepted, it should be made clear in guidance that the main home exclusion can be applied in appropriate circumstances to lifestyle blocks that are ineligible for the farmland exclusion. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The main home exclusion should be clarified to ensure that lifestyle blocks are covered by the proposed exclusion. The vast majo rity o f lifest yle blocks are not likely to meet the farmland exclusion. (nsaTax) Comment In some circumstances lifestyle blocks will be eligible for the main home exclusion. An example of this is provided in this Officials’ Report (Example Scenarios). Further examples are also available in the special report published at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz for the recent Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015. We will also provide addit ional guidance in the Tax Information Bulletin for this bill after enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Legislatively detailing main home exception Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, EY, KPMG) Several submissions were received stating that specific features of the main home exception should be legislatively detailed. In particular, submitters stated that the factors determining a person’s “greatest connection” should be legislatively defined as the term is uncertain and the outline of them in the commentary to the bill and Tax Information Bulletin do not have determinative status. Submissions were also received seeking legislative clarification of the treatment of co-owners and legislative reflection of how the main home exclusion is shown to apply in circumstances outlined in the commentary (for example, page 13 of the commentary outlining when the main home may be used for two properties at the same time). 30 Comment Provisio ns such as the main home exception will apply in a wide number of circumstances and living arrangements. It is neither feasible nor desirable for the legislation to prescribe every possible situation. Trying to provide detailed rules for every situation can lead to the legislation not applying appropriately. Instead we prefer to apply general rules and provide guidance on how they work. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Detailed guidance required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, KPMG) There are several areas that are unclear about how the main home test will apply. Detailed guidance is required on how a person is to determine whether they are able to rely on the main home exclusion. The commentary to the bill notes that in determining a person’s greatest connection that the factors used to determine a person’s “permanent place of abode” could be used. Case law indicates that this may be difficult to apply in practice. Comment We will provide guidance in the Tax Information Bulletin for the main home exception. In addit io n, Inland Revenue is providing additional guidance on the application of “greatest connection” for the recent changes in the Land Transfer Amendment Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 31 Issue: Habitual seller rule Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax) The bill proposes that the main home exception is not available if the person has used the exclusion two or more times within the two years immediately preceding the date of disposal. Explicitly allowing a person to rely on the main home exclusion twice in a two-year period sends the wrong message as people may assume they can sell two homes within each period of two years (and by implication many more homes over a longer period) and not be subject to tax on any gains on the sale of those properties. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The main home exclusion should only be able to be relied on once in any two-year period. (nsaTax) Comment We agree that the proposed “habitual seller” rule for the bright-line test could send the wrong message. The rule could lead to people assuming that their sale of their main home is non- taxable if they have not previously used the main home exception within the previous two years even if they have sold more properties over a longer period. This would be incorrect as the person may be taxable under the “intention” test and the habitual seller rule contained within the “intention” test. To resolve this we consider that the main home exception for the bright-line should also not be available if a person has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land. This is aligned with the existing habitual seller exception in the main residence exclusion to the “intention” test. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Principal settlor rule does not work appropriately in all circumstances Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The “principal settlor” rule does not work appropriately in all circumstances, wit h the result that the main home exclusion will not be available in some circumstances when it should be. 32 Take, for example, where a 25-year old and her partner settle a trust which acquires their first home for $800,000. The couple are beneficiaries of the trust. As the couple only has $10,000 towards a deposit for the property, the 25-year old’s mother lends $200,000 interest-free to the trust. That loan makes the mother a settlor of the trust. This scenario is common in practice. If the interest foregone by the mother exceeds the settlement made by the 25-year old and her partner, the mother will be the principal settlor. If the mother has her own main home, the couple will not be able to rely on the main home exclusion, even though the property was their main home. Comment We agree that the principal settlor provision would not work appropriately in the circumstances outlined by the submitter. To fix this we recommend that a person is not a principal settlor for the purposes of the rule if they have provided value to a trust and they are neither a trustee of the trust, a beneficiary of the trust, a person with the power to appoint or remove trustees, or a decisio n-maker under the trust deed. We consider this will ensure that genuine gifts to a trust by family members will not remove the ability to claim the main home exception, while still ensuring that the trust provisions cannot be used to claim the main home exception multiple times. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: What transfers of value are counted for determining a principal settlor Submission (nsaTax, New Zealand Law Society, EY) The “principal settlor” definition should be modified to take into account all settlements made and not be limited to property settled on the trust. It is common for value to be provided to a trust through debt forgiveness and providing free services to a trust. (nsaTax) The definit io n of “settlor” includes a person making non-monetary transfers of value such as guaranteeing the trust’s financial obligations and providing services at below- market value. In practice it may be difficult to value these non-monetary settlements. Inland Revenue should provide guidance on how to determine the “principal settlor” when non-monetary settlements are made on a trust. (New Zealand Law Society) Clarification of the “principal settlor” definition is needed. (EY) 33 Comment It is not clear what transfers of value are counted for determining the principal settlor. This can be seen by submitters having different views on what is counted for the purposes of this provision. We consider this has arisen because the “principal settlor” definit ion looks at how much “property” has been settled in the trusts. What transfers would count as “property” is unclear. We recommend clarifying this provision by having the principal settlor definit io n consider all transfers of value to the trust except transfers that are the provision of services at below market value. We believe this will provide greater certainty in the section. This approach is consistent with that used for defining a settlor for the purposes of the associated person definitions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Use of term “value” Submission (nsaTax) The use of the term “value” is unclear. It is assumed that this is meant to be market value. If so this should be made clear. Comment The term “value” is meant to refer to market value. We agree this should be made clear. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Multiple principal settlors Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax) Where multiple people have provided equal value to a trust, it is unclear which of them is principal settlor. 34 We assume that neither of them will be for the purposes of section CB 16A. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Where multiple people have provided equal value to the trust, it is intended that all of them are treated as principal settlors. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Focus on ownership Submission (nsaTax) The main home exclusions should focus on both ownership and use of the relevant property. Currently, the proposed legislation focuses solely on use. The main home should be the one dwelling which is owned by the relevant vendor. A person could have a rental property that they reside in which is their main home. This would mean that a separate property that they own would not be able to utilise the main home exception. Comment The main home exception is not intended to be a rule that enables all people to have one property exempted. It is intended to only apply when the property disposed of is actually used as a person’s main ho me. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Communal land Submission (nsaTax) Many subdivisions include both residential lots and a single communal or amenities block. Typically, a purchaser will acquire a “normal” residential lot to build a dwelling on it together with an interest in a communal or amenities block. Most often, the area of the communal lot will far exceed the area of the residential lot. 35 The legislation should be amended to include within the main home exclusion direct or indirect interests in such communal land, which are required to be conveyed as part of a residential lot sale. Comment In most situations, communal areas will be part of the title of the land that is being transferred. In a circumstance when it is not part of the title being transferred, the communal land will likely not be residential land and therefore will not be covered by the proposed bright-line test. In addit ion, the communal land would have zero value (and therefore no gains to be made) as the land is worth nothing separate from the resident ial lot. As a result we consider that the proposed amendment would add additional complexity to the legislation for no gain. Part of the generic tax policy process involves a post-implementation review. We will monitor this area to ensure the bright-line test is working as intended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of home by family members Submission (EY) The main home exclusion should apply where an owner’s family members live there but the legal owners do not. When a property is being used as a home for members of an owner’s family, even if the owner is residing elsewhere there is no reasonable policy basis for not allowing the main home exception to apply. Comment It is intended that the main home exception is only available where the owner resides in the property (or the beneficiary of the trust resides in the property). This is consistent with the residential exclusion in the existing land sale rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 36 Issue: Look-through companies Submission (EY) There should be clarification or confirmation that section HB 1(4)(b) would apply to treat the owners of look-through companies which own residential land as the relevant owners and persons for the purpose of the main home exception. Comment Section HB 1(4)(b) would have the effect of treating the owner of a look-through company as the owner of residential land purchased by the look-through company for the purposes of the main home exception. We will note this in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Broader main home exception Submission (EY) A broader main home exception should be available to cover “sales off the plan” when people intend to use the property as their main home. This approach would be consistent with the desired outcome intended by the changes to the date of acquisition made in 2014. Comment The main home exception is intended to be based on a person’s actual use of the property rather than their intended use of the property. We believe expanding the main home exception would make it more subjective and difficult to enforce. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Use of main home exception by non-residents Submission (EY, KPMG) The commentary to the bill asserted that the main home exception cannot be used “if the owner of a property does not reside in New Zealand”. There may be situations in which a person who does not live in New Zealand all the time could use the main home exception. If it is intended that non-residents are unable to use the main home exception, express, detailed amendments to that effect are needed. Comment We agree there are some limited circumstances when the main home exception would be available for persons who at the time of sale do not live in New Zealand. This could happen where a person left New Zealand shortly before selling but used the property as their main home while they were in New Zealand. We will clarify this point in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Practical difficulty in applying principal settlor test Submission (KPMG) The principal settlor rule may be difficult to apply in practice where the trustee is independent of the settlor. The settlor may also wish to claim the main home exemption in respect of property owned by the trust, rather than property the settlor may be residing in. At present the wording deems the main home exemption to apply to the settlor’s other property, regardless of whether they wish for that property to be their main home. Comment The provision in the bill is consistent with the settlor-focused rules in the trust rules. The main home exception does not allow a person to pick which of their properties they can treat as their main home. If a person wishes to claim the main home exemption in respect of property, it actually needs to be their main home. 38 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Principal settlor who has a main home that they do not own Submission (Matter raised by officials) There is a gap in the “principal settlor” provision which can lead to a person being able to access the main home exception multiple times through the use of trusts. This occurs because proposed section CB 16A(1)(b)(ii) only denies the main home exception when the principal settlor of the trust does not own a main home. A person could work around this rule by ensuring that they do not own their main home and instead rent their main home. The person could then place their properties in trust and use the main home exception for multiple properties without the principal settlor restrict ions. Comment The principal settlor provisions are intended to ensure that people cannot use the main home exception multiple times through the use of trusts. We consider that this gap should be closed. This could be remedied by changing the requirement that the principal settlor “own” a main home to a requirement that they “have” a main home. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 39 INHERITED PROPERTY Clauses 4(3) and 11 Issue: Drafting of “cost of residential land” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The drafting of the inheritance rollover includes in the value of the land being rolled over expenditure that does not relate to the land as well as expenditure on revenue account. The drafting should be clarified so that the expenditure must relate to the subject land and only expenditure of a capital nature is included. Comment The drafting of “cost of residential land” is consistent with the current land rules for inheritance. We expect that the same interpretation would be applied for both. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Redrafting inheritance provision Submission (EY) Proposed new sections CB 6A(3) and FC 9 are not appropriate to achieve the intended outcome. The simpler approach would be to amend section CB 6A(3) to include a reference to transfers to a deceased’s personal representatives as described in section FC 1(1)(a) as well as to disposals made by personal representatives as described in section FC 1(1)(a), as well as to disposals made by such personal representatives and disposals by beneficiaries who receive residential land by inheritance under a will or on intestacy. Comment Subpart FC contains the provisions dealing with inheritance. We consider that including the inheritance provisions for the bright-line test within subpart FC is more consistent with the scheme of the Income Tax Act. 40 We also consider that moving away from this scheme would result in unintended consequences. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alignment with other provisions in subpart FC Submission (EY) If the above submission is not accepted, the interaction of all of the provisions in subpart FC should be reviewed, with appropriate amendments included if necessary to ensure there is no inconsistency, confusion or anomalous outcomes. Comment We have reviewed the provisions in subpart FC and have identified it should be clarified that section FC 9 overrides sections FC 3 and FC 4. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 41 RELATIONSHIP PROPERTY Clauses 10, 10B and 10C Issue: Alignment with inheritance Submission (KPMG) There is no rationale for distinguishing between the tax treatments of subsequent sales of inherited and relationship property. The latter will be subject to the bright-line test, whereas the former will not. The justification given by officials was that there is more opportunity to negotiate the property that a transferee receives under a relationship property agreement. This assumes that the transfer will be amicable, which will not always be the case. Further, if one of the reasons for applying the bright-line test to subsequent disposals of relationship property is that it can be presumed that both parties had a joint purpose or intention when acquired, then the start date should be the original purchase date. Comment It is proposed that inherited property be excluded from the bright-line test because in the case of inheritance the person did not intend to acquire the property. The bright-line bill proposes that the exception for property transferred under a relationship property agreement is narrower. This is because: • In most cases property subject to the bright-line would have been acquired during the relat ionship. This means we can presume that the two parties had a joint intention in acquiring the property. • Unlike inheritance, the parties have scope to negotiate the transfer of the property. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 Issue: Use of term “date of acquisition” Submission (EY) Section FB 3A should be revised to remove the reference to “date of acquisition”. This should be reworded. Comment We agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 43 OTHER EXCEPTIONS Issue: Exceptions for circumstances outside seller’s control Submission (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, PwC, KPMG, nsaTax, Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Law Society) Submitters sought exceptions from the bright-line test for various circumstances where the seller is forced to sell property due to circumstances outside of their control. Submitters stated that as the bright-line test is intended to be a supplement to the existing intention test it should not apply when the seller is forced to sell the property due to circumstances outside of their control. Exceptions were sought for: • sales due to financial hardship; • compulsory acquisitions; • mortgagee sales; and • corporate and personal insolvencies. Comment The primary objective of the bright-line test is to be an easy to enforce rule. For the bright-line test to be effective the number of exceptions should be limited and defined tight ly. Exceptions such as hardship would make the bright-line test more subjective and difficult to enforce. Providing additional exceptions to the bright-line test would increase the complexity of the bill while reducing its effectiveness and making it less clear and objective. Existing hardship provisions in tax law are available to provide relief for taxpayers who cannot afford to pay. In addition, the main home exception will mean that a person’s main home will not be taxed by the bright-line test. Part of the generic tax policy process involves a post-implementation review. We will monitor this area to ensure the bright-line test is working as intended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 44 Issue: Exception for persons who hold leasehold title in property prior to obtaining freehold title Submission (New Plymouth District Council) There should be an exception from the bright-line test for persons who hold a leasehold title in respect of the property prior to the purchase of a freehold title, the leaseho ld t it le has a perpetual right of renewal, and the person has held the leasehold title or the freehold title for at least two years. The bright-line test is intended to capture speculators. Where persons hold a lease with a perpetual right of renewal, it will be common for them to obtain freehold title prior to selling the land, to make it easier to sell. These people are not speculators and it would be administratively difficult for them to administer the bright-line test. Treating leases with a perpetual right of renewal similarly to freehold estates is also consistent with recent changes made in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employment Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. Comment For the bright-line test to be effective, the number of exceptions should be limited and defined tightly. However, we can see a good case for a narrow exception in this situation. Leases with a perpetual right of renewal are very similar to freehold title and other tax provisions treat them similarly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Rollover relief for associated persons Submission (nsaTax, Chapman Tripp) The bill provides for no loss from a transfer of property to an associated person. However the bill does not provide for the inverse situation to provide rollo ver relief for gains. A person may choose to place their property into a trust or restructure for genuine commercial reasons within two years of acquiring the property. This should not be subject to the bright-line test. Instead, rollover relief should be provided and the associated person should obtain the property at cost with the benefit 45 of the acquisition date of the transferor. This would better reflect the economic reality where the associated persons are effectively one economic unit. This would also remove the incentive for a taxpayer to realise an unrealised loss. Only genuine third-party sales would trigger losses under the bright-line. Comment For the bright-line test to be effective, the number of exceptions should be limited and defined tightly. We consider that having rollover relief for associated persons would increase the complexity of the bright-line test and result in it being less clear. Not having general rollover relief is consistent with the current land sale rules, which do not provide rollover relief for gains realised on a transfer to an associated person. If a person chooses to place their property into a trust or restructure for genuine commercial reasons immediately after acquiring it, they will not have a tax liability as there will be no gain from the disposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 46 HOLDING COSTS FOR PROPERTY SUBJECT TO THE BRIGHT- LINE SHOULD BE DEDUCTIBLE No clause Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax, New Zealand Law Society, PwC, KPMG) Holding costs for property subject to the bright-line test should be deductible. This would be the result if the standard deductibility rules applied to the property, otherwise the legislation should explicitly provide an automatic right of deduction for the property. An explicit provision would be consistent with how deductions are treated for other revenue account property, more equitable, and allowing deductions ensures that only the gain on the sale is taxed. Current rules provide a deduction for holding costs as holding costs do not exclusively relate to “living as an individual” and therefore are not subject to the private limitation. This is because these costs are incurred irrespective of whether the property was used or available for use for private purposes. Inland Revenue should provide guidance on this point in a Tax Information Bulletin. Comment The bill proceeds on the basis that holding costs for property subject to the bright-line are deductible according to ordinary tax rules. No separate rules for the bright-line are proposed. This is to ensure that the rules for deductions for the bright-line are aligned with the rules for deductions generally. This ensures that the framework for deductions is maintained and ensures there are no distortions caused by having people wanting to accelerate or delay sales into or outside of the bright-line period as a result of the differing treatment for deductions. In accordance with the framework for deductions, deductions are not allowed for expenditure to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This is to ensure that income is calculated before deducting any consumption expenditure. We do not consider that current deductibility rules would allow for holding costs to be deductible for revenue account property when the property is used only for private purposes. The deductibility of holding costs is a current issue, which is not created or limited to the bright-line test. We recognise there should be greater certainty on the deductibility of holding costs in relation to the land sale rules and other revenue account property generally. Officials intend to consider this area further. 47 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 48 RING-FENCING LOSSES Clause 8 Issue: Opposition to ring-fencing losses Submission (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax, New Zealand Law Society, EY, PwC, Chapman Tripp, KPMG) Submitters did not support the proposal to ring-fence losses from sales taxable solely due to the bright-line test. Reasons given for this were: • Gains and losses that arise under the bright-line test should be treated in the same manner as other gains and losses that arise under the other sections of subpart CB. • Taxpayers will have an incentive to argue that they had an intention of resale for any losses, which will increase compliance costs and render ring-fencing ineffective. • Ring-fencing losses will distort investment decisions and will encourage economically inefficient behaviour. The bright-line test will capture many situations where the taxpayer is forced to sell due to financial strife; losses in these cases should be dealt with on the same footing as gains. • Ring-fencing would mean that many people will have unusable losses. • Taxpayers are unlikely to accelerate property sales to realise losses as the benefit fro m the tax losses would give rise at most to a 33 percent recovery, while the true economic loss is much greater. • Ring-fencing creates a “one-way bet” for government. Comment The two-year nature of the bright-line test would cause a significant revenue risk if unrestricted losses were allowed. The bright-line test creates an incentive for people with unrealised losses to accelerate sales and an incentive for those with unrealised gains to defer sales. This means that people are able to maximise claimable losses and minimise taxable gains. This revenue risk would be particularly large in a downturn, when people are likely to sell recently acquired property at a loss. Ring-fencing is intended to reduce the revenue risks by removing the ability to offset losses against all other income (such as salary and wages), and therefore reduce the incentive to accelerate losses. 49 The proposed ring-fencing is as limited as possible while still addressing the revenue risks. This includes limiting ring-fencing to sales that are taxable solely due to the bright-line test, and allowing ring-fenced losses to be offset against any future land sale gains. Losses from property sales that are also taxable under the current land sale rules (that is those that are not solely taxable under the bright-line test) will not be ring-fenced, thereby mitigating any distortions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Group companies Submission (EY) Companies should be able to offset excess deductions or losses arising under the bright-line rule against any net taxable income from land sales in other group companies. There is no general income tax restriction on the type or source of losses that companies can offset against net income derived by other tax group companies and we cannot see any justification for restricting the offset. Comment Enabling group companies to offset ring-fenced deductions against land income from other group companies would increase the complexity of the proposed ring-fencing and make the bright-line test less clear. We note that consolidated groups will be able to offset ring-fenced deductions against the land income from other consolidated companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Spill-over Submission (PwC, EY) Given the hierarchical application of the land taxing provisions there is potential for losses to be ring-fenced where the property sale would otherwise have been taxable under a subsequent provision without loss limit ation. This spill-over produces an unintended loss limitation. 50 Comment The proposed ring-fencing only applies where the sale is taxable solely due to the bright-line test. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 51 LOSSES FROM TRANSFERS TO ASSOCIATED PERSONS Clause 8 Issue: Support for denying losses from transfers to associated persons Submission (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc) The submitter supported the proposed denial of losses from transfers to associated persons. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition to denying losses from transfers to associated persons Submission (nsaTax) Losses from transfers to associated person transactions should be allowed in full. At the very least they should be ring-fenced in the same way as proposed for losses arising fro m third-party transactions. The so lution to this is to provide rollover relief for transfers to associated persons. (See Issue: Rollover relief for associated persons). Comment The bill proposes to deny losses from transfers to associated persons to prevent people recognising losses without any real economic transaction occurring. For the reasons outlined for the submission Issue: Rollover relief for associated persons we do not agree with providing rollover relief for transfers between associated persons. We are proposing to adjust the cost base for the recipient of property to prevent genuine losses being denied permanently through transfers to associated persons (see Issue: Adjusting cost-base of associate). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 52 Issue: Limiting provision to disposals taxable solely due to the bright-line Submission (nsaTax, EY) The proposed denial of losses from transfers to associated persons should only apply to a person who derives income solely under section CB 6A. Section DB 18AB applies to a person who derives income under section CB 6A. This section should be amended so that the deduction cap on associated person transactions is limited to income derived solely under section CB 6A. Without amendment the deduction cap could apply to land which is taxable under other provisions. Comment The limit to losses from transfers to associated persons is only intended to apply to transactions taxable solely due to the bright-line test. We agree that section DB 18 AB should be amended to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cross-reference error Submission (nsaTax) Section DB 18A(2) refers to subsection (3). The reference should be to subsection (4). Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 53 Issue: Adjusting cost base of associate Submission (EY, Chapman Tripp) Any undeducted cost balance for the transferor should become part of the cost base for the associated transferee. When transferees acquire land from associated persons they should also be treated as acquiring the land at the same date as the transferor. This may however create the ability for associated persons to transfer losses. Comment We agree with submitters that if the cost base of the asset is not adjusted it could result in genuine losses being denied permanently due to an intermediate transfer to an associated person. As a result we recommend providing an adjusted cost base to the transferee. However we do not recommend adjusting the date of acquisition for the transferee. We consider that the rule will be simpler if the date of acquisition remains unchanged for associated party transfers. We also note that in the case of a property that has made a genuine loss, having a longer bright-line period would be more taxpayer- friendly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 54 LAND-RICH COMPANIES AND TRUSTS Clause 14 Issue: Support for proposed anti-avoidance rule Submission (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc) The submitter supports rules to prevent the use of companies and trusts to circumvent the bright-line test. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition to proposed anti-avoidance rule Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, Chapman Tripp, KPMG) Submitters did not support the proposed anti-avoidance rule. Reasons given for this opposition included: • The general anti-avoidance rule gives Inland Revenue sufficient power to challenge those who act to avoid the bright-line test. In addit ion, disposals of shares that are part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme are taxable under section CB 3. • Commo n occurrences such as death, divorce or change of advisor would inadvertently trigger the proposed anti-avo idance rule. The wide definit io ns used in the rules create a risk of inadvertent capture of common situations. • It is unlikely that taxpayers will use companies to acquire residential land as this exposes the taxpayer to other liabilities and is not a commercially viable way of acquiring residential land as well as other securities law obligations that arise. The small number of transactions does not justify the introduction of a specific rule. • There is no principle to distinguish between good and bad share sales under the proposed test. • If you want to tax the sale of land-rich shares this should be set out in clear terms that apply to all taxpayers. The proposed anti-avoidance rule will only apply when Inland Revenue chooses to invoke the rule. 55 • The international tax issues with taxing land-rich companies have not been properly considered. • A “wait and see” approach should instead be adopted. Comment It is important that people cannot easily avoid the bright-line test through the use of companies and trusts. The use of a specific anti-avoidance rule is intended to supplement the general anti-avoidance rule by showing that Parliament clearly intends that avoidance rules are to apply to the use of land-rich companies and trusts to avoid the bright-line test. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exempting rental property Submission (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc) Consideration should be given to exempting property that is to be used to provide tenants with long-term rental accommodation from the proposed anti-avoidance rules. (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc) Comment The bright-line test applies to residential property that is bought and sold within two years whether or not it is used for rental purposes. As a result, the anti-avoidance rule should also apply irrespective of whether the property is intended to be used for rental purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Making rules as simple as possible Submission (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc) The rules should be the simplest required to eliminate the use of companies and trusts to circumvent the bright-line test. 56 Comment Officials consider that the proposed anti-avoidance rule is the simplest means of addressing the issue of land-rich companies and trusts while providing an effective counter to the avoidance risks. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Ownership of multiple properties Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Clarification is needed when a company owns a number of properties and some were purchased during the bright-line period. It is unclear whether the bright-line test will apply when shares of the company are sold. Comment When section GB 52 applies, it is intended that the bright-line test only applies to the properties that have been acquired within two years of the share disposal. We agree that section GB 52 should be amended to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: International tax implications Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is arguable that some of New Zealand’s double tax agreements do not allow New Zealand to impose tax on the gains made on the sale of shares. For example, shares in a New Zealand company owning residential property held by a German resident. Assuming the sale of the shares gives rise to New Zealand-sourced income under the new bright-line provisions, the German resident would apply Article 13(4) of the Germany-New Zealand Double Tax Agreement to be taxed only in Germany in respect of the income. It appears that the introduction of proposed section GB 52 is intended to override the application of such articles. The application of the bright-line test to non-resident 57 shareholders of land-rich companies under New Zealand’s double tax agreement network needs to be considered and its implications spelled out. Comment Proposed sections GB 52 and GB 53 are specific anti-avoidance rules. In certain circumstances, a shareholder of a land-rich company, or trustee of a land rich trust, will be treated as disposing of land for the market value. Inland Revenue’s view is that the proposed legislation does not raise any issues o f override in this situat ion. This is because specific anti-avoidance rules are applied to the situation to establish the appropriate tax result under New Zealand’s domestic law, and then the relevant double tax agreement will be applied to that tax result. However, it should be noted that the benefits of a double tax agreement are not available when a main purpose for entering into certain transactions or arrangements is to secure a more favourable tax position, obtaining more favourable treatment in these circumstances would be contrary to the object and purpose of the relevant provisio n. This is likely to be the case when sections GB 52 or GB 53 apply. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Should allow deductions for shareholder Submission (nsaTax, EY) The proposed anti-avoidance rule does not allow the shareholder or trustees to claim any deductions for the cost price of the land, capital expenditure, or related selling costs (including cost of shares). This is because it is the company that incurred the costs, but it is the shareholder who is treated as receiving the gain. This could lead to over-taxation. Comment We agree that the shareholder or trustee should be able to claim a deduction for the cost of residential land as well the other deductions available to a seller of land. In the case of a trustee, we consider the current drafting would achieve this as section GB 53 deems the trustee to have disposed of the land. The trustee will have incurred the cost of the residential land and so will be entitled to a deduction. In the case of a shareholder we consider that section GB 52 should be amended to ent it le them to a deduction that would have been available if they had sold the land themselves. 58 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Determining value of company or trust assets Submission (nsaTax, PwC, EY) The land-rich company rule refers to the company’s residential land making up “...50% or more, by value, of the assets of the company;”. The provision needs to clarify what “value” it is referring to as there are multiple possibilities and the time at which such measurement should be made. It also needs to be clarified at what point in time the value is measured. Section GB 53 suffers the same gross inadequacies. (nsaTax) The anti-avoidance rule uses the term “value”. This is undefined and the later reference in the section to “market value” could imply the term had a different meaning. (EY) Comment We consider that the method for determining “value” should be clarified by making clear that it should be “market value” that is considered. With reference to the point at which point you determine the respective values, we consider that the current bill is clear in that the time you determine the values is the time that the actions in sections GB 52(1)(c) or GB 53(1)(c) occur. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 59 Issue: Adjusting cost base of company Submission (nsaTax) If the anti-avoidance rule applies, the company should be deemed to have acquired the land at market value to avoid the same gain being taxed if the company sells the land within two years of acquisition. If section GB 52 applies, the company should be deemed to have acquired the land at market value to avoid the gain being double-taxed if the company later sells the land. Comment We agree that the current provision could lead to over-taxation. Adjusting the cost base for the company is a sensible means of addressing this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disposal of all residential land when there is a partial sale of shares Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed anti-avoidance rule could lead to over-taxation. A so le shareho lder will be treated as having disposed of all of the residential land owned by the company when that shareholder disposes of 50 percent or more of their shares to a third party. Given that they retain up to 50 percent of the shares, taxing the full gain from the land would over-tax them. Comment We agree that the rule should be amended to ensure that the person is only taxed on the gain from the land proportional to the amount of shares that they actually disposed of. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 60 Issue: Arrangement under the trust Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The phrase “an arrangement under the trust” is unclear. Officials could treat almost any arrangement as “an arrangement under the trust” for the purpose of invoking the specific anti-avo idance rule. The section should not refer to changes in “an arrangement under the trust”. Comment The provision for “an arrangement under the trust” is intended to cover several situations when trusts could be used to avoid the bright-line test. This would include a change in the beneficiaries of a trust or the termination of the trust. For the proposed anti-avoidance rule to apply there would still need to be a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. This limits the application of the rule in the case of an arrangement. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Allowance for land acquired before 1 October 2015 Submission (PwC) There is currently no allowance for land acquired before 1 October 2015 in the proposed anti-avoidance rule. This land should be excluded from the rule. Comment The proposed anti-avoidance rule only applies when there are actions that have the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. As the bright-line test only applies to land acquired on or after 1 October 2015, there will only be a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright- line test in relation to actions that relate to land acquired on or after 1 October 2015. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 61 Issue: Clarifying which trustee derives income Submission (nsaTax) Proposed section GB 53 should be modified to clarify which trustees are liable for any tax liability resulting from the application of the section. Comment Where there are two or more trustees of a trust, section HC 2 treats them as if they were a notional single person and they are jointly and severally liable to satisfy the income tax liability of the trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 62 APPLICATION DATE Clauses 4 to 13 Issue: Clarification on rules for application date Submission (EY) The application clauses refer to the date a person “first acquires an estate or interest”. This appears to be intended to be the same as that in section CB 15B. Section CB 15B expressly does not apply to section CB 6A. This should instead refer to section CB 6A(1) to remove uncertainty. The commentary to the bill states that the application date for the bright-line rule is for sales where registration is after 1 October 2015, when the land is acquired other than by sale. There is no statutory provision to this effect and it does not necessarily accord with section CB 15B. Comment Section CB 15B is a substantive provision that has no impact on the application date. We therefore do not consider that amending section CB 15B would have any effect on the proposed application date. When land is acquired other than by sale, generally, the first estate or interest the person acquires will be acquired on the date of registration of title for the land. As a result, in most cases where land is acquired other than by sale, the bright-line will apply if registration of title is on or after 1 October 2015 (and it meets the other requirements of the bright-line test). As the submitter has noted, this may not always be the case. When land is acquired before registration of title, or without there being registration of title, the application date for the bright-line test will be the date they acquire that first interest in the land and not the date of registration of title. We will clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 63 Issue: Application date for loss ring-fencing Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The application date for the loss ring-fencing rules is resident ial land acquired “after 1 October 2015”. This should be “on or after 1 October 2015”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date for anti-avoidance provisions Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current application date of the anti-avoidance provisions refers to when a person disposes o f resident ial land. However, the anti-avoidance rules apply only in circumstances when there has not been a disposal of residential land. Comment The application date for the anti-avoidance rule should be changed to 1 October 2015. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 64 Other policy matters 65 66 TRUST FILING EXCEPTION Clause 16 Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) Submitters supported the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Minimal income and expenditure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, KPMG) The minimal amount of income exemption should be set at $1,000 if income is taxed at source at the default rate, rather than $50 as this would make a much more meaningful difference to compliance cost savings. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The de minimus for administration costs should be increased. (PwC) The exclusion for non-active trusts needs to have a more reasonable income threshold. At present it is limited to bank interest and cannot exceed the $50 of administration costs allowed. There is no practical value from trusts having to file tax returns for minimal amounts. (KPMG) Comment We agree that the proposed exception should be extended to achieve more compliance cost savings. We consider that trusts should be treated as having nil income for the purpose of the exception if their relevant income or expenditure is less than $200, rather than $50 as proposed in the bill. We also propose that, in determining whether the trust has no deductions that interest, rates and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of the property and incurred by a beneficiary of the trust, are disregarded. 67 These changes should help ensure that the amendment reduces compliance costs for taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Non-active entity Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The requirement that the trust not have disposed of any assets is not required for the rule as distributions of capital by a complying trust are not subject to income tax. The requirement that the trust not have disposed of any assets should therefore be removed as it would increase compliance costs but not increase the tax take. Comment We agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Limiting expenditure requirement to expenditure that is deductible Submission (PwC) Family trusts will often hold private assets and incur expenditure that is not deductible for income tax purposes. However proposed section 43(3)(b) refers to costs rather than deductions. The provision should be clarified to confirm that it is only expenditure that would be deductible for income tax to the trust that is to be considered. Comment The structure of the new provision is that subsection (2) refers to tax concepts of income and deductions. Subsection (3) refers to actual incomings and outgoings such as fees and bank charges. These concepts should not be mixed. 68 As a result we do not support the proposed amendment, which would incorporate tax concepts into subsection (3), which would be inconsistent with the structure of the new section. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inland Revenue should provide guidance Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Many trusts, including trusts that own only non-income producing assets such as the family home, do not obtain an IRD number or file income tax returns. Inland Revenue should confirm that trusts that do not (and are not required to) obtain an IRD number are not required to file income tax returns if those trusts do not derive income or are not otherwise taking a tax position. Comment The proposed amendment will provide that complying trusts that do not have any income or deductions (as defined in the provision) do not have to file returns. The provision will be explained in the Tax Information Bulletin for the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Net filing income threshold for individuals Submission (KPMG) The $200 non-filing income threshold for individuals has been unchanged for over 15 years. It is therefore timely for this to be increased to take into account inflation. A $500 net income threshold, for both individuals and non-individuals is more reasonable. Comment This submission refers to matters that are not part of the bill. 69 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Defining “professional trustee” Submission (Matter raised by officials) We consider it preferable to define what is a “professional trustee” for the purposes of this amendment. We consider that using the definition contained in section 13C of the Trustee Act would be appropriate. Section 13C of the Trustee Act 1956 defines a professional trustee as a person “where a trustee’s profession, employment, or business is or includes acting as a trustee or investing money on behalf of others”. Comment We consider the proposed definition would help provide greater clarity in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 Remedial amendments 71 72 AMALGAMATIONS – REFERENCE TO AMALGAMATING AND AMALGAMATED COMPANIES Clause 13 Submission (EY, nsaTax) The proposed section contains references to “amalgamating company” which should be “amalgamated company”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 73 74 Matters raised by the Committee 75 76 EXAMPLE SCENARIOS The Committee has asked for example scenarios to demonstrate how the bright-line test would work in practice. Several of these example scenarios may change if recommended amendments to the bill contained in this Officials’ Report are accepted. Where these amendments would affect the outcome in the example scenario the impact of the change is outlined underneath the example. Examples Two-year time period Standard scenario For standard sales of land the two-year bright-line period starts at the time a person acquires registered title to land and ends when a person enters into an agreement to dispose of the land. 1 May 2016 Amy acquires registered title to residential land. 1 December 2017 Amy enters into an agreement to sell the land to Bob with final payment and settlement to follow. 1 July 2018 Bob makes final payment for the property and registered title to the land is transferred to him. The bright-line period starts on 1 May 2016 (date registered title acquired) and ends on 1 December 2017 (date of entry into agreement to sell land). Amy receives payment for the property in the 2018–19 income year. This means that Amy is required to return the income in her annual income tax return for the year. 77 Sales where there is no registration of title For a sale “off the plan” (when the land is bought and sold prior to obtaining registration of t it le), the bright-line period starts at the time a person enters into an agreement to acquire the land and ends when a person enters into a contract to dispose of the land. Sale off the plan and there is registration of title. Proposed amendment for sales off the plan If the proposed amendment to sales off the plan is agreed to (Issue: Sales “off the plan”), then the sale of the land from Peter and Paul will not be covered by the bright- line test. This is because the start date of the bright-line test will instead be 1 May 2016 (the date Peter entered into a contract to purchase the title “off the plan”). 1 May 2016 Developer enters into a contract to sell apartment A to Cory. 1 July 2016 Cory enters into an agreement to sell apartment A to Denise. 1 May 2019 Construction is finished and the developer creates a unit title for apartment A. Apartment A is transferred to Denise. The sale of the right to buy A by Cory to Denise is covered by the bright-line test. This is because he entered into an agreement to sell apartment A (1 July 2016) within two years of entering a contract to purchase apartment A (1 May 2016). A developer is building an apartment block. The developer plans to finish construction in 2019 and is selling rights to the titles of the eventual apartments “off the plan”. 1 May 2016 Developer enters into a contract to sell apartment A to Peter. 1 May 2017 Construction is finished and Peter obtains registered title to land. 1 July 2018 Peter enters into an agreement to sell the land to Paul. The sale of the land from Peter to Paul is covered by the bright-line test. This is because the start date for the bright-line is 1 May 2017 (the date Peter obtained registered title) and the end date is 1 July 2018 (the date Peter enters into an agreement for sale of the land). A developer is building an apartment block. The developer plans to finish construction in 2019 and is selling rights to the titles of the eventual apartments “off the plan”. 78 Sale that is cancelled For sales that are cancelled, there will be no income tax to be paid under the bright- line test because there has been no income derived from the sale. Disposal of land that does not involve a contract to sell There are several situations when land is disposed of and there is no agreement to dispose of the property by the owner (for example, a mortgagee sale). In these situations, the proposed end date for the bright-line period differs from the standard rule. For mortgagee sales, the proposed end date for the bright-line period is the date that the land is disposed of by the mortgagee. 1 May 2016 Elizabeth obtains registered title to residential land. 1 July 2017 Elizabeth enters into an agreement to sell the land to Fred. 1 December 2017 Fred is unable to obtain the funds to purchase the land and so the sale is cancelled. The sale of the land from Elizabeth to Fred falls within the two-year period for the bright-line test. However, because the sale is cancelled, Elizabeth has not derived any income from the disposal of land and will not have any income tax liability. The sale of the land from Elizabeth to Georgina is not covered by the bright-line test because the agreement for sale (1 July 2018) was not entered into within two years of Elizabeth obtaining registered title (1 May 2016). 1 July 2018 Elizabeth enters into an agreement to sell the land to Georgina. 1 May 2016 Henrietta obtains registered title to residential land (purchase price of $400k). Henrietta mortgages the property to the bank. 1 December 2017 Henrietta defaults on the mortgage and the bank begins a mortgagee sale. 1 February 2018 Bank sells property for $450k and transfers registered title to purchaser. The start date for the bright-line period is 1 May 2016 (date Henrietta acquired registered title) and the end date is 1 February 2018 (date land disposed of by mortgagee). The sale is covered by the bright-line test and Henrietta will have income of $50k under the bright-line test. 79 Subdivision The start date for the bright-line period when land is subdivided is the date the owner originally acquired the undivided land. Residential land The proposed bright-line test will apply only to residential land. Land is “residential land” if eit her: • the land has a dwelling on it; or • there is an arrangement to put a dwelling on it; or • it is bare land that because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling on it. However, even if land meets one of these three requirements it is not “resident ial land” if it is used predominantly as business premises or is farmland. Development Andrew buys an empty plot of land. He plans to develop the plot by subdividing it into four lots and building houses on each of the lots. Andrew sells lot 1 off the plan to Bob. One month later, Bob sells lot 1 to Carla. Lot 1 would be “residential land” and Bob would be subject to the bright-line test as there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it, and because it is bare land, that due to its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling on it. 1 May 2016 Bob acquires registered title to residential land. 1 May 2021 Bob subdivides the land into two sections and builds a house on the second section. 1 May 2022 John enters an agreement to sell the second section to Carla. The start date for the bright-line period is 1 May 2016 and the end date is 1 May 2022. As a result, Bob’s sale of the second section to Carla is not covered by the bright-line test. 80 Farmland Farmland is land that because of its area and nature is capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business. Land that because of its nature is not capable of being used as farmland Tina owns a 50 hectare plot of land. The land is covered in gorse. The land is not farmland as it is not currently capable of being used for farming purposes. Land that because of its area is not capable of being used as farmland Marama purchases a lifestyle block with a house and a small area of farmland. A small number of sheep are kept on the land to keep the grass down. The farming exclusion will not apply as the land is not capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming business. It is a hobby farm rather than a genuine farming business. If the area of farmland was larger and capable of being used as an economic unit for farming purposes, it would likely be covered by the farming exclusion. Small plot of land that is farmland Uri has a 5 hectare plot of land that is suitable for use as a rose farm. This land is farmland as it is currently capable of being used as an economic unit for farming purposes. Business premises Bed and breakfast Mary owns a bed and breakfast. Mary provides meals to the residents, room service and cleans the rooms she lets out every day. The land has a dwelling on it so meets the first criteria for residential land. However, the land would not be “residential land” as the land is used predominantly as the business premises for the bed and breakfast. 81 Worker’s quarters Steve owns land which contains a factory which is used to process food. The land also has workers’ quarters on it, which Steve provides to his employees to use as residences. The land is used predominantly as business premises and so is entitled to the business premises exception. Empty factory Velma purchases an empty factory which she plans to develop into an apartment building. Before beginning construction Velma receives a good offer for the building and sells it to William. Velma has an arrangement to put a dwelling on the land and so meets the first criteria for residential land. The land does not qualify for the business premises exclusion as it is empty and not being used as business premises at the time of disposal. As a result the land is “residential land” and potentially subject to the bright-line test. Recommended amendments to definition of residential land We are recommending changes to the definition of “residential land” (see Issue: Farmland, and Issue: Bare land). In the example scenarios provided above we do not believe the recommended changes would affect the end result. Main home The bright-line test will not apply to the disposal of a person’s main home. To utilise the main home exception a person must have used most of the land as their main home for the majority of time they have owned the land. Multiple dwellings Bill buys an apartment block on a single title. He lives in one of the apartments as his main home and rents out the remaining six apartments. Bill sells the apartment block to a third party. Bill cannot use the main home exception because the land (contained on the single title) was not used predominantly as his main home. The majority of the land was used as rental property. 82 Lifestyle block Bob purchases a 2 hectare block of former farmland and builds a house on it. Bob lives in the house as his main home with his family. The remaining land is used by the family to keep some family horses to ride and to run a handful of sheep to keep the grass down. Bob will be able to use the main home exception because the entire land has been used by Bob as his main home. Country store and house Barbara buys a country store that has living quarters attached. She resides in the living quarters and runs a retail business from the front half of the property. She estimates that the retail business uses 45 percent of the property and claims expenses (insurance and rates) on that basis against the retail income. Barbara sells the property. Barbara is not able to use the business premises exception as the land is not used predominantly for her retail business (45 percent). However, Barbara can utilise the main home exception because she has used the property predominantly (55 percent) as her main home during the time she has owned the property. She uses her previous estimate for her expenses to prove her actual use of the property. Purchase of lifestyle block - A Bob and Deb decide to move from the city to the country. They buy a 15 acre (6 hectare) block on which there are the following buildings:  a two-storey building that consists of a large room and office downstairs and basic two-bedroom accommodation upstairs;  a large shed; and  six un-used glasshouses. They move in and purchase some livestock to keep the grass down and the freezer full. The couple start looking at their options for improving their accommodation. The land is not eligible for the farmland exclusion because it is not large enough to be an economic unit for farming purposes. However they would be able to use the main home exception as all of the areas are used for their residence. 83 Purchase of lifestyle block - B The couple then look at their options for improving their accommodation. They consider the following:  renovating the house and bringing the downstairs area into use as part of the ho me; and  building a new home and renting out the old one. They also consider how the glasshouses could be used to supplement their income. They consider establishing a cut flower-growing business in the glasshouses, using the large shed as a packing room and chiller area. They also consider leasing out half of the paddocks for horse grazing. If the property was later sold, the changes being contemplated would have the following effects:  Renovation of the house to include the ground floor as part of their home would not change the application of the main home exemption.  If a new house was built and the old one rented out, there would be multiple dwellings on the property. However, as the new home and paddock area would exceed the area of the rental property, the main home exemption would still apply.  Utilising the glasshouses would also have no effect as the area of the rental house and the glasshouses would not exceed the area of the house and paddocks.  Leasing out half of the paddocks for grazing would be the one change that would be likely to result in the main home exemption being no longer available. This is because the area used for their own purposes would probably not exceed the area of the glasshouses, the rental home and the leased paddocks. 84 Main home exception for multiple properties In limited circumstances a person may use the main home exception for two properties at the same time. Main home and trusts Generally, trusts are able to use the main home exception when a beneficiary of the trust uses the property as their main home. However, trusts cannot use the main home exception where a principal settlor of the trust has another main ho me. This is to ensure that people cannot use the main home exception multiple times through the use of trusts. Trusts – student flat Dave has two properties, a family home which he lives in, and a student flat which his son lives in while studying. Dave settles the student flat on a trust and makes his son a discretionary beneficiary of the trust. The trust cannot use the main home exception because the principal settlor of the trust (Dave) has another main home. Main home October 2016 Moves out of property 1 January 2016 Purchases property 1 Main home October 2016 Purchases property 2 December 2016 Sells property 2 December 2016 Sells property 1 The main home exception is available for both properties. Property 1 was the main home for 9 out of the 11 months the property was owned. Property 2 was the main home for the entire time it was owned. 85 Deductions Rental property Carla has sold a rental property that is subject to the bright-line test. May 2016: Carla buys rental property for $500k May 2016 to 31 March 2017: Carla pays interest of $30k and rates of $5k July 2016: Carla gets a new roof put on the building at a cost of $80k 2 April 2017: Carla sells the property for $800k Deductions in 2016–17 year = $35k (interest and rates) Deductions in 2017–18 year = $580k (Cost base of property = house and roof) Income in 2017–18 year = $800k Beach house Denise has sold a private beach house that is subject to the bright-line test. May 2016: Denise buys beach house for $500k solely for private use May 2016 to 31 March 2017: Denise pays interest of $30k and rates of $5k July 2016: Denise gets a new roof put on the building at a cost of $80k 2 April 2017: Denise sells the beach house for $800k Deductions in 2016–17 year = $0 – Interest and rates denied by the private limitation Deductions in 2017–18 year = $580k (Cost base of property = house and roof) Income in 2017–18 year = $800k Ring-fencing Losses from sales of residential property that are taxable solely due to the bright-line test are ring-fenced so they can only be offset against gains on other land sales. Ring-fenced loss In June 2017 Zac sells residential land that is taxable solely due to the bright-line test. Zac acquired the land for $600,000 and sold it for $540,000. For the 2017–18 income year, Zac also earned $80,000 in salary and wages. The $60,000 loss for the sale of residential land is ring-fenced so that it may only be used to offset income from other land sales. Zac cannot use the $60,000 loss to offset his income from salary and wages. 86 Offsetting against future land gain In August 2019 Zac sells land that he purchased with an intention of resale. Zac made a gain of $100,000 from the sale. Zac may offset his previous $60,000 loss against the $100,000 gain. As a result Zac only has to pay tax on $40,000 of the gain in the 2019–20 income year. 87 INHERITANCE The Committee asked for further information on the provisions for inheritance in the bill. Comment When a person dies, their property may be sold or transferred to a beneficiary, who may subsequently sell the property. The bill proposes that those transfers and disposals will not be subject to tax under the bright-line test. Background When a taxpayer dies, an estate can be dealt with in several ways, depending on whether a will exists. A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased’s estate (an administrator). The executor or administrator is vested with legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased’s property from the time of death to the end of the period of executorship or administration. The beneficiaries have a right to have the deceased’s estate administered properly during this period but do not have a legal or beneficial interest in the assets. The duties of the executor or administrator are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the legacies. At the end of the period of executorship or administration, the executor or administrator becomes a trustee of the residual assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. Property that has been bequeathed or devised under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. Specific legacies are treated as taking effect from the date of transfer to take effect from the date of death, so income arising fro m the property is derived by the beneficiary from the date of death. A general or residuary legacy vests in a beneficiary at the time of distribution. Inheritance and the bright-line test The bright-line test proposes rollover relief for all transfers following a death and an exemption for any disposals by the executor or administrator or subsequent disposals by the beneficiaries. The rollover relief is achieved by deeming the transfers from the deceased person to the executor or administrator, and from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary, as a disposal and acquisition of the property at the total cost of the land to the deceased person at the date of transfer (rather than at the land’s market value). The effect of this is that no tax liabilities under the bright-line test arise under the transfers. 88 Disposals by a beneficiary, executor or administrator of residential land transferred to them on the death of a person are specifically excluded from the bright-line test. However, the disposals may still be subject to tax under the current land sale rules. 89 CHANGES TO THE INTENTION TEST The Committee asked whether there were any changes planned, or changes which could improve the current intention test as a result of the new bright-line test. Comment The bright-line test is intended to be a supplement to the intention test to assist with enforcement in cases where there is fast turnover of residential property. We consider that the intention test is still necessary to ensure that speculators who hold their property for longer than two years are taxable on gains from their sales. As a result, the bright-line test is not intended to replace or alter the intention test. Officials are not currently proposing that any changes be made to the intention test. 90
Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill February 2015 Prepared by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, and the Treasury CONTENTS Overview 1 Matters raised in submissions 3 Transitional savings provisions for providers 5 Withdrawal of the Government kick-start contribution 6 Defined terms 7 Other aspects of the HomeStart package 8 OVERVIEW The central feature of the bill proposes to extend the current KiwiSaver withdrawal rules for first-home buyers on 1 April 2015 as part of the Government’s HomeStart package announced in August 2014. Under the current rules, KiwiSaver members who are purchasing their first home are able to withdraw the contributions they and their employer have made, to supplement a deposit on a first home. The proposals in the Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill will allow them to also withdraw their member tax credit, giving these members access to up to an extra $521 for each year the Government has contributed to the scheme. The Government’s $1,000 kick-start contribution is excluded from the provisions in the bill and cannot be withdrawn so a member’s KiwiSaver account remains open and active after the withdrawal of eligible funds. Four submissions were received on the KiwiSaver proposals in the bill and are covered in this officials’ report. No submissions were received on the proposed remedial amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006, which will ensure that income replacement payments made to New Zealand veterans are taxed as intended by the Veterans’ Support Act 2014. The bill therefore clarifies that income replacement payments for veterans will be treated in the same way as ACC compensation payments for taxation, social policy and KiwiSaver purposes, and will be taken into account for social policy calculations such as when applying for Working for Families tax credits. 1 2 Matters raised in submissions 3 4 TRANSITIONAL SAVINGS PROVISIONS FOR PROVIDERS Clause 6 Submissions (Workplace Savings NZ, ANZ) The bill should include a transitional “savings” provisio n to provide relief to KiwiSaver providers who would otherwise be required to update offer documents from 1 April 2015 or potentially be in breach of securities law. Such a provision would allow providers to update their documents to reference the new KiwiSaver rules during the next annual review cycle. (Workplace Savings NZ, ANZ) The transitional savings provision should go further and include reference to other non- legislative changes to the KiwiSaver HomeStart policy which were announced in Budget 2014. (Workplace Savings NZ) Comment Officials agree with the submissions and note that similar transitional savings provisions have been made in similar circumstances in previous bills. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 5 WITHDRAWAL OF THE GOVERNMENT KICK-START CONTRIBUTION Clause 6 Submission (BNZ) With the change to allow KiwiSaver members to withdraw their accumulation of member tax credits, the $1,000 kick-start contribution is the only portion of their savings which is unavailable for withdrawal under first home withdrawal rules. Is there any “overwhelming policy rationale” for this? Comment Excluding the $1,000 kick-start contribution means that KiwiSaver members’ accounts will remain open following a withdrawal under the first home withdrawal provision. This is a pragmatic rule to ensure members remain part of the scheme and their payments, deductions and tax credits have somewhere to go. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 6 DEFINED TERMS Clause 4 Submission (BNZ) The bill seeks to amend the definition of “salary and wages”. The defined term in the KiwiSaver Act is “salary or wages”. Comment Officials agree with the submission that the correct term should be “salary or wages”, as defined in the KiwiSaver Act 2006. \[Emphasis added\]. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 7 OTHER ASPECTS OF THE HOMESTART PACKAGE No clause Submissions (Alan Matteucci, BNZ) The Government should not increase the first home deposit subsidy for newly built ho mes, which is changing from a maximum of $5,000 (or $10,000 for a couple) to $10,000 (or $20,000 for a couple). (Alan Matteucci) The Government should review the price cap limits which set the maximum price for a house to still qualify for the first home deposit subsidy. (BNZ) Comment The submitters have raised matters that do not relate to the provision in the bill. Changes to the HomeStart deposit subsidy and the price cap are made through Cabinet directives rather than legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 8

The first key proposal of the Bill requires buyers and sellers of property to present an IRD number (and their foreign equivalent of an IRD number if applicable) to Land Information New Zealand as part of the land registration process. The IRD number equivalent will not apply to a New Zealand individual if they are buying or selling their main home. The second key proposal of the Bill requires offshore persons to have a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number. Twelve written submissions were received by the Committee, with two of those submissions identified by officials as dealing with issues that are not contained in the Bill. Both submissions concern the proposed bright-line test and officials recommend that the Committee forward the submissions to the appropriate Inland Revenue officials. Generally submitters were broadly supportive of the policy objectives of the Bill. Some concerns were raised in relation to ensuring that compliance costs are minimised. A particular concern raised by some submitters was the need for appropriate guidance to determine whether the main home exemption applies. Officials agree that comprehensive guidance should be provided to buyers and sellers. A communications programme to inform buyers, sellers and conveyancers in plain English will be provided as part of the implementation of the changes. Officials have also proposed several technical and drafting changes. 2 3 Matters raised by submitters 4 5 SUPPORT FOR REFORM Issue: Support for the Bill Submission (Auckland District Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) A number of submitters have expressed their broad support for the Bill and its associated policy objectives. One submitter congratulated the Government on its intention to introduce rules that would enable more accurate information to be collected on the levels of foreign ownership of New Zealand property. (Auckland District Law Society) One submitter noted that it believed that the costs imposed by the Bill would be outweighed by the benefits that would result from easier and better enforcement of income tax rules relating to property and better information about the property market. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Another submitter noted that the Bill is well-intentioned as it seeks to improve systems in order to gather better information and assist tax law enforcement. (New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation) Comment Officials note the submitters’ support for the Bill. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 6 IMPACT ON THE LAND TRANSFER SYSTEM Issue: Possible delays in the land transfer system Submission (Auckland District Law Society) The changes will disrupt the land transfer system. More time should have been given to consult with stakeholders. If delays occur and a bank account is not available, a tax file number cannot be issued in a chain of settlements involving a whole series of consequential transactions for third parties could be delayed or ultimately cancelled due to defaults in not settling. Comment It will be important that potential buyers and sellers are made aware of the need to apply for bank accounts (if they are an offshore person) and IRD numbers early enough in the transaction process. Officials are working on communications to ensure that this information is made public as soon as possible, and in particular with real estate agents. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 7 LEGISLATIVE COHERENCE Issue: Land Transfer Act 1952 and income tax rules Submission (EY) The Land Transfer Act 1952 should not include or attempt to replicate proposed income tax rules, whether wholly or in part. Comment The intention of the tax information collection requirements are to provide better information for tax compliance purposes. Accordingly, a balance needs to be struck between requiring information which is useful for tax enforcement purposes and keeping the rules as simple as possible for transferors and transferees of land. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 8 TIMEFRAME OF BILL Issue: Development of the bill Submission (Auckland District Law Society) Further time should have been given for developing the bill. Comment The changes are part of a wider package of reforms aimed at improving tax compliance for property transactions and it is important that the start dates align with other tax changes that commence on 1 October 2015. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 POST-IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW Issue: Automatic expiration of the provisions in the bill Submission (Auckland District Law Society) The provisions should automatically expire in 3-5 years’ time to ensure that there is a mandatory review. Comment An automatic expiry date is unnecessary and would create uncertainty. A post implementation review is a recognised part of the generic tax policy process. 1 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Monitoring and review on an on-going basis Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed new rules should be monitored and reviewed on an on-going basis to ensure that they are working as intended and that they are consistent with further legislative reform, such as Phase 2 of the Government’s anti-money laundering policy. Comment As part of generic tax policy process, newly introduced measures are subject to a post- implementation review. In addition, the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax system is monitored by Inland Revenue on an on-going basis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 1 Further information about the generic tax policy process can be found at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/how-we-develop-tax-policy 10 NEXT STAGES OF PROPERTY COMPLIANCE MEASURES Issue: Consistency between property tax proposals Submission (EY) The Bill implements the first of three proposed reforms to the taxation of real property. There will be a need to review and possibly revise the land information requirements once the detailed proposals for the second and third stages of the property tax law reforms have been developed. This would be an unfortunate outcome and inefficient use of resources and create increased uncertainty and confusion for taxpayers. Comment Consequential amendments to the Land Transfer Act 1952 may be necessary once detailed proposals for the bright-line test and withholding tax have been developed. Any such amendments will seek to maintain coherence between these proposals. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 11 MAIN HOME EXEMPTION Issue: Reconsidering the main home exemption Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The main home exemption makes the rules more complex and limits the volume of information available and therefore the value of that information. The exemption should be reconsidered. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) All parties to property transfers should provide IRD numbers, with no main home or other exemption. (EY) Comment The exemption broadly aligns with both the current rules for taxing gains from property, and the proposed bright-line test which are not targeted at a person’s main home. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Complexity of main home exemption provision Submission (Auckland District Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, EY) The main home exemption from providing an IRD number will be difficult to apply. The main home exemption will create uncertainty and difficulties on the boundary. The provisions need to be simplified. The uncertainty with the main home exemption means that there is a risk of dispute. This does not seem justified from a broader policy perspective. It would be preferable to focus any issues, disputes and risks on substantive income tax matters, rather than on procedural and information-gathering rules. (EY) 12 Comment Officials are proposing to simplify the main home exemption by removing the requirement that the land be “residential land”. In addition, officials propose to clarify the date on which a home needs to be the person’s main home and simplify the “mainly used as a residence” test. Officials agree that guidance on these rules is desirable. To the extent that comments in this report and the bill commentary have not clarified matters to submitters’ satisfaction, officials anticipate the usual post-enactment explanation of the rules in a Tax Information Bulletin (or by way of an earlier special report published upon enactment) should provide further clarification. Inland Revenue is also making administrative efforts to communicate the effect of the proposed legislation to key stakeholder groups. Officials would also welcome direct contact from interested parties on any areas of particular concern. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of “main home” rather than existing definitions of residence Submission (Auckland District Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society) There are existing terms used to define a person’s main residence such as “principal place of residence” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 or the concept of “permanent place of abode” or “habitual abode” in double tax agreements. Creating a new definition of “main home” creates uncertainty. Instead an existing definition should be used. Comment Officials consider it preferable to align the main home exemption with the current tax rules for land sales. This ensures that a person would only obtain the main home exemption where it is likely that the gains from the sale of the property will not be taxable. The two key requirements for the main home test (mainly used as a residence and greatest connection) are to some extent based on existing tax rules. As a result, existing guidance on these provisions could be used to assist in the application of the rules. 13 Officials consider in the majority of cases, these provisions would be simple to apply. When there are situations on the boundary, plain English guidance for buyers, sellers and conveyancers will be provided. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Greatest connection Submission (Auckland District Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers) A person’s “main home” is the “1 home with which the person has the greatest connection”. The concept of a “greatest connection” is imprecise and greater clarity is needed. It should be sufficient that the home is the one home used by the person mainly as a residence, regardless of whether they subjectively have the “greatest connection” to it. (New Zealand Law Society) Comprehensive guidance should be provided as to how it should apply. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) What factors are relevant in determining a person’s “greatest connection” should be listed in the legislation. (Auckland District Law Society) “Greatest connection” is not used in New Zealand revenue legislation. It is unclear how the “permanent place of abode” test, that it appears to be trying to replicate, is applicable as a person can have more than one “permanent place of abode”. (EY) Some common examples would be useful to illustrate the concept of “greatest connection”. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The definition of “main home” must broadly align with the definition to be used in the bright-line test, so that people understand what their tax obligations are likely to be now, and so that the right information is gathered as part of this process. The core of the definition is “the 1 home that is mainly used as a residence”. The “greatest connection” requirement is only necessary to determine which home obtains the main home exemption in circumstances where a person has multiple homes. The greatest connection requirement therefore operates only as a tie-breaker where a person has more than one home. 14 Officials consider in the majority of cases, these provisions would be simple to apply. When there are situations on the boundary, plain English guidance for buyers, sellers and conveyancers will be provided. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Time “main home” determined Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is unclear when a person needs to satisfy the “main home” requirement in order to obtain the main home exemption from providing an IRD number. The current drafting creates uncertainty where a person moves out of their home for a short period prior to transferring it. Comment It is intended that the main home exemption applies where the person did use or intended to use it as their main home. The exemption would still apply when a person moves out of their home shortly before selling it. Officials consider that the current drafting achieves this outcome. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Need for guidance Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers) It is critical that comprehensive guidance on the main home exemption is provided. The absence of such guidance will lead to unacceptable levels of uncertainty. The proposed definition of “main home” is different from the “principal place of residence” test for GST. To avoid any confusion when the Bill is enacted it should be clearly communicated that these two definitions are different and must both be considered separately. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 15 Comment Officials agree that guidance on these rules is desirable. Plain English guidance for buyers, sellers and conveyancers will be provided. Further, an explanation of the rules in a Tax Information Bulletin (or by way of an earlier special report published upon enactment) should provide clarification. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Main home of family member Submission (EY) The main home exemption should be available when a property is not the transferor’s main home but is the main home of a family member of the transferor. Comment The main home exemption from providing an IRD number is intended to align with the current land sale rules. This ensures that a person only gets the exemption where it is likely that the gains from the sale of property will not be taxable. The exemption under the current land sale rules for a person’s residence only applies where it is the transferor’s main home. As a result, a home used solely by other family members should not be able to obtain the exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Person’s family living with the person Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Main home is defined as the “1 home that is mainly used as a residence by the person and any member of the person’s family living with the person...” 16 If a property is used mainly as a residence by the person (i.e. the owner), it should be irrelevant whether it is mainly used as a residence by any member of the owner’s family living with them. Comment The intention of the reference to a “person’s family living with the person” was to ensure that owners can qualify for the main home exemption when they reside in property with their family living with them. Officials accept that this can be achieved without including these words in the legislation and they should be deleted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the words “and any member of the person’s family living with the person” should be deleted from the definition of main home in s156A. Issue: Change “exempt transfer” wording Submission (EY) The wording “exempt transfer” should be changed to a different wording (such as “non-notifiable transfer”) to avoid creating the impression that no income tax liabilities will arise in relation to a particular piece of land if it meets the “exempt transfer” standard. Comment Officials note that the references to exempt transfer will be included in the Land Transfer Act and it is clear they only refer to the collection of information rather than liability for tax. Tax liability is dealt with under different legislation. Officials will refer the submission to the drafter for consideration. Recommendation That the submission be considered by the drafter. 17 Issue: Vendors who use main home exemption more than twice in past 2 years Submission (EY) The Bill as drafted would exclude a transfer from being an “exempt transfer” for vendors if they have relied on the main home exemption category at least twice in the last two years. This exclusion would not apply to any vendor until they make a disposal after 1 October 2017, at the earliest (assuming the Bill is enacted and its provisions come into force for transfers from 1 October 2015). The exclusion from the main home exemption should be reconsidered and, if it is to be retained, its drafting should be clarified for the following reasons: the reference to “the date of transfer is not clear; the exclusion increases the complexity of the rules; and the exclusion may create or reinforce perceptions as to the tax liability on the disposal of property. Comments While the two year period would start from the enactment of this Bill (which is intended to be 1 October 2015), the provision limits exempt transfers to two in any two year period. Thus, if a person sold two main homes in any lesser period than two years, for example six months, and then shortly thereafter was going to sell their third main home, they would not be able to use the main home exemption and would need to provide a full tax statement. The Bill as drafted has the intended effect. The relevant date is intended to be the date the transfer is registered. Officials consider that current drafting achieves this result. As noted elsewhere, this bill is about information collection and the fact that information has not been collected does not necessarily mean that there is no tax liability in any particular situation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Meaning of “arrangement” Submission (Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society) It is not clear what an arrangement is. Often a contract to construct a dwelling is not entered into until after a property is transferred. The current definition also does not cover a residential section upon which a dwelling may be constructed in the future. There needs to be a timeframe for the expiry of an arrangement. (Auckland District Law Society) 18 Residential land should include “land that will have a dwelling on it within X months” rather than refer to an arrangement. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials consider that the bill could be simplified by removing the requirement that land be “residential land” to obtain the main home exemption from providing an IRD number. This would also mean that the definitions of “dwelling” and “farmland” – which are only included because they are used in the definition of residential land – are not required and could be deleted. Recommendation That the submissions be noted and that the definitions of “dwelling”, “farmland” and “residential land” be deleted from clause 156A of the Bill. Issue: Meaning of “dwelling” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The definition of “dwelling” excludes a number of types of premises. These are presumably intended to capture the units/sections within the various premises listed, rather than the entire premises. If that is the case it should be clarified. The definition of “dwelling” excludes retirement villages. This means that a person who uses a retirement village as their main home will not be able to get the benefit of the main home exemption. Comment As discussed above, officials consider that the bill could be simplified by removing the requirement that land be “residential land” to obtain the main home exemption. If the Committee agrees to that recommendation, the definition of “dwelling” would be deleted. This would enable people who live in retirement villages to utilise the main home exemption. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 19 Issue: Meaning of “farmland” Submission (EY) The definition of farmland should also refer to forestry, horticultural, and pastoral businesses to avoid uncertainty in the context of the Land Transfer Act 1952. Comment As discussed above, officials consider that the bill could be simplified by removing the requirement that land be “residential land” to obtain the main home exemption. If the Committee agrees to that recommendation, the definition of “farmland” would also be deleted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 20 OTHER INTERESTS IN LAND Issue: Specified estates in land Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It should be communicated widely and explicitly that the proposed changes affect all transfers of “specified estates in land”. For instance, land other than residential land will be affected. Comment Plain English guidance for buyers, sellers and conveyancers will be provided. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Cross lease properties included Submission (Auckland District Law Society) Cross lease properties should also be included within the definition of “specified estate in land”. Comment Cross lease properties are a form of leasehold estate in land so are already included as a specified estate in land in s156A of the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 21 EXEMPTIONS SPECIFIED BY REGULATIONS Issue: Reconsidering exemptions specified by regulations Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The exemptions to be specified in regulations should be reconsidered, or public consultation on proposed regulations should be provided for. In addition, the “low risk of tax avoidance” reason for the Minister making regulations that would exempt certain transfers should be reconsidered. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The relevant provision be limited to administrative details required to make the two class exemptions of the explanatory note to the Bill workable. (Chapman Tripp) Comment The Bill provides that the exemption is only to be applied in a narrow set of circumstances, where it is impractical or involves high compliance costs or where there is a low risk of tax avoidance. The number of transfers that will fall within qualifying categories is likely to be limited. The “low risk of tax avoidance” criterion aligns with one of the underlying policy objectives of the Bill, which is to improve tax compliance. The process of introducing any regulations will involve consultation with key stakeholders. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Reconsidering exemptions specified by regulations Submission (EY) Regulations can be made on the recommendation of the Minister. Clarification is required as to which Minister is intended in this context. Comment The Bill will be amended to make it clear that the regulations will be made by the Minister for Land Information. These regulations will be made after consultation with the Minister of Revenue. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 22 PROVISION OF TAX INFORMATION Issue: IRD number application process Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The process for obtaining a New Zealand IRD number will need to be kept simple, fast and efficient. Comment Once a completed application is received, the current timelines for Inland Revenue to issue an IRD number is 8–10 working days. Inland Revenue plans to increase its resources in this area to ensure that it continues to meet the current timeframes. As part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation work, a key business objective is to encourage as many customers as possible to deal with us through digital channels. Any future improvements for people obtaining an IRD number would be part of this work. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Online IRD number application Submission (Auckland District Law Society) Inland Revenue should make available the option to apply for an IRD number online. Comment As part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation work a key business objective is to ensure that officials encourage as many customers as possible to deal with us through digital channels. Any future improvements for people obtaining an IRD number would be part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation work. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 23 Issue: Validation of residence status Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Inland Revenue should have a system for validating a person’s residence status before exchanging information with a foreign jurisdiction’s tax authority. Comment Inland Revenue does not need to validate a person’s residence status before exchanging information with a foreign tax authority. This is because the standard for exchanging information under double tax agreements with other countries is whether the information would be “foreseeably relevant”. If a foreign tax information number has been used by a person in the past, then information relating to that person can justifiably be exchanged with other tax authorities under this standard without validation of the tax residence status of that person. Officials note that safeguards are built into exchange of information processes to maintain data protection and secrecy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The requirement to provide a tax statement should only apply to transfers of land under contracts entered into on or after 1 October 2015. Comment Officials consider that, for simplicity, the best policy is for any transfers of land where registration is done on or after 1 October 2015 to be subject to the new requirement to provide a tax statement. Thus, where the contract for transfer of land is concluded before this date, the parties to the transfer may still be required to provide tax statements upon registration. An information campaign is planned to inform people of the changes as early as possible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 Issue: Non-active trust compliance costs Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Trusts that are required to obtain an IRD number due to the proposed changes should not have to file a tax return for years in which they derive no income. (Chartered Accounts Australia and New Zealand, EY) A non-active trust declaration similar to the non-active company declaration should be introduced. Trustees should be made aware of the extra tax obligations that arise once a trust has an IRD number and also the required criteria for a non-active trust declaration, if introduced. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment All trusts, including trusts that only hold a family home, will be required to provide an IRD number under this proposal. Any tax implications will be considered as part of the second stage (which will include the “bright-line” test) of the property law reform process. This will include clarification that trusts do not generate income (for example, because their only asset is the family home) will not be required to file. Officials understand that an administrative practice has allowed non-active trusts to not file and will ensure that this practice continues until that stage of reform is completed. Recommendation That the submission be declined and considered as part of the second stage of the property law reform process. Issue: Exemption for death and relationship property transfers Submission (EY) Death and relationship property transfers should be exempt or addressed specifically in relation to the requirement to provide tax information. Comments Officials note that in some cases the information collection provisions will not entirely align with the proposed bright-line rule. This bill relates to information collection only and not to core taxing provisions. 25 Officials note that the legislation makes provision for transactions to be exempt via Regulations where it is impractical, there are high compliance costs, or there is a low risk of tax avoidance. As part of developing regulations officials will consider whether death and relationship property transfers should be exempt. Recommendation That the submission be declined Issue: Fast-tracking IRD number application process for trusts Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Inland Revenue should allow the IRD number application process for trusts to be fast- tracked. Comment The current application process is between 8–10 working days upon receiving a completed application. As part of the application process, trusts are required to provide the trust deed and the names of the trustees. Officials do not consider that there is a reason to prioritise applications for trusts over other taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Change of trustees as an exempt transfer Submission (Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society) Land transactions that are the result of a change in the trustees of a trust should be exempt transfers. Comment A land transfer transaction is already required where there is a change in trustee. There is therefore no additional on-going compliance cost from this requirement as the same IRD number will be used and it will already be known. 26 Further, it is possible that a change in trustees could result in a change in the tax residence of a trust for overseas tax purposes. For example, adding a new trustee who is considered to be tax resident in another country may, in certain cases, result in the trust itself becoming tax resident in the other country for the purposes of that country’s laws. The policy intent is that in this situation, any new foreign tax information number should be captured. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Mortgagee sale or power of sale conferred by statute Submission (New Zealand Law Society) There should be no obligation to provide a tax statement where a transfer of land is pursuant to a mortgagee sale or power of sale conferred by statute. This is because the transferor’s tax information is not relevant as they are the mortgagee, and the mortgagor’s tax information may not be available to the mortgagee. Comment This is an issue for consideration under the proposed regulation-making power. Officials will consult with stakeholders as part of the regulation-making process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Determining tax residence Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Inland Revenue should release some guidance as to how people determine their tax residence (for the purpose of providing a foreign tax information number). Comment A person will need to provide their foreign tax information number, if they are currently treated as tax resident in another jurisdiction under that jurisdiction’s tax laws. Where a person is tax resident in a jurisdiction, the jurisdiction is entitled to tax them on their worldwide income. 27 Most jurisdictions’ rules relating to tax residence provide that a person will be resident if they have a significant presence in that jurisdiction (common examples are having a house in that jurisdiction at the time, or spending more than six months in that jurisdiction during the relevant period). Accordingly, officials expect the person will have already had contact with the relevant tax authority. Officials will ensure that Inland Revenue guidance makes it clear that the person should contact the relevant overseas jurisdiction’s tax authority for assistance in determining whether they are tax resident, if they are uncertain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Passport basis instead of tax residence basis Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) For simplicity, the requirement to provide a foreign tax information number if an individual is tax resident in another country should be replaced with a passport basis. That is, if an individual has a passport in another country, they will be required to provide information from that jurisdiction. Comment The information that is being collected is to be used for tax purposes, and therefore should be on the basis of tax residency. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transfer to an offshore person Submission (EY) The legislation is not clear as to whether a transfer to an offshore person intending to use the property as their main home is exempt. Comments The submitter queries whether transfers to an offshore person made by a person who qualifies for the main home exemption will be exempt. The Bill’s intention is that, in 28 such a case, the transferor’s transaction would be exempt, but that the offshore person’s transaction would not be exempt. Officials consider that the current drafting achieves this intention. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Foreign tax information provision from multiple jurisdictions Submission (EY, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Foreign tax information should be sought for all jurisdictions in which a non- individual person is tax resident. The current drafting tends towards only requiring foreign tax information from one foreign jurisdiction. Comment The Bill’s intent is that a person who is tax resident in more than one jurisdiction will have to provide all of their foreign tax information numbers. Officials consider that the drafting currently achieves this policy intent. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Form of tax statement should be standardised Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society) There should be a standard form tax statement agreed to by Inland Revenue and Land Information New Zealand. Comment The Bill sets out clearly what information is required to be included on the tax statement. Land Information New Zealand and Inland Revenue intend to produce a standard form. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 29 Issue: Form of tax statement should be published in the Gazette Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The standard form of the tax statement could be Gazetted. Comment Publishing the form in the New Zealand Gazette would require everyone to use that form as gazetted, and officials believe that is unnecessarily restrictive. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Country code availability Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Country codes should be made publicly available on the websites of Inland Revenue and Land Information New Zealand. Comment Officials will ensure that the country codes are publicly available, including on appropriate websites. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Remove certifiers’ retention period for holding of tax statement Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The ten year retention period obligation for tax statements on certifiers should be completely removed. 30 Comment The ten year retention is required for all other land transfer requirements. Further, the retention period should be preserved as stated in the Bill, because tax statements must be available for prosecution purposes under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reduce retention period for holding of tax statement Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The retention period should be reduced to seven years to align with the retention period for tax records. Comment The reduction of the retention period to seven years would result in a misalignment with other land transfer documentation retention periods, which are (generally) specified to be ten years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removal of certifier obligation to provide Commissioner of Inland Revenue with tax statements Submission (Chapman Tripp) Certifiers should not be required to give a copy of a tax statement to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue upon request. This information will already be provided to Land Information New Zealand. Comment The information that will be provided to Land Information New Zealand is the summary of the tax information, not the tax statement itself. In situations where a tax investigation is necessary, the tax statement may be required by Inland Revenue for evidentiary purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 31 Issue: Retention by electronic means Submission (Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society) Retention of tax statements should be able to be done electronically as an additional option. Comment The Electronic Transactions Act 2002 already provides that electronic retention can be done instead of physical retention. The Bill does not overrule the relevant part of that Act, nor is it intended that electronic retention is disallowed. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: No certification of tax statement accuracy and no liability for incorrect information Submission (Auckland District Law Society, Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Law Society, Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) It is submitted that an explicit provision be included in the Bill to ensure that Certifiers do not certify the accuracy of the tax statement information provided to Land Information New Zealand. Further to this, the Bill should state that there will be no liability for incorrect information provided by Certifiers. (Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Law Society) The liability for providing false or misleading tax information should be limited to transferees and transferors. (Real Estate Institute of New Zealand) The references to certifiers and chief executives should be removed altogether. (Auckland District Law Society) Comment The Bill provides for an offence to apply to a person who knowingly gives false information. As the person who gives the tax statement is either the transferee or the transferor, the offence contained in the bill would not apply to certifiers such as a conveyancing lawyer. However, it should be noted that, under existing provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a person who knowingly provides a false or misleading tax statement to any 32 person could be liable for similar penalties. This could include a certifier who knowingly provides false information to Land Information New Zealand. A transferee, transferor, or certifier will not be liable (under existing law or under the proposals in the bill) for unintentionally providing incorrect information. The bill provides a process for information to be corrected. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Definition of “chief executive” Submission (Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society) “Chief executive” should be defined. Comment The references to Chief Executive will form part of the Land Transfer Act 1952. That Act currently only defines “department”, which is Land Information New Zealand. Officials agree that as currently drafted this may create confusion. Officials recommend amending the Bill to add the words “of the department” after “Chief Executive”. This addition, in combination with the existing provisions in the Land Transfer Act 1952, will make it clear who the Chief Executive is. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: “Nominee” by reference to the Income Tax Act 2007 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The meaning of the term “nominee” should be clarified by reference to the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment Officials accept that the term “nominee” can have different meanings in different areas of law and that it is sensible to clarify that, in this case, the term has a meaning that matches the one that can be found in the Income Tax Act 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 33 Issue: Focus on person who makes the nomination rather than nominee Submission (Chapman Tripp) In situations where a nominee is a transferor or transferee of land, it is crucial that the Bill’s focus is on the person who makes the nomination rather than the nominee in order to collect the right information. Comment Officials note that the Bill as currently drafted reflects this focus on the person who makes the nomination. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Information sharing concerns Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) The Bill as introduced addressed concerns raised by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner that the legislation could allow for the sharing of any information between Inland Revenue and Land Information New Zealand beyond the stated policy objectives. Amendments were made to limit information sharing between Inland Revenue and Land Information New Zealand to the extent necessary to meet the stated policy objective of assessing tax liability on property transactions. Comment Officials are aware of the need to consider privacy issues and the use of information collected under the Bill. There is a proposed amendment to allow information to be used by Government departments for housing policy. This information will be provided in aggregate form by Land Information New Zealand and will not allow for the identification of particular individuals or entities. Inland Revenue will have access to individualised information, but only for the purposes of tax compliance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 34 Issue: Requiring information through IRD number application process Submission (EY) If New Zealand entities are established by other individuals or entities which might fall within an “overseas” category, officials suggest any similar information required of those owners or controllers should be sought as part of the CIR’s process for allocating an IRD number to the entity, rather than as part of the LTA property transfer process. Comments Requiring information as part of the land transfer process gives Inland Revenue the information it needs to help enforce tax rules relating to income from property and property transactions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: No further information in tax statement Submission (EY) There should be no information as to the person’s residence or the use or characterisation of the property disclosed as part of the tax statement. Comment The information provided on the tax statement will be relevant for tax purposes and therefore officials consider that it should be collected. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 35 BANK ACCOUNT REQUIREMENT Issue: Bank account number prerequisite Submission (EY) Further consideration of this proposal is needed to determine whether it is necessary and to limit its possible application. Comment The intent of the bank account requirement is that it will provide Inland Revenue with more confidence that it knows who it is dealing with by ensuring that a person has first satisfied a financial institution’s anti-money laundering verification of identity requirements. Subject to the changes recommended below, officials consider that the bill is appropriately drafted to achieve this objective. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Bank account number on becoming offshore person Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The requirement for a person to provide a New Zealand bank account number to Inland Revenue upon becoming an “offshore” person should be removed. Comment Officials consider that the requirement to provide a bank account on becoming an offshore person is an important anti-avoidance measure. If a New Zealand person were to establish such companies and sell their interests in them to offshore persons without the bank account requirement kicking in, the requirement could be easily circumvented. The comment by the submitter that Inland Revenue will already have a bank account for the person, or have other means of accessing their bank account information will not always be the case in practice. Some companies incorporated in New Zealand will not have New Zealand bank accounts and will not have been required to provide one to Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 36 Issue: Guidance on transition to bank account requirement Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Guidance should be produced by Inland Revenue as to whether non-individual offshore persons which already have an IRD number need to provide Inland Revenue with a New Zealand bank account number. Comment The provision applies only to people that apply for an IRD number on or after 1 October 2015. If a company that is an “offshore person” already has an IRD number, they will not be required to provide a bank account to Inland Revenue after that date. The only way that a person with a current IRD number can be required to provide a bank account is if they are a non-individual and become an offshore person on or after 1 October (for example, if New Zealand shareholders of a New Zealand-registered company sell their shares to offshore individuals). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Preventing double provision of bank account number Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed rule should be changed to ensure that only those non-individuals who have not previously provided Inland Revenue with a bank account number will be required to provide one. Comment The submission raises the issue of whether the provision of a bank account at this stage is necessary if Inland Revenue already has bank account details of that company. Officials would agree that requiring a bank account in these circumstances would be unnecessary, but only if the bank account that Inland Revenue has on file is current at the relevant time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that the legislation be amended to clarify that a bank account is not required if Inland Revenue already has a current account for a non-individual at the time it becomes an offshore person. 37 Issue: Timeframes of obligation to provide bank account number Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The obligation to provide a New Zealand bank account number to Inland Revenue could be extended to the 20 th of the following month (to align with various tax return due dates), with a potential requirement to provide the account number earlier if a tax statement is completed at an earlier date. Comment It is necessary for the legislation to be clear about when the obligation to provide a bank account number arises. Officials consider that an immediate obligation is appropriate. Given that is the time that the interests are being transferred, it would allow the bank account requirement to form part of the transfer transaction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Bank account requirement limited to non-individuals dealing in or holding property Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement to provide a New Zealand bank account number should be limited to non-individuals who either hold property or are in the process of actually making a property transfer. Comment As set out above, the policy is that it will provide Inland Revenue with more confidence that it knows who it is dealing with by ensuring that a person has first satisfied a financial institution’s anti-money laundering verification of identity requirements. It is intended that this policy apply equally to both individuals and non- individuals. With regard to the timing of the bank account requirement, the IRD number application is a recognised point of contact for people with Inland Revenue. It is expected that the vast majority of offshore persons that are individuals and have the ability to work will either have, or will be otherwise required to obtain a bank account as part of their working arrangements. Those offshore people that are not required to get an account are more likely to be the people that the proposal is targeting, so imposing the bank account requirement is consistent with the policy. 38 Inland Revenue is generally not involved in the property transaction process. Making an additional contact point with Inland Revenue at that time would add compliance costs. Equally, having the bank account information routed through LINZ would add administration costs to that process. If a party to a property transaction was required to provide evidence of a New Zealand bank account as part of that transaction, it would require either:  The person (generally a conveyancing lawyer) registering the change of property ownership to certify that the account exists. The Bill has been drafted on the basis that the advisors (in most cases the conveyancing lawyer) will not need to certify information being provided by the vendor or purchaser as being correct. This was a deliberate policy decision to ensure that penalties for non- compliance rest with the underlying vendor/purchaser of the property, rather than their advisors. To impose obligations at the advisor level would result in increased transaction costs as advisors would require longer to certify documents and would probably require new or different tools to authenticate information their clients provide them; or  The lawyer providing a copy of a bank statement (or some other similar evidence) to LINZ outside of the automated Landonline registration process. The receipt and passing on of this information would be administratively cumbersome for conveyancing lawyers and LINZ and potentially for the information exchange with Inland Revenue. Whether a person is an “offshore person” is not currently a feature of the information being collated by LINZ – it is only relevant for a person’s self-assessment of whether an exemption applies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The bank account requirement may not deliver intended outcomes Submission New Zealand Bankers’ Association, ANZ The bank account requirement may be undermined, particularly by anti-money laundering rules that allow accounts to be opened prior to completion of all due diligence. Comment Officials note that, under section 16(3) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009, customer due diligence can only be conducted after the business relationship has been established if: a) it is essential not to interrupt normal business practice; and 39 b) money laundering and financing of terrorism risks are effectively managed through procedures of transaction limitations and account monitoring; and c) verification of identity is completed as soon as is practicable once the business relationship has been established. It will be up to the financial institution to determine in any given case whether these criteria are met. Officials consider it is appropriate for offshore applicants to go through the appropriate anti-money laundering due diligence checks (even if those are the enhanced checks for high risk customers), as that is what the Bill is designed to achieve. Officials consider that the requirement may result in increased customer numbers for financial institutions, but it is not the intention that new customers are treated differently – just that they are subject to the appropriate anti-money laundering checks. There are no extra reporting obligations imposed by these requirements. In saying this, officials understand from the submission that the anti-money laundering rules allow a bank to open an account and then require/examine all the identity material sometime later. Until the customer goes through all the checks, the account is effectively frozen to transactions. Officials are concerned that this scenario could pose a significant risk to the effectiveness of the rules. An offshore person could open an account with a token amount, use that account to gain an IRD number and then never actually go through the customer due diligence process. The bank would presumably close the account after trying to obtain the information, but Inland Revenue may never know of this. The customer may prefer this approach because they get an IRD number and only lose the small amount involved in the initial deposit. Officials suggest clarifying the bill so that only an account on which customer due diligence had been completed could be used to obtain the IRD number. If the person uses a “frozen account” to obtain an IRD number they would be breaching the requirement in the bill (with associated penalties). As stated above, officials do not intend to impose any additional compliance burden on banks. It would up to the customer to only use an appropriate account in their IRD number application. The customer should know that due diligence had been completed because the account would be “unfrozen”. As mentioned above, officials recommend that this policy be reviewed after the Phase 2 roll-out of the anti-money laundering rules, so whether this change is having the desired effect this is something that could be considered as part of that review. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the bill be amended to clarify that only accounts on which customer due diligence has been fully completed should be able to be used to obtain an IRD number. 40 Issue: Compliance costs Submission New Zealand Bankers’ Association, ANZ Other potential impacts could be that it will be harder for foreign investors to open accounts and there may be increased dormant accounts. The 1 October effective date is challenging. Comment It is not the intention of these rules to make it harder for offshore persons to open accounts, just that they do so. Equally, it is not the intention that this requirement imposes significant compliance costs on banks. Although dormant accounts may increase in number, officials expect banks to handle these accounts using existing processes. It is not necessary for the account to remain open indefinitely. The 1 October date is an important component of these changes, because there are a suite of changes all occurring on that date. Alignment is seen as crucial so that the start date of information provision requirements matches that for other measures. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Communication strategy for bank account requirement Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Inland Revenue should develop a communication strategy to ensure that persons affected by the new bank account requirement are sufficiently aware of their new obligations upon commencement. Comment Inland Revenue and LINZ are coordinating to ensure that advisors most likely to be involved in property transactions are aware of any obligations that their clients may be under following the introduction of these rules. The IRD number application form will be updated so that, post 1 October 2015 the bank account requirement will be clearly signalled for offshore applicants. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 41 Issue: Banks requiring IRD number before opening account Submission (Chapman Tripp) Offshore persons may have difficulty providing a New Zealand bank account number in order to obtain an IRD number because some registered banks will require an IRD number before they will allow a bank account to be opened. Comment Officials understand that the absence of an IRD number should not prevent a person from opening a bank account. A bank could open an account irrespective of whether the person has the number. The practical difference is, as the submitter points out, that the “non-disclosure” tax rate will apply to the account until an IRD number is attached to it. The non-disclosure rate is the top personal marginal rate of 33%. However, if a person opens an account and then applies for an IRD number, the IRD number can then be taken back to the bank and attached to the account. It is recognised that this extra transaction with the bank will have some compliance costs, but these are not expected to be significant. Also, given the timeframes, if these actions are taken promptly, it is unlikely that the higher rate will be in place for any meaningful period of time and so should not impact on interest payments made in respect of the account. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Post-implementation review of bank account requirement Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) A post-implementation review is done in two-three years’ time on the requirement to provide a New Zealand bank account number in order to obtain an IRD number. Comment A post implementation review is a recognised part of the generic tax policy process. 2 The submitter has raised the issue that the bank account requirement may be superseded by Phase 2 of the anti-money laundering legislation, which is expected to apply to solicitors, real estate agents and conveyancers. 2 Further information about the generic tax policy process can be found here: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/how-we-develop-tax-policy 42 Officials agree that unnecessary duplication of information is undesirable and so, subject to other Government priorities, agree that the effect of the bank account requirement be reviewed following Phase 2 of the anti-money laundering reform. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Definition of offshore person Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp) Reconsider the first two parts of the definition of offshore person (for an individual), those being New Zealand citizens not in New Zealand within the previous three years and resident class visa holders not in New Zealand in the last 12 months. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) For the purposes of being under a positive obligation to provide a bank account number, the definition should align with the “overseas person” definition in the Overseas Investment Act. (Chapman Tripp) Comment A definition linked to immigration status was chosen because it is easier for most people to understand than the concept of tax residence. Although a person’s tax residence and immigration status are often the same, this is not always the case. In marginal cases, tax residence can be difficult to determine, whereas immigration status is generally clearer. However, officials consider it is important that there is not a blanket exemption from the bank account requirement for New Zealand citizens. If a person has no meaningful connection with New Zealand their treatment should be the same irrespective of their immigration status. The proposed test that a citizen will become an offshore person if they have not been in New Zealand in the previous three years (12 months in the case of residence class visa holders) is replicated in the Electoral Act 1993. Officials consider this test will be simple for people to apply and is appropriate in terms of differentiating between citizens and residents that have retained some connection with New Zealand and those that have not. With regard to the Chapman Tripp submission, officials consider that applying one rule for individuals and a different rule for individuals that have interest in a New Zealand company/trust may incentivise people to ether apply for an IRD number directly or as a shareholder in a company, depending on which route provides the more favourable outcome. To the extent possible, officials consider it desirable to limit these types of behavioural distortions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 43 Issue: Clarification on “been in New Zealand” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Clarification is needed for the concept of having “been in New Zealand” Comment The expression “been in New Zealand” is intended to be interpreted at face value. It is not intended to impose a time limit on a person’s stay in the country, merely provide recognition for having entered the country. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Exception for inbound short-term employees Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Inbound short-term employees who work in New Zealand should be provided with an exemption in the definition of an offshore person. Comment Officials understand that the vast majority of people entering New Zealand on visas allowing employment will either be required to, or will chose to, open a New Zealand bank account in any event as a recipient account for their New Zealand wages. Therefore, although the proposal will require a different sequence of events (obtaining the bank account first and the IRD number second), the additional compliance costs on these immigrants is expected to be relatively low. Some non-resident workers are engaged on short-term assignments, for example to install or maintain specialised machinery. These visa-holders may be exempt from New Zealand tax if either they never become tax resident under our domestic law or if they are treated as non-resident by the operation of a double tax agreement. If they are not subject to New Zealand tax they are not required to get an IRD number, and so the bank account requirement would not apply to this group. It is also important to note that no class of visa restricts the ability of the person to purchase New Zealand residential property. The policy objective of this initiative is to increase compliance of New Zealand’s tax laws as they relate to property transactions. Therefore, in order for an exemption to be considered, there would need to be a clearly identifiable group that posed no real revenue risk from a property compliance perspective. The intent of the policy could be defeated if there was an immigration 44 status that was exempt from the bank account requirement and property investors could access this status. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Shifting identification verification onus onto other parties in land transactions Submission (New Zealand Bankers’ Association, ANZ) The bank account requirement should be removed and replaced with a verification of identification obligation to be placed on parties that will already have relationships with overseas purchasers of land, such as real estate agents and lawyers. Additionally, Phase 2 of anti-money laundering reform should be expedited. Comment At present, New Zealand’s anti-money laundering rules do not apply to professional bodies such as real estate agents, conveyancers and solicitors. However, it is anticipated that these professionals will be subject to the customer due diligence requirements as part of Phase 2 of the anti-money laundering rules. To impose due diligence obligations on such people as part of this bill, prior to Phase 2 of the anti- money laundering reform, could be seen as subverting the planned roll-out of the anti- money laundering rules. As set out above, officials consider it would be appropriate to review these rules once anti-money laundering Phase 2 has occurred to see if there is unacceptable duplication of information at that time. Inland Revenue and LINZ officials understand that the Ministry of Justice are considering timing for Phase 2 roll-out. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 Issue: Drafting error Submission (EY) The cross-reference to the Overseas Investment Act in clause 9(3)(b) refers to sections 7(2)(b) – (e) of that Act. It should refer to sections 7(2)(b) – (f). Comment Officials agree that the cross-reference contains an error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 46 47 Other policy matters 48 49 Issue: Bright-line test Submission (John Williams, New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation Inc.,) Two submissions were made on the proposed “bright-line test” that is presently being consulted on through an officials’ issues paper. Comment The submissions refer to matters that are not contained in the Bill and are therefore outside the scope for consideration. However, the submissions should be referred to the appropriate officials to be considered as part of the consultation process for the bright-line test proposal. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but that they be referred to the appropriate officials. 50 51 Matters raised by officials 52 53 Issue: Identifying if the property is residential Submission (Matter raised by officials) The land transfer system does not differentiate between land on the basis of use, e.g. as a home. This makes the information less useful than it could be for housing policy. Officials submit that clause 4 be amended so that if the land is to be used as a residence or home this information is provided in the tax statement. Comment The information collected through this tax statement could be useful for understanding the housing market. For this information to be useful in this context the statement needs to identify if the transaction relates to a home. This could be achieved by the statement identifying that the transaction relates to the transfer of a home. It will also require changes to who can use the information and to what information will be published by Land Information New Zealand. Recommendation Amend clause 4 to amend section 156C (1) that the information should include if the transfer relates to land that will be or has been used as a home. Amend section 156F to allow this and the other tax information collected under the Bill information to be used by relevant department/s and their authorised person for Housing Policy purposes. Amend section 156F of the Bill to allow Land Information New Zealand to publish aggregate data on the transfers of land used or to be used as homes. Issue: Main homes - multiple dwellings Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current draft for the main home exemption does not address situations where land has multiple dwellings. Comment Where a piece of land has more than one dwelling on it, the majority of the land should be used as the main home to get the main home exemption. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 54 Issue: Issuing an IRD number Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bank account requirement should be limited to instances when a person has applied for an IRD number. Comment Sometimes, for administrative convenience, Inland Revenue will proactively issue a person with an IRD number – essentially as a file number so that transactions involving that person can be recorded in Inland Revenue’s systems. The person may not have requested this number, or even be aware of its existence. An example might be a parent with child support obligations that does not otherwise have an IRD number. In the event this person is an “offshore person”, the legislation, as currently drafted, would prevent this practice form occurring because the Commissioner will not have a bank account for the person. This would have unintended adverse effects on the administration of the tax system. Therefore, officials consider that the bank account requirement should only apply in cases when a person has applied for an IRD number, as opposed to situations where one has been assigned to them for administrative reasons. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of tax file number should be included in Tax Administration Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of tax file number should be included in the Tax Administration Act 1994 rather than in the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment The definition of tax file number (IRD number) is currently included in the Income Tax Act 2007. There is a potential argument that the tax file number can be issued or used only for income tax purposes. 55 For clarity, the tax file number should be included in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (which applies for the purposes of all taxes, not just income tax) instead. This would make it clear that, for example, a person who has a GST number (and has no income tax liabilities) can use that GST number as a tax file number. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 56 57 Matters raised by the Committee 58 59 Issue: Application to trusts Matter raised The Committee has asked for guidance on how the proposed rules will apply to complex trust situations, including when the main home exception might apply to a person who is a beneficiary or settlor of multiple trusts. Comment For the purposes of the current bill, it is important to note that there will be no instances when the main home exception can be claimed by a trust. This means that all trusts will need to provide their IRD numbers, even when the property is the family home of a beneficiary or settlor of the trust. However, it is equally important to note that it is currently anticipated that many trusts will be able to claim the main home exemption from the proposed bright-line test. Officials working on the proposed bright-line legislation are aware of the Committee’s questions and general interest in these matters. To the extent possible, the bright-line legislation will take into account the scenarios raised by the Committee. Officials will brief the Committee more fully on the application of the bright-line test to trusts as part of the departmental briefing of the Committee on introduction of the Bill. Issue: Statement of intended use for a property Matter raised The Committee has suggested that a person should be asked to state what the intended use of their property is (for example, whether the property is a rental property or bach). Comment Officials note that they propose adding a question to the tax statement regarding whether the property has been or will be used as a home. This will partially address the Committee’s suggestion. 60 Issue: Legislative time limit on issuing IRD numbers Matter raised The Committee has asked whether Inland Revenue should be under a statutory timeframe for issuing IRD numbers. Comment Once a completed application is received, the current timeframe for IRD number processing is 8–10 working days. Submissions on this bill suggest that the existing processing time is adequate in terms of getting an IRD number in time for settlement of property transactions. Inland Revenue is, following enactment of this bill, anticipating an increase in IRD number applications. The Department has plans in place to increase its resources in this area to ensure that it continues to meet the current timeframes. Inland Revenue will redesign its IRD number application form to make the obligations of offshore persons clearer. We believe that this would be a significant response to meet the increase without the need for a statutory timeframe. In addition, statutory timeframes could introduce complications, for example, it may difficult to determine when an application is considered to be “complete”. There may also be factors outside of Inland Revenue’s control, such as postal delays. Work is currently being undertaken to investigate introducing electronic applications for an IRD number as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation work. It is anticipated that online applications will further reduce application processing times.

It will appear in the April 2015 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 27, Number 3). Notice pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand to Improve International Tax Compliance and Implement FATCA (the Agreement) New Zealand has, pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement, received notification from the United States Government that it has granted more favourable terms to a Partner Jurisdiction. Article 7 provides that more favourable terms apply automatically to the Agreement unless a decision is made to decline them. New Zealand has not declined the application of the terms. The following paragraphs are therefore to be treated as being included in Section VI of Annex I of the Agreement beginning on 3 July 2014. With reference to paragraph G, no written notice was provided to the United States before 3 July 2014. G. Alternative Procedures for New Accounts Opened Prior to Entry Into Force of this Agreement. 1. Applicability. If New Zealand has provided a written notice to the United States prior to entry into force of this Agreement that, as of July 1, 2014, New Zealand lacked the legal authority to require Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions either: (i) to require Account Holders of New Individual Accounts to provide the self-certification specified in section III of this Annex I, or (ii) to perform all the due diligence procedures related to New Entity Accounts specified in section V of this Annex I, then Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions may apply the alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section, as applicable, to such New Accounts, in lieu of the procedures otherwise required under this Annex I. The alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section shall be available only for those New Individual Accounts or New Entity Accounts, as applicable, opened prior to the earlier of: (i) the date New Zealand has the ability to compel Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to comply with the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, which date New Zealand shall inform the United States of in writing by the date of entry into force of this Agreement, or (ii) the date of entry into force of this Agreement. If the alternative procedures for New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, described in paragraph H of this section are applied with respect to all New Entity Accounts or a clearly identified group of such accounts, the alternative procedures described in this paragraph G may not be applied with respect to such New Entity Accounts. For all other New Accounts, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must apply the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, to determine if the account is a U.S. Reportable Account or an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution. 2. Alternative Procedures. a) Within one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to a New Individual Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section, request the self-certification specified in section III of this Annex I and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification consistent with the procedures described in section III of this Annex I, and (ii) with respect to a New Entity Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I and request information as necessary to document the account, including any self-certification, required by section V of this Annex I. b) New Zealand must report on any New Account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported with respect to such a New Account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the New Account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened. c) By the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must close any New Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section for which it was unable to collect the required self-certification or other documentation pursuant to the procedures described in subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section. In addition, by the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Individual Accounts (without regard to whether such accounts were High Value Accounts), perform the due diligence procedures specified in paragraph D of section II of this Annex I, or (ii) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Entity Accounts, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section IV of this Annex I. d) New Zealand must report on any closed account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(c) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported for such a closed account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened. H. Alternative Procedures for New Entity Accounts Opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015. For New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to treat such accounts as Preexisting Entity Accounts and apply the due diligence procedures related to Preexisting Entity Accounts specified in section IV of this Annex I in lieu of the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I. In this case, the due diligence procedures of section IV of this Annex I must be applied without regard to the account balance or value threshold specified in paragraph A of section IV of this Annex I.      PAGE \\\* MERGEFORMAT 1 <EVWXYtu���������  0 2 3 � /0��^�������һ����҈҈|�l�҈\\M�M�MhRt@hRt@CJOJQJaJhRt@hRt@5�CJOJQJaJhRt@hRt@6�CJOJQJaJh�\]'CJOJQJaJhRt@CJOJQJaJ#jh�R 0JCJOJQJUaJ hrz�h�('0JCJOJQJaJh�R jh�R Uh�('h�\]'CJOJQJaJh�('CJOJQJaJh�\]'h�('5�OJQJh�('h�('5�OJQJh�('5�OJQJWXY1 2 3 � � � � kl\_\`a����������@A���������������������������gdRt@gd�� &dP��gd�\]'^\_\`ae�����������Ʊ���mXC1"h��h��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJ(hRt@h��5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ(hRt@h�('5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ%hRt@h��5�6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��h��CJOJQJaJh�g�h��5�CJOJQJaJ"h�('5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ(h�g�h��5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJhRt@5�6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh�('hRt@CJOJQJaJh�('CJOJQJaJh�('h�('CJOJQJaJ��\] h � � ������Ze����������\[hiv���� ?A�� +�����������������������z�����k��������������hRt@6�CJOJQJ\]�aJhRt@h��5�CJOJQJaJ(hRt@h�('5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ%hRt@h��5�6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��hRt@CJOJQJaJh��h��CJOJQJaJh�('6�CJOJQJ\]�aJ"h��h��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJ\*A���!�"�"�"�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%&&&&�������������������������$a$gd�(' d��gd�('gd�('gd����� �!�!|"�"�"�"�"�"�" #�#�#$$�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%�%���������x�������plplplplhlhlhlhtKh�R jh�R U(h��h��5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ(h�g�h��5�6�CJOJQJ\\�\]�aJ%h�g�h��5�6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��CJOJQJaJh�('6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJ"h��h��6�CJOJQJ\]�aJh��h��CJOJQJaJ"�%�%&&&&&&&&&&&���̳ݯ�����h��h��CJOJQJaJhtKh�R 0jh�('h5~DCJOJQJUaJmHnHu!h=m�CJOJQJaJmHnHuh�('h5~DCJOJQJaJ%jh�('h5~DCJOJQJUaJ&&&&&����gd�('21�h:p�\]'��. ��A!��"��#�n$�n%�������j���������666666666vvvvvvvvv666666>666666666666666666666666666�6666666666�666666666666hH66666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666�62���� 0@P\`p������2(�� 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p������ 0@P\`p��8X�V~ OJPJQJ\_HmH nH sH tH J\`��JNormald��CJ\_HaJmH sH tH DA ���D Default Paragraph FontRi���R 0Table Normal�4� l4�a�(k ���( 0No List^�o���^��Default7$8$H$)B\*CJOJQJ\_HaJmH phsH tH R�@R $0Balloon Textd��CJOJQJ^JaJN�o��N$0Balloon Text CharCJOJQJ^JaJ6U\`��!6�('0 Hyperlink>\*B\*ph�>@2>�('0Headerd����B#.��A.�('0Header Char> @R>�('0Footerd����B#.��a.�('0Footer CharPK!����\[Content\_Types\].xml���N�0E�H���-J��@%�ǎǢ|�ș$�ز�U��L�TB� l,�3��;�r��Ø��J��B+$�G\]��7O٭V��$���������!)O�^�r�C$�y@�����/�yH\*��񄴽)�޵��߻��UDb�\`}"�qۋ�Jח���X^�)I\`n�E���p)���li�V\[\]�1M<������O�P��6r�=���z�gb�Ig��u��S�eb���O������R�D۫����qu �g��Z����o~ٺlAp�lx�pT0���+\[}\`j�����zA��V�2�F���i�@�q�v�֬5\\|��ʜ̭N��le�X�ds���jcs����7����f���� ��W���+�Ն�7����\`���g�Ș��J���j|��h(�K��D-���� dX��iJ�؇(��x$(��:��;�˹!�I\_�T��S1�������?E��?������?ZBΪm���U/������?�~����xY����'���y5�g&΋/����ɋ�>���G�M�Ge���D�����3Vq%'#q�����$�8��K�����)f�w9:ĵ�� x}r�x����w���r�:\\TZaG�\*�y8I�j�bR��c|XŻ�ǿ�I u3KG�nD1�NIB�s��� ��R��u���K>V�.EL+M2�#'�f��i~�V��vl�{u8��z��H� �\*���:�(W�☕ ~��J��T�e\\O\*�tHG��HY��}KN��P�\*ݾ˦���TѼ�9/#��A7�qZ��$\*c?���qU��n��w�N��%��O��i�4=3��N���)cbJ u�V�4����(Tn��� 7��\_?���m-ٛ�{U����B�w��z���n���ʜ"Z��x��J�Z��p;�������{/�<�P;��,)''K�Q�k5���q���pN��8�K�Gb�e��� �S��d�̛�\\17 �p�a�>��SR!��� 3��K4'+�r�zQ TT��I����Ivt\]K�c⫲�K#�v�5+�|��D������~��O@%\\w���\_�nN\[�L��9K����q��g�V�h��n R!�y+��U�n�;�\*&�/H�r��T�� �>��>\\ �t��=.Tġ ���S; Z�~�!������P��9gi���C�ڧ!�# B��,��;�X=ۻ,I�2UW�V�9$l�k���=A��j���;�{�A�P79�|s\*Y�����;�̠�\[�MC�ۿ�hf��\]o��{oY=1k�yV��V����5E8�Vk+֜���\\8���0X4D)�!!��?\*|f�v� u����"�x��A�@T\_������q��6�4)kڬu�V�7��t�'��%;���i�9s�9�x���,��ڎ-45x�d���8?�ǘ�d�/Y|t��&LIL�J\`�& �-G�t�/��PK!
