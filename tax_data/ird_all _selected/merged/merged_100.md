I n Confidence 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 19 November 2020 M inister of Finance Minister for Social Development and Employment Minister of Revenue Adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) for the 2021 and 2022 income years Executive summary 1.Recent and proposed changes to main benefit settings have implications for the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). On 30 November 2020, the Minister for Socia l D evelopment and Employment intends to seek decisions from Cabinet on increasing the benefit abatement thresholds. This will have an impact on the MFTC threshold for the 2022 income year. 2.In March 2020, the Government increased main benefit rates by $25 per week and temporarily doubled the Winter Energy Payment. This will have an impact on the MFTC threshold for the 2021 income year. 3.Ministers have decisions on whether to increase the MFTC threshold for the 2022 income year (the prospective change) and the 2021 income year (the retrospective change). 4.The purpose of the MFTC is to ensure that families in work are financially better off than they would be on a benefit. While it is available to low-income couples with dependent children, the primary focus of the credit is to improve the financia l i ncentive for sole parents to be off benefit. 5.The current annual income threshold is $27,768 after tax ($534 per week). A round 3,800 families received this credit in income year 2020, totalling $12 million. The average payment amount is $3,100 per family. Around 90% of MFTC customers are sole parent families. 6.The MFTC threshold has been adjusted each year since 2006 to reflect changes to main benefit settings. 2022 MFTC threshold (the prospective change) 7.The proposed benefit abatement threshold changes have a total cost of $290.568 million over the forecast period. The increase to benefit abatement thresholds will have a large consequential impact on the MFTC threshold from 1 April 2021. 8.There are two potential options for increasing the MFTC threshold. A full alignment to include the benefit abatement thresholds would maintain the original policy intent of providing low-income families a financial incentive to work and move off benefit. This alignment will increase the MFTC threshold to $32,604 after tax, at a cost of $77.7 million over the forecast period. Inland Revenue recommends the full alignment option. 9.An alternative option is to increase the MFTC threshold to a rate where sole parents remain incentivised to move and remain off benefit. This threshold broadly adjust s f or the $25 per week benefit rate increases from March 2020 and for the annual general adjustment for benefit settings for the 2022 year. This would not align the MFTC threshold to the benefit abatement threshold increases (should they be agreed), and so would not fully meet the policy intent of the MFTC. However, this In Confidence 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] would have a lower fiscal cost, and sole parents would have a financial incentive to remain off benefit and in work. This change would increase the MFTC threshold to $30,576 at a total cost of $38.25 million over the forecast period. MSD recommends the partial alignment option. 10. A third option is to not make a change to the MFTC threshold. This would not meet the intent of the MFTC, and over 3,000 families, most of whom are sole parents, will be financially incentivised to remain on a benefit when in work. The total net fiscal impact arising from an increased uptake of main benefits and the Winter Energy Payment is likely to be small. Treasury recommends the no adjustment option due to the tight fiscal environment (f urther Treasury comment below). 11. 2021 MFTC threshold (the retrospective change) 12. As part of its response to COVID-19 in March 2020, the previous Government agreed to increase the main benefit payments by $25 per week and temporarily doubled the Winter Energy Payment from 1 April 2020. Due to the urgent pace at which the benefit payments were changed, the decision to change the MFTC threshold was not considered. 13. Ministers now have an option to retrospectively adjust the MFTC threshold. One option is to adjust it for the $25 per week benefit increase, which would result in all MFTC customers gaining by $32 each week they received the MFTC (an average gain of $1,280 per family) in the 2021 income year. This would have a fiscal cost of $4.7 million. 14. If Ministers wish to adjust the MFTC threshold for the 2021 income year, Inland Revenue could begin paying customers the higher MFTC payment from late December 2020. This would provide a financial incentive to work for the remainder of the 2021 income year. 15. A second option is to not adjust the MFTC threshold retrospectively, as a retrospective adjustment could not act as a work incentive for those who had already made the decision to work. However, the threshold would not be aligned for the remainder of the 2021 income year. Legislative amendment and next steps 16. If Ministers wish to make a change to the MFTC for the 2020-21 income year (the retrospective change), this must be made via an amendment to primary legislation. An omnibus tax bill is scheduled to be introduced and passed through all stages under urgency on 1 December 2020. 17. If Ministers wish to make a prospective change to the MFTC threshold, this could also be included as a legislative amendment in the December 2020 tax bill, or alternatively, an Order in Council could set the MFTC threshold if passed by 1 December 2020. 18. To include these legislative amendments, decisions are needed by Cabinet on 30 November. If Ministers agree, a Cabinet paper needs to be lodged by 26 November with a Regulatory Impact Assessment. Officials will separately provide a draft joint Cabinet paper (including the increases to benefit abatement thresholds) for Ministers to consider. 19. Officials will provide advice to joint Ministers on a potential scope for a work programme to review the Working for Families tax credits in December 2020. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Treasury comment 20.The Treasury does not consider that this policy decision meets the threshold to be progressed as a Budget pre-commitment. While Treasury acknowledges that it is likely to introduce greater complexity for clients, Treasury does not agree that these adverse effects are sufficient to justify funding this initiative ahead of the Budget process given the tight fiscal environment.

Recent and proposed changes to main benefit settings have implications for the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). Officials seek decisions from Ministers regarding the MFTC threshold for the 2022 income year (the prospective change) and the 2021 income year (the retrospective change). This report outlines the range of options available to Ministers and the associated trade-offs. 2. If Ministers decide to progress any changes, decisions are needed by Cabinet by 30 November for amendments to be included in an omnibus tax bill scheduled to be introduced on 1 December 2020. Advice is provided on the legislative options available. 3. MFTC background 4. The MFTC is one of the Working for Families (WFF) tax credits and is available to low-income families with children. The purpose of the MFTC is to ensure that families in work are financially better off than they would be on a benefit. The effect is that there is a minimum income for families who meet the eligibility criteria. 5. The MFTC i s intended to support the “making work pay” objective of the WFF package. While it is available to low-income couples with dependent children, the primary focus of the credit was “to improve the financial incentive for sole parents to be in paid work". 1 6. The current annual income threshold is $27,768 after tax ($534 per week). Inland Revenue administrative data indicate that around 3,800 families received this credit in tax year 2020; however, we forecast that there will be a decrease to 3,200 families in tax year 2021. 2 Inland Revenue paid nearly $12 million to these families in tax year 2020, with an average payment amount of $3,100 per family. Around 90% of MFTC customers are sole parent families. 7. As part of the introduction of Working for Families from 1 April 2006, Cabinet agreed to adjust the MFTC threshold annually to ensure families did not suffer a reduction in income when moving off benefit into full-time employment ( defined as 30 hours a week for couples and 20 hours a week for sole parents). Since then, the MFTC threshold has been adjusted each year by Order in Council to reflect changes to benefit settings. 8. The MFTC threshold is calculated by determining the maximum income level a family could receive if they are working but continue to receive an abated benefit. The calculation uses the couple-rate of main benefit Jobseeker Support, which is higher than the sole parent main benefit rate. This ensures that couples with children are financially better off than on benefit. It also means that sole parents are entitled to a slightly greater amount of MFTC than if we use a sole parent rate of main benefit. Because of the tie with main benefit settings, the MFTC threshold is sensitive to changes in main benefits. It is also dependent on other factors, such as the minimum wage rate, personal taxes and tax credits. 1 Changing Families’ Financial Support and Incentives for Working, IR and MSD, July 2010 citing Cabinet Policy Committee (2004) 2 Some reasons for the decrease in tax year 2021 could be due to the impacts of Covid-19 on employment, or the increase in main benefit payments and temporary doubling of the Winter Energy Payment from 1 April 2020. The latter changes have made the financial incentives to stay on benefit higher. s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Known issues with the MFTC 9. The MFTC works by providing a payment so that a family’s income reaches exactly the legislated threshold. For example, if a sole parent earns $25,000 of net income 3 , then they would receive a payment of $2,768 (on an annual basis). If the sole parent works more and earns $1 more, then their payment is reduced by $1. This is known as a 100% effective marginal tax rate (EMTR). 10. High EMTRs indicate lower financial incentives to work. Because the MFTC has a 100% EMTR, there is no financial incentive to work more hours while receiving the MFTC. However, because the MFTC threshold itself is set to be above the benefit income at 20 hours (for a sole parent), there remains a financial incentive to go off benefit at this point. 11. This means that the MFTC provides a strong financial incentive for sole parents on low/minimum wage to work the minimum required hours (20 hours a week). For example, a sole parent with two children (aged three and five years) 4 would gain around $62 a week moving from working 5 on a benefit to working and receiving the MFTC. 12. However, there is little to no financial incentive to work more than 20 hours a week on a low/minimum wage. For example, a sole parent with two children (aged three and five years) 6 would gain around $96 a week moving from 20 hours of work to 40 hours of work a week on the minimum wage, once their housing costs are taken into account. If they are paying for formal childcare, they would be worse off by $152 a week. (However, the incentive would still remain for these families to increase their work hours to at least 20 hours of work per week.) 13. While families are receiving the MFTC they will also not benefit from hourly wage increases (unless their income increases enough so that they are no longer eligible for MFTC). While part-time work may be desirable for many sole parents given their caregiving responsibilities, disincentivising working 40 hours per week for those earning low/minimum wage may impact on sole parents’ longer-term labour market trajectories and lifetime earnings. 14. We note that families and individuals make their decisions on whether to work, or to work more or less, for multiple reasons. Financial incentives are just one of the reasons for labour supply decisions. Decision for the 2022 MFTC threshold (the prospective change) 15. In its manifesto, the New Zealand Labour Party proposed an increase to main benefit abatement thresholds to $160 per week for main benefit payments, and $250 per week for the second abatement threshold for the Sole Parent Support and Supported Living Payment. MSD officials have provided advice on the impacts of these changes for beneficiary and non-beneficiary recipients \[refer to Implementing the manifesto commitment to increase abatement thresholds REP/20/11/1045\]. 16. The total cost of the abatement increases is expected to be $290.568 million over the forecast period (excluding any changes to MFTC). The Minister for Social Development and Employment intends to seek Cabinet agreement on this proposal at the 30 November 2020 meeting. 17. These benefit abatement changes increase the amount someone could receive if they are working while receiving a main benefit. These changes would also have 3 For simplicity, we assume that the net income in this example is family scheme income, which is the legislated income definition used for Working for Families entitlement. 4 With other assumptions, such as housing costs and childcare costs. 5 Working 19 hours a week on benefit, 20 hours a week on the MFTC, while on minimum wage. 6 With other assumptions, such as housing costs and childcare costs. In Confidence 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] flow-on implications for the MFTC. Ministers have options which primarily involve trade-offs on financial work incentives, fiscal costs, and impacts on future reforms. The advantages and disadvantages of each option are outlined in the table below. In Confidence 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 Note that this increase is more than was paid out in MFTC in tax year 2020. Option Impact Advantages Disadvantages Option 1: Increase the MFTC threshold to fully reflect benefit abatement changes. The MFTC threshold would increase to $32,604 p.a. (or $627 per week), which would have an ongoing fiscal cost of $18.3 million per annum. 7 This full alignment is a 17% increase ($4,836 p.a. or $93 per week) from the current threshold, a large increase relative to previous annual adjustments 8 . The MFTC threshold remains aligned with its policy intent. The expected 3,200 families on MFTC would gain, and an additional 1,700 families would be eligible. The average increase is $4,700 per family. The range over which the MFTC is available is extended, resulting in a larger range of hours worked with a 100% EMTR, further reducing incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low/minimum wage. The 1,700 newly eligible families would also experience a 100% effective marginal tax rate meaning there is less incentive to increase hours of work. However, these may not have a significant impact on labour supply decisions in aggregate given that much of this group already face an 100% EMTR. Increasing the MFTC this significantly may also make future structural reform of WFF more difficult particularly if there is a desire to avoid people being financially disadvantaged. 9 Option 2: Adjust the MFTC threshold to account for the recent increase to main benefits and the Annual General Adjustment but not the proposed abatement changes. The MFTC threshold would increase to $30,576 p.a. (or $588 per week), which would have an ongoing fiscal cost of $9.0 million per annum. This increase is $2,808 p.a. ($54 per week) from the current threshold. Is fiscally less costly than a full alignment. Sole parents would remain financially better off working and receiving MFTC than receiving a benefit. Increasing the MFTC threshold by a lesser amount now may make any future structural reforms of WFF slightly less costly. The expected 3,200 families on MFTC would gain, and an additional 770 families would be eligible. The MFTC threshold is not fully aligned with its policy intent. This means that couples would be theoretically better off working and receiving a main benefit, however, few couples are likely to qualify for a benefit if one person is working 30 hours a week. 10 MFTC recipients gain by less than a full adjustment of the MFTC. The range over which the MFTC is available is extended, resulting in a larger range of hours worked with a 100% EMTR, reducing incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low/minimum wage (but not as much as a full adjustment). However, these may not have a significant impact on labour supply decisions in aggregate given that much of this group already face an 100% EMTR. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8 This is roughly equivalent to the cumulative increases to the MFTC over the past five years. 9 This is because any structural changes would need to ensure that families with children would have at least the same net income at 20 hours of work as under current settings. 10 This is due to the ’30-hour rule’ where a person (or couple) are not eligible for Jobseeker Support if they are working fulltime (defined as 30 hours a week). Option Impact Advantages Disadvantages Option 3: Do not adjust the MFTC threshold. The MFTC threshold would remain at $27,768 p.a. (or $534 per week). This could have a net fiscal cost arising from the increase to benefit expenditure as families move on to benefit. We are currently calculating what the cost is and will provide that to Ministers. We estimate this is likely to be small. Not increasing the MFTC threshold now may make any future structural reforms of WFF slightly less costly. This option also has the lowest fiscal cost, which would allow funding to be directed to other priorities. The MFTC threshold is no longer aligned with its policy intent and therefore some MFTC families may be financially better off receiving a benefit depending on the number of hours they work. As a result, there may be an increase in the number of families receiving a benefit and a consequential fiscal impact, but this cost would be partially offset by the reduction of MFTC (as families would no longer receive the MFTC). This change would also result in confusion of when a person was better off on benefit or working and receiving MFTC. This would be very challenging for customers to understand and for staff to communicate. s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Discussion 18. On balance, Inland Revenue officials recommend that the MFTC threshold increase to maintain alignment with the benefit abatement thresholds as this is consistent with the policy intent when the MFTC was established – that is, to provide a financial incentive to work and move off benefit and on to the MFTC. 19. Arguably, there is also an equity issue in that not fully aligning the MFTC threshold financially disadvantages those families who remain off benefit (relative to those who are on benefit). If benefit settings are intended to reflect a minimum level of income for beneficiaries, then implicitly, the guaranteed minimum income provided to working and off-benefit families (via the MFTC) should be at least the same. 20. There are also flow-on benefits to children in these low-income families whose parents are working and off benefit. 21. However, officials note that there are also trade-offs with fully aligning the MFTC threshold, including exacerbating existing issues with EMTRs and 22. For this reason, MSD officials recommend an alternative option to partially align the MFTC threshold to the new benefit settings to ensure that sole parents are financially better off working and receiving the MFTC, versus remaining on benefit. As it is a smaller increase, it has a lower fiscal cost and a lesser impact on the upcoming WFF review (discussed below) in comparison to a full alignment. 23. In the partial alignment option, for example, a sole parent with two children (aged three and five years) 11 would be $87 a week better working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. 24. The MFTC threshold would not be fully aligned with its policy intent. This means that couples would be theoretically better off working and receiving a main benefit, however, few couples are likely to qualify for a benefit if one person is working 30 hours a week. 12 Couples will still gain from this option. 25. The Treasury does not consider that this policy decision meets the threshold to be progressed as a Budget pre-commitment. While Treasury acknowledges that it is likely to introduce greater complexity for clients, Treasury does not agree that these adverse effects are sufficient to justify funding this initiative ahead of the Budget process given the tight fiscal environment. Trade-offs with not increasing the MFTC threshold 26. If the MFTC threshold is not increased at all, then the purpose of the MFTC becomes moot for some customers. The income that a family would receive off benefit may be less than they could receive if they remain on benefit while working. As an example, a sole parent with two children 13 working 20 hours at $20 per hour would be better off receiving the MFTC from 20 hours to 25 hours of work but could then receive more on a benefit above 25 hours of work. This inconsistency would also make customer experience much more difficult if they need to switch between 11 With other assumptions, such as housing costs and childcare costs. 12 This is due to the ’30-hour rule’ where a person (or couple) are not eligible for Jobseeker Support if they are working fulltime (defined as 30 hours a week). 13 The sole parent example assumes they have two children ages three and five, living in Auckland and receiving Accommodation Supplement Area 1 payments. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] benefit and MFTC when they have a change in hours. It would also be challenging for customers to understand and for staff to communicate. 27. MFTC customer experience 28.MFTC customers are a particularly vulnerable group of customers for Inland Revenue. The majority of customers receive MFTC on a weekly or fortnightly basis throughout the year. In earlier qualitative research, some customers have told Inland Revenue that the payment is a significant source of support as they move off benefit. Based on Inland Revenue’s experiences, customers are likely to compare the income they would receive while on benefit, versus the income they receive off benefit. 29.If the MFTC threshold is not fully aligned, then customers may stay on benefit while working rather than exiting the benefit system. They may also have to switch between MFTC and benefit which would be challenging for customers to understand and for staff to communicate. Review of Working for Families 30. 31. 32. Decision for the 2021 MFTC threshold (the retrospective change) 33.As part of its response to COVID-19 in March 2020, the previous Government agreed to increase main benefit rates by $25 per week on 1 April 2020 and temporarily doubled the Winter Energy Payment for 2020. This would normally have a flow-on impact to the MFTC threshold. Due to the urgent pace at which the benefit payments were changed, the decision to change the MFTC threshold was not considered. 34.Ministers now have an option to retrospectively adjust the MFTC threshold. The choices are 14 : 34.1 Retrospectively adjust for the $25 main benefit increase: The adjusted threshold would be $29,432, effective from 1 April 2020. Under this option all MFTC recipients in the 2020-21 income year would gain by 14 There is also an option to increase the rate to account for the temporary doubling of WEP, but on balance, officials do not recommend aligning the threshold with this rate given it is temporary. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] $32 for each week they received the MFTC, an average gain of $1,280 per family. Additionally, we expect approximately 400 families would become newly eligible for the MFTC. 34.2 Do not retrospectively adjust the MFTC threshold: The threshold would remain at the current legislated rate of $27,768. However, any prospective full alignment to MFTC will need to take into account the permanent changes to benefit settings from this income year. 35. If Ministers decide to adjust the MFTC threshold for the 2020-2021 income year, Inland Revenue could begin paying customers the higher MFTC payment from late December 2020. This would ensure there is a financial incentive to move off benefit for the remainder of the 2021 income year. 36. For the April-November 2020 months, MFTC recipients would receive this retrospective increase as a lump sum when completing their square-up at the end of the tax-year. It is worth noting that this retrospective payment cannot retrospectively provide an incentive to work more and move off benefit. However, as noted earlier, it would provide additional income support for this group 15 . 37. While retrospective changes are not ideal, there may be a case for doing so in this instance because the decision was not included as part of the normal decision- making process for the benefit rate increases due to the urgency around COVID- 19. Financial implications 38. Under normal circumstances, when a policy change impacts the MFTC, the fiscal costs for MFTC are funded as part of that policy change. Additional funding was not provided when main benefits and the Winter Energy Payment were increased in April 2020 due to the urgency with which the changes were progressed. A retrospective adjustment to the MFTC threshold will therefore also incur a fiscal cost. 39. If Ministers agree to increase the MFTC threshold to fully reflect benefit abatement changes, 39.1 this has a fiscal cost of $77.7 million over the forecast period ($18.3 million p.a.). Of this, $4.6 million p.a. is associated with the main benefit increase agreed in March 2020, while $13.7 million p.a. is associated with the abatement changes. 39.2 If Ministers also agree to retrospectively adjust for the $25 main benefit increase for 2020-21 this will increase the overall fiscal cost by $4.6 million to $82.3 million over the forecast period. 40. If Ministers agree to increase the MFTC threshold to reflect increases to main benefits but not abatement changes, 40.1 this has a fiscal cost of $38.25 million over the forecast period ($9 million p.a.). 40.2 If Ministers also agree to retrospectively adjust for the $25 main benefit increase for 2020-21 this will increase the overall fiscal cost by $4.6 million to $42.85 million over the forecast period. 15 MFTC is chargeable income for some types of financial assistance paid under the Social Security Act 2018, e.g. Temporary Additional Support. A retrospective increase in MFTC may lead to debts being created for some people. It is also assessable income for Public Housing purposes, for assessing eligibility and calculating the rate of Income Related Rent. In Confidence 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 41. If a decision to increase the MFTC threshold is progressed, funding would need to be sought via a Budget 2021 pre-commitment. Legislation 42. If Ministers wish to make a change to the MFTC for the 2020-21 income year (the retrospective change), this must be made via an amendment to primary legislation. An omnibus tax bill is scheduled to be introduced and passed through all stages under urgency on 1 December 2020. Decisions will need to be taken by Cabinet by 30 November to include these amendments in this bill. 43. If Ministers wish to make a prospective change to the MFTC threshold, this could also be included as a legislative amendment in the December 2020 tax bill. We recommend both changes are included in the December 2020 tax bill if both changes are agreed. 44. Alternatively, if Ministers agree to just a prospective change, an Order in Council could set the MFTC threshold if passed by 1 December. Cabinet decisions are required by 30 November for this option as well. Next steps 49. A draft Cabinet paper has been provided for Ministers to consider. This paper discusses the proposal to increase benefit abatement thresholds with a placeholder for the consequential impacts to the MFTC threshold. 50. At Ministers’ direction, a Cabinet paper with the Regulatory Impact Assessment will be lodged by 26 November to be discussed at the 30 November 2020 Cabinet meeting. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IN-CONFIDENCE POLICY AND STRATEGY Treasury:4382172v1 IN-CONFIDENCE Joint Report: Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Date: Friday 27 November 2020 Report No: T2020/3583 IR2020/488 File Number: SH-1-6-1-3-3 Action Sought Action Sought Deadline Minister of Finance (Hon Grant Robertson) Respond to the recommendations in this report.

IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 2 IN-CONFIDENCE Joint Report: Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Executive Summary Cabinet will consider the framework for economic responses to any further community resurgence COVID-19 by the end of this year. As part of this, the Minister of Finance has requested further information to support the design of a new grant scheme to operate alongside the wage subsidy, addressing firms most affected by transition costs and public health restrictions at Alert Level 2 and above. The new grant can be used for any purpose. We are referring to the scheme as a Business Support Grant (BSG), however alternative names such as the Resurgence Support Grant may be more appropriate. The objective of the BSG is to target firms that experience a disruption in revenue as a result of public health restrictions. These firms, like hospitality and events businesses that rely on people gathering, need to adjust their operations to public health restrictions, have unavoidable fixed costs, and disrupted revenue. The proposal in this paper targets those businesses that will be impacted, albeit less generously to reflect the smaller economic impacts of Alert Level 2. The outstanding design choices in the table below reflect feedback from the Minister of Finance, and further decisions sought through this report. Options Recommended Design Considerations Agreed by Minister of Finance Payment frequency: a one-off payment to assist firms with transition and fixed costs, or multiple payments One-off payment on escalation from AL1 - Firm size limits: options to limit payments to larger firms Available to all firms but payment capped at 50 FTE rate - Regional targeting: regional targeting challenging given boundary issues, but may be beneficial for very localised outbreaks Option available depending on outbreak - Design decision required Trigger: Need to balance the need for support with fiscal costs during short resurgence events. Minimum period of 7 days at AL2 or above as the trigger for activating the scheme Judgement about the materiality of costs incurred for shorter escalations. Eligibility: Whether test should be prospective or retrospective A retrospective model, firms declare required drop in revenue over the preceding two weeks based on actuals Tightens verification and integrity IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 3 IN-CONFIDENCE Options Recommended Design Considerations Eligibility: revenue drop test would target affected firms and sectors. 30% revenue drop test Choices to further manage costs and integrity risks. Higher 40% or lower 20% revenue drop test Payment structure: choices around the level and form (whether to base on FTE or include a per-firm component) Per-firm ($1,500) and per-FTE component ($400) Options include a higher base rate. This would favour smaller firms and sole traders Declaration: Such a requirement will assist the link with firm level impacts and shape firm behaviour Firms are required to declare their drop in revenue is a result of specific COVID-19 measures and circumstances, and require firms to hold records proving the link. Needs to align with the wage subsidy approach Sectoral targeting: explicit targeting by sectors very challenging and creates boundary issues No explicit sector targeting, as revenue drop will implicitly target affected sectors. Integrity measures above will strengthen this link. Further work required to operationalise a targeting regime. Organisation eligibility: option to design bespoke settings or build of existing wage subsidy settings. Aligned with wage subsidy scheme Includes charities, not-for-profits, pre-revenue firms. IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 4 IN-CONFIDENCE Communications Early announcements of the establishment of the BSG, as part of broader public communications on the suite of economic support measures in resurgence events, will provide business certainty and support firms to build resilience between resurgences. We recommend that the BSG be announced early, setting out the broad parameters of the scheme. This would include confirmation of the revenue drop test, the ability for firms to use the funds for any purpose, the triggers for activating the scheme, the role of Inland Revenue, the retrospective test approach and the need for firms to demonstrate an impact on revenue from COVID-19. It will also be important to position the BSG as part of a suite of support measures, to manage the expectations of firms. For example, the BSG is not designed to cover all revenue impacts. It is designed to provide one-off support at the outset of a resurgence, supporting firms as they adjust their operations to meet public health restrictions. In this sense, it recognises the public good that businesses provide through taking disease prevention steps to continue operating. Where further support is needed, firms can access the SBCS, Business Finance Guarantee Scheme (BFGS), lending from their bank, and in higher ALs the wage subsidy. The BSG will be the main “new” product of the economic support package. It will be necessary to set out the rationale for why the BSG is being established now and not earlier. The core argument is that we are better at responding to resurgences and have developed our thinking. This includes supporting greater economic activity under longer periods of lower ALs. We recognise that there is an impact on businesses at this level and if the wage subsidy is not available, then an additional and smaller grant will assist businesses to adjust. We will provide key messages next week after you have decided the design parameters. Recommended Action We recommend that you: a note that Treasury has provided a draft Economic response to future resurgences of COVID-19 Cabinet paper to the Minister of Finance, which will cover the Business Support Grant Scheme subject to decisions taken through this report. b agree that a minimum period of 7 days at Alert Level 2 or above will be required to activate the scheme. Agree/disagree Agree/disagree Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue c agree that firms must demonstrate a revenue drop of more than 30% over any 14 day period after an escalation from Alert Level 1 to be eligible. Agree/disagree Agree/disagree Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue d agree that firms must demonstrate a drop in revenue over that 14 day period through declaring an actual 30% drop in revenue against that period, and that firms will be required to hold information to verify this if required by Inland Revenue. Agree/disagree Agree/disagree Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 5 IN-CONFIDENCE e agree that the payment will be calculated based on a $1,500 per-firm payment and a $400 per-FTE payment, capped at 50 FTEs. Agree/disagree Agree/disagree Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue f agree that firms be required to declare their drop in revenue as a result of a COVID-19 Alert Level escalation, and that firms will be required to hold information to verify this if required by Inland Revenue. Agree/disagree Agree/disagree Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue g agree that organisational eligibility criteria will be aligned to the Wage Subsidy Scheme. Agree/disagree Agree/disagree Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue h note that an additional grant within an escalation period would complicate the one-off nature of the scheme, add fiscal cost per escalation, but may be desirable under a protracted period above Alert Level 1. i note that, if you support subsequent grants as a design feature, officials will provide advice following Cabinet decisions on a framework for subsequent grants. j indicate whether the scheme should be enabling of subsequent grants through an additional round of applications within one protracted period above Alert Level 1. Yes/no Yes/no Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue k agree that amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 be done by way of a standalone Bill passed under urgency when the House resumes in February 2021. Agree/disagree Agree/disagree Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue l note that the BSG scheme is expected to cost $350 million in operating funding per escalation above Alert Level 1, based on a 30% revenue drop test and an estimated 150,000 firms qualifying for the Business Support Grant. m note that Inland Revenue will require an estimated $9 million in new operating funding to build and deliver the Business Support Grant in 2021/22 to 2024/25. n note that this funding assumes the scheme will be in place for two years, with two further years for integrity and compliance work after the scheme has ended. o note that Treasury recommends the scheme’s administrative funding be drawn from the CRRF with funding sought through the Cabinet paper. p note that Inland Revenue will redeploy administrative capability to work on the Business Support Grant as required and, to provide administrative flexibility, the Cabinet paper will propose delegating to Joint Ministers the authority to redistribute this $9 million across years as necessary. q note that the Minister of Finance has agreed to officials holding targeted stakeholder engagement on key parameters of the Business Support Grant. IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 6 IN-CONFIDENCE r agree that the targeted stakeholder engagement will include: a. The trigger design, including the proposed 14 day delay before applications open; b. The mechanics of the 30% revenue drop test, specifically the requirement that firms declare an actual drop in revenue over the preceding 14 days (as opposed to forecast); c. The workability of the proposed requirements to include a more specific declaration that an applicant has been impacted by the COVID-19 public health restrictions; d. Per-firm ($1,500) and per-FTE component ($400) payment rates; and e. Alignment and interaction with the other support schemes (including the wage subsidy).

This report seeks detailed decisions from the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue on the key parameters of a new Business Support Grant (BSG). This includes the level of the revenue drop a firm must experience to become eligible, the rate on which payments will be calculated, and the triggers to activate the scheme. It also provides detailed recommendations to assist Inland Revenue with implementing the scheme, including the drafting of legislation to be passed in February 2021. Background 2. The Government’s public health strategy and Alert Level (AL) framework is complemented by an economic strategy that minimises the economic cost of public health restrictions and allows New Zealand to take advantage of the opportunities of a protracted period of minimal community transmission. 3. Public health restrictions deliver short and severe economic shocks based on the closeness of physical contact in any given business. This impact delivers a public good – disease prevention. This means there is an equity and distributional case for broad- based support for firms affected during public health restrictions. 4. A resilient strategy relies on the Government responding quickly through elevated public health restrictions. This has been delivered through a wage subsidy scheme available from AL3 that supports labour market retention and additional interventions, such as support for childcare, rents and tenancies. There is scope for a new grant scheme for costs not covered by the wage subsidy, or costs experienced at AL2. This would provide cash flow support to firms with adjustment costs at the beginning of an outbreak, and recognise that firms have unavoidable fixed costs that may not be met due to disrupted revenue. 5. Altogether, we recommend a one-off lump sum payment to aid companies to adjust to an escalation, recognising their contribution to public good through disease prevention. To target the most affected firms, we recommend firms be eligible when they have experienced a 30% drop in revenue two weeks after an escalation from AL1. The rationale for this is to ensure the scheme is well-targeted and maintains integrity. Firms would not be required to use the funding for specific purposes, supporting firms to build resilience between resurgences. 6. The payment will be calculated based on a per-firm payment and a per-FTE payment, weighting the contributions in favour of smaller firms with high fixed costs. These firms tend to be less resilient to changes in their operations. We recommend a payment structure of $1,500 per eligible firm, plus $400 per FTE (capped at 50 FTEs) as a proxy for firm size. Decisions sought 7. The key parameters for a new Business Support Grant relate to the level of revenue drop required for firms to be eligible, the triggers to activate the scheme in an escalation event, and the rate of payment to calculate the support granted to a firm. 8. In previous advice, the Minister of Finance agreed to a number of key parameters and sought further advice to inform decisions on others. The parameters that have been agreed are: IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 8 IN-CONFIDENCE a. The grant will be provided as a one-off payment when there is an escalation from AL1; b. Payment calculated on a per-firm and per-FTE component (like the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS)) c. Firms of all sizes will be eligible, but the per-FTE component will be capped at 50 FTEs; and d. The scheme will be available nationally, even during regional AL escalations, however regional targeting remains an option depending on the outbreak. 9. The Minister of Finance sought further information on the threshold for the revenue drop test, noting a concern that 20% may provide support too broadly, and the potential to strengthen the declaration process to more closely link a drop in revenue to impacts arising from public health restrictions. This report responds to that request, and recommends a higher threshold of 30%, a requirement for applicants to declare that their drop in revenue is a result of COVID-19 and a requirement for businesses to hold records proving the causal link between COVID-19 and the revenue drop. 10. In addition, we are seeking decisions on other details to assist in the design and implementation of the scheme, as well as agreement that the Cabinet paper will delegate detailed design decisions to joint Ministers (the Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue, and Minister for Economic Development). The additional decisions sought through this paper include the triggers for activating the scheme, the rates for the per- firm and per-FTE payments, eligible organisations and the potential for subsequent payments. The triggers to activate the scheme should be clear, to provide business certainty and support decisions that are durable to public health developments. 11. The Minister of Finance has agreed that the scheme be limited to a one-off payment at an initial escalation from AL1 to AL2 or above. This reflects the transitional costs to adjust operations for an escalation. 12. A minimum public health restriction period should be established as a trigger for opening applications. This will align with proposed settings for the wage subsidy scheme and ensure that payments made to cover a portion of firms’ weekly fixed costs are not provided in very short precautionary escalations (say 2-3 days). We recommend Cabinet agree in-principle to establishing a minimum period of 7 days at AL2 or above as the trigger for activating the scheme, to align with the wage subsidy. However the period a firm must demonstrate its drop in revenue should be across 14 days to provide sufficient information to demonstrate a revenue drop. We also recommend Cabinet delegate Joint Ministers to confirm the exact period following further advice and consultation with stakeholders. 13. We recommend that applications be time-limited for one month after the first day of de- escalation to AL1. This allows sufficient time for a firm to gather information on its revenue drop to submit an application. The revenue decline test can be prospective or retrospective, this choice involves trade-offs between speed of payment and integrity. 14. A prospective revenue decline test would mean firms are paid in anticipation of a revenue decline, while a retrospective test would mean firms are paid after experiencing a revenue decline. We recommend the test be applied based on actual revenue drop to improve integrity and align to proposed changes to the SBCS. IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 9 IN-CONFIDENCE 15. While applications based on forecast revenue drops have the advantage of providing firms with immediate cash-flow support, there is a greater reliance on the honesty of firms and a higher possibility of payments going to firms that do not need them. This reduces the scheme’s integrity and cost effectiveness. Experience with the wage subsidy shows that firms are often confused if they have received a grant based on a genuinely anticipated revenue fall which then does not eventuate. 16. Under a purely retrospective model, applications for the grant would open two weeks after the AL escalation. While this delays applications for two weeks, during which some otherwise viable firms may not survive, this could be mitigated by pre- announcing the policy to signal to firms to try to hold sufficient cash on hand for an initial two-week period at AL2. In addition, Inland Revenue is able to issue payments promptly after an application is received, and one instance of contact will be required between applicant and Inland Revenue. 17. MBIE data indicates approximately 70% of businesses have cash reserves that would allow them to operate for several weeks without support. Approximately 20% of businesses state that they have no reserves. A retrospective test would assist in targeting the payment to viable firms that have experienced a decline in revenue arising from COVID-19, reducing the need for more detailed declaration tests and increasing the integrity of the scheme, however some firms may not hold sufficient reserves to wait 14 days to apply. For this reason, we recommend the scheme be activated when there is an escalation of at least 7 days, with applications based on a 14 days to demonstrate revenue loss. Inland Revenue is generally able to process and make payments within 24 hours of an application. 18. Communicating the scheme in advance of its establishment will allow firms with low cash reserves or access to bridging finance to build resilience, knowing that the application process will require a two week period to demonstrate their revenue impact. The choice of revenue drop test threshold determines who receives the grant, and, on balance, we recommend a revenue drop level of 30%. 19. The Minister of Finance has indicated preference for a relatively strong revenue drop test serving as the targeting mechanism for this scheme. A revenue drop test is likely to identify the firms most in need of economic support due to public health restrictions. It will both target support at those sectors and regions that are, on aggregate, most affected by higher ALs, while also ensuring firms in any sector or region that is affected are eligible. For example, while food, accommodation, and recreation services were the largest recipients of the WSR in August, more than 70% of the scheme’s expenditure was on other sectors such as construction. 20. We previously recommended a revenue drop test of 20%. However, based on your feedback, we have presented two choices of revenue test – 30% or 40%. We consider any threshold higher than 30% to be inconsistent with the operational impacts felt by firms at AL2 (too few firms will receive support), and any lower would risk being insufficiently targeted (too many firms will receive support). On balance, we recommend 30%. 21. A revenue drop test of 40% would reduce the fiscal impact and/or allow a more generous grant. However, this threshold may not be appropriate to support firms particularly affected by periods at AL2. We estimate 110,000 to 120,000 firms would satisfy a 40% revenue drop during a modelled resurgence event requiring nationwide escalation to AL2. IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 10 IN-CONFIDENCE 22. Alternatively, a revenue drop test of 30% would capture more firms and may better reflect pressures experienced at AL2. We estimate 130,000 to 150,000 firms would satisfy a 30% revenue drop during a modelled resurgence event requiring nationwide escalation to AL2. This would achieve a greater breadth of support while further targeting the most affected firms. 23. We recommend that the revenue drop test apply only to revenues generated by the applicant business. For example, funds received from the wage subsidy or the SBCS would not be counted in the test. This assists firms in applying based on the actual impact of a resurgence. 24. Some firms will have higher costs at AL2. We have considered whether we allow firms to demonstrate eligibility based on cost increases alongside revenue drops. This however would shift the test away from revenue to net revenue which is likely to be more complex to communicate and assess. We therefore recommend staying with a revenue drop test. An applicant could acknowledge a cost impact through the declaration process, however this would not be enforceable and would, therefore, serve a signalling purpose only (discussed further below). 25. We recommend the Cabinet paper seek agreement to the high-level revenue drop threshold (30%) and a delegation for Joint Ministers to design the more technical aspects of the test, including the length of the test period, the point of comparison, and the definition of revenue. This will allow for appropriate alignment between the various revenue drops in different schemes, and for more substantive stakeholder engagement on the design. The payment rate can be weighted towards smaller firms by increasing the base payment per-firm. On balance, we recommend a base payment of $1,500 plus $400 per FTE. 26. Indicative options for the payment amount are set out below. The choice of payment level is a sliding scale, and the benchmarks set out below can be scaled. Table 1: Indicative impacts for different payment amount settings 1 Sole traders 1 to 5 6 to 9 10 to 19 20 to 99 Weekly Fixed Costs ($000s) 2.9 4.1 7.5 13.5 65.2 Payment amount Proportion of fixed costs covered by grant Base per FTE Sole traders 1 to 5 6 to 9 10 to 19 20 to 99 $1,000 $600 34% 59% 67% 62% 35% $1,500 $400 51% 59% 56% 48% 25% $2,000 $200 68% 60% 45% 33% 14% 1 Cost structures for firms are taken from the Annual Enterprises Survey. Fixed costs include interest payments, rent, insurance, rates, depreciation, ACC, superannuation, subcontractors, losses from trading assets, bad debts, royalties, and donations. IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 11 IN-C ONFIDENCE 27. All of the options presented above have the same indicative fiscal costs. These are dependent on the threshold for the revenue drop and the likely firms impacted during an escalation from AL1 to Al2 or from AL1 to AL3. The indicative fiscal cost would be $340-380 million with a 30% revenue drop during an escalation from AL1 to AL2, or $450-500 million during an escalation from AL1 to AL3. If the threshold were 40%, we estimate the indicative fiscal costs to be $270-290 million in an escalation to AL2 and $340-380 million in an escalation to AL3. 28. Depending on your preferred size of the total fiscal impact of the scheme, these options can be scaled up or down. We recommend a significant grant to improve the credibility of the support, and thereby the confidence signal to firms. A larger one-off fiscal support package may also reduce the chances of immediate calls for further supports, which risk increasing the total fiscal costs of the scheme over time (refer to discussion about review periods and subsequent payments below). 29. Choices between these options represent a choice on the distribution of support across different firm sizes. Fixed costs tend to make up a greater proportion of small firms’ total costs, and smaller firms are likely to have less resilient balance sheets. Structuring the payments to direct proportionally more support towards smaller firms, by providing a relatively larger base payment, is appropriate. 30. We note sole traders present a greater integrity risk, and are cautious against over- weighting payments towards this group. 31. There is no ideal level of payment to firms. Even with the number of FTEs proxying firm size, the sufficiency of any payment amount in covering a firm’s non-wage and transition costs at higher Alert Levels will vary. The declaration requirements for applicants can strengthen the connection to impacts from COVID-19, however it is not possible to achieve perfect alignment. We recommend firms be required to declare their drop in revenue is a result of COVID-19 measures and circumstances, and require firms to hold records proving the link. 32. The Minister of Finance has signalled that the declaration requirements could include more direction to applicants that they need to have been impacted by the shift from AL1 to AL2 or above in order to be eligible for the grant. 33. The agreements in previous schemes including the wage subsidy and the SBCS scheme have also included high-level requirement that a business declare that they have been impacted by COVID-19, or that their revenue drop is related to COVID-19. There is an opportunity to be more prescriptive in the declaration, supported by other requirements on applications. 34. Being more prescriptive and selecting aspects of the impact of COVID-19 that can be evidenced (e.g. a firm could prove that they had experienced the impact, and keep a record of that evidence), would marginally help improve enforceability of the eligibility criteria through later audit processes. A more prescriptive application process also risks considerably increasing call volumes to Inland Revenue, as well as generating uncertainty for businesses who may seek advice before applying resulting in increased compliance costs. 35. While it may be possible to require firms to declare their impact is a result of public health restrictions (e.g. gathering sizes leading to cancellations, physical distancing requirements, cleaning and the provision of PPE, and other restrictions), it is not suited to a test based on a drop in revenue. For instance, a requirement to wear (and therefore procure) PPE is an increased cost on a business, not a reduction in revenue. It would also be difficult to check compliance through an auditing process. s 9(2)(k) IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 12 IN-CONFIDENCE 36. Instead, we recommend a well-designed application process that includes a retrospective test to demonstrate an actual decline in revenue over a 14 day period, supported by a requirement for firms to declare that their result is as a consequence of COVID-19 measures and that they hold records to demonstrate this as part of the application. These approaches, combined with a 30% revenue drop level, will assist in limiting the support provided to those firms that demonstrate an actual drop in revenue during an escalation event. This could be complemented by clear communications about the intent of the BSG as a support for firms transitioning to meet public health requirements. 37. We recommend that Cabinet agree in-principle to the direction of travel in the Cabinet paper (i.e. that retrospective tests combined with clear declaration requirements), and delegate further decisions to Joint Ministers to finalise, and update as needed, the specifics of the agreement. This will allow officials time to refine the criteria and consult stakeholders. Existing integrity measures at Inland Revenue will strengthen the integrity of this scheme. 38. Inland Revenue’s standard approach, as applied to tax products, would strengthen the integrity of the scheme. For example, its existing information on taxpayers could result in some applicants that should not receive the grant being stopped pre-payment or, if necessary, trigger post-payment action. These checks would occur when confirming that an applicant is in business and the number of FTEs listed in a company. The threat of audit will also act as a behavioural incentive to stop some applicants from seeking the funding. 39. Further, we understand that work is occurring through improvements to the wage subsidy scheme to implement a test that confirms when a business has been affected by an escalation in ALs. The wage subsidy and BSG should be aligned on this policy as far as possible, meaning this work may result in changes to the BSG in the future. Eligible organisation types 40. We recommend that the eligibility of state sector organisations and of different organisational types (such as charities, and not-for-profit entities) to apply for the BSG be aligned with the settings of the wage subsidy scheme. As part of development of the SBCS, officials identified two broad types of organisations for which changes were necessary to give effect to this policy objective. We recommend the same changes be adopted for the BSG. 41. As part of the eligibility criteria, the business duration for firms should only be eligible for the BSG if they have been in business for at least 6 months. This aligns to the proposed changes to the SBCS that will soon be put before Cabinet. This is an integrity measure and it limits the fiscal risk around setting up a business to apply for the grant. 42. Charities and not-for-profit entities should be eligible for the BSG scheme so long as they meet the other eligibility criteria for the scheme. One issue is that it may be difficult for charities and not-for-profit entities to meet the ‘viable, ongoing business’ test. In order to resolve this issue, we recommend that charities and not-profits be asked to confirm that they are a ‘viable, ongoing organisation’ rather than a ‘viable, ongoing business.’ This reflects the general principle that recipients of the BSG should be acting in a manner that is consistent with the ongoing operation of the entity. IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 13 IN-CONFIDENCE 43. Pre-revenue firms, such as start-ups, are eligible for the wage subsidy scheme. They do not need to demonstrate a decline in revenue to be eligible for the wage subsidy scheme, but they must demonstrate that their capital-raising activity has been affected by the pandemic. We recommend that these conditions carry across to the BSG. Pre- revenue firms will need to have been in business for at least six months. As with charities and not-for-profit entities, pre-revenue firms may struggle to meet the ‘viable, ongoing business’ test. Officials will monitor the situation for pre-revenue firms, and may seek further changes to the test if it prevents pre-revenue firms from accessing the BSG. 44. The rules for State sector entities should be aligned with the settings for the WSS. For the wage subsidy, Sate Sector Organisations (SSOs) (including State Owned Enterprises) can be granted an exemption to apply for the scheme. This does not automatically grant access to the wage subsidy for the relevant SSOs as MSD has decision-making rights on whether to approve the application. We would expect that existing exemptions will carry through to the BSG. Subsequent application rounds within one escalation period. 45. The BSG should be provided as a one-off grant at the outset of a resurgence to support firms with fixed costs when transitioning from AL1. However, if the Government intends to provide a second round of BSG funding under protracted public health restrictions above Alert Level 1 then a decision is required through the Cabinet paper to accommodate for the setting. 46. The rationale for a second payment during an escalation period would be to provide additional assistance when an AL2 period occurs for a significantly longer period than initially expected. This is an unlikely scenario given an extended resurgence period may warrant an escalation to AL3 which would enable firms to access the wage subsidy. Firms can also access other supports such as the SBCS, BFGS and lending support from banks. For this reason, officials are undecided as to whether a subsequent application round is necessary. 47. There is an option for Ministers to direct a second round of payments to be provided to the initial recipients on the same terms, without a second application (i.e. money is pushed out to recipients without requirements). This would likely increase the amount going to firms that no longer require the support and would increase integrity risk. If there were integrity concerns about the first payment, it would be more difficult to reclaim money. Given this, if Ministers want the ability to provide a further round of payment during protracted Alert Level periods, then officials recommend a second round of applications would be opened requiring businesses to re-declare their eligibility for a subsequent payment. Operational implications 48. Legislation: There will be legislative amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to operate the BSG. The legislative amendments could be done by way of a standalone tax Bill passed under urgency when the House resumes sitting in February 2021 (in which case the BSG could be available in late February). Inland Revenue recommends this option – the longer the BSG is delayed, the more likely an ad hoc alternative scheme would be required in the event of a resurgence before the BSG is operational. Alternatively, the amendments could be added as a Supplementary Order Paper to the tax Bill currently before the House that will be passed by 31 March 2021 (in which case the BSG could be available in April). IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 14 IN-CONFIDENCE 49. Tax treatment: Businesses should not be subject to income tax on the grant they receive, but they should not be able to claim deductions for expenditure funded by the grant. This is consistent with the standard tax treatment of government grants. GST registered businesses should pay GST on the grant, with businesses able to claim input tax deductions for the relevant expenditure. This is consistent with the standard GST treatment of government grants. 50. This will differ from the GST treatment of the wage subsidy. We consider the difference is justified because the wage subsidy is required to be passed on to employees, and employee salary and wages are not subject to GST. 51. Overlapping supports: The Cabinet paper confirms, for avoidance of doubt, that firms should receive the BSG alongside other forms of support such as the wage subsidy and SBCS. 52. Resourcing: Resourcing this scheme is estimated to be similar to that for the SBCS with respect to system build and administration of payments, integrity and recoveries (though without debt management processes). Unlike the SBCS, this scheme would be activated occasionally. 53. Implementation agency: Inland Revenue will administer the scheme, alongside its existing responsibilities for the SBCS. Depending on the complementarity of the revised wage subsidy scheme, Inland Revenue may be suited to administering all three schemes. Further advice will be provided. Financial implications 54. The proposed package of resurgence measures, including the BSG, would be implemented only in the event of a future COVID resurgence. The fiscal cost of this depends directly on the number and duration of future resurgences and changes to Alert Levels. Given the uncertainty around this, the costs may therefore be higher or lower than estimated. 55. The BSG scheme would be paid for each escalation above AL1. Multiple resurgence events would trigger additional payments of the grant and multiply the fiscal cost. Remaining at higher ALs for longer durations would limit permitted economic activity, increasing expected demand for the WSS. 56. The table below shows the indicative combined fiscal cost of the BSG and WSS in different scenarios: Scenario BSG (indicative) Wage subsidy Total fiscal cost AL2 nationally for four weeks $350 million N/A $350 million Auckland-style outbreak 2 $400 million $520 million $920 million AL3 nationally for 2 weeks, AL2 for 6 weeks $450-500 million $960 million $1,410-1,460 million 57. While there is considerable uncertainty around the final cost, we consider there to be sufficient balance in the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) to fund the proposed package through multiple resurgence events. 2 Auckland at AL3 for 2 weeks followed by AL2 for 6 weeks. The remainder of NZ is at AL2 for a total of 6 weeks. IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3583 : Further decisions on a new Business Support Grant Page 15 IN-CONFIDENCE 58. Cabinet approval of the required appropriations will be sought when it is clear that the BSG is likely to be activated. Administration funding 59. While Inland Revenue is able to fund the cost of operationalising and establishing administrative capacity for the scheme for 2020/21, an estimated $9 million in new operating funding is required for 2021/22 to 2024/25. We recommend thi s is drawn from the CRRF. 60. This funding assumes that the scheme will be in place for two years, and requires a further two years of funding for integrity and compliance work after the scheme has ended. 61. Inland Revenue has noted that administrative capacity will be redeployed to work on the BSG as required. To provide for administrative flexibility, we propose delegating to Joint Ministers the authority to redistribute this $9 million across years as necessary. Next steps 62. Treasury has provided a draft Cabinet paper for initial consideration and feedback from the Minister of Finance. This paper covers the full suite of resurgence preparedness and is, at this stage, a Finance paper only. This paper includes the BSG, and this section will be finalised to align to decisions taken by both Ministers through this report. 63. Decisions on the scheme policy are needed now to complete the required legislation and system design to stand up the BSG in 2021. The design features therefore need to be agreed by Cabinet or delegated Joint Ministers before Christmas. Inland Revenue will then implement the BSG by end February 2021. Officials have proposed delegation of further design to Joint Ministers through the Cabinet paper. 64. Officials will commence very limited stakeholder engagement on the high-level proposals, subject to your agreement on detailed parameters of the BSG including: a The trigger design, including the proposed 14 day delay before for applications open; b The mechanics of the 30% revenue drop test specifically the requirement that firms declare an actual drop in revenue over the preceding 14 days (as opposed to forecast); c The workability of the proposed requirements to include a more specific declaration that an applicant has been impacted by the COVID-19 public health restrictions; d Per-firm ($1,500) and per-FTE component ($400) payment rates; and e Alignment and interaction with the other support schemes (including the wage subsidy). 65. Officials propose no discussion with stakeholders on the proposals for reviewing whether subsequent payments or application rounds in prolonged resurgence events 66. There is a risk that this may build expectations early. This will be mitigated by engaging trusted stakeholders only.

Ahead of taking a paper to Cabinet on 14 December regarding the economic support package in the event of a further resurgence of COVID-19, this report provides further information on the proposed Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) 1 , including how the RSP aligns and interacts with other forms of resurgence support. The report also seeks your decision on whether the RSP should be available to applicants at alert level (AL) 2 and above, or only at AL2. Background 2. On 14 December, you, along with the Minister for Social Development and Employment and the Minister for Small Business, are taking a paper to Cabinet on the economic support package in the case of a resurgence of COVID-19. 3. The core elements of the Cabinet paper are: a) an expanded Leave Support Scheme at all Alert Levels, to encourage compliance with self-isolation guidance and reduce the risk and extent of resurgences; b) a new Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) to support firms’ non-wage fixed and transition costs at Alert Level 2 (and possibly above); c) an improved Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) at Alert Level 3 and above; and d) additional measures at Alert Level 4 on childcare and residential tenancies, with further work on commercial tenancies. 4. The economic support package is intended to promote confidence, employment, and a rapid return to activity following the end of AL increases by providing the most affected firms with increasing levels of support as the severity and cost of public health restrictions rise. Affected businesses will be able to apply for the comparatively modest RSP when there is an increase in ALs, providing cash flow to cover fixed costs. Firms that require additional cash flow support can access the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) or seek lending from their banks (including through the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme). If there is an escalation to AL3 or above, then the most affected firms could also seek the WSS to help them keep their employees. Other support on childcare, commercial rents and leave will also assist firms and households through public health restrictions. 5. The key purpose of agreeing this package in December is to provide businesses and the public with more predictability of the support that will be available to them in the event of further Alert Level rises, and help ensure that a comprehensive response can be delivered in a timely fashion. 6. Last week, the Treasury provided the Minister of Finance with an early draft of this Cabinet paper, and will provide an updated version of the Cabinet paper to your offices early next week. 1 The RSP was previously referred to as a Business Support Grant. IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3657 & IR2020/505 Page 5 IN-CONFIDENCE 7. There are several moving parts for the design of the resurgence package, including Ministerial decisions regarding expanding the Leave Support Scheme, and further design of the WSS. Officials will provide separate reports to responsible Ministers on these issues alongside this report (such as Minister for Social Development and Employment on the WSS and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety on the Leave Support Scheme). 8. Ahead of providing you with an updated Cabinet paper on the entire resurgence package, this report provides further information on the proposed RSP, including how the RSP aligns and interacts with other forms of resurgence support. This report also seeks your decision on whether the RSP should be available to applicants at AL2 and above, or at AL2 only. 9. We have annexed a more detailed explanation of the interaction and alignment between the policy settings of the proposed RSP, WSS and SBCS. This sets out indicative payments to firms under different scenarios. When should the RSP be available? 10. The Minister of Finance has indicated that the RSP should be more limited in coverage than previous support schemes. There was a question from Ministers about whether the RSP should be available to businesses only at AL2, or at higher ALs too when the WSS is available as a form of support. Having the RSP available at only AL2 is broadly workable but not recommended 11. In practice, making the RSP available only at AL2 could be achieved by requiring that the revenue drop be demonstrated over the period at AL2 only. This does mean that in a situation where alert levels escalate straight to AL3, the RSP would not be available. 12. However, we consider there to be significant issues with availability of the scheme being restricted to AL2 only. The overarching policy intent of the scheme \[T2020/3446\] is to provide grant-based support for firms’ fixed costs upon escalation to AL2+, even with wage cost support available in the form of the wage subsidy. The schemes are complementary in that they support fixed and wage costs to the most affected firms during periods of high public health restrictions (i.e. firms with a 40% revenue decline in AL3 and AL4). 13. A common theme in stakeholder engagement to date has been that fixed costs, particularly rent, remain a significant stressor on firms during elevated alert levels. The gap between firms’ revenues and expenses which emerges under the public health restrictions is widened at AL3. As such, supporting non-wage costs at AL2 but not at AL3 contradicts the scheme’s stated purpose. Stakeholders supported the RSP, recognising the need for strong integrity measures. 14. The pass-through requirement of the WSS, which we consider essential to achieving support for employment, households, and individuals in line with the scheme’s intention, means that firms either receive no support for non-wage costs at AL3, or that firms face a choice in whether or not to comply with the pass-through requirement of the WSS. Stakeholder engagement highlighted a synergy between the proposed RSP and the WSS when available simultaneously, in making explicit the distinction between the RSP for firm support, and the WSS for employment support. We consider it advantageous to offer the WSS and the RSP concurrently, as it will encourage proper pass-through, making the WSS more effective. 15. Further, were the RSP available only at AL2, and the WSS to be the only grant-based support accessible at AL3, some small firms would receive more support at AL2 than at AL3, if it were a relatively short period of alert level escalation. Moreover it would create IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3657 & IR2020/505 Page 6 IN-CONFIDENCE confusion in events similar to the Auckland resurgence, as an escalation to AL3 in one region would activate the WSS nationally while the escalation to AL2 elsewhere would activate the RSP nationally. 16. For the reasons described above, we recommend that the RSP remains available at AL2 and above. Ways to limit the fiscal impact of the RSP 17. If you would like to further contain the fiscal cost of the scheme, three options for limiting the size of support provided by the RSP are set out below. Some of these are indicative and would require further work to develop, and to mitigate the potential challenges. Exclusivity of support schemes 18. An option to enable both schemes to be available concurrently, but restricting firms’ access to either the WSS or the RSP would be to establish an effective upper limit for the RSP eligibility threshold at AL3 and above. This would mean the RSP would be available for firms that have experienced a revenue decline of between 30% and 39%, and the WSS when a revenue decline is experienced above 40%. This enables some support for firms fixed costs to be provided when there is an escalation from AL1 to AL3 only, with no escalation to AL2, however more heavily impacted firms would receive only the WSS. 19. Ultimately, we consider options such as this approach unworkable or undesirable as: a) If the RSP was only available for firms with revenue drops of between 30% and 39%, some firms experiencing a revenue drop of 30% to 40% would receive more support than an equivalently sized firm experiencing a revenue drop greater than 40%. b) The incentive to take on the WSS and maintain employment levels would be marginally weakened by the presence of an alternative but exclusive RSP. At least some firms would choose the unconditional RSP grant over the conditional wage subsidy. The magnitude of this effect cannot be estimated in the time available. c) If firms can choose which support to receive, with recurring payments under the WSS, while the RSP is a one-off payment, they could speculate on the duration of AL2 versus AL3 restrictions when engaging with support. This would partly undermine the certainty provided by having a pre-determined package of support. d) Operational complexity arises in enforcing any exclusivity between the support mechanisms. This is exacerbated by the fact the two schemes are implemented by different agencies. Such an approach would require IRD and MSD systems to be more coordinated than they currently are, with significant implications for the design of the respective implementation systems. Higher revenue drop tests 20. A higher revenue drop threshold could also be considered. Most recently, we have recommended a 30% threshold, considering this to be suitably targeted towards firms experiencing the greatest activity constraints, while remaining relevant to the level of disruption at AL2. Any stronger revenue drop test applied at AL2 trades-off against the breadth of support provided. 21. We do not recommend revenue drop settings for the RSP being different in the event of an AL3 escalation to that applied at AL2. This would introduce significant additional IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3657 & IR2020/505 Page 7 IN-CONFIDENCE operational complexity to the application of revenue drop tests and confusion for applicants. 22. Increasing the revenue drop test to 40% at Alert Level 3 would also create a double ‘cliff face’ of support for firms just below the 40% threshold. A 30% threshold helps by providing support to firms that are still affected but cannot access the WSS at AL3. 23. For information purposes only, we have provided below, a table indicating the estimated cost and breadth of potentially eligible firms in 30%, 40%, and 50% threshold scenarios. $1,500 base payment, $400 per FTE payment, three revenue drop thresholds, indicating firm coverage and fiscal impact Revenue drop test Escalation to AL2 Escalation to AL3   Firm coverage Fiscal impact ($ millions) Firm coverage Fiscal impact ($ millions) 30% 150,000 $ 360 190,000 $ 460 40% 120,000 $ 300 160,000 $ 380 50% 90,000 $ 230 120,000 $ 300 Lower payment amounts 24. A lower payment amount could also be considered. However, we consider there to be some minimum floor on payment amounts, below which the scheme ceases to be useful. The current proposal means that firms with 5-9 FTEs would receive approximately 50% of one weeks’ average fixed costs, which is relatively low considering an eligible firm would need to experience a 30% decline in revenue over a two week period. On balance, we recommend retaining the payment structure previously agreed. Targeting firms that have been specifically affected by COVID-19 25. The Minister of Finance expressed a desire for the RSP to require a declaration from applicants that their business or organisation has been specifically impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions associated with the most recent resurgence of COVID-19, to avoid support being provided to firms experiencing ‘random’ revenue drops. This will work in tandem with the revenue drop test to target support towards firms that are most affected. At the point of application, this test will be satisfied by the applicant certifying it has met the condition. 26. (the ‘specifically affected business test’), and we recommend that they . 27. Officials are undertaking selective consultation with stakeholders to inform the wording of this self-certification, that the applicant has been specifically affected by the alert level escalation. The issues being explored include whether a particular declaration wording will be easy for applicants to self- assess, since ambiguity will cause confusion and drive customer contact to IR. Officials s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3657 & IR2020/505 Page 8 IN-CONFIDENCE are also testing whether any concept or declaration wording phrase is verifiable as this will influence whether audit will be an effective tool for driving integrity. 28. The Cabinet paper as currently drafted includes a recommendation seeking agreement to the policy intent for a specifically affected test, but delegates further decisions to Joint Ministers about how best to achieve this. We consider this to be sufficient for the purpose of the Cabinet paper, and will work to provide you with further advice on how to best achieve a sufficiently clear, and workable ‘specifically affected’ test in the RSP declaration. Further design decisions Pre-revenue firms 29. Pre-revenue firms are eligible for the WSS and the SBCS if they meet specific eligibility criteria. There is an argument that pre-revenue firms ought not be eligible for the RSP. As the firms are pre-revenue, they would not suffer a decline in customer numbers upon an elevation in Alert Levels. That said, pre-revenue firms could conceivably suffer financially if an escalation delayed their capital raising activities, or if it deferred their progress towards being market-ready (particularly upon an increase to AL3 or AL4). 30. On balance, we recommend that pre-revenue firms, (typically R&D intensive start-ups) that have been in business for at least six months at the time of application, to be eligible for the RSP scheme. We propose to align the eligibility test with the eligibility test for the wage subsidy. Repayment requirements 31. There is a question for both the RSP as to the circumstances in which recipients would be required to repay the funds they receive. 32. Officials are providing substantive advice for Ministers in parallel to this report that addresses the repayment obligations of recipients. It will address, for instance, options regarding repayment obligations 33. You may prefer to delay making a decision on repayment requirements for the RSP until you have received the advice . This would give you an option for more consistency between the schemes. Alternatively, applicants for the RSP could be required to repay the grant only where an applicant was retrospectively found to be ineligible at the time of their application. Depending on decisions taken by responsible Ministers, this may not be aligned with , but the integrity risks are less acute for the RSP as it will include a revenue test based on actuals, and individual applicants will not be eligible for more than $21,500. We therefore consider there to be diminishing returns for a significant repayment policy feature, given the potential implementation and resourcing implications. 34. IR’s preference is to resolve this issue prior to announcement of the policy as IR may receive inquiries about eligibility that cannot be answered. Officials recommend that you address this issue in the Cabinet Paper that will be lodged on Friday 11 December 2020. 35. We recommend engagement with stakeholders prior to finalising any new rule requiring repayment by profitable firms. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2) (f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IN-CONFIDENCE T2020/3657: Joint Report: Further information and decisions on the Resurgence Support Payment Page 9 IN-CONFIDENCE Annex one: Alignment of the RSP with other resurgence support schemes The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS), Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) and the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) provide complementary forms of support to firms in different Alert Level scenarios. These are further supported by other policies, including the Leave Support Scheme, changes to commercial rent legislation, the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme (BFGS) and support from private lending. This annex focusses on the three schemes providing direct funding to firms with relatively similar application processes, but different features recognising the unique support each scheme provides. The annex covers some illustrative scenarios of how these support measures would kick in and be available to different firm types. It also sets out the key parameters and how they interact, and rationales for any discrepancies. This information has been prepared under urgency and may contain errors.

For AL3/4, concern some firms may not be able to access finance, impacting confidence so prospective test enables fast payment and higher confidence and staff retention. These issues are less present at AL2, hence retrospective test that improves integrity. Resolved Payment rate $585.80 per FTE per week $10,000 per firm, $1,800 per FTE $1,500 per firm, $400 per FTE Schemes support different objectives: wage costs, fixed costs, and lending. RSP and SBCS weighted to small firms through a higher per-firm component. Resolved Number of employees Eligible regardless of number of FTEs Fewer than 50 FTEs All FTEs, but payment capped at 50 FTEs SBCS creates competitive neutrality issues at margin. If we want large firms to keep employees on then need to scale by size. This rationale doesn’t apply for fixed/non-wage costs. In the case of the RSP, payment cap recognises that larger firms have larger balance sheets. Resolved Implementation agency MSD IR IR MSD supporting firms for labour market attachment. IR supporting firms with cashflow. Potential for IR to implement all three schemes in future. Resolved Requirement to pass through to employees Yes No No WSS provides support to keep workers in employment, so funds should be spent on wage costs. This is not required for SCBS and RSP. Resolved Restrictions on use Wage expenses only Business expenses only Business expenses only Pass through requirement for WSS restricts funds to wage expenses. SBCS and RSP supports cashflow, so declaration restrictions applied to business expenses (wages, capital expenditure, core operating costs, cannot be used to pay dividends). Resolved Payment frequency Fortnightly One-off One-off RSP targeted at fixed costs during a transition to an AL escalation, so the payment covers one-off adjustments. WSS supports continued employment, linked to duration at AL3/4. SBCS is a loan, up to a limit. No subsequent rounds for RSP. Resolved. New companies No requirement to have been in business In business for 6 months, ownership continuity test (new criterion) In business for 6 months, ownership continuity test Integrity measure to exclude shell companies attracting the SBCS and RSP. The restriction is an integrity measure to exclude shell companies or ‘phoenix’ arrangements. This is not required for the WSS as the employment objective requires a firm to have staff and to pass it through. Resolved Tax treatment No income tax or GST on grant Because it’s a loan, not taxable nor is there GST No income tax but expenditure not deductible. GST to pay on grant but GST can be claimed on purchases Different treatment for GST is justified since WSS must be passed onto employees and wages are not subject to GST.

Not required for the permanent SBCS. Declaration is based on self-assessment, risks ambiguity, delegation to confirm declarations including specifically affected language for RSP. Delegate Activation 7 consecutive days or more at relevant Alert Level 3 and/or 4 Permanently activated 7 days or more at relevant Alert Level (2, 3 or 4) (at least part of 7 consecutive days) Minimum period encourages business resilience, consistency increases ease of communication. 7 days appropriate to avoid activating schemes for short, precautionary AL escalations. Decision sought through this paper Eligibility of charities and not- for profits Yes Yes, with “viable ongoing organisation declaration” Yes, with “viable ongoing organisation declaration” if such a declaration is required for the RSP. No such declaration in WSS, introduced in SBCS and recommended to be carried through to enable a path for access to charities and not-for-profits. Resolved Comparator period Year-on-year comparator (under review) Year-on-year comparator, but if COVID-19 impacted then across two years. TBC The year-on-year comparator will be complicated from March 2021 as the comparator month will also have been suppressed by the March 2020 AL4 declaration. SBCS will now require applicants to demonstrate an impact across two years to mitigate against this (subject to Cabinet decision). Shorter comparator periods could disadvantage or advantage seasonal businesses. New businesses would hold a shorter comparator period. Delegate Viability test None “Viable, ongoing business” “Viable, ongoing business” SCBS introduced a requirement that firms declare they are a “viable, ongoing business.” RSP could include this also as it may strengthen signals to better target the scheme. Detail to be resolved in Cabinet paper Eligibility of groups of related companies None (per FTE payment) One loan per participant in the group provided total number of employees 50 or fewer TBC WSS calculated based on a per-FTE basis, supporting FTEs across a group of businesses (e.g. branches of one firm). SBCS and RSP provides a per-firm basis, which if applied per branch could advantage a firm. Further work required to accommodate for regional escalations (i.e. affected branch may require a per- firm contribution, but what about the other branches operating normally?). Delegate Closing date for applications Scheme will remain open long enough for employers to assess revenue drop and submit claims for eligible period(s). Actual closing date depends on operational decisions by MSD. Closes in 2023 1 month after resumption of AL1 Application round requires an end point for WSS and RSP, given temporary nature. 1 month at AL1 provides firms with sufficient time to apply based on retrospective actuals. Resolved Sectoral targeting None None None Sectoral targeting is infeasible as it creates boundary issues (e.g. sector definitions), and the most impacted firms can be better targeted through a well-designed revenue decline test. Resolved Regional targeting None, with discretion to apply manual approach in very local Alert Level escalation None None, with discretion to apply manual approach Regional targeting fails to recognise supply chain linkages and is administratively complex. We recommend that no regional targeting occur, however if this is required then options could include self-declaration that a business is within a region, or a local third party would approve a list of eligible businesses (slowing the application process). These options would still be Resolved, however a late decision to incorporate regional targeting could delay implementation.

Detail to be determined in operational guidance State sector organisations Eligible subject to a waiver from MOF Eligible subject to a waiver from MOF Eligible subject to a waiver from MOF State sector organisations that operate on a commercial basis are therefore susceptible to revenue declines in escalation events. However, as the Crown has an ownership interest these organisations must first seek approval from the MOF to submit an application for the WSS. The same rationale applies for the RSP, so we recommend it carry through. Resolved Pre-revenue firms Eligible with amended revenue drop test Eligible with amended revenue drop test Eligible with amended revenue drop test Firms without revenue do not need compensation for reduced revenue, but may still have reduced activity particularly at AL3 so should be eligible for WSS and SBCS support. The RSP is targeted to AL2 resurgences, so the argument for pre-revenue firms may be weaker, however this is recommended for alignment purposes. Resolved Repayment requirements Repayment required if applicants no longer meet obligations and criteria in declaration. Yes TBC WSS did not establish a repayment requirement for firms that subsequently become profitable. Nonetheless, Some firms have repaid voluntarily for this reason. The RSP will provide relatively small grants (maximum $21,500) and is subject to a retrospective test (i.e. experience of revenue drop is demonstrated), so this may be unnecessary for the RSP. Repayment required for SBCS as it is a loan. Indication sought from Ministers on whether to require repayments of RSP for firms that become profitable.

Relation to government priorities 2 Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds is signalled as a priority in the Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto. This aligns with the Government’s priority to support New Zealand’s economic recovery through incentivising those on main benefit to engage in paid work and builds on our commitment to ensure benefit abatement thresholds better reflect existing labour market settings. Executive Summary 3 Main benefits are targeted to people who need it the most through the eligibility criteria and the benefit abatement regime. People receiving a main benefit can earn up to a certain level of income per week (abatement threshold) before their benefit begins to reduce. 4 The abatement thresholds were adjusted on 1 April 2020 through funding secured through Budget 2019. However, prior to this adjustment, main benefit abatement settings had not been adjusted for almost a decade. 5 This has meant that the value of what people could earn before their benefit abated has declined in real terms over time as wages have increased. The number of hours beneficiaries can work before their benefit begins to abate has reduced significantly over the years and the current settings offer little incentive to engage in paid work while receiving a main benefit. 6 Therefore, I propose that the abatement thresholds be increased to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2021, which will allow beneficiaries to work up to eight hours on minimum wage before abatement occurs. This is in line with our manifesto commitment. 7 This increase will allow working beneficiaries to keep a greater proportion of their earnings as they can work more hours before their benefit begins to abate. This will improve financial incentives for a significant number of people to enter the labour BUDGET SENSITIVE 1 4. BUDGET SENSITIVE market and maintain part-time work while on a benefit. While the proposed increase better incentivises part-time work than full-time work, it ensures that some (who may be currently facing reduced hours) can access financial assistance while still being attached to their job. 8 Increasing the abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week is expected to benefit approximately 82,900 individuals and families by on average of $18 per week. Of these, approximately 50,200 are families with children. These changes are estimated to reduce child poverty by around 6,000 (+/- 3,000) on the AHC50 fixed line measure 1 and 2,000 (+/- 3,000) on the BHC50 measure 2 in 2021/22. 9 The proposed increase will increase the benefit cut-out point 3 , which has a number of flow-on impacts to other financial assistance: 9.1 Of the 82,900 individuals and families, around 50,300 are non-beneficiaries who currently receive the Accommodation Supplement (AS), who will become eligible for a higher rate of payment (average gain of $12 a week); 9.2 A small number of non-beneficiaries (approximately 4,000) will become newly eligible for AS; 9.3 A small number of non-beneficiaries (approximately 7,000) will become newly eligible for a main benefit; they will also become eligible for the Winter Energy Payment during the winter period. 10 s 9(2)(f)(iv) 11 Abatement threshold changes also affect decisions on the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). The MFTC has been adjusted annually to reflect changes in settings, such as benefit rates and abatement thresholds, to maintain the financial incentives provided by the MFTC for families with children to work at 20 or 30 hours a week. 12 The MFTC threshold needs to be adjusted for 2021/22 to reflect the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds. We recommend a partial increase for 2021/22, increasing the MFTC threshold to $30,576 per annum. This proposed partial increase ensures that sole parents, who account for approximately 90% of the MFTC recipients, remain better off working and receiving MFTC than receiving a benefit. The partial increase also has a lower fiscal cost, reduces the impact on financial disincentives to work full-time and will have less of an impact on the cost of options being considered as part of the review of Working for Families tax credits. This review will include further consideration of the MFTC. 1 AHC measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 per cent of the median income in 2017/18, after housing costs are removed. 2 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income, before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 per cent of the median household income in the year measured. 3 The point at which a person’s payment is reduced to zero because of their income or assets. BUDGET SENSITIVE 2 BUDGET SENSITIVE 13 The partial increase to the MFTC threshold will benefit around 4,000 families. Approximately 400 of these will be newly eligible for the payment. Background Main benefits provide income for people who are unable to fully support themselves through paid work 14 Main benefits are targeted to people who need it the most through the eligibility criteria and the benefit abatement regime, which gradually reduces payments that people receive as their other income, for example from work, increases. 15 Generally, the full rate of benefit will be available to people earning up to a certain amount; this is the abatement threshold. Above this amount, payments reduce gradually as people’s incomes increase based on the abatement rate. Allowing people to work for a small number of hours without having their benefit payment affected encourages labour market entry, and also recognises that there are additional costs associated with work, such as transport costs. 16 There are two main benefit abatement regimes, which seek to align the financial incentives to work with the level of labour force engagement expected of the individual (based on their circumstances): 16.1 The full-time regime has a relatively high abatement rate of 70 percent which is designed to incentivise full-time work. This mainly applies to people on Jobseeker Support (JS)-related benefits. 4 16.2 The part-time regime has two abatement thresholds, with a relatively low abatement rate of 30 percent applied at the first threshold, and an abatement rate of 70 percent applied at the second threshold. This is designed to incentivise part-time work and applies to people receiving Sole Parent Support (SPS) and Supported Living Payment (SLP). 17 The full-time abatement regime is also applicable for recipients of New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) and Veteran’s Pension (VP) if they choose to include a non- qualifying partner in their payment. 5 If they choose to include a non-qualifying partner, they receive payment as a couple but the payment becomes subject to an income test based on the income of both partners. 18 Recipients of VP who are under 65 also have their payments subject to an income test. VP (under 65) is a grandparented income support payment under the War Pensions Act 1954 for veterans who are unable to work due to illness or injury. The abatement regime for VP (under 65) mirrors those for SPS and SLP, which is designed to encourage part-time work. 19 The current abatement thresholds are set out below: Current amount Abatement rate at different thresholds beneficiaries can earn per week before their benefit begins to abate 4 This includes Jobseeker Support on the grounds of a health condition, injury or disability. 5 From 9 November 2020, the option to include non-qualifying partners in payments for NZS or VP is no longer available. BUDGET SENSITIVE 3 BUDGET SENSITIVE JS (abatement rate of 70%) $90 NZS and VP with non-qualifying partner (abatement rate of 70%) $115 SPS, SLP and VP (under 65) – Threshold One (abatement rate of 30%) $115 SPS, SLP and VP (under 65) – Threshold Two (abatement rate of 70%) $215 20 Under the current settings, a JS recipient would have their benefit reduce by 70 cents for every dollar earned over $90 per week. For a SPS recipient, their benefit would reduce by 30 cents for every dollar earned over $115 per week, and by 70 cents for every dollar earned over $215 per week. Prior to the adjustments made on 1 April 2020, abatement thresholds had remained unchanged for almost a decade 21 Abatement thresholds are increased through one-off changes, rather than being adjusted annually. On 1 April 2020, the abatement thresholds were adjusted through funding secured through Budget 2019. This funding committed to progressively increase the abatement thresholds for main benefits over four years (until 2023) in line with minimum wage increases \[CAB-19-MIN-0174.36 refers\]. 6 The adjustment aimed to ensure that the number of hours a beneficiary could work on minimum wage before abatement occurred would not reduce any further. 22 However, prior to the April 2020 adjustment, the last adjustment to main benefit abatement settings occurred in September 2010, when changes were made for recipients of (what was then known as) Domestic Purposes Benefit, Invalid’s Benefit, Widow’s Benefit as well as for VP (under 65), and NZS and VP with non-qualifying partners. For the full-time abatement regime for JS, the threshold had remained at $80 since it was last adjusted in 1996. 23 This has meant that the value of what people could earn before their benefit abated has declined in real terms over time as wages have increased. For example, a person receiving JS in 1997 could work approximately 11.4 hours on minimum wage ($7.00 per hour) before their benefit abated. In 2019, a person receiving JS could only work for approximately 4.5 hours on minimum wage ($17.70 per hour) before their benefit abated. Increasing the abatement thresholds will support beneficiaries to work more 24 I consider that it is timely to increase the abatement thresholds as the current settings are out of line with the original abatement settings. The number of hours beneficiaries can work before their benefit begins to abate has reduced significantly over the years and current settings offer little incentive to engage in paid work while receiving a main benefit. 25 Therefore, I propose that the abatement thresholds be increased on 1 April 2021 as set out below: 6 Budget 2019 funding of $97.1 million to increase abatement thresholds over four years from $80, $100 and $200 in 2019 to $105, $130 and $230 in 2023. These adjustments set the new thresholds by rounding to the nearest $5. BUDGET SENSITIVE 4 BUDGET SENSITIVE Abatement rate at different thresholds What beneficiaries can earn per week before their benefit begins to abate Current From 1 April 2021 JS (abatement rate of 70%) $90 $160 NZS/VP with non-qualifying partner (abatement rate of 70%) $115 $160 SPS/SLP and VP (under 65) -Threshold One (abatement rate of 30%) $115 $160 SPS/SLP and VP (under 65) -Threshold Two (abatement rate of 70%) $215 $250 26 These proposed increases are in line with our manifesto commitment to increase abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2021. We committed to support families towards better futures by allowing people to keep more of what they earn while on a benefit. 27 These increases will allow working beneficiaries to keep a greater proportion of their earnings as they can work up to around eight hours on minimum wage 7 before their benefit begins to abate, recognising that eight hours is a typical working day. For recipients of SPS, SLP and VP (under 65), they can work up to 12.5 hours before their benefit abates at the higher rate. These increases mean the thresholds will better align with the original abatement settings which enabled beneficiaries to work for longer hours before abatement occurred. 28 The proposed changes to the abatement thresholds do not impact Youth Payment or Young Parent Payment as these benefits have a separate abatement regime, which is the same as the regime for Student Allowance. 8 The changes also do not impact Orphan’s Benefit or Unsupported Child’s Benefit as these do not have an income test. Increasing abatement thresholds will increase the incomes of working beneficiaries and better incentivise part-time work... 29 I believe the proposed increases will improve financial incentives for a significant number of people to enter the labour market and maintain part-time work while on a benefit. This is because beneficiaries will be able to work for longer before their benefit begins to abate and keep a greater proportion of their earnings. 30 A significant number of non-beneficiaries (low-income working individuals and families) who are currently receiving the AS will also become eligible for a higher rate of payment. This is because the AS abatement threshold for non-beneficiaries is aligned to the JS benefit cut-out point 9 , which will increase as the abatement threshold increase. 7 Based on minimum wage increasing to $20.00 per hour on 1 April 2021. 8 The current abatement threshold is $224.58 per week; any earnings above this point are abated at 100 percent. 9 Benefit cut-out point is the point at which a person’s payment is reduced to zero because of their income or assets. BUDGET SENSITIVE 5 BUDGET SENSITIVE 31 Increasing the abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week is expected to benefit approximately 82,900 individuals and families by on average of $18 per week. 10 Of these: 31.1 around 29,500 individuals and families currently receiving a working-age benefit are expected to benefit from the change with an average weekly gain of $29; 31.2 around 3,100 individuals and families receiving NZS are expected to benefit with an average weekly gain of $21; 31.3 more than half (50,300) are non-beneficiaries receiving AS, who will gain an average of $12 a week; 31.4 around 50,200 are families with children; these changes are estimated to reduce child poverty by around 6,000 (+/- 3,000) on the AHC50 fixed line measure and 2,000 (+/- 3000) on the BHC50 measure in 2021/22. 32 I note that the proposed increases will likely mean that working beneficiaries in part- time work may be less incentivised to move to full-time work as the proposed changes reduce the financial gain from moving from part-time to full-time work. This may be of concern where financial incentives to work full-time are currently relatively weak, for example, for sole parents on low/minimum wages with childcare costs. 33 However, given the economic impacts of COVID-19 and many people facing reduced hours, the proposed increase in abatement thresholds ensures that those with reduced hours can access financial assistance while still being attached to their job. 34 Better incentivising beneficiaries to enter the labour market and maintain part-time work can ensure people take the opportunity to be in employment without losing financial security. This is especially important for those already disadvantaged in the labour market prior to COVID-19, such as sole parents and people with a health condition, injury or disability. Part-time work can also provide a pathway to full-time work by providing opportunities to connect with the labour market, get work experience and become familiar with the demands that can come with employment. ... and will result in some people becoming newly eligible 35 Changes with welfare system settings often have various flow-on impacts. Increasing abatement thresholds will result in some people becoming newly eligible. This is because abatement thresholds determine the benefit cut-out point, which is the point at which a person’s payment is reduced to zero because of their income or assets. 36 A small number of people will become newly eligible for AS; it is estimated that around 4,000 additional people could take up AS as a result of the changes. A small number of people will become newly eligible for a main benefit as well. It is estimated that around 7,000 additional people could take up a main benefit as a result. They will also 10 The modelling factors in flow-on impacts of the proposed abatement threshold changes, including likely increase to the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). The overall number of people affected by the abatement threshold changes include families who are expected to gain through increases in the MFTC. The modelling is also based on the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Update 2020 forecasts. These forecasts were prepared during a time of high uncertainty, and actual volumes of benefit receipt have tracked lower than the forecast. Therefore, the actual numbers may be lower once more recent forecasts are considered. BUDGET SENSITIVE 6 BUDGET SENSITIVE become eligible for the Winter Energy Payment (during the winter period) as eligibility for th is payment is linked to main benefits. A small number may be financially disadvantaged as a result of the abatement threshold increases but I propose compensating them through a Transitional Assistance Payment 37 A small number of people may be financially disadvantaged as a result of the proposed abatement th reshold increases; around 79 i ndividuals and families are expected to lose an average of $19 a week. People are likely to be disadvantaged for the follow ing reasons: 37.1 Childcare Assistance - supplementary assistance payments, i ncluding AS, are included as income for the purposes of determining the rate of Childcare Assistance payable. Some may face a reduction in the hourly subsidy rate as a result of abatement th reshold increases if they become newly eligible for AS or their AS payment increases. 37.2 Temporary Additional Support ( TAS)-TAS recipients with high disability costs can receive additional support over and above the upper limit th rough an additional top-up called the disabili ty exception. Some people will lose their disability exception as a result of increases to their rate of benefit or other supplementary assistance, resulting in them moving off the TAS upper limit and becomi ng ineligible for the Disability Allowance exception. 38 I propose to implement a Transitional Assistance Payment (TAP) for these people w ho may be financially disadvantaged on 1 April 2021 as a result of the abatement threshold increases, to be available for up to 12 months. A TAP is a temporary non- taxable payment, paid through a welfare programme established under section 101 of the Social Security Act 2018. 39 This approach is consistent with other recent packages of changes to the income support system. For example, a TAP was provided for clients w ho were financially disadvantaged on 1 April 2020 because of one or more of the changes from the Income Support and COVID-19 Recovery Packages, w hich included abatement threshold increases. 40 41 BUDGET SENSITIVE 7 BUDGET SENSITIVE Abatement threshold changes will also affect decisions on the Minimum Family Tax Credit The Minimum Family Tax Credit ensures that families with children are better off not on a benefit when in work than receiving a main benefit 42 The Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) is one of the Working for Families tax credits. It is received by low-income working families in each week that they work the required hours 11 , do not receive a main benefit and have income below the prescribed weekly threshold. 43 On 30 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to retrospectively increase the MFTC threshold for the 2020/21 tax year to $29,432 to reflect the $25 increase to main benefit rates made on 1 April 2020 in response to COVID-19 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. Under this threshold, the MFTC tops up a family’s income to at least $566 a week after tax. 44 The MFTC is intended to support the “making work pay” objective of the Working for Families package. Its purpose is to ensure that a family who works the required hours and does not receive a benefit always has a higher income than they could receive on a benefit. The MFTC threshold is set at $1 above the maximum income a two-parent family could receive on a benefit and is therefore sensitive to changes that impact the incomes of beneficiary families, such as benefit rates and abatement thresholds. 12 45 The MFTC works by providing a payment so that a family’s income reaches exactly the legislated threshold. For example, if a sole parent earns $25,000 of net income, then they would receive a payment of $4,432 on an annual basis under the new 2020/21 threshold as agreed to by Cabinet. If the sole parent works more and earns $1 more, their payment is reduced by $1. Therefore, there is no financial incentive for families receiving the MFTC to increase their hours or earnings until their net income is above the prescribed threshold. 46 However, the MFTC does ensure there is a strong financial incentive for families to increase their hours of work up to the 20-or 30-hour threshold and move off benefit. 47 In the 2019/20 tax year, around 3,800 families received the MFTC. The average MFTC payment per family was $3,100 at a total fiscal cost of approximately $12 million. Approximately 90% of those who receive the MFTC are sole parents. The MFTC has been increased annually since 2006 48 As part of the introduction of Working for Families, on 26 April 2004, Cabinet agreed to increase the MFTC on 1 April each year by an amount sufficient to ensure that couples do not suffer a reduction in income when moving off benefit into 30 hours of paid work a week, from 1 April 2006 onwards \[CAB Min (04) 13/4 refers\]. 49 Consequently, the MFTC threshold has been increased each year since 2006 to reflect the latest changes to relevant settings (such as benefit rates, the minimum wage and abatement thresholds). 11 20 hours for sole parents and 30 hours combined for couples. 12 This threshold is then rounded up to the nearest $52 to produce a whole-dollar weekly amount. BUDGET SENSITIVE 8 BUDGET SENSITIVE 50 As such, if the abatement thresholds increased as proposed on 1 April 2021, a decision would be required on whether to adjust the MFTC for the 2021/22 tax year to reflect the abatement threshold increase. We recommend partially increasing the MFTC threshold for 2021/22 in response to the proposed increases to the abatement threshold 51 As noted above, prior to the adjustments made on 1 April 2020, the abatement thresholds had not been adjusted for almost a decade. Given that the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds are significant, the MFTC threshold would also require a significant adjustment to reflect this change. 52 We have considered three options around adjustment to the MFTC threshold for 2021/22 to reflect the abatement threshold increases: 52.1 Increase the MFTC threshold to $32,604 per annum ($627 per week) to fully reflect the abatement threshold increases – this would incur a fiscal cost of $51 million over the forecast period; 52.2 Partially increase the MFTC threshold to $30,576 per annum ($588 per week) – this would incur a fiscal cost of $17 million over the forecast period; 52.3 Do not increase the MFTC threshold. 53 These options involve trade-offs between financial incentives to work, fiscal costs and impacts on future reforms through the upcoming review of Working for Families. Appendix One sets out in detail the advantages and disadvantages of each of the options. 54 A partial or full adjustment to the MFTC threshold are finely balanced options. A full adjustment would ensure that no family could be better off on a benefit than they would be moving off benefit and receiving the MFTC and preserves the full policy intent of the MFTC. 55 However, a full adjustment extends the range of income over which families receive the MFTC, thereby reducing the financial incentive for those families to work greater hours or earn more income. 56 Also, a full adjustment would incur a significant fiscal cost and may make options for reform through the upcoming review of Working for Families more costly. 57 Therefore, we recommend partially increasing the MFTC threshold for 2021/22 by reflecting the maximum amount of income a sole parent on benefit could receive, instead of the maximum amount a two-parent household on benefit could receive. This partial increase ensures that: 57.1 Sole parents, who account for approximately 90% of the MFTC recipients, remain better off working and receiving MFTC than receiving a benefit 57.2 Changes to the MFTC will have less of an impact on the cost of options for reforming Working for Families 57.3 The impact of the changes to the MFTC on the financial disincentives to take up full-time work for low-income sole parents are smaller. BUDGET SENSITIVE 9 BUDGET SENSITIVE 58 The partial increase to the MFTC threshold will benefit around 4,000 families on MFTC. Approximately 400 of these will be newly eligible for the payment. 59 We do not recommend not adjusting the MFTC threshold. This would mean that sole parents and couples will be better off on benefit than receiving the MFTC when they are receiving WEP and working over 20 or 30 hours. Financial Implications 60 The total cost of the policy changes proposed in this paper is estimated to be $410.979 million (net) over the next five years. Abatement threshold increases 61 A pre-commitment to Budget 2021 is required in order to increase the abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week on 1 April 2021. The proposed increases to the abatement thresholds in 2021 are estimated to cost $387.496 million (net) over the next five years. 62 Note that this accounts for increasing the abatement thresholds in 2021 only; s 9(2)(f)(iv) 63 In addition, a pre-Budget commitment is required for the following: 63.1 $80,000 in Transitional Assistance Payment payments to be available for up to 12 months for people who may be financially disadvantaged on 1 April 2021 as a result of the abatement threshold increases 63.2 $6.403 million in operational costs, including costs for additional resources and IT system changes to implement the abatement threshold changes and administer TAP. Adjustments to the MFTC threshold 64 A pre-commitment to Budget 2021 is required in order to increase the MFTC threshold for the 2021/22 tax year. The proposed increase is estimated to cost a total of $17 million over the forecast period. Legislative Implications Increasing the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 65 An Order in Council under sections 452(1) and 452(2)(c) of the Social Security Act 2018 is required to increase abatement thresholds for JS, SPS, SLP and NZS on 1 April 2021. 66 In addition, an amendment to the Veterans’ Support Regulations 2014 under section 265(1)(29A) of the Veterans’ Support Act 2014 is required to increase abatement thresholds for VP. Subject to Cabinet agreement to the proposal, the Minister for Veterans has agreed to the Regulations being amended in order to implement the proposed increases on 1 April 2021. BUDGET SENSITIVE 10 BUDGET SENSITIVE 67 Should Cabinet agree to the proposal, I will report back separately to the Cabinet Legislation Committee to progress these legislative changes in early 2021. Transitional Assistance Payment 68 Subject to Cabinet decisions, I intend to approve and establish a welfare programme under section 101 of the Social Security Act to provide a TAP for up to 12 months for the small number of people who may be financially disadvantaged on 1 April 2021 as a result of the abatement threshold increases. Minimum Family Tax Credit 69 Changes to the MFTC threshold can be made by an Order in Council as set out in sections ME 1(4) and MF 7(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, an Order in Council is required by 1 December 2020 for changes to apply from 1 April 2021. Therefore, the proposed adjustment to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold would need to be made via an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. 70 Should Cabinet agree to the proposed change to the MFTC, we recommend that Inland Revenue be instructed to draft the necessary amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 to give effect to the revised thresholds for 2021/22 to be included in the next available tax Bill. This amendment would need to be passed by March 2021 for MFTC payments to be made at the new rate from 1 April 2021. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Statement 71 The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) requirements apply to the proposals in this paper. A RIA has been prepared and is attached. 72 On 30 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to adjust the MFTC threshold for the 2020/21 tax year, but a RIA could not be undertaken due to time constraints \[CAB-20-MIN- 0490 refers\]. As required under Cabinet’s RIA requirements, the attached RIA also incorporates a Supplementary Analysis Report for the proposal on adjusting the 2020/21 MFTC threshold. 73 The Quality Assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development have reviewed the Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit RIA and consider that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. 74 It partially meets the quality criteria for the following reasons: 74.1 There has been no analysis of the behavioural impacts. This is understandable given the timeframes and difficulties undertaking this analysis. However, the abatement thresholds and the MFTC are intended to encourage people to engage in work. Ideally, RIA would include an estimate of how many people will move into work as a result of the changes. The team notes the employment impacts will be monitored following implementation. 74.2 There is minimal discussion of alternative options to the abatement threshold increases, such as the staged increases committed to by the Government as part of Budget 2019. However, the Treasury RIA team advised the Ministry of BUDGET SENSITIVE 11 BUDGET SENSITIVE Social Development that a full RIA for the abatement threshold increases was not required because the increases were a manifesto commitment. 74.3 In terms of the MFTC, the status quo is based on a long-established policy of full alignment of the MFTC with benefit changes. There are now differing views on the appropriateness of this automatic linkage when there are significant increases in benefit entitlements and the case for change does not adequately consider the impact on the identified group of people who would be relatively worse off if the MFTC is not increased. Moreover, the analysis relies on certain assumptions about the fiscal cost, which could benefit from further explanation, such as the degree of behavioural response that could lead individuals to shift from paid employment with MFTC to paid employment with welfare support. The behavioural responses are uncertain. The team notes the employment impacts will be monitored following implementation. 74.4 The team notes that the options have administrative implications but there is little discussion of the impacts, for example from backdating MFTC payments. 74.5 Consultation with stakeholders – beyond government departments – has not happened due to time constraints and budget sensitivities. 75 The team recommends the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue monitor the behavioural outcomes of the changes, especially the employment outcomes. Population Implications 76 Increasing abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 will benefit approximately 82,900 low-income working individuals and families. Of these, approximately 15,500 are Mäori families who will gain an average of $17 a week, and 5,100 are Pacific families who will gain an average of $17 a week. 77 The proposed increase will improve financial incentives to work part-time, which is particularly important for some cohorts, such as sole parents and people with a health condition, injury or disability, for whom suitable work may only be part-time due to their health conditions or childcare requirements. Approximately 21,310 sole parent families are expected to gain from the proposed abatement threshold increases (including from flow-on impacts to supplementary assistance such as Accommodation Supplement) by on average $17 a week. Approximately 8,024 recipients on Jobseeker Support on the grounds of a health condition, injury or disability, Supported Living Payment and Disability Allowance are expected to gain by an average of $26 a week. 78 A small number of people (sole parents and people with a health condition, injury or disability) may be financially disadvantaged as a result of the abatement threshold increases. A Transitional Assistance Payment will protect the entitlements of these people, who would otherwise lose additional support for childcare or disability costs, for up to 12 months. 79 The partial increase to the MFTC threshold for 2021/22 is expected to benefit around 4,000 families. Approximately 400 of these will be newly eligible for the payment. The vast majority of these families are sole parents. BUDGET SENSITIVE 12 BUDGET SENSITIVE 80 Not fully aligning the MFTC threshold from 1 April 2021 could result in a small number of two-parent households being able to receive a higher income on a benefit than they could by moving off benefit at 30 hours of work. Human Rights 81 There are no human rights implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Consultation 82 The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Child Poverty Unit), The Treasury and Veterans’ Affairs New Zealand have been consulted on this paper and support the proposals in this paper. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Policy Advice Group) have also been informed of this paper. Communications 83 The Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue will develop communications strategies and work with relevant Ministers’ Offices for communicating changes to the public regarding the abatement threshold increases and MFTC adjustment. Proactive Release 84 This Cabinet paper will be proactively released, with redactions made consistent with the Official Information Act 1982.

Authorised for lodgement Hon Carmel Sepuloni Minister for Social Development and Employment Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue BUDGET SENSITIVE 17 Appendix One - options for adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2021/22 Option Impact Advantages Disadvantages Option 1: Increase the MFTC threshold to fully reflect benefit abatement changes. The MFTC threshold would increase to $32,604 p.a. (or $627 per week), which would have an ongoing fiscal cost of $12 million per annum. (Note that this increase is more than was paid out in MFTC in tax year 2020) This full alignment is a 10.8% increase ($3,172 per annum or $61 per week) from the current threshold, a large increase relative to previous annual adjustments. The MFTC threshold remains aligned with its policy intent. It is expected that approximately 4,900 families would benefit under this change, approximately 1,300 of these families would be newly eligible for the MFTC. The range over which the MFTC is available is extended, resulting in a larger range of hours worked with a 100% EMTR, further reducing incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low/minimum wage. The 1,300 newly eligible families would also experience a 100% EMTR meaning there is less incentive to increase hours of work. However, these may not have a significant impact on labour supply decisions in aggregate given that much of this group already face a 100% EMTR. Increasing the MFTC this significantly may also make future structural reform of WFF more difficult particularly if there is a desire to avoid people being financially disadvantaged. Option 2: Partially increase the MFTC threshold. The MFTC threshold would increase to $30,576 p.a. (or $588 per week), which would have an ongoing fiscal cost of $4 million per annum. This increase is $1,144 per annum ($22 per week) from the current threshold. This option is fiscally less costly than a full alignment. Sole parents would remain financially better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. Increasing the MFTC threshold by a lesser amount now may make any future structural reforms of WFF slightly less costly. It is expected that approximately 4,000 fa mi lies would benefit under this change, approximately 400 of these families would be newly eligible for the MFTC. The MFTC threshold is not fully aligned with its policy intent. This means that couples could be theoretically better off working and receiving a main benefit, however, few couples are likely to qualify for a benefit if one person is working 30 hours a week. This is due to the '30- hour rule' where a person ( or couple) are not eligible for Jobseeker Support if they are working full-time (defined as 30 hours a week). MFTC recipients gain less than how much they would gain through a full adjustment of the MFTC. The range over which the MFTC is available is extended, resulting in a larger range of hours worked with a 100% EMTR, reducing incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low/minimum wage (but not as much as a full adjustment). However, these may not have a significant impact on labour supply decisions in aggregate given that much of this group already face an 100% EMTR. Option 3: Do not The MFTC threshold would remain at $29,432 p.a. The MFTC threshold is no longer aligned with its policy intent and adjust the MFTC (or $566 per week). therefore some MFTC families may be financially better off working and threshold. This could have a net fiscal cost arising from the increase to benefit expenditure as families move on to benefit. We estimate this is likely to be small. Not increasing the MFTC threshold now may make any future structural reforms of WFF slightly less costly. This option also has the lowest fiscal cost, which would allow funding to be directed to other priorities. receiving a benefit than working and receiving the MFTC, depending on the number of hours they work. As a result, there may be a small increase in the number of families receiving a benefit and a consequential fiscal impact, but this cost would be partially offset by the reduction of MFTC (as families would no longer receive the MFTC). This change would also result in confusion of when a person would be better off working and receiving a benefit or working and receiving the MFTC. This would be very challenging for customers to understand and for staff to communicate. 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:25 Coversheet: Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Advising agencies Decision sought Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue Agreement to increase main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequentially adjust the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020121 and 2021122. Note that on 30 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to adjust the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020/21 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. However, a Regulatory Impact Assessment could not be undertaken due to time constraints. Under Cabinet's regulatory impact analysis requirements, this document is: - the Supplementary Analysis Report for the adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2020121; and - the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the abatement threshold increases and the adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit for 2021122. Proposing Ministers Minister for Social Development and Employment Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The current abatement thresholds provide limited work incentives for beneficiaries The amount that beneficiaries can earn before their benefit reduces has declined substantially over time as benefit abatement thresholds have not been increased in line with wage growth. This has reduced financial incentives to enter the labour market and to work part-time for people receiving benefits. For example, a person receiving Jobseeker Support in 1997 could work around 11.4 hours on minimum wage before their benefit abated; in 2019, this has reduced to around 4.5 hours on minimum wage. There are trade-offs in making consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Under current policy, the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) thresholds are adjusted annually to account for changes to relevant settings, such as changes to benefit rates, abatement thresholds and the minimum wage. 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Full Impact Statement Template I 1 5. The MFTC threshold for 2020/21 was not adjusted to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase made on 1 April 2020 in response to COVI D-19 due to time constraints at the time. This has resulted in the current MFTC threshold being misaligned with the current benefit rate. Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 has flow-on implications for the MFTC threshold in 2021/22 and subsequent tax years. To maintain financial incentives provided by the MFTC for families with children to enter work, the MFTC threshold for 2021/22 requires adjustments alongside abatement threshold increases under current policy. However, given the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds are significant, the adjustment required for the MFTC to align would be much higher than previous adjustments. This may exacerbate known issues with the MFTC, mainly reducing financial incentive for sole parents to work more than the minimum hours required. It may also increase the cost of options in the upcoming review of Working for Families. Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency's preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? Is the preferred approach likely to be reflected in the Cabinet paper? Abatement threshold increases will improve financial work incentives Increasing benefit abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week increases the number of hours a beneficiary can work before their benefit begins to reduce. This will improve the financial incentives to enter the labour market and work part-time for people receiving benefits. Part-time work can provide a pathw ay to full-ti me work by providing opportunities to connect with the labour market, get work experience and become familiar with the demands that can come with employment. There are different agency views on making adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Under current policy, changes to benefit settings would lead to an adjustment of the MFTC threshold to ensure the financial work incentives provided by the MFTC are maintained. However, given the extent of the recent and proposed benefit changes, full adjustment of the MFTC incurs significant fiscal costs. Additionally, a significant increase to the MFTC threshold may increase the cost of options as part of the upcoming review of Working for Families (WFF). 2020121 MFTC threshold adjustment Retrospectively adjusting the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the increases to main benefits that came into effect on 1 April 2020 means the work incentives provided by the MFTC will be maintained for t he 2020/ 21 tax year. This ensures that low-income families with children (both sole parents and two parent families) are better off in work and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving the benefit. Note that on 30 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to retrospectively increase the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to $29,432 from 1 April 2020 to reflect the increases to main benefits that came into effect on 1 April 2020 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers\]. Full Impact Statement Template I 2 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 2021122 MFTC threshold adjustment Inland Revenue (IR}, Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and the T reasury have differing views on the most appropriate options relating to the alignment of the MFTC th reshold: • MSD prefers the partial prospective alignment option. This is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. MSD considers that a partial prospective alignment maintains the work incentives MFTC provides to the majority of MFTC recipients (ie, sole parents}, but at a significantly lower fiscal cost than full alignment. MSD notes that fully aligning the MFTC th reshold may exacerbate existing MFTC issues such as high Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs)1. MSD considers partially aligning the MFTC th reshold would increase the cost of options as part of the upcoming WFF review , particularly if there is a desire to avoid people being financially disadvantaged by future changes. However, these effects will be less than under full alignment. • IR prefers the full prospective alignment option. Although the fiscal cost of full alignment is greater than under other options, IR consi ders it necessary to maintain the work incentives provided by the MFTC, ensuring low-income families w ith children (both sole parents and two parent families) are better off in work and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving the benefit. IR does not consider the potential effects of aligning the MFTC threshold on any future WFF review to be a significant enough issue to warrant reducing the work incentives currently provided by the MFTC. • In advice to Ministers, the T reasury recommended the no prospective alignment option due to the tight fiscal environment. The T reasury also did not consider that the policy decision \[to align the MFTC threshold with benefit rates\] meets the threshold to be progressed as a Budget pre-commitment. While the Treasury acknow ledged that it was likely to introduce greater compl exity for clients, the Treasury did not agree that these adverse effects were sufficient to justi fy funding the initiative ahead of the Budget process given the tight fiscal environment. - Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Monetised and non-monetised benefits Beneficiaries working part-time and non-beneficiary recipients of the Accommodation Supplement gain from abatement threshold increases The main people to gain are beneficiaries working part-time and non-beneficiary recipients of the Accommodation Supplement (these are low to middle-income working families). MSD estimates that around 82,900 individuals and families will gain an average of $18 per 1 Effective Marginal Tax Rate show s how a dollar increase in gross income translates to an increase in income in hand (after t axation and the reduction of income-tested assistance). Full Impact Statement Template I 3 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 week in extra income support payments as a result of increasing benefit abatement thresholds. Non-monetised benefits include: • Improved financial incentives to enter the labour market and work part-time for people receiving benefits • A modest reduction in the number of children in poverty (it is estimated that the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds will reduce child poverty by around 6,000 (+/-3,000) on the AHC50 fixed line measure 2 and 2,000 (+/-3,000) on the BHC50 measure 3 in 2021/22), and • Broader improvements in health and wellbeing where eligible people are engaged in work (provided the work is safe, stable and financially beneficial). MFTC recipients and newly eligible recipients will gain from the adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit Retrospective change – increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 Approximately 3,200 families receiving the MFTC in the 2020/21 tax year would gain an additional $32 for each week they received the MFTC. The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive would be $1,664 ($32 x 52 weeks). However, it is estimated that the average MFTC increase for the year would be approximately $1,280 per family. Approximately 400 additional families would become newly eligible for the MFTC in the 2020/2021 tax year as a result of the threshold increase. Because newly eligible families will have incomes above the current threshold, the average increase for these families will be less than $32 a week. A full retrospective increase will also maintain financial incentives for families to move off benefit and into work for the remainder of the 2020/21 tax year. It also addresses the potential equity issue whereby some families who remained off benefit and in work following the benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 are financially disadvantaged relative to those who are on benefit. Prospective change – partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold Approximately 4,000 families are expected to receive the MFTC in the 2021/22 tax year. Of these, around 400 families would be newly eligible to the MFTC. Families would gain an additional $22 for each week they receive the MFTC. The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive in the 2021/22 tax year would be $1,144 ($22 x 52 weeks). However, because not all families will receive the MFTC for ever week of the tax year, the average MFTC increase is estimated to be less than $1,144. 2 AHC50 measures the number of children in households with incomes much lower than a typical 2018 household, after they pay for housing costs, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 per cent of the median income in 2017/18, after housing costs are removed. 3 BHC50 is a moving-line income measure, with the poverty threshold taken the year the data is gathered (low income, before housing costs – moving-line measure). BHC50 measures the number of children in households with much lower incomes than a typical household, and is measured by the threshold line set at 50 per cent of the median household income in the year measured. Full Impact Statement Template | 4 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 A partial increase of the MFTC threshold ensures that sole parents, who make up around 90 percent of the MFTC recipients, continue to be financially better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. Where do the costs fall? Monetised and non-monetised costs; for example to local government or regulated parties Abatement threshold increases are primarily a cost to the Government The cost to the Government of increasing benefit abatement thresholds is $387.496 million in income support payments and $6.4 million in operating costs over the forecast period. There is an additional cost of $80,000 for 12 months for providing a Transitional Assistance Payment (TAP) to people who may be financially disadvantaged as a result of the abatement th reshold increases on 1 April 2021. Non-monetised costs include a small reduction in financial incentives to work full-t ime for some beneficiaries. Adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit are primarily a cost to the Government Retrospective change - increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold to reflect the $25 benefit rate increase on 1 April 2020 The cost to the Government of increasing the 2020/21 MFTC threshold is $4.6 million for the 2020/21 tax year and $24.1 million for the forecast period. Prospective change - partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold The cost to the Government of partially increasing the 2021/22 MFTC threshold is $17 million over the forecast period, assuming the retrospective increase is agreed to . The financial work incentives provided by the MFTC would be reduced for two-parent families (approximately 10 percent of MFTC re cipients) as they would theoretically be better off working and receiving a main benefit than working and receiving the MFTC. There may be a small net fiscal cost to the Government from two-pare nt families moving onto a benefit. This net fiscal cost has not been calculated due to time constraints. The behavioural impacts are uncertain. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? How significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Abatement threshold increases may financially disadvantage a small number of people but a Transitional Assistance Payment can be provided Increasin g benefit abatement thresholds will mean that a small number of people will be financially disadvantaged due to complex interactions in the income support system. TAP, a temporary non-taxable paymen t, is proposed to be available for up to 12 months for the small number of people who may be financially disadvantaged on 1 April 2021 as a result of the abatement threshold increases. Full Impact Statement Template I 5 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Retrospective and prospective adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit each have unintended impacts A retrospective increase (paid in lump sum for the portion of the year for which payments have already been made) may lead to debts being created for some people as the MFTC is chargeable income for some types of financial assistance paid under the Social Security Act 2018 (such as Temporary Additional Support). It is also assessable income for Public Housing purposes, for assessing eligibility and calculating the rate of Income Related Rent. While this does lead to debts for some clients, these debts are usually less than the value of the lump-sum payment (so clients are still better off overall) and it reflects the appropriate consi deration of these payments as income for these families. The prospective partial increase means that the MFTC would not be fully aligned with its poli cy intent and some two-parent families may be better off working and receiving a main benefit than working and receiving the MFTC. However, few coupl es are likely to qualify for a benefit if one person is working 30 hours a week as this is considered working full-time under the Social Security Act 2018 4 . Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? How confident are you of the evidence base? MSD is confident that increasing benefit abatement thresholds will directly increase incomes for beneficiaries working part-time and l ow to middle-income working families receiving the Accommodation Supplement. Holding all else equal, MSD is also confident that these increases are likely to modestly reduce child poverty. The evidence base on financial i ncentives to work (for both abatement threshold increase and MFTC) indicates that financial incentives are only one of many factors that influence people's decisions on whether to work and how much to work and they are not usually the most important facto r. However, empirical evidence suggests small but statistically significant impacts on labour market participation and intensity from changes in financial incentives to wor k, with larger impacts for some groups compared to others. 5 The modelling of the increases to benefit abatement th resholds and the MFTC assumes no behavioural i mpacts, i.e. no increases in labour market participation or hours worked, as these impacts are likely to be modest and are difficult to quantify. While increasing financial i ncentives to work part-time, the changes also reduce financial incentives to work full-time for some. Again, this impact has not been quantified. There is reasonably strong evidence that suitable work has broader positive impacts on wellbeing 6 , 4 Th is is due to the '30-hour rule', where a person (or couple) are not eligible for Jobseeker Support if t hey are working fu ll-time (defined as 30 hours a week). 5 Kost0I, A, & Mogstad, M.

To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: The reviewing agencies were: Ministry of Social Development Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue and Ministry of Social Development have reviewed the Increasing main benefit abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: It partially meets the quality criteria for the following reasons: • There has been no analysis of the behavioural impacts. This is understandable given the t i meframes and difficulties undertaking th is analysis. However, t he abatement thresholds and the MFTC are intended to encourage people to engage in work. Ideally, RIA would include an estimate of how many people w ill move into work as a result of the changes. The team notes the employment impacts will be monitored following implementation. • There is minimal discussion of alternative options to the abatement threshold increases, such as the staged increases committed to by the Government as part of Budget 2019. However, the Treasury RIA team advised MSD that a full RIA for the abatement threshold increases w as not required because the increases were a manifesto commitment. • In terms of the MFTC, the status quo is based on a long-established policy of full alignment of the MFTC with benefit changes. There are now differing views on the appropriateness of this automatic linkage when there are significant increases in benefit entitlements and the case for change does not adequately consi der the impact on the identified group of people who would be re latively worse off if the MFTC is not increased. Moreover, the analysis relies on certain assumptions about the fiscal cost, which could benefit from further explanation, such as the degree of behavioural r esponse that could lead individuals to shift from paid employment with MFTC to paid employment with welfare support. The behavioural responses are uncertai n. The team notes the employment impacts will be monitored following implementation. • We note that the options have administrative implications but there is little discussion of the impacts, for example from backdating MFTC payments.

This analysis and advice have been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to be taken by Cabinet in relation to increasing the abatement thresholds and consequential adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC). 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Limitations and constraints on the analysis in this document include: • The Labour Party committed to increasing the thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2021 in its 2020 manifesto commitment. Therefor e, other options have been ruled out, such as increasing the th resholds by a different amount, or changes to the abatement rates. ( It should be noted that abatement rate changes would also have similar trade-offs that apply, and it would be harder to communicate the changes, which means it would be harder to influence people's behaviour in the direction intended). • Other options that have been ru led out due to t ime constraints include extending a part-time abatement regime to Jobseeker Support on the grounds of a health condition, injury or disability to more closely match their work obligations . • • The modelling results for abatement threshold increases are scaled according to the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2020 recipient and expenditure forecasts. • The estimates of the impact of the newly eligible for abatement threshold increases are created based off existing work done in the Integrated Data Infrastructure ( IOI). However, there is high uncertainty around these numbers. • Impacts of abatement threshold increases on Special Needs Grants and recoverable assistance have not been modelled. It is expected that the number of these could modestly decrease, but there is a considerable amount of uncertainty. • Behavioural i mpacts (ie, increases in labour market participation or hours worked) have not been modelled as there are various factors that influence a person's work choices and they are difficult to quantify. Full Impact Statement Template I 9 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 • Analysis in this document has been carried out under tight time constraints. • No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds is a Manifesto commitment and the Government's consi deration of the proposed changes in this RIA is Budget Sensitive. 1.3 Responsible Managers: Income Support Policy Famili es and Individuals Welfare System and Income Support Poli cy Policy a nd st rategy Ministry of Social Development 3 December 2020 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Inland Revenue 3 December 2020 Full Impact Statement Template I 10 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? The welfare sys tem is structured to assist t hose most in need and encourage paid wo rk where possible New Zealand's welfare system is designed to target people who are unable to fully support themselves th rough paid wor k. Almost all income support in New Zealand is targeted on the basis of family income (and family assets), with the family defined as the nuclear family ( i.e. adults and any dependent children). Income and asset tests are determined by a combination of the abatement settings of payments (how fast they are reduced) and the rates of the benefit payments. Generally, the full rate of a payment will be available to people earning up to a certain amount (known as the abatement threshold ). Above this amount, payments reduce (abate) as people's incomes increase. The welfare overhaul invo lves a range of changes including changes to abatement thresholds and Working for Families tax credits The Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG), in its report Whakamana Tangata, proposed a comprehensive package of substantial changes to income support, while broadly maintaini ng the existing structure of income support. The WEAG package emphasised i mproving income adequacy and simplifying and rationalising the purpose of particular payments. The WEAG recommended that abatement threshol ds for main benefits be i ncreased to $150 and $250 per week. In 2019, Cabinet agreed to overhaul the wel fare system to achieve its vision for a system that ensures people have an adequate income and standard of living, are treated with respect, can live in dignity, and are able to participate meaningfully in their communities \[CAB-19-MIN-0578 refers\]. On 6 November 2019, Cabinet endorsed a high-level short, medium, and long-term work programme to achieve this vision, but did not detail w hen work would be progressed. As part of the welfare overhaul work programme, the Government also agreed to a review of Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, including the MFTC. COVID-19 has caused significant economic disruption in New Zealand COVID-19 has caused major economic disruption in New Zealand and globally. With great uncertainty in the economy and with extended border closures, unemployment is forecast to rise, peaking at 7.8 percent in the March 2022 quarter. As a result of the weaker economic outlook, beneficiary numbers are forecast to increase. In October 2020, 369,860 people were receiving a main benefit, at 11.8 percent of the estimated New Zealand working-age population. This is 69,623 more than October 2019. Of the 369,860 receiving a main benefit, 203,371 were Jobseeker Support recipients (6.5 percent of the working-age population), which is 61,241 more than October 2019. The number of people on a benefit is expected to peak in May 2021 at around 443,000, with another peak later in January 2022 reaching around 453,800. Full Impact Statement Template I 11 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 The economic impacts of COVID-19 are expected to disproportionally impact Maori, Pacific peopl e, disabled people (including people with health conditions) and sole parents, w ho are more likely to be employed in areas affected by job losses and have additional barriers to accessing em ployment. COVID-19 will certainly increase poverty and hardship rates, although it is too soon to esti mate the size of these impacts. The sudden loss of all employment income, or reduced employment income, can ti p many families into financial hardship, especially if they have limited cash or near-cash assets to maintain existing commitments (e. g. rent, mortgage and consumer debt). Government's response to COVID-19 As part of the Government's response to COVID-19, on 1 April 2020, main benefit rates increased by $25 per week. The Winter Energy Payment (WEP), which is paid from 1 May to 1 October each year, was doubled for the 2020 w inter period. Along with work to minimise hardship for families, the Government has introduced a range of initiatives aimed at boosting employment for those who have lost jobs due to COVID- 19. Labour Party's 2020 manifesto commitment The Labour Party's 2020 manifesto committed to: • increase abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 April 2021; • progressively increase the abatement threshold year on year in line with minimum wage increases; and • continue with the welfare overhaul work and to implement WEAG's recommendations to improve the welfare system. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? Benefit abatement thresholds allow people to work some hours while on benefit New Zealand's welfare system is designed to assist people who are unable to fully support themselves through paid work. Assistance is targeted through the eligibility crit eria 7 and the benefit abatement regime, w hich gradually reduces payments that people receive as their other income increases. Generally , the full rate of payment will be available to people earning up t o a certain amount; this is the abatement t hreshold. Above this amount, payments abate as people's other income increases, but payment can abate in different ways and at different rates based on the type of benefit payment. The abatement rules, along with the benefit rate, determine the benefit cut-out point, which is the amount of income at w hich a benefit is reduced to zero. The abatement threshold allows people to work for a small number of hours without having their benefit payment affected and is seen as a way to encourage labour market entry . It is also intended to recognise that there are additional costs associated with work, such as transport costs. 7 Social assistance payments are typically means-tested, and eligibility is based on family rather than individual income. Full Impact Statement Template I 12 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Currently there are two main abatement regimes within the welfare system, which seek to align the financial incentives to work with the level of labour force engagement expected of the individual: • a part-time regime has two abatement thresholds, with a relatively low abatement rate of 30 percent applied at the first threshold, and an abatement rate of 70 percent applied at the second threshold. This is designed to incentivise part-time work and applies to people receiving Sole Parent Support (SPS) and Supported Living Payment (SLP), as well as to those under 65 receiving the Veteran’s Pension (VP). The assumption is that part-time work is often the best option for recipients of these payments. • a full-time regime has a relatively high abatement rate of 70% which is designed to incentivise full-time work. This mainly applies to people on Jobseeker Support (JS)- related benefits, as well as Non-Qualifying Partners (NQP) of New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) and VP recipients. The assumption is that people receiving these benefits are able to undertake full-time work where it is available. The current abatement thresholds and rates are set out below: Abatement rate at different thresholds Current amount beneficiaries can earn per week before their benefit begins to abate JS (abatement rate of 70%) $90 NZS/VP with non-qualifying partner (abatement rate of 70%) $115 SPS, SLP and VP (under 65) – Threshold One (abatement rate of 30%) $115 SPS, SLP and VP (under 65) – Threshold Two (abatement rate of 70%) $215 Under the current settings, a JS recipient would have their benefit reduce by 70 cents for every dollar earned over $90. For a SPS recipient, their benefit would reduce by 30 cents for every dollar earned over $115, and by 70 cents for every dollar earned over $215. The Minimum Family Tax Credit incentivises families with children to move off benefit and into greater amounts of work The MFTC is one of the WFF tax credits. The MFTC aims to incentivise families with children (in particular, sole parents) to move off benefit and into greater amounts of paid work 8 by ensuring people who move from working and receiving a main benefit into working and receiving the MFTC are not financially worse off from doing so. This is done by “topping-up” families’ earned income to a prescribed level (the MFTC threshold) that means they are financially better off by working a greater amount and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. This effectively creates a guaranteed income for families, above what they would receive if they were on a benefit. Around 90 percent of MFTC recipients are sole parent families. 8 Families with children qualify for the MFTC when they work 20 hours of more per week for sole parents, and 30 hours or more for couples. Full Impact Statement Template | 13 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 The MFTC abates at 100 percent for every dollar earned over the MFTC threshold. This means that for every dollar a family earns over the prescribed amount, their MFTC entitlement reduces by one dollar. The MFTC threshold, as at 30 November 2020, is $27,768 per year (after tax). This is $534 per week. Approximately 3,800 families were paid nearly $12 million in the 2020/21 tax year. The average MFTC payment amount was $3,100 per family. IR forecasts that 9 there will be a decrease to approximately 3,200 families in the 2021/22 tax year. As part of the introduction of WFF, on 26 April 2004, Cabinet agreed to increase the MFTC on 1 April each year by an amount sufficient to ensure that couples do not suffer a reduction in income when moving off benefit into 30 hours of paid work a week, from 1 April 2006 onwards \[CAB Min (04) 13/4 refers\]. Consequently, the MFTC threshold has been increased each year since 2006 to reflect the latest changes to relevant settings (such as benefit rates, the minimum wage and abatement thresholds). The MFTC threshold is set by calculating the total income a two-parent family could receive if they were working less than 30 hours and receiving an abated main benefit (the couple rate for Jobseeker Support) and the Winter Energy Payment. This amount is then increased by $1 and rounded up to the next multiple of $52 (as expressed for the weeks in the year). Sole parents face the same MFTC threshold as two-parent families. As the sole parent benefit is lower than the couple rate of Jobseeker Support, this means that sole parents gain significantly more than two-parent families by moving onto the MFTC. Roles of government agencies The Ministry of Social Development administers and provides information on financial assistance, employment and housing. MSD’s role includes paying financial assistance, providing support for getting people into and maintaining employment and housing. Inland Revenue administers New Zealand’s tax system, collecting Crown revenue, as well as collecting and distributing social support programme payments, such as WFF tax credits. 9 Some reasons for the decrease in tax year 2021 could be due to the impacts of Covid-19 on employment, or the increase in main benefit payments and temporary doubling of the Winter Energy Payment from 1 April 2020. The latter changes have made the financial incentives to stay on benefit higher. Full Impact Statement Template | 14 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Abatement thresholds have become out of line with their original settings and offer little financial incentive to enter the labour market or work part-time Abatement thresholds are increased through one-off changes, rather than being adjusted annuall y. On 1 April 2020, the abatement thresholds were adjusted through funding secured through Budget 2019. This funding committed to progressive ly increase the abatement thresholds for main benefits over four years (until 2023, as set out in the below table) in li ne wi th mini mum wage increases \[CAB-19-MIN-0174.36 refers\]. The adjustment aimed to ensure that the number of hours a beneficiary could work on mini mum wage before abatement began would not reduce any further. Abatement threshold for: Prior to 1 April 1 April 1 April 1 April April 2020 2020 2021 2022 2023 Jobseeker Support $80 $90 $95 $100 $105 NZSN P non-qualifying partner $100 $115 $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP - Threshold One $100 $115 $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP - Threshold Two $200 $215 $220 $225 $230 However, prior to the April 2020 adjustment, the last adjustment to main benefit abatement settings occurred in September 2010, when changes were made for recipients of (what was then know n as) Domestic Purposes Benefit, Invalid's Benefit, Widow's Benefit as well as for VP (under 65), and NZS and VP wi th non-qualifying partners. For the full-time abatement regime f or JS, the threshold had remained at $80 since it was last adjusted in 1996. This has meant that the amount that people cou ld earn before their benefit abated has declined in real terms over time as wages have increased, particu larly for JS recipients. For example, a person receivi ng JS in 1997 could work approximately 11.4 hours on mi ni mum wage ($7.00 per hour) before their benefit abated. In 2019, a person receivi ng JS coul d onl y work for approximately 4.5 hours on mini mum wage ($17.70 per hour) before their benefit abated. The current settings, despite the adjustments made in April 2020 and subsequent increases set through till 2023, have moved out of line with the original abatement settings and now o ffer little financial incentive for people to engage in paid work while receivi ng a main benefit. The MFTC was not adjusted following COVID-19 related benefit increases On 1 April 2020, as part of the previous Government's response to COVID-19, main benefit rates were increased by $25 per week. The Winter Energy Payment was also temporarily doubled fo r the 2020 winter period. Under normal circumstances, a consequential increase in the MFTC threshold would like ly have been made at the same time. However, the urgent pace at which these benefit changes occurred meant that no decision to change the MFTC threshold was made. This has resulted in the current MFTC threshold being misaligned wi th the current benefit rate. Under current policy, the MFTC threshold should be increased to account for the increase in benefit rates. Full Impact Statement Template I 15 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Proposed increases to the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 will also require an increase to the MFTC threshold under current policy Increasing the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 (as per the Labour Party’s 2020 manifesto commitment) has flow-on implications for the MFTC threshold. Under current policy, a consequential increase to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold would be made to reflect the changes to the abatement thresholds. If the MFTC threshold does not maintain alignment with the benefit abatement thresholds, this will be inconsistent with the policy intent of the MFTC, that is, to provide a financial incentive to work a greater amount and move off benefit and on to the MFTC. The greater the misalignment of the MFTC threshold and benefits, and the longer the misalignment continues, the greater the impact on the incentives for low income families with children to leave the benefit and work a greater amount and receive the MFTC. There is also a potential equity issue in that not fully aligning the MFTC threshold financially disadvantages those families who remain off benefit (relative to those who are on benefit). If benefit settings are intended to reflect a minimum level of income for beneficiaries, then implicitly, the guaranteed minimum income provided to working and off-benefit families (via the MFTC) should be at least the same. The MFTC provides little to no incentive for sole parents to work more than 20 hours a week while receiving the MFTC The proposed increases to the abatement thresholds on 1 April 2021 are significant, which would require the 2021/22 MFTC threshold adjustment to be much greater than its previous adjustments. This may further exacerbate known issues with the MFTC, mainly that the MFTC provides little to no financial incentive for sole parents to work more than the minimum required hours (20 hours a week) while receiving the MFTC. This is because income earned over the MFTC threshold would reduce the MFTC payment dollar for dollar. This is known as a 100 percent effective marginal tax rate (EMTR); high EMTRs indicate low financial incentives to work. A significant adjustment to the MFTC threshold would further reward working the minimum number of hours required for the MFTC at the expense of working more than this. This is because the adjustment would mean the income range over which the MFTC is available would be extended, resulting in a larger range of hours worked with a 100 percent EMTR and further reduction in incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low/minimum wage. For example: • Fully adjusting the MFTC increases the gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving the benefit to working and receiving the MFTC to around $125 a week; but reduces the gain from increasing work hours from 20 to 40 hours a week to around $20 a week. 10 • Partially adjusting the MFTC increases the gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving the benefit to working and receiving the MFTC 10 This calculation is for a sole-parent family with two children (aged 3 and 5) earning the minimum wage ($20 per hour) when working, living in Auckland, paying lower quartile rent and receiving the Accommodation Supplement, Temporary Additional Support and relevant tax credits. It does not take into account childcare costs. Full Impact Statement Template | 16 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 to around $85 a week; but reduces the gain from increasing work hours from 20 to 40 hours a week to around $60 a week. 11 While working 20 hours a week may be desirable for many sole parents due to their caregiving responsibilities and financial incentives being just one of the reasons for labour supply decisions, disincentivising sole parents from working more than 20 hours per week (or taking up higher wage work) may impact on their longer-term labour market trajectories and lifetime earnings. It is important to note that there is also robust evidence to show that the gap between “in work” income and “out of work” income is a stronger driver of behaviour than the incentive to increase work by an additional hour. A significant adjustment in the MFTC would result in a larger gap between “in work” income and “out of work” income (at 20 hours for sole parents and 30 hours for couples) and would potentially provide a stronger financial incentive to go from not working to working the minimum number of hours for the MFTC than partial or no adjustment options. There is an upcoming review of Working for Families, which includes the MFTC This means that any significant adjustments to the current MFTC threshold would likely increase the cost of options for reform. This is largely due to: A 2021, for planned is WFFof review s 9(2)(f)(iv) • the significant gain that sole parents receive by moving from working and receiving a benefit to working and receiving the MFTC – currently around $60 a week (for no extra hours of work) • the likely need to ensure that options for reform do not financially disadvantage low-income working sole parents, as this would be likely to be seen as contrary to the Government’s vision for the welfare system, particularly given its focus on improving income adequacy and reducing child poverty. any significant adjustment to the MFTC threshold would s 9(2)(f)(iv) increase the gain that sole parents currently receive by moving onto the MFTC s 9(2)(f)(iv) 11 As above. 12 Earning minimum wage and therefore, eligible for the maximum amount of the MFTC.

No explicit consultation on these changes beyond Government agencies has taken place No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as the proposed increases to the abatement thresholds is a Manifesto commitment and the Government's consideration of the proposed changes in this RIA is Budget Sensitive. MSD, IR and the Treasury's views on the adjustments to the MFTC thresholds are set out in Section 5. 1. However, the Welfare Expert Advisory Group informed our analysis The proposed approach for abatement threshold changes has been informed by the findings of the WEAG, which in turn was informed by the views of stakeholders and those w ho took part in the engagement process. The WEAG conducted wi de consultation with a variety of groups across New Zealand. This included face to face meetings with more than 1,300 individuals and organisations (such as people receiving welfare payments, employers, service providers, advocates, and community workers ), 1,348 written submissions, and addit ional submissions through online engagement. In February 2019, the WEAG published its report Whakamana Tangata, which noted that the income support system needs to encourage the outcomes of good and appropriate work by ensuring people are financially better off in paid work. One element of making work pay is ensuring that abatement settings are reasonable, especially at the point when people are entering work. The WEAG recommended that the abatement threshol ds for main benefits be increased to $150 and $250 per week. The WEAG also recommended substantial changes to WFF and other tax credits to i mprove the adequacy of incomes and returns from paid work for families with children. This included a recommendation to replace the MFTC, In-Work Tax Credit and Independent Earner Tax Credit with a new Earned Income Tax Credi t. 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? Three primary obj ectives to consi der are: • Improve income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people • Improve financial i ncentives to work • Pay welfare support at a sustainable cost to government These obj ectives should be considered within the overarching government commitment to overhaul the welfare system, in line with the WEAG's recommendations. Improving income adequacy for beneficiaries and low-income people Any changes proposed in this RIA should seek to improve income adequacy for l ow-income peopl e. While the recent changes to the welfare system (including the Families Package, the $25 increase to main benefits on 1 April 2020 and the indexation of main benefits to average wage) will help to improve living standards of low-income people, income Full Impact Statement Template I 18 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 adequacy issues are likely to remain for many low-income people. The changes proposed in this RIA should ensure people can receive increased incomes through undertaking paid employment, and keep more of their earnings. Improving financial incentives to work Improving financial incentives to work is one component of encouraging people who are able to work to seek employment, alongside other interventions such as active labour market policies. For the majority of people, paid work is a key means of achieving improved wellbeing. For this reason, most income support systems typically aim to ensure that people are financially incentivised to work where this is a possibility. However, financial incentives are only one of many factors that influence people’s decisions on whether to work and how much to work and they are not usually the most important factor. Additionally, different amounts of work may be appropriate for different people given their circumstances. While the changes proposed in this RIA seek to improve incentives to enter the labour market and to work part-time, the changes also slightly reduce the incentives to work full- time. Paying welfare at a cost that is sustainable to government The Government is required to act and pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the principles of responsible fiscal management as set out in the Public Finance Act 1989, such as managing fiscal risks facing the government, having regard for the impact on present and future generations, and ensuring the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently. Any changes proposed in this RIA must be at a sustainable cost to government, particularly given the current tight fiscal environment following the range of initiatives implemented by the Government in response to COVID-19. There are significant trade-offs between these three objectives There are significant trade-offs between these three objectives. It is generally possible to achieve two of the three objectives for any given policy change, but not all three. These three objectives are all important, and any policy will need to balance the trade-offs between these objectives. Full Impact Statement Template | 19 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Section 3: Option identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? There are two options for abatement threshold increases Option One - Increase the abatement thresholds to $160 and $250 per week on 1 Apri l 2021 This opti on proposes to increase abatement th resholds to $160 and $250 per week from 1 Apri l 2020, as specified in the Labour Party Manifesto 2020. The proposed increases are set out below : Abatement threshold for: 1 April 2021 Jobseeker Support $160 NZSN P w ith non-qualifying partner $160 SPS and SLP - Threshold One $160 SPS and SLP - Threshold Two $250 Under this option, beneficiaries will be able to work up to eight hours on minimum wage (based on minimum wage increasing to $ 20 per hour on 1 April 2021) before their benefit begins to abate. F or recipients of SPS, SLP and VP (under 65), they can work up to 12.5 hours before their benefit begins to abate at the higher r ate (Threshold Two ). This would have a fi scal cost to t he Government of $387.496 million in income support payments and $6.4 million in operating costs over the forecast period. Option Two - Status guo This option proposes not to increase abatement th resholds on 1 Apri l 2021, other t han t he adjustments that have been set to occur for 2021, 2022 and 2023 through f unding secured th rough Budget 2019. This means for the next t hree years, the abatement th resholds would be ad justed as follows: Abatement threshold for: 1 April 1 April 1 April 2021 2022 2023 Jobseeker Support $95 $100 $105 NZSN P w ith non-qualifying partner $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP - Threshold One $120 $125 $130 SPS and SLP - Threshold Two $220 $225 $230 Under this option, the number of hours beneficiaries can curr ently work up to before their benefit begins to abate (around 4 .5 hours on minimum wage) will be maintained (not reduce any further) over t he next th r ee years. There are two options for retrospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold There are two options to consider for retrospective adjustment to the 2020/2 1 MFTC th reshold: • Option One (stat us quo) - full retrospect ive alignment of the 2020/ 21 MFTC th reshold.

This is the status quo, as under current policy, the MFTC threshold would be adjusted in line with changes to benefit rates and abatement threshold. • Option Two - partial alignment of the 2021/22 MFTC th reshold. • Option Three - no adjustment to the MFTC th reshold. 13 The maximum MFTC increase a family could receive would be $ 1,664 ($32 x 52 weeks).

The gain would be less for f amili es who do not receive the MFTC for the full year. 15 As above Full Impact Statement Template I 22 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? Full assessment of impacts was not completed for abatement threshold increases As the Labour Party has committed to increasing the abatement thresholds as per Option One, MSD has not undertaken a full assessment of the likely impacts of the options in this RIA. Criteria for evaluating options for adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Both the retrospective and prospective alignment options have been evaluated against the following criteria: • Work incentives -the option should ensure the MFTC continues to fulfil i ts poli cy objective to financially incentivise low-income families with children to move from working and receiving a benefit to working and receiving the MFTC. • Equity -the option should not financially disadvantage those families receiving the MFTC (ie, in full-time work and off benefit) compared with families w ho are on benefit. • Future reform -the option should not significantly limit choices for future reform of the MFTC and WFF scheme generally. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? As the Labour Party has committed to increasing the abatement thresholds as per Option One, MSD has not considered any other options for change, such as increasing the abatement threshol ds by different amounts, or changing the abatement rate. Note that changing the abatement rate may be more difficult to influence people's decision to work as it can be harder for people to understand how the changes in the abatement rates affect their payments. Other options ruled out include possible abatement se tting changes for clients on Jobseeker Support on the ground of a health condition, injury or disability (JS-HCD). JS- HCD is available for people assessed as being temporarily unable to work, or able to work only part-time. Therefore, JS-HCD recipients have either part-time or deferred work obligations. However, JS-HCD r ecipients face the same high abatement rate of 70 percent as other JS clients, aimed at incentivising full -time work, w hich means current settings may not adequately support JS-HCD recipients to engage in part-time work. Changing the abatement settings for JS-HCD recipients to better support part-time work was ruled out due to time constraints. Further work is required to design and implement any changes in this space to ensure positive outcomes for JS-HCD recipients.

However, any increase delivered by a lump sum at t he end of t he tax year (to cover April to December 2020) cannot incentivise families to move o ff benefit after t he fact. + Fully aligning the threshold will mean MFTC recipients would be not be di sadvantaged compared to working families receiving a benefit. Given the income assistance provided to those on benefit was increased on 1 April 2020 and the MFTC is set r elative to the amount of income a beneficiary can receive, MFTC recipients should also be compensated for t he increase in assistance to beneficiaries. Increas ing the MFTC threshold may make future WFF reform more complex and costly, partic ularly if t here is a desire to avoid people be ing financially disadvantaged. 0 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Option Two -No retrospective alignment of the 2020/21 MFTC threshold The MFTC threshold would not have met its policy intent of making low-income families bett er off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit.

It would be for a slightly smaller group than Option One as only sole parents (who account for approximately 90% of MFTC recipients) would be better off on the MFTC. This would also extend the range of income over which families receive the MFTC, thereby reducing the financial incentive for those families to work more ho urs than the minimum required for the M FTC or earn more income. However, this would be less than Option One. + Sole parents, who account for approximately 90% of M FTC recipients, would remain better off on the M FTC.

Full Impact Statement Template I 26 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Option One is the preferred option for abatement threshold increases The proposed option for abatement threshold increase is Option One as it means the th resholds will better align with the original abatement settings (as well as WEAG's recommendation), which enabled benefici aries to work for longer hours before abatement occurred. This option will all ow working beneficiaries to keep a greater proportion of their earnings before their benefit is affected, thereby improving income adequacy and financial incentives to work part-time while on a benefit. This option may reduce the financial i ncentive for beneficiaries working part time to move into full t i me work. However, better incentivising beneficiaries to enter the labour market and maintain work, even if part-ti me wor k, is important. This is particularly so for those already disadvantaged in the labour market prior to COVID-19, such as sole parents and people w ith health conditions, injury or disability, for whom suitable work may only be part- time work. Paid work can not only lift incomes and living standards, it can also enable people to experience better self-assessed health, life satisfaction and social connectedness. Part- ti me work can also provide a pathway to full-ti me work by providing opportunities to connect with the labour market, gain work experience and become familiar with the demands that can come with employment. Also, given the economic impacts of COVID-19 and many people facing reduced hours, this option ensures that those on l ow incomes with reduced hours can access financial assistance while still being attached to their job. No consultation (beyond other Government agencies) has taken place as this change is a Manifesto commitment (and the Government's consideration of it is Budget Sensitive). Option One is the preferred option by IR for restrospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Option One is the preferred option by IR, and is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. MSD does not have a preferred option. Note that Cabinet agreed to adjust the 2020/21 MFTC threshold as per Option One on 30 November 2020 \[CAB-20-MIN-0490\]. This option means the financial incentive provided by the MFTC for families w ith children to move off benefit and into greater amounts of work would be maintained for the remainder of the 2020/21 tax year. While the increase cannot incentivise families w ith children to move off benefit for the period of the 2020/21 tax year that has already passed (April to December 2020), it addresses the potential equi ty issues, whereby those families who remained off benefit and in work during April to December 2020 are financially disadvantaged relative to those who were on benefit. MSD and IR have different preferred options for prospectively adjusting the Minimum Family Tax Credit Option Two is the preferred option by MSD, and is the proposed option in the Cabinet paper. Full Impact Statement Template I 27 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 This option ensures that around 90% of MFTC recipients (ie, sole parents) would remain better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receivi ng a benefit. While a partial increase would extend the income range over which the MFTC is availab le, resulting in reduced financial incentives to work greater hours for sole parents on low-incomes, the impact would be smaller than Option One. MSD considers fully aligning the MFTC threshold wou ld increase the cost and complexity of any future WFF review particularly if there is a desire to avoid people be ing financially disadvantaged. However, these effects will be less under Option One than Option Two. IR's preferred option is Option One. While the fiscal cost of full alignment are greater than under other options, this option maintains the work incentives provided by the MFTC by ensuring low-income families with children (both sole parents and two-parent families) are better off working and receiving the MFTC than working and receiving a benefit. IR does not consider the potential effects of aligning the MFTC threshold on any future WFF review to be a significant enough issue to warrant removing the work incentives currently provided by the MFTC. IR considers that there is a potential equity issue if the MFTC threshold is not fully aligned. Less than full alignment potentially disadvantages those fami lies who remain in work and off benefit, re lative to those in work and receiving a benefit. If benefit settings are intended to reflect a minimum level of income for beneficiaries, then implicitly, the guaranteed minimum income provided to working and off-benefit families (via the MFTC) should be at least the same. In advice to Ministers, the Treasury recommended the no prospective alignment option due to the tight fiscal environment. The Treasury also did not consider that the policy decision \[to align the MFTC thres hold with benefit rates\] meets the threshold to be progressed as a Budget pre-commitment. While the Treasury acknowledged that it was likely to introduce greater complexity for clients, the Treasury did not agree that these adverse effects were sufficient to justify funding the initiative ahead of the Budget process given the tight fiscal 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg, ongoing, one-off), evidence a nd assumption (eg, compliance rates), risks Abatement threshold increases Impact $m present value where appropriate, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach compared to taking no action Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Monetised cost Increase in Benefit or Related $387.496 million High to Crown Expenses from increasing over five years.

Better incentivising beneficiaries to engage in work th rough abatement th reshold i ncreases could also lead to positive impact on broader wellbeing, as being in suitable work is good for people's health and wellbeing (provided the work is safe , stable, suits people's circumstances and financially beneficial). The expected benefits described in section 5.2 will depend on the interaction be tween different assistance types, the extent to w hich people undertake further work and the subsequent impact on their earned incomes. Also, there is a risk that the gains will be lost over time if abatement thresholds do not increase in future years. Full Impact Statement Template I 35 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The Manifesto commitment specified an implementation date of 1 April 2021 for abatement th reshold increases. Legislative vehicle Changes to abatement th resholds require an Order in Council and regulation amendment. Abatement threshol ds for main benefits and New Zealand Superannuation Non-Qualifying Partner are set out in Schedule 2 of the Social Security Act 2018. An Order in Council under section 452(2 )(c) of the Social Security Act 2018 is required to make the abatement th reshold increases for main benefits and NZS for April 2021. Abatement threshol ds for Veteran's Pension Non-Qualifying Partner and Veteran's Pension (under 65) are set out separately in regulation 42A of the Veterans' Support Regulations 2014, which will also require amendment. Changes to the MFTC threshold can be made by an Order in Council as set out in sections ME 1 (4 ) and MF 7(1 )(d ) of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, an Order in Council is required by 1 December for changes to apply from 1 April the following year. Therefore, adjustments to the 2020/ 21 and 2021/22 MFTC thresholds would need to be made via amendments to the Income Tax 2007. Communication A communications plan will be developed to ensure the changes are communicated to staff and the public in advance of implementation. Transitional arrangements A Transitional Assistance Payment (TAP), which is a temporary non-taxable payment, could be considered for the small number of people (around 79 people) who may be financially disadvantaged by the proposed abatement threshold increases on 1 April 2021. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? Minimal implementation risks with the abatement threshold increases Implementation ris ks for abatement thresholds are minimal. The changes will use existing administrative structures and will not require any new service design. There is a potential for public confusion around the proposed increases, as this proposal overrides the four-year adjustments to the abatement thresholds secured through Budget 2019. A communications plan will be developed to ensure sufficient information is provided to both staff and the public through various platforms, including MSD's website. Some implementation risks with the adjustments to Minimum Family Tax Credit A partial increase to the 2021/22 MFTC threshold may cause confusion with some people as to which option they would be better off under. Some two-parent families may be better off working and receiving benefit than working and receiving the MFTC, but for one reason Full Impact Statement Template I 36 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 or another remain on the MFTC and receive less than what they may be entitled to. Material will be developed to ensure sufficient information about the MFTC adjustments are available to both staff and the public through various platforms, including IR’s website. Full Impact Statement Template | 37 72vh7ewzmz 2020-12-11 08:24:57 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7 .1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Behavioural changes arising from abatement threshold increases can be monitored using administrative data MSD w ill be able to use administrative data to monitor the trends in declared income before and after changes to abatement th resholds, in cluding the trends for different subgroups (eg, Maori, Pacific people, sole parents, people with a health condit ion or disability). An expected trend follow ing the abatement th reshold changes would be an increase in the level of income that clients declare to MSD, as a result of clients taking up extra work in response to the changes. There may also be a signalling effect (ie , changed behaviour) ahead of the changes. Behavioural changes arising from adjustments to the Minimum Family Tax Credit can be monitored using administrative data The effects of the MFTC threshold alignments can be monitored using data IR currently collects as part of administ ering the MFTC. This includes the number of MFTC re cipients, the nature of those families, the amount of MFTC payments made, and MFTC recipient movement be tween the MFTC and the benefit. This administrative data will show what effect the MFTC alignment changes have on the up take of the credit, and the actual fiscal cost to the Government of the chosen settings. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? As part of the Welfare Overhaul work programme, MSD is working on developing a measure of a client's total in come, and regularly reporting on this measure. Progression of this work w ill allow for reporting on this measure past 2021. The measure will allow MSD to analyse the longer term imp act of this policy on client outcomes. In December 2020, officials intend to provide advice to joint Ministers on a potential scope for a work programme to review WFF, which includes the MFTC. The WFF revi ew is part of the broader welfare overhaul work programme and is expected to take at l east 12 months. Any changes to WFF th rough legislative amendment would take even longer to im plement. It is noted that, subj ect to any change in Government policy on the alignment of the MFTC threshold to future changes to benefit r ates or abatement settings, further reviews of the MFTC threshold w ill be required annually.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister for Social Development and Employment Office of the Minister of Revenue Office of the Minister for Small Business Chair, Cabinet Economic response to future resurgences of COVID-19 Proposal 1 This paper seeks agreement to a sustainable and proportionate economic support package for use in the event of further resurgences of COVID-19 in the community. Relation to government priorities 2 This proposal supports the Government’s first overarching objective to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19, including by protecting jobs and livelihoods, and strengthening the economy. It does so by ensuring a package of financial support is in place for businesses and individuals in the event of Alert Level escalations following future resurgences of COVID-19 in the community, with the aim of limiting the economic and social impacts if outbreaks occur. It also seeks to reduce the risk of resurgences by supporting workers to stay home when sick. These goals are complementary, as protecting New Zealanders from the virus will also support economic activity resuming quickly after any outbreaks. Executive Summary 3 In the event of Alert Level escalations, a sustainable and proportionate package of economic support is needed to minimise the impact of public health restrictions on employment and incomes, deliver more equitable outcomes in the face of very short and severe economic shocks, and help to maintain social license and encourage compliance with the public health response. In turn, that enables economic activity to resume quickly after any outbreaks of the virus, allowing the economy to take advantage of the economic benefits of no or low community transmission. 4 Our economic response to the initial national lockdown and the subsequent outbreak in Auckland achieved these aims. We have also heard consistent feedback from business that certainty about the support measures that will apply in future Alert Level escalations is critical for ongoing investment and hiring activity. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 1 5 This paper proposes a package of measures that develops and improves our previous response, building on our experience to date and feedback from business, and recognising the added stress to firms and individuals as uncertainty around the trajectory of the virus continues. Key components of the package are: 5.1 a new one-off Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) to help firms who are directly impacted by an Alert Level change to cover their fixed costs (such as rent) when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above; 5.2 an improved Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) at Alert Level 3 and above; and 5.3 additional measures at Alert Level 4 on childcare and residential tenancies, with further work on commercial tenancies. 6 The elements of the package have been designed to complement each other, with existing measures to support employment and wages buttressed by a new measure to help firms in any escalation from Alert Level 1. In designing the package we have attempted to strengthen the targeting and integrity of measures, while ensuring that there is timely and adequate support. 7 The proposed package is intended to promote confidence, employment, and a rapid return to activity following the end of Alert Level increases by providing the most affected firms with increasing levels of support as the severity and impact of public health restrictions rise. 8 The approach aims to be proportionate to the impacts. In the event of an escalation from Alert Level 1, businesses would be able to apply for a comparatively modest one-off payment under the RSP, providing cash flow to cover their costs. Businesses that require additional cash flow support could access the extended Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) or seek lending from their banks (including through the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme). 9 In any future escalation to Alert Level 3 or above, the most affected firms could also seek the WSS to help them keep their employees. Other supports on childcare and residential tenancies will also assist firms and households in an escalation to Level 4. 10 While the package is designed to be ready in the event of Alert Level escalations, the strongest way to support businesses and individuals is to sustain our public health response so that escalation is a last resort and economic activity is maximised. 11 Alongside the proposed resurgence measures, we therefore recommend complementing the Leave Support Scheme with a new Short-Term Absence Payment at all Alert Levels, to address an existing gap in coverage by facilitating workers who are awaiting test results to stay home and self-isolate. This aims to support compliance with the public health guidance, reducing the risk of resurgences and prolonged escalations. 12 The package of measures proposed here is designed to mitigate the direct economic costs of Alert Level escalations by protecting jobs and incomes. However, we recognise that outbreaks have multi-faceted impacts on individuals, particularly on the most vulnerable or at-risk groups. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 2 13 In the previous term, the Government introduced a significant number of schemes, funded through the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRFF) to address those impacts. But we will need to continue to review the integrity of that safety net to ensure it remains fit for purpose, particularly given the recent expiry of the COVID-19 Income Relief Payment (CIRP). 14 The existing economic supports and proposed new measures are outlined here: 15 The full resurgence package and new Short-Term Absence Payment will be ready to implement early next year, subject to legislation. To ensure that we are prepared for a resurgence in the meantime, we propose that the existing Wage Subsidy Scheme be reinstated in the event of a reescalation to Alert Level 3 or 4, using similar settings as the August resurgence. 16 Communicating the resurgence measures in advance of further outbreaks will provide greater certainty to businesses and individuals about the Government’s economic response. While businesses will still face uncertainty over the number of outbreaks, they will be able to better plan and make investment and hiring decisions, knowing what support they will receive should an Alert Level escalation occur. 17 It is therefore proposed that the Minister of Finance announces the package, including the timeline for implementation and the interim approach, prior to Christmas. 18 The package of resurgence measures would cost around $920 million in response to an Auckland-equivalent resurgence. While a significant sum, it reflects the scale of the economic impact of higher Alert Levels. Temporary and time-limited measures are critical to limit ongoing economic damage from the impacts of escalations. There is a sufficient balance in the CRRF to fund the proposed package through multiple resurgence events. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 3 Background 19 The Government’s COVID-19 elimination strategy allows us to take advantage of the opportunities of protracted periods of minimal community transmission. Where necessary, periods of higher restrictions are required to stamp out the virus. Our economic strategy complements this, by continuing to support people, businesses and jobs and keeping the recovery moving. 20 Key to these objectives is a sustainable and proportionate economic response to potential resurgences of the virus. 21 Our economic response to Alert Level escalations so far has comprised support for jobs, firms’ non-wage costs through the SBCS, and support for vulnerable populations. The response has been successful and well-received, but there is scope to further improve aspects of its effectiveness and integrity. 22 At the time of the August outbreak, the Government commissioned further work on more sustainable arrangements for financial support in the event of future restrictions \[CAB- 20-MIN-0402 refers\]. Since then, we have heard consistent feedback from business that certainty about the support that will be available at higher Alert Levels is critical for ongoing business and hiring activity. 23 Having considered officials’ advice and listened to feedback from business, we now propose the Government announces a package of measures that develops and improves the existing model by: 23.1 making a clearer link between the period and level of support and the period and severity of restrictions; 23.2 improving the clarity and integrity of the measures, to ensure support goes to firms and individuals in need; and 23.3 providing a sustainable solution to supporting firms’ fixed and transition costs beyond the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS). 24 The package maintains the same objectives as the existing model: protecting jobs and incomes, limiting economic damage by enabling a swift resumption of economic activity, and supporting social licence for the public health response and compliance with restrictions. Its core components are: 24.1 a new Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) to support firms’ fixed costs when they are directly impacted by the transition from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above; 24.2 an improved Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) at Alert Level 3 and above; and 24.3 additional measures at Alert Level 4 on childcare and residential tenancies, with further work on commercial tenancies. 25 While this package is designed to be ready in the event of an Alert Level escalation, the strongest way to support business and individuals is to sustain a strong public health response so that escalation is a last resort and economic activity is maximised. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 4 26 The package will therefore be complemented by a new Short-Term Absence Payment available at all Alert Levels to facilitate workers to stay home and self-isolate while they are awaiting COVID-19 test results. Introducing a new Resurgence Support Payment at Alert Level 2 and above 27 We propose Cabinet agrees to establish a new one-off Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) scheme administered by Inland Revenue. This would help firms who are directly impacted by an Alert Level change to cover their fixed costs (such as rent) when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2. 28 The RSP would complement other elements of our economic response to resurgences by providing a relatively modest grant to help with fixed costs such as rent, particularly at Alert Level 2, where the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) is unavailable. It would be paid as a grant because many small firms are not in a position to take on additional debt. 29 A one-off grant soon after an escalation from Alert Level 1 would help offset businesses’ increased costs at the outset of public health restrictions being imposed. The payment would provide cashflow support at the most critical moment, when uncertainty is likely to be highest and businesses have had the least opportunity to adapt to the restrictions. 30 This payment will support businesses who are directly impacted by the escalation in Alert Levels. For example, when the country moves from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2, hospitality and related businesses have to make significant changes to their operations and face significantly reduced revenue. 31 At a macroeconomic level, the RSP can also help ensure that fiscal policy provides sufficient total support to the economy. A broad-based payment of this kind can compensate for lost revenue and output more effectively than conventional fiscal stimulus measures (such as direct subsidies to support consumer activity) during periods when the economy remains constrained by public health restrictions. 32 Agreement to the design parameters specified below is sought from Cabinet, to enable further work to be completed on the implementation of the scheme. We propose that the broad outline of the scheme be announced prior to Christmas, including the rate of payment, eligibility threshold, activation triggers, key declaration requirements, role of Inland Revenue, and relationship to other support schemes. Objectives of the Resurgence Support Payment 33 The purpose of the RSP is to provide support for businesses’ fixed costs (such as rent) when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above. We propose the objectives of the scheme are as follows: 33.1 Support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; 33.2 Support firms to pay fixed costs if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; 33.3 Share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels between Government, firms and across economic sectors; and 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 5 33.4 Encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy. 34 The RSP assists firms with fixed costs when there has been a significant reduction in revenue. This complements the WSS support for short-term labour market attachment by providing cashflow support in a broad-based manner to firms impacted by public health restrictions. Firms will be required to use funds for business expenses, such as wages, capital expenditure and core operating expenses. One payment limited to the initial escalation in Alert Levels 35 We propose that the scheme be limited to a one-off payment at an initial escalation from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above. We do not propose activating the scheme each time there is a change to a lower or higher Alert Level during a resurgence event. Payment would be restricted to this format to reflect that for many firms the impact of an escalation from Level 1 is most acute at the outset, and that transitional costs are greater in respect of an increase than a decrease in Alert Levels. A one-off payment also reduces the fiscal risk of multiple payments in quick succession in the event of rapid changes in Alert Levels. Scheme activated after seven days 36 We recommend Cabinet agrees to establish a minimum period of seven consecutive days that must elapse at Alert Level 2 or above before the scheme comes into effect, of which the seventh day may be a partial day. A minimum period is desirable before the RSP becomes available, as it is reasonable to expect that businesses can absorb the cost of a very short escalation in Alert Levels. 37 Firms would not begin submitting applications until 14 days after an escalation, as they would be required to declare they have experienced an actual decline in revenue over a 14-day period. If an escalation to Alert Level 2 or above occurs for seven or more days (activating the scheme) but fewer than 14 days (the period to demonstrate a decline in revenue), firms would still be eligible to apply if they experienced a decline in revenue of at least 30%. National availability 38 The RSP will be available on a national level by default, even in the case of regionally elevated Alert Levels. This reflects the nationwide supply chain impacts a regional escalation can have and the administrative difficulty associated with allowing applications from certain regions only. This is consistent with the WSS. Payment rate and structure 39 We propose that the payment be structured as a per-firm payment with an additional per- FTE component. This is the same structure as the SBCS, weighting relative support in favour of smaller firms. Smaller firms are likely to have weaker financial reserves, and consequently be less resilient to revenue shocks. However, unlike the SBCS, the RSP would be available to firms of all sizes. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 6 40 We recommend that the rates are set at $1,500 per firm and an additional $400 per FTE. For most firms, this provides a lower level of support than the WSS, which is appropriate, given that the RSP will be available in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 2 when the economic impacts are generally lower. The payment rates for the RSP would not need to be increased at Alert Levels 3 and 4, as firms that are most impacted by the restrictions will become eligible for the WSS. 41 The per-FTE component will be capped at a maximum of 50 FTEs. Firms with more than 50 employees will still receive a payment (up to a maximum of $21,500). 42 It is estimated a payment at these rates would cover 51% of an average sole trader’s fixed costs for one week, 59% for an average firm with 1-5 FTEs, and 25% for the average firm with 20-50 FTEs. Within these averages, there will be significant variation, including as a result of sectoral differences. 43 We consider that these rates are sufficient to be credible and that they recognise the impact of public health restrictions on firms, while still requiring most firms to cover some of the costs associated with resurgence events (and therefore build their resilience). 44 In effect, this means a sole trader would receive a payment of $1,900, a small-to-medium enterprise (10 FTEs) would receive $5,500, and medium-to-large sized firms (50 FTEs or more) would receive $21,500. This would be complemented by the WSS in an escalation to Alert Level 3 or 4, subject to the firm’s revenue declining by 40%. Requirement to declare a drop in revenue caused by an escalation 45 The RSP will be limited to firms that declare an actual drop in revenue due to the effects of the escalation from Alert Level 1 in place at the time. 46 Similar to what is proposed for the WSS below, we propose to introduce a further declaration for applicants as follows: 46.1 The firm attributes the effect to the escalation in Alert Levels that began on \[date of current escalation\]; and 46.2 The effect has led to the decline in revenue that the firm has declared. 47 This would help to distinguish revenue drops relating to the public health escalation from effects of border closures, broader economic effects of COVID-19, and normal baseline revenue volatility. Applicants will be required to keep evidence to support this declaration (i.e. records showing the specific effects on their business and the resulting impact on revenue). This would be implemented in a high-trust manner, meaning firms establish an impact by declaration with the knowledge that records may be checked in case of audit. Officials will develop guidance on suitable record-keeping as evidence for the attributable declaration and revenue decline test. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 7 48 We considered more prescriptive approaches to this declaration, such as requiring firms to link the decline in revenue to specific health restrictions (including adherence to physical distancing requirements). However, officials advised that enforcement would be difficult, could increase uncertainty and compliance costs for businesses, and would have limited benefit, given most businesses are affected in some way by restrictions at Alert Level 2 or above. Revenue must decline by at least 30% to be eligible 49 We consider firms should be required to demonstrate a revenue decline of at least 30%, alongside the declaration that the decline is attributable to the current Alert Level escalation. Any test lower than 30% would be insufficiently targeted, resulting in too many firms receiving support, with greater associated fiscal cost. A higher revenue drop test such as 40% would be inconsistent with the revenue impacts felt by firms at Alert Level 2 and would likely result in too few firms receiving support. 50 Firms would be required to declare they have experienced an actual decline in revenue over a 14-day consecutive period after the initial escalation from Alert Level 1. This is unlike the WSS which allows for predicted revenue drops, as described below. The divergence reflects the lower economic impact on firms at Alert Level 2, when concerns about business confidence and firms’ access to immediate short-term cashflow support are less present. The requirement to declare an actual drop improves the integrity of the scheme. 51 Firms would be required to hold information that demonstrates their revenue declined by at least 30%. This impact must be compared against a useful data point. The current comparison point for the WSS is a similar period in the prior year, which is becoming progressively less accurate at selecting firms in need of support as the economy adjusts to COVID-19. 52 We propose that the default comparator period for the revenue drop test, for both the RSP and WSS, should be the typical fortnightly revenue in the six weeks prior to the Alert Level escalation that triggered the scheme. Employers that have highly seasonal revenue can use a prior year comparator if their seasonal revenue changes make it harder for them to meet the revenue decline test. 53 Eligible firms would be able to apply after the first 14 days of an escalation, as firms will need to demonstrate an actual decline in revenue over a period of that length. The test would apply to any 14-day period between the start and end of an escalation from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above (unless a return to Alert Level 1 nationally occurs within 14 days of the initial escalation, in which case the 14-day period will include the period spent at Alert Level 2 or above and any subsequent days at Alert Level 1). This recognises that, while the decline must be attributable to the effects of the escalation, the impact on a firm’s revenue may not be immediate in some cases. There may also be lags in a firm’s ability to generate the information required to make the declaration. Firms will therefore be able to apply until one month after a return to Alert Level 1 nationally. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 8 54 The revenue drop test will serve as the principal targeting mechanism for the scheme, as it is likely to identify the firms most in need of economic support owing to the impact of public health restrictions. It will target support at those sectors or regions that are most affected by higher Alert Levels, while also ensuring affected firms in any sector or region are eligible. 55 A well-designed declaration process and revenue drop test, as we propose, will assist in targeting support to sectors most in need owing to the impact of the escalation in restrictions. Therefore, we do not propose that the RSP include any additional sectoral or regional targeting, as this is likely to add significant operational complexity, create difficult boundary issues, and exclude some firms legitimately in need of support. Definition of revenue 56 For the purposes of the RSP and WSS, revenue is used as a proxy for income-generating activity. In elevated Alert Levels, physical distancing measures would reduce activity, and therefore income or revenue. The challenge is how a firm determines whether it has experienced a drop in activity/revenue, particularly when its business operates on an accrual (and not cash) basis and “earns” income by sending out invoices on a monthly or infrequent basis rather than having a daily cashflow. 57 We propose that revenue is clarified by guidance material published by Inland Revenue. The guidance would cover the following matters: 57.1 Revenue is derived from standard income-generating activities; and 57.2 Revenue is to be determined by applying standard accounting principles. 58 The 14-day revenue decline period starts on or after the escalation period commences. The comparison amount would be on an average fortnightly revenue within the six weeks before the escalation that triggered the scheme. 59 Revenue will not include funds from the WSS, SBCS or RSP. Revenue will not include income that is received passively (meaning those whose income is wholly derived passively, for example, landlords, or through dividend or interest payments). 60 The guidance will be developed by officials, who will report back to the Ministers responsible for the WSS, SBCS and RSP if the guidance is found to have unintended negative effects on applicants or if the definition of revenue shifts from what is stated above. Viability test 61 Firms would be required to declare that they are a “viable, ongoing business” in order to apply for the RSP. This is aligned with the requirements for the SBCS, and is intended to help ensure that support is provided only to firms that have reasonable future prospects. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 9 Other eligibility settings 62 We propose that sole traders should be eligible for the RSP. While this creates some integrity risk, sole traders are a significant proportion of firms and therefore should be eligible for support. 63 In line with recent changes to the SBCS, we recommend that firms should be eligible only if they have been in business for at least six months. This is an integrity measure and limits the fiscal risk associated with businesses being formed in order to apply for the support. 64 Pre-revenue firms, such as start-ups, are eligible for the WSS and the SBCS if they meet specific eligibility criteria. This reflects that pre-revenue firms may suffer financially if an escalation event delayed their capital raising activities or deferred their progress towards being market-ready (particularly upon an increase to Alert Level 3 or 4). We therefore propose that pre-revenue firms be eligible for the RSP, subject to satisfying the eligibility criteria for pre-revenue firms established through the WSS and SBCS. 65 We recommend that groups of related companies be eligible for a single per-firm payment, with the per-FTE payment similarly capped at 50 FTEs across all related entities. This avoids advantaging a firm with groups of companies and incentivising firms to split their businesses to increase their entitlement. 66 Charities and not-for-profit entities should be eligible for the RSP scheme, provided they meet the other eligibility criteria for the scheme (including a requirement to declare they are a “viable, ongoing organisation”). 67 State sector entities will be subject to the same rules for State Sector Organisations (SSOs) as under the WSS. This means SSOs (including State Owned Enterprises) would be excluded by default from the scheme, but can be granted an exemption to apply for the scheme by the Minister of Finance. Inland Revenue would then make an assessment of the application. We recommend existing exemptions made under the WSS be transferred to the RSP. 68 We also recommend a minimum age requirement to prevent young people (e.g. children with paper runs) from applying for the grant and receiving what is likely to be significantly more than their usual monthly revenue. We recommend the minimum age limit be 18 years (as with the SBCS). Restrictions on use 69 The WSS requires firms to pass through the value of the WSS to employees as wages subject to normal deductions as PAYE. As the SBCS did not have a pass-through requirement, it introduced restrictions on the use of funds as an integrity measure: firms must declare that the funds will be applied to business expenses only and cannot be passed through to shareholders or owners of the business or organisation. This gives firms flexibility in use of the payment, while the declaration constitutes an integrity measure (though the fungibility of money means its enforceability is likely to be complex). We recommend applicants for the RSP be required to declare the fund will be applied to business expenses only (including wages, capital expenditure and core operating costs). 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 10 Repayment expectation 70 Currently the WSS is repayable when an employer has not met the eligibility criteria (for example, if its predicted revenue loss does not occur); if it has not complied with the conditions attached to the subsidy; if it has provided false information; or if it has received insurance to cover any costs covered by the subsidy. We propose that the same rules apply for the RSP. This means that a firm will be required to repay the RSP if it is demonstrated to have not experienced the revenue decline it declared on application. Consistent with our view on the WSS, we do not recommend any additional rules be added in relation to profit or revenue growth, given the complexity and uncertainty this would add to the scheme, and the risk of creating unintended hardship for certain firms and their employees. Complementary supports 71 We propose that firms should be able to receive the RSP alongside other forms of support including the WSS, SBCS, Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP) and LSS. The schemes serve different purposes, with the SBCS providing lending for cashflow purposes, the WSS supporting the retention of the workforce during higher Alert Levels, and the RSP providing firms with fungible, non-repayable support to assist transitions from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above. Implementation agency 72 Inland Revenue would administer the RSP. It has indicated that it could implement the scheme six to eight weeks after Cabinet decisions are taken, subject to passage of the required legislative amendments. Tax treatment 73 We consider businesses should not be subject to income tax on payments under the RSP they receive, nor should they be able to claim deductions for expenditure funded by those payments. This is consistent with the standard income tax treatment of Government grants. 74 We recommend GST-registered businesses should pay GST on payments they receive under the RSP, with those businesses being able to claim input tax deductions for the relevant expenditure. This is consistent with the standard GST treatment of Government grants, but will differ from the GST treatment of the WSS payments. We consider the difference is justified because the WSS is required to be passed on to employees, and employee salaries and wages are not subject to GST. Delegation to Joint Ministers 75 To ensure that officials have sufficient mandate from Ministers, we propose that Cabinet authorise the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Revenue, and the Minister for Small Business to take decisions relating to further design details and operational matters required to progress the implementation of the RSP, in alignment with the key parameters agreed in this paper. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 11 Strengthening the Wage Subsidy Scheme at Alert Levels 3 and above 76 The Wage Subsidy Scheme has been the core element of the Government’s economic response to COVID-19. Since March of this year, there have been three main iterations of the scheme: the 12-week Wage Subsidy Scheme opening in March, a further 8-week extension opening in June, and the 2-week Wage Subsidy Resurgence Scheme available during the August outbreak of COVID-19 in Auckland. These are collectively referred to as the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS). 77 Under the WSS, employers that experienced a COVID-19-related drop in revenue (30% for the initial iteration, and 40% subsequently) were able to claim a subsidy of $585.80 per week for each full-time employee (20 hours or more) or $350 for part-t ime employees (less than 20 hours). Employers were obliged to retain, for the duration of the subsidy, staff for whom they claimed the subsidy or repay it if staff were not retained. They were also required to exercise their best endeavours to pay at least 80% of those employees’ ordinary salary or wages or, at a minimum, pay at least the value of the subsidy to those staff (or their normal wages if less). A total of $14 billion has been paid out across the three schemes, in respect of 1.8 million unique jobs. 78 Following the Auckland outbreak, the last Government directed officials to report back on a more sustainable, longer-term Wage Subsidy Scheme \[CAB-20-MIN-0402 refers\]. That advice has informed our recommendations detailed below. Confirming the objectives of the Wage Subsidy Scheme 79 We propose that, going forward, the objectives of the WSS be to: 79.1 Temporarily support workers’ incomes and employment attachment during periods at Alert Level 3 or above; 79.2 Provide support for employers to pay wages if they are struggling to do so as a result of an escalation to Alert Level 3 or above; 79.3 Share the cost associated with a period at Alert Level 3 or above between the Government, employers and employees, and across economic sectors; 79.4 Balance short-term labour market attachment with long-term labour market reallocation; and 79.5 Encourage the shift to a COVID-19-resilient economy. Signalling support in advance 80 We propose that the Government signals now that it intends to introduce a WSS if there is an escalation to Alert Level 3 or above, anywhere in New Zealand, for seven or more consecutive days (of which the seventh day may be a partial day), subject to any other factors relevant at the time. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 12 81 We do not propose to open the WSS for Alert Level escalations of fewer than seven days. As with the RSP, we consider it is reasonable for employers to manage the effects of Alert Level escalations that are shorter than one week without support. In addition, it takes MSD five business days to open the scheme with current operational arrangements and around a week after restrictions are in place for support to begin flowing to most employers. 82 We also propose linking, through automatic rules, the duration of support to the duration of lockdown. Under current settings, the WSS is provided in two-week lump-sum payments. We propose to continue this arrangement but clarify upfront that the subsidy payments will be “rounded” to the nearest fortnight. For example, there would be a two- week payment for both an eight-day lockdown and a twenty-day lockdown. We also propose that the availability and settings of an open scheme are reviewed by Cabinet every six weeks, and to review this approach again six months after its introduction. 83 In addition, we propose publicly communicating the key parameters of the WSS in advance of any future resurgence and as part of an announcement on the overall package. These parameters are discussed below. Core Wage Subsidy Scheme parameters would be unchanged 84 We propose that the core parameters of the August iteration of the WSS be retained for any future resurgence. This includes: 84.1 The 40% revenue drop eligibility test; 84.2 Payment rates of $585.80 per week for each full-time employee (20 hours or more) and $350 for part-time employees (less than 20 hours); 84.3 An obligation for employers to retain, for the duration of the subsidy, staff for whom they claimed the subsidy (or repay it if not), and to endeavour to pay at least 80% of those employees’ ordinary salary or wages, or, at a minimum, to pay at least the value of the subsidy to those staff (or their normal wages if less); and 84.4 Nationwide availability of the scheme by default, even in the case of regionally elevated Alert Levels (for the reasons discussed above for the RSP). Proposed changes to the Wage Subsidy Scheme 85 Stakeholder feedback on the WSS has been highly positive, with the scheme widely viewed as being timely and effective at enabling rapid cashflow (which was especially important for small businesses) and at maintaining workplace connections in the face of significant uncertainty due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are opportunities to make improvements. 86 The need to deliver support at pace during a resurgence and the limitations of MSD’s delivery systems means that the scheme will always need to be relatively high-trust, but minor changes can be made in the short term to improve its integrity. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 13 87 MSD’s original approach to WSS integrity built on the applicant declarations for each scheme, and included pre- and post- payment checks of employer details, a coordinated complaints process, a thorough investigations process, and a repayment process. This approach has been refined over time, and enhancements made for later schemes will carry through to future schemes. 88 These include enhanced up-front controls, and the exception of applications that that appear to pose some integrity risk in relation to their entitlement for previous schemes (including where repayments have been requested). \[39\] 89 Pre-payment validation of information with IR and pre-payment checks of This \[39\] includes more detailed discussions that they met the eligibility criteria before approval, and that they understand their obligations under the scheme. 90 Officials are progressing work on the following minor short-term improvements to the scheme’s integrity: 90.1 Increasing visibility and publicity around audit, enforcement and repayments, including through ministerial communications; 90.2 Improving guidance for applicants to reduce error rates and improve automation rates; and 90.3 Clarifying the drafting of rules under the scheme, including a definition of “revenue” and eligibility of company groups (the intent is for these rules to be consistent with the proposed settings where possible, as discussed above). 91 Beyond these operational changes already being progressed, we seek Cabinet agreement to a small number of other changes to the WSS in relation to the below areas that can be delivered in the short term. New attribution test 92 First, similar to what is proposed for the RSP above, we propose to introduce a new test to distinguish revenue declines relating to public health escalation, from the effects of border closures, broader economic effects of COVID-19 and normal baseline revenue volatility. As at present, a firm applying for the WSS will need to declare that it has been affected by COVID-19. However, unlike at present, the firm will also need to declare that: 92.1 the firm attributes the effect to the escalation in Alert Levels that began on \[date of current escalation\]; and 92.2 the effect has led to the decline in revenue that the firm has declared. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 14 93 Applicants will be required to keep evidence to support this declaration, such as records showing the specific effects on their business and the resulting impact on revenue. Like other elements of the WSS, this would be implemented in a high-trust manner, meaning records may be checked in case of audit. Officials will redraft the existing WSS declaration to give effect to this change and develop guidance on records that applicants can keep as evidence. 94 It is intended that employers suffering indirect effects of elevated Alert Levels could still qualify for WSS support under this test, such as a business with heavily affected customers or suppliers. While this may appear to be a broad test, the requirement for this to also have led to a revenue decline creates a more robust test that will help target support to those that are genuinely affected. Revenue decline test 95 We propose to retain the requirement that employers will need to experience or predict at least a 40% decline in weekly revenue relative to an appropriate comparator period to qualify for the WSS. Applicants will be required to hold information that demonstrates their revenue declined by at least 40%. 96 Currently, a prior-year comparator is used for the revenue decline. However, this is becoming progressively less accurate at selecting firms in need of support as the economy adjusts to COVID-19. 97 We propose the default test period for the WSS revenue decline will be revenue over a 14-day period following the escalation to Alert Level 3 (or above). Applicants will be able to apply based on a predicted or actual decline (as currently). Allowing for a predicted revenue decline provides rapid confidence for employers who may be deciding whether to retain staff. The Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment will consider whether there is merit in the default test period being subject to a small amount of flexibility to reduce compliance costs associated with calculating revenue outside of the normal accounting cycles. 98 We propose the default comparator period for the WSS revenue tests should be the typical fortnightly revenue in the six weeks prior to the Alert Level escalation that triggered the scheme. This will normally align with the RSP comparator period. Employers that have highly seasonal revenue will be allowed to use a prior year comparator, if they can show that the seasonality in their revenue makes it harder to meet the revenue decline test with the default comparator period than if their revenues were not seasonal. 99 In some complex public health scenarios, such as several Alert Level escalations in quick succession, it may be necessary to offer a different comparator period which provides a more appropriate baseline. 100 We propose that Cabinet delegates final decisions to the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment jointly on any further implementation details, including for the revenue drop test, test and comparator period (including exceptions to the default period) and reapplication requirements. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 15 Use of the Wage Subsidy Scheme for employees on annual leave 101 Under current settings, employers can use the WSS to pay for holiday entitlements. In line with the Holidays Act 2003, employers must either agree leave with their employee, or if agreement cannot be reached, an employer can direct their employee to take leave with a minimum of 14 days’ notice in writing. However, agencies have received feedback that some employers have not complied with this requirement while receiving the subsidy. 102 To address the risk of non-compliance with employment law, we are planning to support employer compliance with clearer explanations and expectations of rights and obligations under employment law and by promoting use of existing Government employment dispute services. 103 Using existing employment law levers in this way (rather than changing WSS rules) maintains employees’ flexibility to take leave voluntarily and avoids undermining existing employment relationships. Repayment obligations 104 Currently payments received under the WSS are repayable when an employer has not met the eligibility criteria (for example, if the predicted revenue loss does not occur) or is not upholding the conditions attached to the WSS, or has provided false information, or has received insurance to cover any costs covered by the WSS. 105 There has been some media coverage of firms that have recorded profits after receiving WSS payments. The public may be less supportive of the WSS if they feel the cost of public health restrictions is not being shared fairly. We considered introducing a rule for new schemes to address this issue through repayment obligations. However, with the blunt settings available under the scheme, it is not possible to accurately distinguish firms for whom the WSS contributed to retaining staff versus firms for whom the WSS only increased profits. 106 For example, a high level of firm profits over a year does not necessarily mean that payments under the WSS were not warranted. Profit may have been a result of shifting to a more resilient business model or of investments made prior to COVID-19 restrictions. 107 Given this, we do not recommend at this stage that any additional repayment rules are added in relation to profit or revenue growth, given the complexity and uncertainty this would add to the scheme, and the risk of creating unintended negative impacts for some firms and their employees. Further work on more substantive changes is planned 108 Beyond the changes proposed above, we have directed officials to report back to Ministers in February 2021 on whether other, more substantive changes could be made to the scheme, including: 108.1 introducing a higher-integrity model; 108.2 establishing a legal framework for the scheme; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 16 108.3 introducing more payment tiers to reduce windfalls; 108.4 examining the potential benefits of moving scheme delivery to IR; and 108.5 the feasibility of a repayment rule, in a more enduring scheme, for employers who receive payments under the WSS, then subsequently both lay off staff and make a profit. 109 We propose that any public communication relating to the WSS emphasise that the core elements of the WSS will remain the same, while noting that officials are continuing to work on further possible improvements to the scheme. Consistency between the RSP, WSS, and SBCS 110 In designing the RSP, and proposing amendments to the WSS, officials have attempted to achieve consistency between the two schemes and the SBCS, where sensible, so as to reduce business confusion. This is reflected in a number of the settings proposed above for the RSP, including many of the settings relating to business declarations and business eligibility. 111 There are other settings that are not in alignment. Some are based on policy grounds, such as the differing revenue drop thresholds under the RSP and WSS reflecting the schemes’ different purposes. Others are based on the fact that there will be different agencies implementing the schemes, with different system capabilities and different approaches to achieving necessary scheme integrity. Nevertheless, as revisions to the WSS and detailed design decisions for the RSP are made, officials will continue to promote alignment between the schemes where possible and desirable. Other elements of the COVID-19 resurgence package Residential tenancies 112 In response to the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the Government introduced legislation to restrict residential tenancy terminations for three months and freeze residential rent increases for six months. 113 It is proposed that Cabinet agrees to reinstate these measures in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 4. Doing so would support the public health response and assure temporary maintenance of living standards by ensuring people are able to safely stay in one place throughout the duration of a lockdown. 114 Reinstating these measures will require new legislation, as previous provisions have expired and did not include reactivation clauses. Prior to introducing this legislation, further work would be required on the design of residential tenancy measures, to ensure any temporary changes are sufficiently flexible and fit for purpose. This may include limiting the provisions to the period of time spent at Alert Level 4, and considering possible grounds for exemptions to the eviction restrictions. 115 Below Alert Level 4, we consider these measures are not justified, as they prevent transition, impede on landlord property rights, and may cause more housing stress for renters in the long term. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 17 116 To address the economic impact of a further outbreak, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development also intends to consider if any changes are warranted to allow break lease fees to be waived for tenants needing to break fixed term tenancies in the event of sudden job and income loss. The situation will depend on what government support is available to the tenant (e.g. the WSS), the position of the landlord, and the duration at Alert Level 4. Childcare for Essential Workers 117 The Childcare for Essential Workers scheme was available during the first COVID-19 outbreak to provide childcare for essential workers by directly funding government- subsidised childcare providers, via government agencies. 118 During the initial period of availability, overall uptake of the scheme was relatively low, driven in part by a delay in decisions on funding which affected the ability to contract providers. 119 As the scheme has now lapsed, we propose that Cabinet agree to reinstate a similar but improved measure in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 4, in recognition of the lack of availability of other forms of childcare (such as schooling and early childhood education) at Alert Level 4, and the impact this may have on the ability of essential workers to attend work during a resurgence. \[38\] with home-based early childhood education service providers ahead of time. 120 To address negotiated the previous delay in implementation, contracts will need to be 121 We propose that decisions on the following matters be delegated jointly to the Minister of Education and Minister of Finance, following advice to be provided by Ministry of Education officials by the end of March 2021: 121.1 the hourly rate to be paid to providers and the estimated four-week costs; and 121.2 the proposed funding source and mechanism, with any expenditure or draw down of funding subject to Cabinet approval at the time of an escalation to Alert Level 4. Commercial tenancies 122 The initial Alert Level escalation led to a number of disputes between commercial tenants and landlords regarding payment of rent when commercial premises could not be accessed or used due to the Alert Level restrictions, with many commercial lease contracts silent on the obligations arising in such a situation. 123 To address these issues, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee agreed in June to amend the Property Law Act 2007, to imply a clause into leases of businesses that meet eligibility criteria to require a fair proportion of rent and outgoings to cease to be paid when a tenant’s business has suffered a material loss of revenue because of COVID- 19-related restrictions \[DEV-20-MIN-0100 refers\]. Legislation to implement this change was ultimately not progressed. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 18 124 Ahead of a further escalation in Alert Levels, there is merit in considering further interventions (legislative or otherwise) to better facilitate appropriate negotiations over commercial rent in the event of a resurgence or other emergency event unrelated to COVID-19. However, designing an appropriate intervention in this area is difficult, and the need for intervention may reduce over time as leases are renewed and clauses addressing such a situation are introduced into a higher proportion of lease contracts. 125 Given this, we propose to invite the Minister of Justice to report back to Cabinet on this \[33\] matter by February 2021, As part of any announcement, we propose to note that further work is being undertaken on the matter of commercial tenancies, without specifying a solution. Other measures 126 The measures listed above are not exhaustive. In the event of a severe resurgence, it may be possible that other measures will be needed. For example, a number of omnibus Bills were passed immediately prior to, and following, the initial shift to Alert Level 4. However, the measures discussed in this paper represent the core of the economic response to further outbreaks, and are sufficient for communicating the details of a proposed resurgence package to the public. Reducing the risk and extent of resurgences through the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme 127 The measures discussed above are proposed to be introduced in the case of a resurgence of COVID-19. In contrast, the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme (LSS) is already available at all Alert Levels. The scheme is intended to incentivise eligible employees and the self-employed to self-isolate and stay home when sick. Self-isolation and staying at home when sick or where there has been a risk of exposure to COVID-19 plays an important role in containing and preventing the spread of COVID-19, and can therefore help reduce the risk of prolonged Alert Level escalations and the associated economic and social costs. 128 The existing scheme provides a two-week lump-sum payment ($585.80 per week for full- time workers, and $350 per week for part-time workers) to employers in respect of certain eligible workers. Eligible workers include (but are not limited to) people who: 128.1 have contracted, or possibly been exposed to, COVID-19; 128.2 are, or have a household member who is, at an increased risk of severe illness if they contract COVID-19; 128.3 have COVID-19-like symptoms and are awaiting a test result and work in a health, disability, or aged-care facility or service; or 128.4 are a parent or caregiver of a dependent who has been told to self-isolate for a period and the dependent needs support to do so safely. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 19 129 There are several exclusions from the scheme including: 129.1 workers who can work from home; 129.2 international returnees who are in managed isolation facilities; 129.3 workers whose employer is already receiving a WSS payment in respect of them at that time; and 129.4 employees of state sector organisations (unless an exemption has been granted). Effectiveness of the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme 130 Following a recent review, officials have identified areas where the LSS can be improved to close gaps in coverage and address inefficiencies. 131 First, many workers are currently ineligible for the scheme. With the exception of health workers (for whom the criteria are broader), the LSS does not cover workers who are sick (or whose dependents are sick) with COVID-19-like symptoms, unless they have either received a positive test result or been advised to self-isolate by a medical practitioner, or advised or directed to self-isolate by a Medical Officer of Health. 1 For example, the LSS is not available to workers who have been told to stay home when sick by Healthline, or workers who have been tested and told to stay home when sick by a community testing station (unless they fulfil other criteria). 132 Currently, ineligible workers may continue to go to work while they wait for a test result because of financial necessity, concern about their sick leave balance, or pressure from employers who do not want to absorb the cost of their absence. This creates a risk that they return to work while sick with COVID-19. 133 Second, there is an inefficiency in the scheme. Employers are paid a two-week lump sum for workers in aged care, disability and health services if they are told to self-isolate while getting tested. The two-week lump sum is also available to those who meet the high risk of suspicion criteria, or casual contacts who are only required to self-isolate until they return a negative test result. However, the number of days workers are required to self- isolate before receiving a test result is usually between one and three. This generally results in an overpayment of between eleven and thirteen days (although employers are expected to use any remaining subsidy for other eligible staff or return the remaining subsidy to MSD). Public health guidance regarding self-isolation and staying home when sick 134 The Ministry of Health is proposing to amend public health guidance regarding the situations in which people are advised or required to stay at home or self-isolate. The proposed guidance recommends that everyone who gets a COVID-19 test (other than those without symptoms that are taking part in routine or surveillance testing) be asked to stay at home while awaiting the result. If agreed, these changes will likely expand the number of people who may be eligible for the LSS, and the proposed new Short-Term Absence Payment, which is discussed below. 1 A direction to self-isolate can only be made by a Medical Officer of Health under the Health Act 1956 or as part of an Order made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. Otherwise, instructions to self- isolate or stay home when sick do not have legal effect. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 20 Introducing a new $350 COVID-19 Short-Term Absence Payment 135 To address the existing issues around the (lack of) availability of the LSS for workers being tested for COVID-19, we propose to complement the LSS by introducing a new ‘COVID-19 Short-Term Absence Payment’ (STAP). 136 We propose that the STAP be a one-off, flat-rate payment of $350, available to eligible employers (including self-employed workers) to support them in paying workers who: 136.1 legally work in New Zealand; and 136.2 cannot work from home; and either 136.3 need to miss a shift or more from work to stay home while awaiting a test result in accordance with either public health guidance or requirements; or 136.1 are the parent or caregiver of a dependant who needs to stay home while waiting for a test result and needs support to do so safely, and the parent or caregiver needs to miss a shift or more of work while supporting their dependant. 137 We note that public health guidance may be issued from a range of places, including the Ministry of Health website, Healthline, GPs, the National Contract Tracing Centre, Medical Officers of Health, Community-based Assessment Centres, or Public Health Units. 138 This proposal is a significant expansion beyond the current LSS criteria and has the potential to make a material difference in encouraging workers to stay home when sick. The proposed STAP aligns with the proposed changes to public health guidance referenced above. In particular, it is focused on supporting workers who have been tested for COVID-19 to stay home when sick, rather than just the much narrower pool of people who are formally directed to self-isolate or advised to self-isolate by a doctor. 139 Workers currently covered by the two-week LSS while awaiting a test result (such as health care workers) would no longer be eligible for the two-week LSS in the first instance and would instead be eligible for the STAP. This would address the inefficiency outlined above, as the level of payment would better reflect the shorter period required in self-isolation while waiting for results. 140 The existing two-week lump-sum payment would continue to be available for those who need to self-isolate for a longer period (often 14 days), including in the event of a positive test result. Employers who receive the STAP for workers getting tested could therefore subsequently apply for the two-week lump-sum payment if their worker is eligible and required to self-isolate for a longer duration. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 21 141 The STAP is intended to reduce incentives or pressures for workers to come into work in a situation in which they risk spreading COVID-19. These incentives and pressures can exist even when employees have sick leave. Accordingly, the STAP will be available irrespective of whether the worker has a sick leave balance and will signal the importance to the wider public and businesses of not going to the workplace while awaiting a test result. We note that the proposed increase to statutory sick leave entitlements from five to ten days will only begin to come into effect in a phased manner from mid-to-late-2021. 142 How the worker is to be paid if the employer applies for the STAP will be governed by their employment agreement, employment law and any negotiations between the employer and employee. The employer can apply for the STAP irrespective of whether the employee has or uses an existing sick leave entitlement. There will be an expectation as part of the declaration process that employers use the STAP to support employees who need to stay home while awaiting a test result. 143 We note the STAP declaration will not include the obligation to keep the employee employed for the duration of the payment, as there is no specified duration as there is for the LSS. However, employment law means that an employee could not be dismissed for taking time away from work while receiving the STAP. Officials will consider how incorrect payments and overpayments of the STAP will be dealt with and provide advice to delegated Ministers as part of implementation. 144 The STAP will not be available to: 144.1 employers in respect of workers who are not legally working in New Zealand; 144.2 businesses registered or operating outside New Zealand; 144.3 employers, including self-employed people, who are receiving a WSS or LSS payment for that named worker at that time; 144.4 workers who can work from home; 144.5 workers who have routine testing in their workplace such as border workers and MIQ workers (unless they are symptomatic); 144.6 non-symptomatic people participating in surveillance testing; 144.7 people staying in managed isolation facilities; 144.8 New Zealanders who are currently overseas; 144.9 State Sector Organisations (including State Owned Enterprises), except where an exception has been granted in relation to the WSS or LSS; or 144.10 workers of entities other than registered business, sole traders, self-employed persons, registered charities, incorporated societies, non-government organisations, or post-settlement governance entities. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 22 145 Employers or the self-employed will be able to apply for the STAP no more than once in any thirty-day period per eligible worker (unless a health official or medical practitioner advises or requires the worker to re-test). Like current payments made under the LSS, the STAP will be GST-exempt, and treated as excluded income and non-deductible for the employer. 146 MSD expects that it will be ready to offer the new STAP, if agreed by Cabinet, from mid- February 2021. MSD will provide advice to joint ministers on when applications will go live. 147 We propose confirming the ongoing availability of the LSS and the introduction of the new STAP alongside announcements of the resurgence support package. Outstanding issues with the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme 148 Introducing the new STAP will not resolve all potential issues. For example, workers may still be incentivised to come into work if the amount the employer pays to the worker for the days they could not work is less than their normal income. 2 In addition, some employers may choose not to apply for the STAP if they consider it is not worth the effort. Nonetheless, the STAP is an effective short-term solution to key concerns. Risks associated with the proposed COVID-19 Short-Term Absence Payment 149 Due to the consistently low numbers of people applying for existing LSS, it is difficult to anticipate likely uptake of the STAP. Eligibility for the STAP and LSS will also fluctuate along with public health guidance on who needs to stay home while awaiting COVID-19 test results. While IT changes to stand up the scheme can be made by mid- February 2021, it is currently difficult to fully ascertain the implications for ongoing administration of the STAP. Once live, MSD can monitor uptake to understand any additional resourcing needs; however, this lag could lead to an impact on processing times for applications if application numbers are high in the short-term. 150 If there is another community outbreak and an escalation to Alert Level 3 or higher, MSD may need to process a significant number of payments between the STAP, the LSS, and the WSS. This will also have a flow-on impact on MSD’s ability to administer the schemes and deliver on other commitments, such as the Flexi-Wage expansion, meet the peak demand for seasonal work, or support the expected growth in people needing income support. 151 As with other measures discussed in this paper, MSD will operate the payment in a very \[39\] high trust manner However, MSD will have some ability to monitor application behaviour that may pose some integrity risk (i.e. duplicate or multiple applications for employees) and will follow up any allegations received about misuse of the scheme. 2 Those with a sick leave entitlement should receive their usual sick leave pay; however, for those without sick leave the employer could legally pay the $350 STAP which may be less than their usual income. If the worker’s usual income is less than $350 for that period an approach consistent with the LSS would mean the employer would only need to pass on their usual income. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 23 152 Employers will be asked to declare that they are eligible and that their employee has advised them that they meet the eligibility criteria. There is a risk that some employers and self-employed people may take advantage of the payment’s availability to make \[39\] windfall gains, However, the gain for employers will be relatively small, especially in the context of the administrative effort of applying, which should mitigate this risk. 153 Additional criteria will also help to reduce excessive use, such as defining what constitutes missed work. In addition, testing stations generally test only those who have symptoms, and employers will need to declare that they are applying for support for an employee who has been tested and is staying away from work until they get their test results back. Supporting individuals and whānau 154 The package of measures we are proposing to signal in advance largely focusses on fiscal transfers to firms that allow them to continue to pay wages and bills when they are subject to public health restrictions. These measures also support the incomes of individuals employed by those firms, both across the duration of resurgence events and beyond those events, as firms will be more likely to manage through Alert Level escalations without the need for significant cost-c utting or job losses, particularly if subjected to multiple resurgences. 155 The economic and social impacts of a COVID-19 outbreak on individuals persist beyond the short period at higher Alert Levels, and many of the impacts – such as job losses – can take time to materialise. The Government has put in place a number of measures to support individuals affected, such as the now expired COVID-19 Income Relief Payment and the recently expanded Flexi-Wage Scheme \[CAB-20-MIN-0493 refers\]. 156 The broader social safety net is critical to ensure that individuals and whānau most at risk can access support relevant to more bespoke needs during public health restrictions. That could include individuals already out of work or unable to work, homeless individuals, and young people in deprived households. We have funded a significant number of initiatives through the CRRF to ensure that the safety net is robust. 157 In response to the Auckland outbreak the Minister of Finance directed the Treasury to review the support landscape for low income and vulnerable households in South Auckland. The review found that the current support landscape for these groups during outbreaks has no significant gaps, and that the most substantial improvements we can make are in the quick delivery and deployment of support in partnership with relevant groups. 158 It is therefore vital to work with our Treaty of Waitangi partners, trusted local leaders, and with community groups (such as churches and local NGO leaders), who have a valuable role to play in providing support to vulnerable people and supporting social licence in the event of any Alert Level escalation. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 24 Resurgence preparedness in the near term 159 Given the package of economic measures described above will not be available immediately, in the event of a re-escalation in Alert Levels over the Christmas holiday period, we propose reinstating the WSS if the escalation is to Alert Level 3 or 4. Some of the improvements to the WSS proposed in this Cabinet paper may not be implemented prior to Christmas, meaning that in the event of a resurgence over the Christmas holiday period, settings may be equivalent to those used in the August resurgence. 160 MSD is undertaking contingency planning for such an event, but it may take longer than normal for the scheme to be stood up if a resurgence takes place over the Christmas period, owing to limited staff availability. 161 It will not be possible to introduce the RSP if an Alert Level escalation takes place ahead of the passage of legislation to enable IR to deliver such a scheme, currently expected in late February or early March 2021. However, there are other possible options available, such as to increase the rate of the WSS paid out or signal retrospective payments of the new grant when it is available to compensate for the new scheme not yet being available. Given that the need for additional support beyond the WSS will depend on the nature of the resurgence, we propose that Cabinet take a decision on any supplementary measures at the time of a resurgence, should this eventuate. Decision-making process for resurgence measures 162 On 9 December, the Cabinet Business Committee considered a paper from the Minister for the COVID-19 Response, detailing plans for the public health response to COVID- 19 over the summer holiday period and seeking agreement to a Standard Operating Procedure for the response to a case of COVID-19 being tested in the community \[CBC- 20-MIN-0096 refers\]. This set out that Ministers with the Power to Act would decide whether to escalate Alert Levels in the event of future community transmission. It would therefore not be a decision for Cabinet. 163 The measures in the resurgence package will be introduced only in the event of an escalation to the Alert Level at which they are applicable. The Minister of Finance and relevant Joint Ministers will seek Cabinet approval to their introduction and the necessary funding at that time. 164 In the meantime, relevant Joint Ministers will progress the outstanding design decisions and legislation required on the components of the resurgence package in line with the recommendations below. 165 In the event of a resurgence over the Christmas period, we propose that Cabinet authorise the Minister of Finance and relevant Joint Ministers to take the necessary decisions to introduce the WSS if there is a decision to escalate to Alert Level 3 or above for more than one week. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 25 Financial Implications Overall resurgence package 166 The eventual fiscal cost of the proposed package depends directly on the frequency, duration and severity of any Alert Level escalations. 167 Different scenarios will result in different fiscal costs. Multiple separate resurgence events would trigger several payments of the RSP and increase the cost of the scheme. Remaining at Alert Level 3 or above for longer durations would increase expected uptake of the WSS, and at Alert Level 4 the Childcare Support for Essential Workers support would be introduced. 168 The table below shows the estimated indicative combined fiscal cost of the RSP and WSS in different scenarios: Scenario Estimated cost RSP WSS Total Alert Level 2 nationally for four weeks $350 million N/A $350 million Auckland- equivalent outbreak 3 $400 million $520 million $920 million Alert Level 3 nationally for 2 weeks, Alert Level 2 for 6 weeks $450 million $960 million $1,410 million 169 As discussed above, Cabinet approval will be sought for the introduction of the measures and the necessary funding, at the time of an Alert Level escalation at which the measures are applicable. 170 Unless otherwise identified below, we propose that any additional funding required to meet the cost of the measures in the resurgence package be charged against the COVID- 19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF), established as part of Budget 2020. 171 Around $12.84 billion remains unallocated from the CRRF as at 4 December 2020. There are likely to be upcoming calls on the CRRF of approximately $2.84 billion, which would leave around $10 billion unallocated. This amount would be sufficient to meet the estimated costs of the schemes through multiple resurgence events. 3 Auckland at Alert Level 3 for 2 weeks followed by Alert Level 2 for 6 weeks. The remainder of NZ is at Alert Level 2 for a total of 6 weeks, with the Wage Subsidy Scheme available nationally to eligible businesses while Auckland is at Alert Level 3. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 26 Resurgence Support Payment scheme 172 Based on the parameters of the RSP scheme proposed in this paper, the fiscal cost is estimated to lie between $350 and $450 million per outbreak and escalation from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above. 173 There is some uncertainty regarding uptake of the scheme. The costings above are based on a revenue drop requirement of 30%, and an estimated 150,000 firms qualifying for the payment at Alert Level 2. 174 The cost of operationalising and establishing administrative capacity for the scheme will be met within Vote Revenue baseline in 2020/21. Thereafter, an estimated total of $9 million in new operating funding is required across the period 2021/22 – 2024/25. This assumes the scheme will be in place for two years and will require a further two years of funding for integrity and compliance work once it has ended. 175 IR has noted that it will need to provide for these administrative costs across the period 2020/21 to 2022/23 while the scheme is in place, whether or not it is activated. While the scheme is inactive, resources funded for the RSP will be used for other tax administration duties. If the RSP is underspent, funding for 2023/24 and 2024/25 will be returned to the Centre. 176 We propose to fund the estimated administrative cost of $9 million from the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF), established as part of Budget 2020. Wage Subsidy Scheme 177 The cost of the WSS is dependent on the number of recipients. In an Auckland-equivalent outbreak – where Auckland is at Alert Level 3, the remainder of the country is at Alert Level 2, and the WSS is available nationally – the estimated cost is $520 million per fortnight. In the event of a nationwide escalation to Alert Level 3, the estimated cost is $960 million per fortnight, as demand is expected to be higher. 178 Both the Wage Subsidy Extension and Resurgence Wage Subsidy had lower uptake than originally forecast. This has resulted in an underspend of around $1.3 billion remaining in the existing Business Support Subsidy Covid-19 appropriation. In the first instance, we recommend that any future WSS payments be funded (in full or in part) from the underspend in the appropriation. Childcare for Essential Workers 179 Reintroducing a Childcare for Essential Workers support at Alert Level 4 for four weeks \[38\] 180 Officials have identified two options for funding the revised Childcare for Essential Workers scheme: \[33\] 180.1 through reprioritisation of unspent funding 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 27 \[33\] 180.2 through Cabinet approval 181 We propose that Cabinet authorise Joint Ministers (the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Education) to agree on the preferred funding option following advice to be provided by Ministry of Education officials by the end of March 2021. Other resurgence package measures 182 There are no direct financial implications from the proposals to introduce legislation to restrict residential tenancy terminations and freeze residential rent increases. Complementing the Leave Support Scheme with a new Short-Term Absence Payment 183 The likely cost of the STAP, including administration costs for MSD, is still being determined. However, it could potentially be very significant if there are high rates of testing, high numbers of people advised to stay home while sick, and there is high take- up of the payment by those eligible. 184 The cost of the STAP will be met in the first instance from a balance of approximately $85 million remaining in the existing COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme appropriation in Vote Social Development. 185 We recommend that Cabinet direct officials to report back to the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety, and the Minister for Social Development and Employment with updated fiscal cost estimates including administration costs, based on expected take-up of the LSS and STAP and any required amendments to settings, once proposed changes to health guidance regarding self-isolation and staying home when sick have been confirmed. 186 We propose that Cabinet authorise these Ministers to appropriate funding for the administration of the scheme up to $10 million, to be a charge against the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund established as part of Budget 2020, with any additional funding required to be sought from Cabinet; Legislative Implications 187 Legislation will be required to enable Inland Revenue to deliver the proposed new RSP. In particular, amendments will need to be made to the Tax Administration Act 1994. These amendments should be included in a stand-alone tax bill to be introduced and passed through all stages under urgency in February 2021. This would enable the RSP to become available in late February or early March 2021. 188 This stand-alone tax bill will be included in the Minister of Revenue’s Bill bid for 2021. The Joint Ministers for the RSP will present a paper to the Legislation Cabinet Committee in early February seeking approval to introduce the Bill giving effect to the proposed RSP. This paper directs Inland Revenue officials to draft the necessary amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to implement the RSP. 189 Legislation will also be required to implement the freeze on residential tenancy rent increases and tenancy terminations. The current expectation is that this legislation will not be progressed unless a shift to Alert Level 4 is imminent. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 28 Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Statement 190 Cabinet’s Impact Analysis requirements apply to the proposal to establish a new RSP and the proposal to agree in principle to freeze residential tenancy rent increases and restrict tenancy terminations upon escalation to Alert Level 4. 191 There is no Regulatory Impact Statement for the RSP proposal. The relevant Treasury policy team and the Treasury Regulatory Quality Team have agreed on the nature and timing of a Supplementary Analysis Report (SAR). This SAR will be provided to the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting in February 2021. 192 There is also no Regulatory Impact Statement for the proposal to agree to freeze residential tenancy rent increases and tenancy terminations upon escalation to Alert Level 4 and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development has not agreed to a SAR. If the proposal proceeds to discussion at a Cabinet committee, and substantive decisions are made, Cabinet’s impact analysis rules require the responsible Minister to provide a SAR, the nature and timing of which will be determined in conjunction with the Minister of Finance. Population Implications 193 The proposals in this paper will support our national effort to eliminate COVID-19, for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The RSP and WSS will provide additional financial support to firms to allow them to continue to pay their staff and cover non-wage costs, and quickly continue operations as soon as Alert Level restrictions allow. In turn, this benefits individuals employed by those firms. The Short-Term Absence Payment will be available to workers who have been advised to stay at home while awaiting a test result, which will help all businesses to continue to pay those taking leave from work to protect others from a potential outbreak. 194 Uptake of the SBCS and previous iterations of the WSS has been broad across sectors, ethnicities and regions, benefiting a wide cross-section of society, including women, Māori and Pasifika, who make up a significant proportion of some of the most affected sectors. We expect the take-up of a new RSP to be consistent with this, as the proposed eligibility criteria are broadly equivalent. Uptake of the LSS has been low, partly due to the criteria that it cannot be received at the same time as the WSS. The new STAP proposed in this paper will focus on workers being tested. This year testing rates have been higher for the Auckland region, women and Pasifika. 195 The proposed approach to communications set out below will seek to ensure government works and communicates with Māori and Pasifika groups and partners in order to maximise the effectiveness of the measures in these communities. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 29 Human Rights 196 There are no human rights issues raised by the Resurgence Support Payment proposal. The proposed minimum age of 18 reflects the legal minimum age for minors to enter into contracts, and is consistent with the requirements for the Small Business Cashflow Scheme. 197 In the time available, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has not been consulted on the RSP proposal. MOJ will be consulted as part of the legislative stage in early 2021. Consultation 198 The Treasury, Ministry of Social Development and Employment, Inland Revenue, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (COVID-19 Group and Policy Advisory Group) were consulted on this paper. 199 Officials engaged with Business New Zealand, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, the Chartered Accounts Australia and New Zealand, and Māori and Pacific business leaders in developing the resurgence package. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the approach to create greater certainty on the landscape of government support, and particularly welcoming of measures that address non-wage costs. 200 There was strong feedback that the integrity of the schemes will be critical, with both Māori and Pacific business leaders raising concerns about possible gaming of the WSS by large firms. It was suggested that the communications approach to the package should be accompanied by clear guidance to maximise accessibility of the schemes, and partnership with trusted community partners will also aid access. Communications 201 In order to provide business clarity on the supports provided in the event of a resurgence, we propose that the package of measures are announced by the Minister of Finance prior to Christmas. 202 Alongside the development of an announcement package, we propose that materials and content are developed and distributed across key business government channels, through the COVID-19 Group administered Unite Against COVID-19 campaign, and trusted community channels where appropriate, and for a range of audiences, including Māori and Pasifika businesses and sole traders. 203 In order to ensure consistency of content and approach, we propose that the Treasury works with operational agencies to ensure that content is prepared and is live both at the time of the announcement, as well as in the event of an escalation. To aid the uptake and support of the package, opportunities for early engagement with business stakeholders such as Business New Zealand, local chambers of commerce, and Regional Business Partners will be pursued. 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 30 Proactive Release 204 This paper will be proactively released with any appropriate withholdings as soon as practicable after public communication of the support package. The Minister of Finance is proposing to publicly announce the support package before Christmas. Recommendations The Minister of Finance, the Minister for Social Development and Employment, the Minister of Revenue, and the Minister for Small Business recommend that the Committee: 1 note that, in the event of Alert Level escalations, a comprehensive package of economic support is critical to minimise the associated economic and social impacts, and to support compliance with the public health response; 2 note that our economic response to Alert Level escalations so far has been effective, albeit with scope for further improvements; 3 note that communicating in advance a resurgence package to be introduced in the event of future escalations responds to business requests for certainty and allows firms and individuals to better plan; Resurgence package measures – summary of proposals 4 note that the package of measures proposed for use in future escalations builds on the existing model and comprises: 4.1 a new Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) to help firms directly impacted by an Alert Level change to cover their fixed costs (such as rent) when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above; 4.2 an improved Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) at Alert Level 3 and above; and 4.3 measures that relate to childcare and residential tenancies at Alert Level 4, with further work on commercial tenancies; 5 note that the indicative fiscal cost of the RSP and WSS in the following Alert Level scenarios is estimated to be: Measure AL2 nationally for four weeks AL3 nationally for 2 weeks, AL2 for 6 weeks Resurgence Support Payment $350 million $450 million Wage Subsidy Scheme N/A $960 million note that reintroducing the Childcare for Essential Workers scheme at Alert Level 4 for \[38\] four weeks is expected to cost 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 6 31 7 note that, as the proposed measures would be introduced only in the event of a future Alert Level escalation, the eventual fiscal cost depends directly on the frequency, duration and severity of any escalations; 8 note that, due to substantial uncertainty around the timing, frequency and duration of any future Alert Level escalations, funding for the resurgence package is not being sought at this time, except for administrative costs; 9 note that, except where an existing appropriation or relevant contingency has been identified, the proposed funding source for the measures, subject to Cabinet approval at the time of an escalation, is the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF), established as part of Budget 2020; 10 agree to the proposed package of measures set out in recommendation 4 for use in a future Alert Level escalation, subject to Cabinet approval at that time; 11 agree that the Minister of Finance will announce the above package prior to Christmas; Resurgence Support Payment scheme – detailed recommendations 12 note that the purpose of the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) scheme is to complement the WSS and support firms’ fixed costs when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above; 13 agree that the objectives of the RSP scheme will be to: 13.1 Support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; 13.2 Support firms to pay fixed costs if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; 13.3 Share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels to be shared between Government, firms and across economic sectors; and 13.4 Encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy; 14 agree that the RSP scheme will be administered by Inland Revenue (IR); 15 agree that the RSP scheme will provide a one-off payment to eligible firms in the initial event of an escalation from Alert Level 1 to a higher Alert Level anywhere in New Zealand, subject to approval by Cabinet at the time of an escalation from Alert Level 1 at which the scheme becomes applicable and within the parameters agreed below; 16 agree to the following parameters for the design of the RSP scheme: 16.1 the scheme will be activated after a minimum period of seven days (of which the seventh day may be a partial day) under Alert Level 2 or above; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 32 16.2 the scheme will be available nationally, recognising supply chain implications occur even when an escalation is limited to a region; 16.3 firms will be eligible if they have experienced a revenue decline of at least 30% across a 14-day consecutive period at Alert Level 2 or above (including days at Alert Level 1 if there is a national return to Alert Level 1 within 14 days of the initial escalation); 16.4 eligible firms will declare that, in respect to the declared decline in revenue, they have been affected by a current escalation from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above, and that: 16.4.1 the firm attributes the effect to the escalation in Alert Levels that began on \[date of current escalation\]; and 16.4.2 the effect has led to the decline in revenue that the firm has declared; 16.5 the default comparator period for the RSP revenue tests will be the typical fortnightly revenue in the six weeks prior to the Alert Level escalation that triggered the scheme; 16.6 firms that have highly seasonal revenue will be allowed to use a prior year comparator if they can show the seasonality in their revenue makes it harder to meet the revenue decline test with the default comparator period, than if their revenue were not seasonal; 16.7 the payment rate will be $1,500 per firm and an additional $400 per FTE, with the per-FTE component capped at 50 FTE; 16.8 eligible firms will declare that funds will be repaid if their decline in revenue is found to have been less than 30%; 16.9 eligible firms will declare that funds will be applied to business expenses only, including wages, capital expenditure and core operating costs; 16.10 eli gible firms will have to be in business for at least six months and declare that they are a “viable, ongoing business”; 16.11 the types of organisations that are eligible for the WSS will also be eligible for the RSP, including State Sector Organisations, pre-revenue firms, sole traders, charities and not-for-profit organisations (who must declare they are a “viable, ongoing organisation”); 16.12 the minimum age of an applicant will be 18 years; and 16.13 the scheme will close for applications one month after a national return to Alert Level 1; 17 note that the one payment per firm rule will apply to firms with groups of companies to avoid advantaging such firms or incentivising firms to split their businesses to increase entitlements; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 33 18 note that officials are developing a common definition of revenue across the WSS, Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) and RSP, and will report back to relevant Joint Ministers before publishing this guidance; 19 agree that firms will be able to receive the RSP alongside other forms of support, including the WSS, Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP), Leave Support Scheme (LSS) and SBCS, and that funding provided through these schemes will not count as revenue for the purposes of the RSP revenue drop test; 20 agree that existing exemptions provided to State Sector Organisations by the Minister of Finance under the WSS transfer to the RSP; 21 note that firms in receipt of the RSP will not be subject to income tax or be able to claim deductions for expenditure funded by the RSP, and that GST-registered firms will pay GST on the RSP and, in turn, be able to claim input tax deductions for the relevant expenditure; 22 authorise the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue and Minister of Small Business (Joint Ministers for the RSP) to jointly take decisions relating to the further design details and operational matters required to progress the implementation of the RSP, in alignment with the parameters agreed above; 23 note that Inland Revenue estimates that the RSP could be in place by late February 2021, subject to the required legislation; 24 direct Inland Revenue officials to draft the necessary amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to implement the RSP proposals described above; Wage Subsidy Scheme – detailed decisions 25 agree that the Government introduce a WSS in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 3 or above, anywhere in New Zealand lasting seven or more consecutive days (of which the seventh day may be a partial day), with the introduction of the scheme subject to approval by Cabinet at the time; 26 agree to provide WSS support to match the duration spent at Alert Level 3 or above, rounded to the nearest 14 days; 27 note that recommendation 26 means that WSS support could exceed or fall short of the total period spent at Alert Level 3 or above by up to one week; 28 note that employers would be able to apply for a two-weekly payment once MSD opened the WSS scheme (which is likely to be within a few days of the seventh day of elevated Alert Levels) and could apply for subsequent two-weekly payments as long as the scheme remains open, subject to recommendation 26; 29 invite the Ministers of Finance and of Social Development and Employment to report back to Cabinet on this activation approach by June 2021; 30 invite the Ministers of Finance and of Social Development and Employment to report back to Cabinet on the continued availability and settings of the WSS if it remains open for more than six consecutive weeks, and every six weeks thereafter; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 34 31 agree to retain core WSS settings including a revenue drop test of 40%, current payment rates, employee retention obligations, pass-through requirements and the scheme being available on a nationwide basis by default; 32 note that officials are progressing the following minor short-term improvements to WSS integrity: 32.1 increasing visibility and publicity around audit, enforcement and repayments, including through ministerial communications; 32.2 improving guidance for applicants to reduce error rates and improve automation rates; 32.3 clarifying the drafting of rules under the scheme, including a definition of “revenue” and eligibility of company groups; 33 agree that to be eligible for the WSS, employers must have been affected by a current escalation to Alert 3 or above, and: 33.1 the firm attributes the effect to the escalation in Alert Levels that began on \[date of current escalation\]; and 33.2 the effect has led to the decline in revenue that the firm has declared; 34 note that officials will redraft the declaration made by applicants to the WSS to reflect this change; 35 agree that the test period for the WSS revenue decline be revenue over a 14-day period following the escalation to Alert Level 3 (or above), based on actual or predicted revenue; 36 agree that the default comparator period for the WSS revenue tests be the typical fortnightly revenue in the six weeks prior to the Alert Level escalation that triggered the scheme; 37 agree that employers that have highly seasonal revenue be allowed to use a prior year comparator if they can show that the seasonality in their revenue makes it harder to meet the revenue decline test with the default comparator period, than if their revenues were not seasonal; 38 note that it may be necessary to allow exceptions from this proposed default comparator period in complex public health circumstances, such as several Alert Level escalations in quick succession which make it more difficult to identify an appropriate baseline; 39 note that employers are allowed to use the WSS to pay for periods when employees are on annual leave; 40 note that, to address any potential misunderstandings around the interaction between the WSS and employment law, in particular related to use of annual leave, Ministers and officials will provide prominent and clear explanations and expectations of employment law rights and obligations and promote existing Government employment dispute services; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 35 41 note that firms are already required to repay the WSS in a number of situations, and, due to difficulty in designing a well-targeted repayment rule under the current scheme, no additional repayment rules in relation to firm profit or revenue growth are proposed at this stage; 42 note that Ministers have asked officials, as part of advice on a more enduring WSS, to look at the feasibility of a repayment rule for employers who receive payments under the WSS, then subsequently both lay-off staff and make a profit; 43 agree to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment jointly to make operational changes, and decisions on minor changes and clarifications to WSS settings, including on any further implementation details for the revenue decline test, test and comparator period (including exceptions to the default period), and reapplication requirements; Other resurgence package measures 44 note that further design work and new legislation will be required to reinstate a freeze on residential rent increases and restrictions on tenancy terminations; 45 agree that a freeze on residential rent increases and restrictions on tenancy terminations be reinstated, subject to the passage of the required legislation and approval by Cabinet at the time of an escalation to Alert Level 4; 46 agree that an improved Childcare for Essential Workers scheme be introduced, subject to approval by Cabinet at the time of an escalation to Alert Level 4; 47 invite the Minister of Justice to report back to Cabinet in February 2021 on the matter of \[33\] commercial lease disputes, Support for individuals and whānau 48 note that the Government funded a significant number of initiatives from the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund to ensure that the safety net for low-income and vulnerable people is robust; 49 note that, in the event of future resurgence, it will be important to ensure that effective and timely support is deployed in partnership with our Treaty of Waitangi partners, with trusted local leaders, and community groups; Leave Support Scheme and new Short-Term Absence Payment 50 note that the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme (LSS) continues to remain available at all Alert Levels and promotes compliance with the public health response by supporting workers to stay home and self-isolate in certain situations; 51 note that the Ministry of Health is proposing to amend public health guidance, which will clarify that everyone who gets a COVID-19 test (other than those without symptoms that are taking part in routine or surveillance testing) should be asked to stay at home while awaiting the result; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 36 52 note that a review of the LSS has identified a need to expand the situations in which financial support is available to support compliance, and to address inefficiencies; 53 agree to address these issues by introducing a one-off COVID-19 Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP) of $350, available to eligible employers (including self-employed workers) to support them in paying workers who: 53.1 legally work in New Zealand; and 53.2 cannot work from home; and either 53.3 need to miss a shift or more from work to stay home while awaiting a test result in accordance with either public health guidance or requirements; or 53.4 are the parent or caregiver of a dependant who needs to stay home while waiting for a test result and needs support to do so safely, and the parent or caregiver needs to miss a shift or more of work while supporting their dependant. 54 agree that workers currently covered by the two-week LSS while awaiting a test result would no longer be eligible for the two-week LSS payment in the first instance and would instead be eligible for the STAP, but that, provided they meet the other criteria, could move onto the LSS if required; 55 note that the payment will not cover: 55.1 employers in respect of workers who are not legally working in New Zealand; 55.2 businesses registered or operating outside New Zealand; 55.3 employers, including self-employed people, who are receiving a WSS or LSS payment for that named worker at that time; 55.4 workers who can work from home; 55.5 workers who have routine testing in their workplace such as border workers and MIQ workers (unless they are symptomatic); 55.6 non-symptomatic people participating in surveillance testing; 55.7 people staying in managed isolation facilities; 55.8 New Zealanders who are currently overseas; 55.9 State Sector Organisations (including State Owned Enterprises), except where an exception has been granted in relation to the WSS or LSS; or 55.10 workers of entities other than registered business, sole traders, self-employed persons, registered charities, incorporated societies, non-government organisations, or post settlement governance entities; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 37 56 agree that employers are able to apply a maximum of once in any thirty-day period for the STAP for each individual worker (unless a health official or medical practitioner advises or requires the worker to re-test); \[39\] 57 note that MSD will administer the STAP using a very high-trust approach, 58 note that the STAP will not override an employer’s legal obligations under employment law; 59 note that MSD’s ability to process applications under the STAP will be limited in situations in which applications are open for the WSS or there is a surge in applications for the LSS; 60 authorise the Minister of Finance, Minister for Social Development and Employment, and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety to make minor policy decisions and clarify eligibility criteria regarding the LSS and STAP if required within the overall policy settings set out in this paper, including: 60.1 to align eligibility settings with public health guidance regarding testing, self- isolation and staying home when sick; 60.2 the implementation date; and 60.3 repayment obligations; Legislative implications 61 note that legislation will be required to enable Inland Revenue to deliver the proposed new RSP, with legislation expected to be introduced in early 2021; 62 note that legislation will be required to implement the freeze on residential tenancy rent increases and tenancy terminations, with the current expectation being that this legislation will not be progressed unless a shift to Alert Level 4 is imminent; Financial recommendations – resurgence package and new STAP 63 note that, as at 4 December 2020, approximately $12.84 billion remains in the CRRF, although there are likely to be upcoming calls on this funding of approximately $2.8 billion, leaving approximately $10 billion, which is sufficient to fund the estimated costs of the proposed resurgence package through multiple resurgence events, based on the estimated fiscal costs of the measures set out at recommendations 5 and 6 above; 64 agree that future payments of the WSS could be funded in the first instance from a balance of approximately $1.3 billion remaining in the existing Business Support Subsidy Covid-19 appropriation in Vote Social Development; 65 agree that future payments of the Childcare for Essential Workers support could be met through reprioritisation of funding previously appropriated to Vote Education or through \[33\] Cabinet approval 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 38 66 direct Ministry of Education officials to report back to the Minister of Education and the Minister of Finance on the appropriate hourly subsidy rate, the cost of the scheme over a four-week period, and the funding source by the end of March 2021; 67 authorise the Minister of Education and the Minister of Finance jointly to agree the appropriate hourly rate and funding option for future payments of the Childcare for Essential Workers support, to avoid delays in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 4 when Cabinet approval will be sought; 68 agree to provide Inland Revenue with funding to build the administrative capabilities required to deliver the RSP scheme, ending in 2024/25; 69 note that Inland Revenue expects it will need to provide for administrative costs across the period 2020/21 to 2022/2023 while the scheme is in place, whether or not it is activated; 70 agree that any underspends for 2023/24 and 2024/25 relating to the funding described at recommendation 68 above be returned to the Centre; 71 approve the following changes to appropriations to give effect to the decision in recommendation 68 with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net core Crown debt: $ million -increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 Multi-Category Expenses and Capital Expenditure: Services for Customers (MCA) Departmental Output Expenses: Investigations (funded by revenue Crown) Services to Inform the Minister and to Inform the Public about Entitlements and Meeting Obligations (funded by revenue Crown) Services to Process Obligations and Entitlements (funded by revenue Crown) - - - 0.708 1.416 0.876 0.708 1.416 0.876 0.354 0.708 0.438 0.354 0.708 0.438 Total operating -3.000 3.000 1.500 1.500 39 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 72 agree that the expenses incurred as a result of recommendation 71 be charged against the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF), established as part of Budget 2020; 73 note that the likely cost of the STAP, including administration costs for MSD, is still being determined, but could potentially be very significant if there are high rates of testing, high numbers of people advised to stay home while sick, and there is high take- up of the payment by those eligible; 74 agree that the costs of payments under the STAP should be met in the first instance from a balance of approximately $85 million remaining in the existing COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme appropriation in Vote Social Development; 75 direct officials to report back to the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety and the Minister for Social Development and Employment with updated fiscal cost estimates including administration costs, based on expected take-up of the LSS and STAP and any required amendments to settings, once the changes to health guidance have been confirmed; 76 authorise the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety and the Minister for Social Development and Employment to agree to new operating funding of up to $10 million for Vote Social Development for the administration of the STAP, with the associated expenses to be charged against the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund established as part of Budget 2020, with any further funding required to be sought from Cabinet; Preparedness in the near term 77 note that the proposals in this paper relating to the new RSP and STAP and some of the proposed changes to the WSS will not be in place until February 2021 or later; 78 note that, should there be a resurgence in the interim, the WSS can be reinstated within approximately five working days; 79 note that the Ministry of Social Development is undertaking contingency planning for the Christmas period, and is prepared to implement the WSS over this period if needed; 80 note that the decision to escalate Alert Levels in the event of community transmission rests with Ministers with Power to Act \[CBC-20-MIN-0096 refers\]; 81 authorise the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment jointly, in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 3 or above over the Christmas holiday period, to take the necessary decisions to introduce the WSS, with costs to be met in the first instance from a balance of approximately $1.3 billion remaining in the existing Business Support Subsidy COVID-19 appropriation in Vote Social Development; and 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-14 11:39:24 40 82 agree that the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment will jointly seek Cabinet approval for funding to meet the costs of introducing the WSS over the Christmas holiday period, if costs are estimated to exceed the existing balance of appropriated funding described in recommendation 81 above.

Economic Response to Future Resurgences of COVID-19 Portfolios Finance / Social Development and Employment / Revenue / Small Business On 14 December 2020, Cabinet: Background 1 noted that, in the event of COVID-19 Alert Level escalations, a comprehensive package of economic support is critical to minimise the associated economic and social impacts, and to support compliance with the public health response; 2 noted that the government’s economic response to Alert Level escalations so far has been effective, albeit with scope for further improvements; 3 noted that communicating in advance a resurgence package to be introduced in the event of future escalations responds to business requests for certainty and allows firms and individuals to better plan; Resurgence package measures – summary of proposals 4 noted that the package of measures proposed for use in future escalations builds on the existing model and comprises: 4.1 a new Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) to help firms directly impacted by an Alert Level change to cover their fixed costs (such as rent) when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above; 4.2 an improved Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) at Alert Level 3 and above; and 4.3 measures that relate to childcare and residential tenancies at Alert Level 4, with further work on commercial tenancies; 5 noted that the indicative fiscal cost of the RSP and WSS in the following Alert Level scenarios is estimated to be: Measure AL2 nationally for four AL3 nationally for two weeks weeks, AL2 for six weeks Resurgence Support Payment $350 million $450 million Wage Subsidy Scheme N/A $960 million 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 1 CAB-20-MIN-0531 6 noted that reintroducing the Childcare for Essential Workers scheme at Alert Level 4 for four weeks is expected to cost \[38\] 7 noted that, as the proposed measures would be introduced only in the event of a future Alert Level escalation, the eventual fiscal cost depends directly on the frequency, duration and severity of any escalations; 8 noted that, due to substantial uncertainty around the timing, frequency and duration of any future Alert Level escalations, funding for the resurgence package is not being sought at this time, except for administrative costs; 9 noted that, except where an existing appropriation or relevant contingency has been identified, the proposed funding source for the measures, subject to Cabinet approval at the time of an escalation, is the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF), established as part of Budget 2020; 10 agreed to the proposed package of measures set out in paragraph 4 above for use in a future Alert Level escalation, subject to Cabinet approval at that time; 11 agreed that the Minister of Finance announce the above package prior to Christmas 2020; Resurgence Support Payment scheme – detailed recommendations 12 noted that the purpose of the RSP scheme is to complement the WSS and support firms’ fixed costs when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above; 13 agreed that the objectives of the RSP scheme be to: 13.1 support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; 13.2 support firms to pay fixed costs if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; 13.3 share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels to be shared between government, firms and across economic sectors; 13.4 encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy; 14 agreed that the RSP scheme be administered by Inland Revenue; 15 agreed that the RSP scheme will provide a one-off payment to eligible firms in the initial event of an escalation from Alert Level 1 to a higher Alert Level anywhere in New Zealand, subject to approval by Cabinet at the time of an escalation from Alert Level 1 at which the scheme becomes applicable and within the parameters agreed below; 16 agreed to the following parameters for the design of the RSP scheme: 16.1 the scheme will be activated after a minimum period of seven days (of which the seventh day may be a partial day) under Alert Level 2 or above; 16.2 the scheme will be available nationally, recognising that supply chain implications occur even when an escalation is limited to a region; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 2 CAB-20-MIN-0531 16.3 firms will be eligible if they have experienced a revenue decline of at least 30 percent across a 14-day consecutive period at Alert Level 2 or above (including days at Alert Level 1 if there is a national return to Alert Level 1 within 14 days of the initial escalation); 16.4 eligible firms will declare that, in respect to the declared decline in revenue, they have been affected by a current escalation from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above, and that: 16.4.1 the firm attributes the effect to the escalation in Alert Levels that began on the date of the current escalation; and 16.4.2 the effect has led to the decline in revenue that the firm has declared; 16.5 the default comparator period for the RSP revenue tests will be the typical fortnightly revenue in the six weeks prior to the Alert Level escalation that triggered the scheme; 16.6 firms that have highly seasonal revenue will be allowed to use a prior year comparator if they can show the seasonality in their revenue makes it harder to meet the revenue decline test with the default comparator period, than if their revenue were not seasonal; 16.7 the payment rate will be $1,500 per firm and an additional $400 per FTE, with the per-FTE component capped at 50 FTE; 16.8 eligible firms will declare that funds will be repaid if their decline in revenue is found to have been less than 30 percent; 16.9 eligible firms will declare that funds will be applied to business expenses only, including wages, capital expenditure and core operating costs; 16.10 eligible firms will have to be in business for at least six months and declare that they are a ‘viable, ongoing business’; 16.11 the types of organisations that are eligible for the WSS will also be eligible for the RSP, including State sector organisations, pre-revenue firms, sole traders, charities and not-for-profit organisations (who must declare they are a ‘viable, ongoing organisation’); 16.12 the minimum age of an applicant will be 18 years; and 16.13 the scheme will close for applications one month after a national return to Alert Level 1; 17 noted that the one payment per firm rule will apply to firms with groups of companies to avoid advantaging such firms or incentivising firms to split their businesses to increase entitlements; 18 noted that officials are developing a common definition of revenue across the WSS, Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) and RSP, and will report back to relevant Joint Ministers before publishing this guidance; 19 agreed that firms will be able to receive the RSP alongside other forms of support, including the WSS, Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP), Leave Support Scheme (LSS) and SBCS, and that funding provided through these schemes will not count as revenue for the purposes of the RSP revenue drop test; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 3 CAB-20-MIN-0531 20 agreed that existing exemptions provided to State sector organisations by the Minister of Finance under the WSS transfer to the RSP; 21 noted that firms in receipt of the RSP will not be subject to income tax or be able to claim deductions for expenditure funded by the RSP, and that GST-registered firms will pay GST on the RSP and, in turn, be able to claim input tax deductions for the relevant expenditure; 22 authorised the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Revenue and the Minister for Small Business (Joint Ministers for the RSP) to jointly take decisions relating to the further design details and operational matters required to progress the implementation of the RSP, in alignment with the parameters agreed above; 23 noted that Inland Revenue estimates that the RSP could be in place by late February 2021 and could be applied retrospectively, subject to the required legislation; 24 directed Inland Revenue officials to draft the necessary amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to implement the RSP proposals described above; Wage Subsidy Scheme – detailed decisions 25 agreed that the government introduce a WSS in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 3 or above, anywhere in New Zealand lasting seven or more consecutive days (of which the seventh day may be a partial day), with the introduction of the scheme subject to approval by Cabinet at the time; 26 agreed to provide WSS support to match the duration spent at Alert Level 3 or above, rounded to the nearest 14 days; 27 noted that the proposal in paragraph 26 above means that WSS support could exceed or fall short of the total period spent at Alert Level 3 or above by up to one week; 28 noted that employers would be able to apply for a two-weekly payment once Ministry of Social Development opened the WSS scheme (which is likely to be within a few days of the seventh day of elevated Alert Levels), and could apply for subsequent two-weekly payments as long as the scheme remains open, subject to paragraph 26 above; 29 invited the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment to report back to Cabinet on this activation approach by June 2021; 30 invited the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment to report back to Cabinet on the continued availability and settings of the WSS if it remains open for more than six consecutive weeks, and every six weeks thereafter; 31 agreed to retain core WSS settings, including a revenue drop test of 40 percent, current payment rates, employee retention obligations, pass-through requirements, and the scheme being available on a nationwide basis by default; 32 noted that officials are progressing the following minor short-term improvements to WSS integrity: 32.1 increasing visibility and publicity around audit, enforcement and repayments, including through Ministerial communications; 32.2 improving guidance for applicants to reduce error rates and improve automation rates; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 4 CAB-20-MIN-0531 32.3 clarifying the drafting of rules under the scheme, including a definition of ‘revenue’ and eligibility of company groups; 33 agreed that to be eligible for the WSS, employers must have been affected by a current escalation to Alert 3 or above, and: 33.1 the firm attributes the effect to the escalation in Alert Levels that began on the date of the current escalation; and 33.2 the effect has led to the decline in revenue that the firm has declared; 34 noted that officials will redraft the declaration made by applicants to the WSS to reflect this change; 35 agreed that the test period for the WSS revenue decline be revenue over a 14-day period following the escalation to Alert Level 3 (or above), based on actual or predicted revenue; 36 agreed that the default comparator period for the WSS revenue tests be the typical fortnightly revenue in the six weeks prior to the Alert Level escalation that triggered the scheme; 37 agreed that employers that have highly seasonal revenue be allowed to use a prior year comparator if they can show that the seasonality in their revenue makes it harder to meet the revenue decline test with the default comparator period, than if their revenues were not seasonal; 38 noted that it may be necessary to allow exceptions from this proposed default comparator period in complex public health circumstances, such as several Alert Level escalations in quick succession which make it more difficult to identify an appropriate baseline; 39 noted that employers are allowed to use the WSS to pay for periods when employees are on annual leave; 40 noted that, to address any potential misunderstandings around the interaction between the WSS and employment law, in particular related to the use of annual leave, Ministers and officials will provide prominent and clear explanations and expectations of employment law rights and obligations and promote existing government employment dispute services; 41 noted that firms are already required to repay the WSS in a number of situations, and that, due to difficulty in designing a well-targeted repayment rule under the current scheme, no additional repayment rules in relation to firm profit or revenue growth are proposed at this stage; 42 noted that Ministers have asked officials, as part of advice on a more enduring WSS, to look at the feasibility of a repayment rule for employers who receive payments under the WSS, then subsequently both lay-off staff and make a profit; 43 authorised the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment jointly to make operational changes, and decisions on minor changes and clarifications to WSS settings, including on any further implementation details for the revenue decline test, test and comparator period (including exceptions to the default period), and reapplication requirements; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 5 CAB-20-MIN-0531 Other resurgence package measures 44 noted that further design work and new legislation will be required to reinstate a freeze on residential rent increases and restrictions on tenancy terminations; 45 agreed that a freeze on residential rent increases and restrictions on tenancy terminations be reinstated, subject to the passage of the required legislation and approval by Cabinet at the time of an escalation to Alert Level 4; 46 agreed that an improved Childcare for Essential Workers scheme be introduced, subject to approval by Cabinet at the time of an escalation to Alert Level 4; 47 invited the Minister of Justice to report back to Cabinet in February 2021 on the matter of \[33\] commercial lease disputes, Support for individuals and whānau 48 noted that the government funded a significant number of initiatives from the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund to ensure that the safety net for low-income and vulnerable people is robust; 49 noted that, in the event of future resurgence, it will be important to ensure that effective and timely support is deployed in partnership with Treaty of Waitangi partners, with trusted local leaders, and community groups; Leave Support Scheme and new Short-Term Absence Payment 50 noted that the COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme (LSS) continues to remain available at all Alert Levels, and that the LSS promotes compliance with the public health response by supporting workers to stay home and self-isolate in certain situations; 51 noted that the Ministry of Health is proposing to amend public health guidance, which will clarify that everyone who gets a COVID-19 test (other than those without symptoms that are taking part in routine or surveillance testing) should be asked to stay at home while awaiting the result; 52 noted that a review of the LSS has identified a need to expand the situations in which financial support is available to support compliance, and to address inefficiencies; 53 agreed to address these issues by introducing a one-off COVID-19 Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP) of $350, available to eligible employers (including self-employed workers) to support them in paying workers who: 53.1 legally work in New Zealand; and 53.2 cannot work from home; and either 53.3 need to miss a shift or more from work to stay home while awaiting a test result in accordance with either public health guidance or requirements; or 53.4 are the parent or caregiver of a dependant who needs to stay home while waiting for a test result and needs support to do so safely, and the parent or caregiver needs to miss a shift or more of work while supporting their dependant; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 6 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 CAB-20-MIN-0531 agreed that workers currently covered by the two-week LSS while awaiting a test result would no longer be eligible for the two-week LSS payment in the first instance and would instead be eligible for the STAP, but that, provided they meet the other criteria, could move onto the LSS if required; noted that the payment will not cover: 55.1 employers in respect of workers who are not legally working in New Zealand; 55.2 businesses registered or operating outside New Zealand; 55.3 employers, including self-employed people, who are receiving a WSS or LSS payment for that named worker at that time; 55.4 workers who can work from home; 55.5 workers who have routine testing in their workplace, such as border workers and MIQ workers (unless they are symptomatic); 55.6 non-symptomatic people participating in surveillance testing; 55.7 people staying in managed isolation facilities; 55.8 New Zealanders who are currently overseas; 55.9 State sector organisations (including State Owned Enterprises), except where an exception has been granted in relation to the WSS or LSS; or 55.10 workers of entities other than registered business, sole traders, self-employed persons, registered charities, incorporated societies, non-government organisations, or post settlement governance entities; agreed that employers are able to apply a maximum of once in any thirty-day period for the STAP for each individual worker (unless a health official or medical practitioner advises or requires the worker to re-test); noted that the Ministry of Social Development will administer the STAP using a very high- \[39\] trust approach, noted that the STAP will not override an employer’s legal obligations under employment law; noted that the Ministry of Social Development’s ability to process applications under the STAP will be limited in situations in which applications are open for the WSS or there is a surge in applications for the LSS; authorised the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Social Development and Employment, and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety to make minor policy decisions and clarify eligibility criteria regarding the LSS and STAP if required within the overall policy settings set out in the paper under CAB-2-SUB-0531, including: 60.1 to align eligibility settings with public health guidance regarding testing, self- isolation and staying home when sick; 60.2 the implementation date; and 60.3 repayment obligations; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 7 CAB-20-MIN-0531 Legislative implications 61 noted that legislation will be required to enable Inland Revenue to deliver the proposed new RSP, with legislation expected to be introduced in early 2021; 62 noted that legislation will be required to implement the freeze on residential tenancy rent increases and tenancy terminations, with the current expectation being that this legislation will not be progressed unless a shift to Alert Level 4 is imminent; Financial implications – resurgence package and new STAP 63 noted that, as at 4 December 2020, approximately $12.84 billion remains in the CRRF, although there are likely to be upcoming calls on this funding of approximately $2.8 billion, leaving approximately $10 billion, which is sufficient to fund the estimated costs of the proposed resurgence package through multiple resurgence events, based on the estimated fiscal costs of the measures set out at paragraphs 5 and 6 above; 64 agreed that future payments of the WSS could be funded in the first instance from a balance of approximately $1.3 billion remaining in the existing Business Support Subsidy COVID-19 appropriation in Vote Social Development; 65 agreed that future payments of the Childcare for Essential Workers support could be met through reprioritisation of funding previously appropriated to Vote Education or through \[33\] Cabinet approval 66 directed Ministry of Education officials to report back to the Minister of Education and the Minister of Finance by the end of March 2021 on the appropriate hourly subsidy rate, the cost of the scheme over a four-week period, and the funding source; 67 authorised the Minister of Education and the Minister of Finance jointly to agree the appropriate hourly rate and funding option for future payments of the Childcare for Essential Workers support, to avoid delays in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 4 when Cabinet approval will be sought; 68 agreed to provide Inland Revenue with funding to build the administrative capabilities required to deliver the RSP scheme, ending in 2024/25; 69 noted that Inland Revenue expects it will need to provide for administrative costs across the period 2020/21 to 2022/2023 while the scheme is in place, whether or not it is activated; 70 agreed that any underspends for 2023/24 and 2024/25 relating to the funding described at paragraph 68 above be returned to the Centre; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 8 CAB-20-MIN-0531 71 approved the following changes to appropriations to give effect to the decision in paragraph 68 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net core Crown debt: Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue Multi-Category Expenses and Capital Expenditure: Services for Customers (MCA) Departmental Output Expenses: Investigations (funded by revenue Crown) Services to Inform the Minister and to Inform the Public about Entitlements and Meeting Obligations (funded by revenue Crown) Services to Process Obligations and Entitlements (funded by revenue Crown) Total operating 2020/21 - - - - 2021/22 0.708 1.416 0.876 3.000 $ million - increase / (decrease) 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 0.708 0.354 0.354 1.416 0.708 0.708 0.876 0.438 0.438 3.000 1.500 1.500 72 agreed that the expenses incurred under paragraph 71 above be charged against the CRRF, established as part of Budget 2020; 73 noted that the likely cost of the STAP, including administration costs for the Ministry of Social Development, is still being determined, but could potentially be very significant if there are high rates of testing, high numbers of people advised to stay home while sick, and there is high take-up of the payment by those eligible; 74 agreed that the costs of payments under the STAP should be met in the first instance from a balance of approximately $85 million remaining in the existing COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme appropriation in Vote Social Development; 75 directed officials to report back to the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety and the Minister for Social Development and Employment with updated fiscal cost estimates, including administration costs, based on expected take-up of the LSS and STAP and any required amendments to settings, once the changes to health guidance have been confirmed; 76 authorised the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety and the Minister for Social Development and Employment to agree to new operating funding of up to $10 million for Vote Social Development for the administration of the STAP, with the associated expenses to be charged against the CRFF established as part of Budget 2020, with any further funding required to be sought from Cabinet; Preparedness in the near term 77 noted that the proposals in the paper under CAB-20-SUB-0531 relating to the new RSP and STAP and some of the proposed changes to the WSS will not be in place until February 2021 or later; 78 noted that, should there be a resurgence in the interim, the WSS can be reinstated within approximately five working days; 31gum3lkfh 2020-12-16 09:07:25 9 CAB-20-MIN-0531 79 noted that the Ministry of Social Development is undertaking contingency planning for the Christmas 2020 period, and is prepared to implement the WSS over this period if needed; 80 noted that the decision to escalate Alert Levels in the event of community transmission rests with Ministers with Power to Act \[CBC-20-MIN-0096\]; 81 authorised the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment jointly, in the event of an escalation to Alert Level 3 or above over the Christmas 2020 holiday period, to take the necessary decisions to introduce the WSS, with costs to be met in the first instance from a balance of approximately $1.3 billion remaining in the existing Business Support Subsidy COVID-19 appropriation in Vote Social Development; 82 invited the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Social Development and Employment jointly to seek Cabinet approval for funding to meet the costs of introducing the WSS over the Christmas 2020 holiday period, if costs are estimated to exceed the existing balance of appropriated funding described in paragraph 81 above.

This report seeks agreement to certain features of the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP). 10. Cabinet agreed \[CAB-20-MIN-0531\] to introduce a new RSP to help firms directly impacted by an escalation from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or higher. 11. Cabinet has agreed the main parameters of the scheme, including: • The RSP will be a one-off payment to offset businesses’ increased costs when public health restrictions are imposed and provide cashflow support. • Firms will be eligible if they have experienced a revenue decline of at least 30% across a 14-day period at Alert Level 2 or above and the firm attributes the decline to the increase in Alert Levels • The payment will be $1,500 per firm plus $400 per FTE, with the FTE component capped at 50 FTEs – meaning a maximum of $21,500 • Inland Revenue will implement the RSP. 12. Inland Revenue is currently building the scheme. In doing so, various issues have been identified that require resolution. 13. Cabinet authorised you - the Ministers of Finance, Revenue and for Small Business - to jointly take decisions relating to further design details. 14. This report seeks your agreement to proposals relating to: • Whether the payment amount of the RSP is adjusted for low revenue firms • Whether the names of RSP recipients will be published • Whether a New Zealand Business Number should be mandatory for applicants. 15. The report also informs you of various minor design decisions that Inland Revenue has taken in designing the scheme. Low revenue firms 16. The decisions establishing the RSP (and associated public communication) have not imposed any minimum revenue rules for applicants. 17. Some low revenue firms may gain disproportionately from the RSP, in excess of their needs to meet fixed costs and transition costs. For example, if a sole trader sells items at a weekend market and earns $300 per week, they will suffer a 100% revenue drop if the market is shut at Alert Level 2 and would be entitled to $1,900 from the RSP. If the market were closed for 3 weeks, they would have suffered a $900 fall in revenue. A similar issue could arise in the case of an individual making a small supplementary income as, for instance, an Uber driver. 18. The argument against adjusting the scheme to address the issue is that it would add complexity to the scheme. Stakeholder feedback on the wage subsidy and small business cashflow scheme has consistently raised the importance on take-up of simplicity in scheme design. Feedback suggests the risk of loss of engagement with support schemes as complexity increases affects Maori and Pacific populations more so than others. In Confidence IR2021/010; T2021/059, MBIE2021/1986: Further Decisions for the Resurgence Support Payment Page 4 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 19. On balance, however, officials recommend an adjustment for low revenue businesses whereby the amount of payment is capped at two times the fortnightly drop in revenue that the applicant has signalled in its application. This means the amount a firm receives will be the lower of the formula amount ($1,500 plus $400 per FTE) or two times the fortnightly drop in revenue. 20. There is no exact science to choosing a suitable payment amount. Providing twice the revenue drop experienced by firms will likely be sufficient for most affected firms for the length of time in Alert Level 2, without being disproportionately generous. 21. Calibrating the RSP amount in this way is likely to reduce the payment for 25% of applicants, given the uptake amongst small firms and sole traders is likely to be high. We estimate the fiscal savings from this adjustment to be $30-50 million, depending on the severity of the resurgence event. Introducing this adjustment could avoid undermining social license for the scheme arising from applicants receiving a windfall gain as a result of the country going into Alert Level 2. 22. Almost all of the firms receiving a lesser payment amount as a result of this change are expected to be sole traders or firms with 1 – 3 employees. The proposed cap is expected to affect a very small number of medium-sized firms which have low revenue for their size. 23. We have considered cases where the uneven time profile of a firm’s revenue could result in them receiving a lesser payment under the RSP, and note that the application process and guidance provides enough flexibility for the needs of legitimately impacted firms to be met. 24. We consider it preferable to address low revenue firms in this way rather than imposing a revenue floor and excluding firms earning below that level, as such an approach could incentivise gaming around that boundary and lead to the exclusion of legitimate claims. 25. Such an approach will not require any additional effort by applicants. To support the integrity of the scheme, Inland Revenue will require applicants to state their revenue in the COVID-affected fortnight and their revenue in the comparator fortnight. The payment amount they would be eligible for can be automatically calculated as part of their application process. As such, the transaction cost to a firm in accessing the scheme is not increased by the proposed change. Name publication 26. A feature of the wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is that the names of recipients are published for integrity reasons. However, this does not apply to recipients of the small business cashflow scheme (SBCS). 27. There are arguments for and against publishing the names of recipients of the RSP. 28. The fact that it is a grant rather than a loan, points to the WSS providing the stronger precedent. 29. However, there are features of the RSP that distinguish it from the WSS. 30. Recipients of the WSS have an obligation to pass the payment on as wages. Name publication serves as an integrity measure in that employees are able to check whether their employer has received the WSS and therefore has an obligation not to lay them off. There is no such requirement with the RSP. 31. Also, payments for the RSP are capped at 50 FTEs, meaning the maximum amount that can be received is $21,500. In contrast, some WSS recipients received well over $1 million. In Confidence IR2021/010; T2021/059, MBIE2021/1986: Further Decisions for the Resurgence Support Payment Page 5 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 32. Finally, we note that the Ministry of Social Development has opted not to publish WSS recipients with one or two employees, as a result of privacy and ethical issues associated with publishing the names of very small businesses. 33. If the distribution of recipients of the RSP matches that of the WSS, not publishing recipients with one or two employees would exclude over half the recipients. 34. For these reasons, officials recommend not publishing the names of RSP recipients. Provision of New Zealand Business Numbers (NZBNs) 35. It is a requirement of the SBCS that applicants provide their New Zealand Business Number (NZBN). This has provided some modest integrity benefits for the scheme within the overall context of it being a high trust scheme. It has also driven uptake of NZBN and promoted the use of NZBNs by businesses in other interactions with Government and businesses. This will have long term benefits as these sorts of interactions become increasingly digital, for which use of the NZBN is desirable. 36. It is proposed that a similar requirement is adopted for the RSP. 37. If Ministers agree, Inland Revenue will incorporate this requirement into the application process. Inland Revenue will provide a link from the application screen to the NZBN site that lets an applicant check an existing NZBN or obtain one. 38. Most applicants to the RSP will already have an NZBN as “registered” organisations, such as companies, charitable trusts and incorporated societies, automatically have one. 39. Those that do not already have an NZBN can apply for one online. The online application process is automated and 80% of applicants receive their NZBN immediately. The remaining 20% require manual intervention, usually because there is a discrepancy in the identity information that they have supplied. Because applicants to the RSP must wait at least 14 days after the start of Alert Level 2 (to establish their actual revenue drop), any delay in receiving the NZBN need not delay application for the RSP. 40. NZBNs are regulated under the New Zealand Business Number Act 2016. This Act provides that requiring entities to provide an NZBN needs to be authorised by an Order in Council. Officials will prepare the application for this Order in Council for the Minister for Small Business to submit to Cabinet. Decisions taken by Inland Revenue 41. In de veloping the RSP, Inland Revenue has taken the following decisions relating to the scheme’s design. Intermediaries 42. Inland Revenue will allow tax agents to apply on behalf of their clients, subject to the agent declaring they have the authority to do so and holding evidence of their authority. This differs from the SBCS where tax agents are not permitted to apply on behalf of their clients. That restriction is because, being a loan, Inland Revenue needs the applicant to commit to repayment. This issue does not arise with the RSP. Definition of passive income 43. The definition of revenue, for the purpose of satisfying the revenue drop text, will exclude all residential and commercial rents, along with interest and dividends. This In Confidence IR2021/010; T2021/059, MBIE2021/1986: Further Decisions for the Resurgence Support Payment Page 6 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] is the simplest approach, which will assist in providing clear guidance to applicants. Although some potential applicants may be “actively in business” as a landlord, Inland Revenue considers that the likelihood of these firms meeting the revenue drop test is low, given they would hold a portfolio of properties. Accordingly, it does not consider their exclusion will have a material impact on applicants' eligibility for the RSP. Interest on repayments 44. Inland Revenue will charge interest where an applicant is required to repay the RSP (for instance, for making a false declaration). This is a deterrence measure. Though criminal prosecution will be available in the case of false declarations, such a step is resource intensive and may not be cost-effective in all cases. The prospect of interest charges will buttress the threat of prosecution. 45. Interest will be charged at the UOMI rate from when the funds are received. Calculation of Full Time Equivalent Employees (FTEs) 46. FTEs will be calculated the same way as for the SBCS. Applicants will assign their employees to full time or part time status depending on whether they usually work more than 20 hours per week. For calculating FTEs, a part timer will count as 0.6 of an FTE. The total number of FTEs will be rounded up to the next whole number. 47. This methodology was criticised by some potential recipients of the SBCS as it caused their FTE total to exceed 50 and they were therefore ineligible for the SBCS. However, because the RSP is capped at 50 FTEs rather than setting 50 FTEs as a hard boundary, this complaint is unlikely to arise. Bank accounts for receiving the RSP 48. Inland Revenue will only pay the RSP to a New Zealand bank account. This is the same approach as adopted for the SBCS. Repayment not required if applicant receives insurance 49. The wage subsidy requires an applicant to repay the subsidy if it receives insurance to cover any costs covered by the subsidy. This is not the intention for the RSP. However, the Cabinet paper is ambiguous on this point. For clarity, Inland Revenue will not require repayment if an insurance payment is received, but repayment will be required if the conditions of the grant are not met, such as the applicant not having experienced the declared revenue decline or the decline not being linked to the escalation in Alert Levels. Consultation 50. The development of the RSP and associated Cabinet paper was informed by consultation with The Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Business New Zealand. Previously there had been consultation on the COVID-related support measures with a wider group, including community groups. However, no specific consultation has occurred relating to the issues set out in this report. Next steps 51. Inland Revenue will incorporate Ministers’ decisions into the design of the RSP. In Confidence IR2021/010; T2021/059, MBIE2021/1986: Further Decisions for the Resurgence Support Payment Page 7 of 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 52. Inland Revenue is on track for the scheme being ready to implement at the end of February. Officials are preparing the legislation and related materials that will enable the scheme to be activated. It is expected that the legislation will be passed under urgency in mid-February. Should there be a period at Alert Level 2 or higher before then, there will be an option to implement the RSP in respect of this earlier period once the legislation is passed.

The Cabinet paper seeks approval to introduce the Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill on 16 February 2021 and recommends that it is passed under urgency. 3. A draft disclosure statement is attached to accompany the Cabinet Paper in accordance with Cabinet guidelines. The draft disclosure statement is referred to Cabinet along with the Cabinet paper. The disclosure statement is finalised by Inland Revenue with the Parliamentary Counsel Office three days before the introduction of the Bill and is made public when the Bill is introduced. 4. The Supplementary Analysis Report has been provided as the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) proposal was not submitted with a regulatory impact assessment when considered by Cabinet. 5. A draft of the commentary is also attached to this report. It will be published when the Bill is introduced. 6. The Bill contains the items listed below. Policy items approved by Cabinet • COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment (CAB-20-MIN-0531 refers). • Adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit (CAB-20-MIN-0512 refers). Policy items approved by Joint Ministers for the Resurgence Support Payment 7.

If alert levels escalate before 9 February 2021, businesses may need to wait longer than originally intended to apply for the payment. (Normally, businesses may apply when alert levels are escalated for 14 days, subject to Cabinet decision.) This may impact the smallest firms; however, the impact is mitigated if alert levels do not increase to AL3 or AL4. Businesses may use any 14-day period after the alert level escalation as their revenue drop period (within the bounds of eligibility criteria).

The Bill introduces amendments to the: 1.1 Income Tax Act 2007; 1.2 Tax Administration Act 1994; 2.The Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill has been recommended to hold a category 2 priority on the 2021 Legislative Programme (to be passed in the year). Policy 3.The Bill will implement the policy changes previously agreed to by Cabinet to i ntroduce the Resurgence Support Payment and to adjust the Minimum Family Tax Credit threshold. A Bill is necessary as amendments to existing legislation are required to implement the proposed policy changes. Policy Items with Cabinet Approval Resurgence Support Payment (CAB-20-MIN-0531, 14 December 2020 refers) 4.The Resurgence Support Payment (RSP), approved by Cabinet on 14 December 2020 will provide financial support to firms in the event of an Alert Level change from Level 1 to Level 2 or higher. This will help firms cover their fixed costs in the event of an escalation in public health restrictions from Alert Level 1. Cabinet agreed the payment will provide support of $1,500 per firm and an additional $400 per-FTE, with the per-FTE component capped at 50 FTE. Firms will be required to show that the lift in alert levels has caused a decline in revenue of at least 30% in order to be eligible for the payment. 5.Cabinet also delegated authority to the Joint Ministers for the RSP (the Minister of F inance, the Minister of Revenue and the Minister for Small Business) to make 1 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-11 20:43:18 11. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] decisions relating to further design details and operational matters. The most significant of these decisions are: 5.1 Capping the amount that can be received by firms to prevent disproportionate gains by low revenue firms. Firms will receive the lower of: 5.1.1 the formula amount ($1,500 and an additional $400 per FTE), or, 5.1.2 two times the fortnightly drop in revenue. 5.2 Allowing the publication of the names of recipients with three or more employees. 5.3 Requiring that applicants provide their New Zealand Business Numbers. 6. Subject to legislation being enacted, Inland Revenue have advised that the scheme will be in place and able to be activated from Tuesday 23 February. The scheme can be activated via an Order in Council in the event of an Alert Level change. Adjustment to the Minimum Family Tax Credit (CAB-20-MIN-0512, 7 December 2020 refers) 7. The Minimum Family Tax credit seeks to ensure that families do not suffer a reduction in income when moving off benefit into paid work. Cabinet agreed to changes to the abatement thresholds for main benefits on 7 December 2020, with effect from 1 April 2021. As a consequence of this change, the MFTC threshold will need to be adjusted from 1 April 2021. Legislation needs to be in place before 23 February to allow Inland Revenue to make the communications and process changes to allow the increased MFTC to take effect from 1 April 2021. 8. The agreed MFTC change is a partial increase, which will cover approximately 90% of the MFTC recipient population. Partially, rather than fully increasing the MFTC rate represents a change in policy and could result in the perception of a relative reduction in the MFTC rate. This change may be contentious as there will be some current recipients of the MFTC who would receive more income on a main benefit rather than in work. Financial Implications 9. There are no direct fiscal implications with the introduction and enactment of the Bill. 10. Cabinet previously agreed that any financial implications resulting from activating the RSP would be charged against the COVID Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) (CAB-20-MIN-0531 refers). Agreement to implement the scheme and approval of the funding to meet the associated costs will be sought through Cabinet in the event that the activation threshold is met. 11. Financial implications for the adjustment to the MFTC were previously agreed by Cabinet (CAB-20-MIN-0512 refers). 2 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-11 20:43:18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis 12. A regulatory impact assessment was prepared for the change to the MFTC rate. This was submitted at the time that Cabinet Committee approval for the policy change was sought. 13. The Resurgence Support Payment did not have a Regulatory Impact Statement provided when considered by Cabinet. The relevant Treasury policy team and Regulatory Quality team agreed at the time that a Supplementary Analysis Report would be completed and provided to Cabinet in February 2021. This is attached. A joint Regulatory Impact Analysis quality assurance panel with representatives from the Treasury and Inland Revenue has reviewed the Supplementary Analysis Report “Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report” produced by the Treasury and Inland Revenue, dated 28 January 2021. The panel considers that it meets the Cabinet requirements to support its decision. Compliance 14. The Bill complies with: 14.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 14.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 14.3 the disclosure statement requirements (the draft disclosure statement is attached); 14.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 14.5 relevant international standards and obligations; 14.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Consultation 15. The proposed RSP was subject to public and other consultation as part of consultation in developing a resurgence package. Due to time and budget constraints the MFTC change was not subject to any public consultation. Relevant Government Departments or Other Public Bodies 16. As part of the policy development, The Treasury, Ministry of Social Development, Inland Revenue, Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (COVID-19 group, Child Poverty Unit and Policy Advisory Group) were consulted on the policy proposals in this paper. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-11 20:43:18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Relevant Private Sector Organisations and Public Consultation Processes 17. Officials engaged with Business New Zealand, the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and Māori and Pacific business leaders in developing the resurgence package, in the process of developing the RSP. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the approach to create greater certainty on the landscape of government support, and particularly welcoming of measures that address non-wage costs. 18. There was strong feedback that the integrity of the schemes will be critical, with both Māori and Pacific business leaders raising concerns about possible gaming of the Wage Subsidy Scheme by large firms. It was suggested that the communications approach to the package should be accompanied by clear guidance to maximise accessibility of the schemes, and partnership with trusted community partners would also aid access. Binding on the Crown 19. The Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 are binding on the Crown. The amendments will follow the position of the principal Acts. 20. The legislation will not create a new agency. 21. The legislation will not amend the existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of Decision Making Powers 22. The draft legislation does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. Associated Regulations 23. The Bill proposes that the RSP would be activated by the Governor-General by Order in Council. This regulation making power has been proposed to allow Cabinet to activate the payment in the event that the activation criteria are met. Other Instruments 24. Other than the Order in Council, the proposed Bill does not include any provision empowering the making of other instruments that are deemed to be legislative instruments or disallowable instruments. Definition of Minister/Department 25. The Bill does not contain a definition of Minister, department, or chief executive. 4 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-11 20:43:18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Commencement of Legislation 26. The Bill will come into force on the date that it receives Royal assent, with the exception of the MFTC rate change, which will come into force 1 April 2021. Parliamentary Stages 27. The Bill should be introduced on or after 16 February 2021 and passed through all stages under urgency. We propose the Bill be enacted by 21 February to ensure the resurgence support payment is in place by 23 February in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19. It will also give Inland Revenue sufficient time to make systems and communications changes to ensure that the MFTC increase is able to occur from 1 April 2021. Communications 28. We will make an announcement about the proposals in the Bill when it is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. The Minister for Social Development and Employment will need to announce the benefit abatement changes before the bill is introduced because the MFTC change is a consequence of these changes. Proactive Release 29. We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations We recommend that Cabinet: 1. note that the Taxation (Pandemic Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill holds a category 2 priority on the 2021 Legislative Programme (to be passed in the year); 2. note that the Bill makes substantive amendments to the: 2.1 Income Tax Act 2007; 2.2 Tax Administration Act 1994; 3. approve the Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill for introduction, subject to the final approval of the government caucus and sufficient support in the House of Representatives; 4. agree that the Bill be introduced on or after 16 February 2021; 5. agree that the government propose that the Bill be: 5.1 Passed under urgency 5 2r4hxlcklw 2021-02-11 20:43:18 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5.2 Enacted by 21 February 2021.

Proposing Ministers Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Summarise in one or two sentences COVID-19 related public health restrictions at Alert Level 2 or above can create short and severe economic shocks. Cumulatively, they stress firm balance sheets and risk delivering unequitable outcomes. The effects of these shocks on firm revenue, coupled with uncertainty of the nature of Government support in the event of a virus resurgence, risks higher unemployment and firm failure as firms are disincentivised from or unable to employ people or invest. Summary of Preferred Option or Conclusion (if no preferred option) How will the agency’s preferred approach work to bring about the desired change? Why is this the preferred option? Why is it feasible? Is the preferred approach likely to be reflected in the Cabinet paper? Summarise in one or two sentences The recommended approach was to introduce and pre-announce a new one-off Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) available to all firms in the event of an increase from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2, 3, or 4. The recommended sub-options were: -To make the RSP available to all firms that experience a drop in revenue of 30% or more over a 14-day period as a result of higher Alert Level restrictions; and -To pay the lesser of: o$1500 plus $400 per full-time employee (FTE) (up to a cap of 50); or, oTwo times the experienced drop in revenue over the 14-day period. These options were preferred because they: -allow businesses to better plan ahead; -meant the RSP w ould be readily deployable by Inland Revenue in the event it is needed (following the passing of legislation and building the system); -are fiscally sustainable; -cushion the economic blow of higher Alert Levels to firms, limiting scarring effects; 12. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 2 - support the transition up Alert Levels, boosting social licence for public health regulations; - encourage the shift to a more COVID-19 resilient economy; - ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, in excess of their needs to meet fixed costs and transition costs; and - target vulnerable but viable firms. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Monetised and non-monetised benefits The RSP will support the national effort to eliminate COVID-19, for the benefit of all New Zealanders. The RSP provides additional financial support to firms to allow them to continue to meet fixed costs and cover costs associated with an escalation of Alert Levels, and quickly continue operations as soon as Alert Level restrictions allow. In turn, this benefits individuals employed by those firms. Whilst the Payment is available to all businesses, SMEs are the main financial beneficiaries. This recognises that the vast majority of businesses in New Zealand employ fewer than 50 people, and that smaller firms are less resilient to economic shocks than larger businesses. However, it is important to recognise that while larger firms are more resilient on average, larger firms can need support too. Not allowing large firms to access this form of support would disadvantage firms just on the cut-off, such as firms with 51 employees. This could make it harder for these firms to survive and may incentivise them to get rid of staff in order to become eligible, which we do not want to encourage. For this reason, the RSP will be available to firms of all sizes. Where do the costs fall? Monetised and non-monetised costs; for example to local government or regulated parties The fiscal costs fall to the Crown, however Treasury analysis suggests the long-term fiscal, economic and social impacts of no action would likely be greater. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts? How significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Compressed timelines create policy development, delivery, and communications risks, which could lead to: - payments being more widely available than is efficient, or being paid to unviable firms, at unnecessary fiscal cost; - damaging the social capital that is critical for the success of the COVID-19 public health strategy; and - business confusion around the access to the scheme, meaning firms may lose out on support they are entitled to. The main mitigations we have undertaken include: - to agree, via Joint Ministers and Cabinet, detailed design rules in order to enable Inland Revenue to build the scheme at pace with as much certainty as possible; Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 3 - a series of measures to boost the integrity of the scheme and minimise gaming risks; - taking a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to communications; - engaging with external business stakeholders to inform the design of the scheme and promote its availability, ensuring the widest audiences are reached. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? How confident are you of the evidence base? Evidence drawn on to inform the design of the RSP include: Regular, detailed qualitative engagement with the business community and monitoring of the effectiveness of existing supports Evidence was consistent from a diverse range of groups that: - greater certainty about the nature of government support in the event of a resurgence was critical, which led the decision to announce the support would be available in advance of any escalation of Alert Levels; - firm balance sheets in the most affected sectors were increasingly stressed; and - additional debt products were less appropriate. Evaluation of the uptake of the Small Business Cashflow Scheme (SBCS) also evidenced the waning appetite for debt. The Payment was therefore designed as a grant. Real-time transaction data, which showed the impacts of Alert Level on revenue - Xero data on revenue drops experienced by firms month-to-month throughout 2020 informed our understanding of Alert Level impacts. 1 - This, alongside information on uptake of the various wage subsidies, allowed us to estimate the number of firms facing significant revenue drops at different Alert Levels and led to the 30% revenue drop test. Survey data on firms’ cost structures and cash reserves - The Annual Enterprise Survey (AES) 2 provided insight into the fixed, variable, and wage costs usually faced by firms of varying size, allowing us to understand the scale of need when normal revenue streams are disrupted. - This gave quantitative support to insights gathered through stakeholder engagement about the difficulty in meeting fixed costs under higher Alert Level restrictions. - Better 4 Business (B4B) 3 research into firms’ cash reserves also echoed messages from stakeholders concerning balance sheet stress and eroded financial resilience. This evidence supported the case for grant-based support. Modelling and analysis of the macro and microeconomic impacts of Alert Levels on the economy. 1 The data provided was anonymised and aggregated to prevent the identification of businesses that are customers of Xero 2 Carried out by Stats NZ, the AES measures the financial performance and position of New Zealand businesses. 3 B4B is part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. It carries out research on business health. The latest research is available here: https://www.betterforbusiness.govt.nz/resources-2/ Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 4 - The Treasury prepared estimates of economic activity under different Alert Levels for each industry at regular intervals during 2020, updating the analysis as new data became available. - These estimates were initially assumption-driven, based on macroeconomic data, and were updated as new data (including high frequency indicators and information on the uptake of the Government’s financial support) enabled re-examination of previous assumptions. - The Treasury also commissioned modelling of the impacts of border closure and Alert Level settings on sectors and regions of the economy, which was conclusive in demonstrating impacts across all sectors and particularly acute effects on tourism and hospitality firms.

Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 5 Supplementary Analysis: Resurgence Support Payment Section 1: General information 1.1 Purpose The Treasury and Inland Revenue are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing: • stakeholders to be consulted on a government exposure draft of planned legislation (amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994) • final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 6 1.2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis a) What issues are in or out of scope? e.g., Ministers may already have ruled out certain issues. b) What are the limitations on the range of options considered and the criteria used to assess options? The RSP was recommended following direction from the Minister of Finance to deploy a new economic response initiative that was limited in scope to support the transition of viable firms to new economic settings; be flexible to support firms in higher Alert Level settings, be fiscally sustainable; and readily deployable. This limited the options to forms of support that could reach affected businesses quickly, and therefore risk issuing payments to firms who may not always need it. However, the criteria used to assess options indicated that in order to mitigate potential economic scarring effects, and with tight application criteria built in, thi s was a worthwhile trade-off. c) What limitations exist in relation to the evidence of the problem? d) What is the quality of data used for impact analysis? e) What limitations may there have been on consultation and testing? The Treasury engaged with a diverse range of business groups throughout 2020, including on the specific design parameters of a new Payment in the run up to preparing the Cabinet Paper. Those consulted on the RSP design included Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and Māori and Pacific business leaders. In addition to the pace with which consultation was undertaken, a limitation of this evidence continues to be the significant uncertainty around global events and changing, potentially unpredictable domestic conditions. Notwithstanding this uncertainty (which is detailed in the Treasury’s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update and Half-Year Economic Update publications), the Treasury’s assessment of the impacts of Alert Level restrictions on economic activity and the related risks to aggregate firm solvency over potential series of virus outbreaks led to the conclusion that there was a gap in the support available. This assessment was informed by data from sources including the aforementioned AES, B2B surveys, Xero, and other modelling. The Treasury judges the quality of this data to be both high and comprehensive. f) What are the limitations on the assumptions underpinning the impact analysis? We assume that patterns of revenue impact experienced by firms are broadly consistent with those seen in periods of elevated Alert Levels throughout 2020. As such, we assume that the take up of the Payment would be broadly in line with that of other forms of COVID- 19 financial support tools to date, including the Wage Subsidy (WSS) and SBCS. Whilst the design of the Payment reflects the greater information available than when the pandemic first began, the uncertainty related to the nature of any future COVID-19 outbreak means the impacts may be different each time. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 7 1.3 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Jean Le Roux Transitions, Regions and Economic Development Growth, Productivity and Services Directorate The Treasury 28 January 2021 s 9(2)(a) Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 8 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the current state within which action is proposed? Set out the current state, e.g., Nature of the market; Industry structure; Social context; Environmental state. The Treasury’s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update provided the context in which the advice on the RSP was developed. The subsequent Half-Year Economic Update was published on 17 December 2020. Both documents underline that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause widespread economic and social disruption around the world, and the effectiveness and timing of the distribution of vaccines were still unclear at the time of writing. Both reports present a central scenario wherein New Zealand’s border restrictions ease from 1 July 2021 and will lift from 1 January 2022, alongside alternative scenarios attempting to benchmark possible downside scenarios. In the meantime, New Zealanders should be prepared for the potential that whilst most of the economy will operate normally the majority of the time, Alert Levels may temporarily escalate. 2.2 What regulatory system(s) are already in place? • What are the key features of the regulatory system(s), including any existing regulation or government interventions/programmes? What are its objectives? The below diagram summarises the economic support landscape as of January 2021, including with the addition of the RSP, at different Alert Levels. The suite of interventions support the Government’s first overarching objective to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19, including by protecting jobs and livelihoods, and strengthening the economy. It does so by ensuring a package of financial support is in place for businesses and individuals in the event of Alert Level escalations following future resurgences of COVID- 19 in the community, with the aim of limiting the economic and social impacts if outbreaks occur. It also seeks to reduce the risk of resurgences by supporting workers to stay home when sick. These goals are complementary, as protecting New Zealanders from the virus will also support economic activity resuming quickly after any outbreaks. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 9 • Why is Government regulation preferable to private arrangements in this area? Public health restrictions attempt to provide protection from COVD-19; firmly an intervention that should and could only be undertaken by government. However, the economic costs of the public health restrictions (such as Alert Level changes), land upon individuals and businesses. It is appropriate for government to share some of these costs, consistent with the provision of public goods. The Treasury’s latest estimates that the negative impacts to GDP from Alert Level restrictions (relative to pre-pandemic levels) are: • -25% to -30% at Alert Level 4 • -15% to -20% at Alert Level 3 • -6% to -10% at Alert Level 2 • -3% to -5% at Alert Level 1. These are significant impacts with distributional consequences and scarring effects that require interventions at a scale only the Government can provide via broad-based support. • Has the overall fitness-for-purpose of the system as a whole been assessed? When and with what result? What interdependencies or connections are there to other existing issues or on-going work? Part of the rationale for the introduction of a new RSP at Alert Level 2 was to fill a gap in the support available to businesses as the cumulative impacts of higher public health restrictions added additional stress to balance sheets. In designing the intervention, officials attempted to achieve consistency between the RSP, WSS and the SBCS, where sensible, so as to reduce business confusion. This is reflected in a number of the settings proposed above for the RSP, including many of the settings relating to business declarations and business eligibility. There are other settings that are not in alignment. Some are based on policy grounds, such as the differing revenue drop thresholds under the RSP and WSS reflecting the schemes’ different purposes at different Alert Levels. Others are based on the fact that there will be different agencies implementing the schemes, with different system capabilities and different approaches to achieving necessary scheme integrity. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? • How is the situation expected to develop if no further action is taken, and why is this a problem? (This is the basis for comparing options against each other). • What is the nature, scope and scale of the loss or harm being experienced, or the opportunity for improvement? How important is this to the achievement (or not) of the overall system objectives? • What is the underlying cause of the problem? Why cannot individuals or firms be expected to sort it out themselves under existing arrangements? • How robust is the evidence supporting this assessment? Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 10 The estimated negative impacts from Alert Level restrictions (relative to pre-pandemic levels) described in box 2.2 are significant, with distributional consequences and scarring effects that require interventions at a scale only the Government can provide through broad- based support. We know that Alert Level restrictions have an uneven impact across industries. Industries that find it costly to adapt operations for delivery under Alert Level settings, given the general necessity of in-person, on-site service provision, are under significant pressure. “Essential Services” definitions were used to form a view of which firms were able to operate at the higher Alert Levels. This assessment leveraged off work that was being undertaken by MBIE during the early stages of the COVID response to assess demand for Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) across essential industries, as well as work that was done between Treasury and MBIE on assessing uptake of the WSS. On top of this, firms suffer from the wider demand-side shocks due to reduced tourism activity, the decline in people movement, and economic conditions. Aggregate demand impacts from border closure particularly reduce demand for tourism-related industries such as accommodation, recreational activities etc. Statistics NZ Tourism Satellite Account information was used to inform a view on which industries were most impacted and the relative importance of international vs domestic tourism. The Treasury also commissioned modelling of the impacts of border closure and Alert Level settings on sectors and regions of the economy, which was conclusive in demonstrating impacts across all sectors and particularly acute effects on tourism and hospitality firms. 2.4 What do stakeholders think about the problem? • Who are the stakeholders? What is the nature of their interest? • Which stakeholders share the Agency’s view of the problem and its causes? • Which stakeholders do not share the Agency’s view in this regard and why? The Treasury engaged with Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, and Pacific, Māori and Iwi business leaders in developing the RSP. Inland Revenue also engaged with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. Their interest in the Payment was on behalf of business owners and employees throughout New Zealand. The engagement followed several months of conversations between the Treasury and business stakeholders on the impacts of higher Alert Levels and border settings on different sectors. There was extremely strong consensus from across the spectrum that providing greater certainty on the nature of Government support in the event higher Alert Levels were in place would be critical for businesses to plan and right-size smoothly. The RSP responded to this consistent message. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the approach to create greater certainty on the landscape of government support, and particularly welcoming of measures that would address non-wage costs in addition to the costs covered by the WSS. There was strong feedback that the integrity of the schemes will be critical, with both Māori and Pacific business leaders raising concerns about possible gaming of support available. It was suggested that the communications approach to the package should be accompanied with clear guidance to maximise accessibility of the schemes, and partnerships with trusted community channels would aid access to the schemes and be critical in helping SMEs – which would likely be most vulnerable – prepare now for future outbreaks. Officials are using this feedback to inform the communications strategy. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 11 2.5 What are the objectives sought in relation to the identified problem? • Objectives must be clear and not pre-justify a particular solution. They should be specified broadly enough to allow consideration of all relevant alternative solutions. • Where there are multiple policy objectives it should be clear how trade-offs between competing objectives are going to be made and the weightings given to objectives – not just those in direct conflict. • For further guidance, see 2.3 of the Guidance Note on Best Practice Analysis https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/ia-bestprac-guidance-note.pdf The purpose of the RSP is to provide support for businesses’ to meet fixed costs and costs when transitioning from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2 or above, in a fiscally sustainable way. The objectives, which formed the criteria against which different options were assessed, are as follows: a) Support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; b) Support firms to pay fixed costs (such as rent) if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; c) Share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels between Government, firms and across economic sectors; and d) Encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy. This required the following scheme attributes, which informed the selection of options (see section 3): - Resilience to different public health scenarios - Providing business certainty, so firms can better plan ahead - Complementarity with existing schemes; and - Fiscal sustainability. Trade-offs In order to support firms to maintain viability and employment levels (objective (a)), there will necessarily be payments made to some firms who would survive anyway, and others that may not have been viable in the medium term (see objective (d)). However, from a fairness perspective, there is a case to equally share the cost of the exogenous shock provided by the pandemic (c). The critical weighting here is in favour of mitigating scarring economic effects for the long-term benefit of all New Zealanders , and designing a scheme that is resilient / can pay out quickly (see box 3.1). The Payment was therefore designed to be available to all firms but with design features built in to target the most affected and those with the fewest resources to respond to the restricted market settings created by higher Alert Levels. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 12 Section 3: Option identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? • List and describe the key features of the options. Set out how each would address the problem or opportunity, and deliver the objectives identified. • How has consultation affected these options? • Are the options mutually exclusive, or do they or some of them work in combination? • Have non-regulatory options been considered? If not, why not? • What relevant experience from other countries has been considered? The first-order options were as follows: A. Front-loaded WSS-based scheme Lump sum worth 2 weeks of the wage subsidy paid for every change in AL to firms meeting a 40% revenue drop test, with a labour market attachment requirement: Assessment: maintains employment but does not address other costs associated with Alert Level escalation; 40% threshold aligned with WSS but likely too high at Alert Level 2; fiscally expensive. B. Amended WSS-based scheme As above, but restricting payments to escalations in ALs only, and allowing only one payment every four weeks. Assessment: potentially less frequent payments may do more to encourage transition, but challenges of option A remain. C. Lump-sum AL2+ grant \[this was the recommended and agreed approach\] Adapted form of options A&B that is: 1. Less generous per FTE, with a per-firm and per-FTE component to reflect fixed costs; 2. Subject to a less onerous revenue drop test, to reflect impact of AL2 on businesses; 3. Paid every time there is an escalation from AL1 to AL2 or above; and 4. Without a labour market attachment condition, but firms would declare they are viable. Assessment: responds to business feedback that more support was needed for fixed costs (e.g. rent); less generous, thereby better facilitating transition and potentially more equitably sharing the cost between Government and the private sector. D. Ongoing AL2+ grant As (C), but paid on an ongoing basis for every week a region or nation is at AL2 or above Assessment: benefits of Option C but less likely to facilitate transition, fiscally expensive. E. Time-limited AL2+ grant As (D), but with a fixed number of weeks that a firm can claim for over the life of the scheme. Assessment similar to (D); greater cushioning provided for firms than (C) but more expensive. The Treasury also considered grants directly aimed at hospitality firms and others directly identified in public health regulations as needing to make adaptations in order to meet social Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 13 distancing and hygiene requirements. This was ruled out due to the considerable boundary issues involved in categorising businesses by strict sectors. Option C was recommended in light of its strengths in delivering the overall objectives described in box 2.5 above. The sub-options that were consequently considered, which are largely mutually exclusive, are as follows: The public health settings that would trigger the scheme’s activation Based on the above objectives, we recommended that any new grant scheme should be available to businesses based on an escalation to AL2 or higher. This ties the duration of any payments to the time at which many businesses will continue to face substantial cost from public health restrictions. In the event that such an escalation is in one region, the case for only starting the scheme in that region was considered. Regional targeting would pose operational challenges – for example, firms that are registered in a different place to their economic activity, or subject to spillovers from restrictions in a neighbouring region. Those challenges mean that regional targeting will come with hard boundary cases, and would create operational difficulties for IR, though it is technically feasible. As an alternative, there was an option for Ministers to choose to turn the scheme on nationally or by region in the given circumstance. Given that this could undermine business certainty on the support received, which was a significant part of the policy aim informed by consultation, it was concluded that a commitment to provide the RSP when a region or the country was at AL2 or above would be subject to final Cabinet approval at the time of an escalation event. Whether to make the support time-limited, or an ongoing grant at certain Alert Levels The key strategic choice was between supporting firms to adapt to the new restrictions through a one-off or time limited payment, or maintaining as many existing firms or jobs as possible by providing ongoing, certain, support for the remainder of the pandemic. The former approach was judged to best support the objectives, in light of the greater fiscal sustainability associated with one-off payments; likelihood of supporting fewer non-viable firms; and potential to incentivise a transition to new market conditions. The conditions under which firms would be eligible Whilst all means of delivering targeted sector or viable firm support are imperfect, on balance, we recommended taking a similar approach to the Wage Subsidy Scheme and relied on a revenue-drop test. This is because: - It identifies those firms and sectors most affected by AL2 restrictions, whether that is due to the direct impact of public health restrictions or supply chain spill-overs; and - It is well understood by businesses as a common means of determining eligibility for COVID-19 support measures. The alternative identified was to specifically target firms that are subject to specific public health requirements by virtue of providing food and drink for on-premises consumption (hospitality). Treasury’s judgement, having consulted with delivery partners, is that doing so would be exceptionally challenging to define, audit, or operationalise; would create very difficult boundary issues for businesses to navigate and understand; and would create very high levels of customer contact and confusion. The means of calculating the grant value A grant to firms should be fiscally sustainable and ideally account for the fixed costs that firms face which scale relatively slowly with firm size and are hard to adjust quickly (such as Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 14 rent and utilities), and variable costs that can adjust more quickly (such as wages and the transition costs associated with Alert Level changes). In order to achieve this, we recommended that a grant value has a fixed and variable component using FTE 4 employees as a measure of firm size and variable costs. Grant = base value per firm + ( FTE payment \* FTE) To ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, we also recommended a design mechanism whereby the amount of payment is capped at two times the fortnightly drop in revenue that the applicant has signalled in its application. This approach means the amount a firm receives will be the lower of the formula amount ($1,500 plus $400 per FTE) or two times the fortnightly drop in revenue. The Treasury estimated this would save a total of $30-50m in fiscal costs. We also explored alternative ways of setting a grant relative to a firm’s size (for example, on the basis of a firm’s revenue or balance sheet), but doing so poses substantial operational challenges and would be more complex for businesses. Whether to restrict the grant to SMEs. Larger firms have stronger balance sheets and access to credit and cash buffers, and the value of the payment will be much less material to their business decisions. However, the fiscal impact of providing the RSP to all firms without a cap on FTE was estimated to be relatively low (given that the base value was a substantial proportion of the cost, and there are very few large firms in New Zealand). On balance, it was preferred to cap the amount of the RSP to firms at the equivalent of a payment to firms with 50 FTE, similar to the original design of the Wage Subsidy, which has the benefits of equal treatment in approach to supporting all businesses. This was also supported by feedback gathered in consultation with stakeholders across the business community, who provided advice that the support would have strongest effect for SMEs. Have non-regulatory options been considered? If not, why not? What relevant experience from other countries has been considered? The Treasury explored whether demand-led schemes could be viable to support objectives including (a) and (d) above. It examined the UK’s ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme, which subsidised meals out. It was concluded that the scheme would run counter to the public health goals at higher Alert Levels to subsidise and therefore incentivise eating out. The IMF’s Policies for the Recovery published in October 2020 was also considered. The publication recommended fiscal strategies including “cash or in-kind transfers to support transition and target those in need, in the event of partial opening”, which supported the case for the approach taken to designing the RSP. In addition, the Treasury engaged with officials in Australia to share ideas on building support schemes which targeted vulnerable but viable firms. 4 FTEs are determined in the same way as for the Wage Subsidy and SBCS: a full time worker is one who regularly works 20 or more hours a week. A part time worker is one who regularly works fewer than 20 hours a week. A part time worker is calculated as 0.6 of a full time worker. The total from classifying all employees is rounded up to the nearest FTE. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 15 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? • Comment on relationships between the criteria, for example where meeting one criterion can only be achieved at the expense of another (trade-offs) Note: sections 3.2 and 3.3 from the original template are combined as the answers are strongly related. The desired impacts are directly related to the objectives of the RSP: a) Support firms to maintain viability and employment levels across escalations in public health restrictions; b) Support firms to pay fixed costs if they are struggling to do so as a result of escalated Alert Levels; c) Share the cost associated with escalated Alert Levels between Government, firms and across economic sectors; and d) Encourage the shift to a COVID-19 resilient economy. It was considered that grant-based support was more likely to support businesses to maintain viability and employment levels than debt-based alternatives, whilst being fiscally sustainable (given the quantum of funding set aside to respond to resurgence events if needed). Whilst debt based support may help firms manage immediate cash flow issues, it can become restrictive and delay investment in transition as they divert cash from growth activities to financing costs. Furthermore, firms are likely to be more risk averse than the Crown, which pools risk and has a large balance sheet, a long time horizon, and a public interest perspective. An additional part of the rationale for the RSP in delivering the above objectives relates to the impacts on social license for the public health response. Whilst the available evidence demonstrated a broadly high level of compliance with the public health restrictions during the outbreaks in 2020 (for example, traffic flows were much lower as a result of AL3 in Auckland), there was some evidence that the high degree of social capital that supported compliance with the longer national lockdown waned. In addition, at the time of designing the Payment, there was emerging evidence that compliance with restrictions overseas was waning, especially in cases where the economic support was judged to be insufficiently generous to incentivise people to self-isolate rather than work. It was concluded that economic response measures can play a key role in maintaining ongoing social license for public health restrictions, both in compensating individuals for their compliance with restrictions, minimising the impact on jobs and economic wellbeing, and reinforcing social solidarity. Whilst this is a difficult impact to measure and accurately attribute to economic support, the counterfactual would be a significant risk to the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.

The recommended approach was to introduce and pre-announce a new one-off Resurgence Support Payment available to all firms in the event of an increase from Alert Level 1 to Alert Level 2, 3, or 4. The recommended sub-options were: - To make the Payment available to all firms that experience a drop in revenue of 30% or more over a 14-day period as a result of higher Alert Level restrictions; and - To pay the lesser of: o $1500 plus $400 per full-time employee (FTE) (up to a cap of 50), or, o Two times the experienced drop in revenue. These options were preferred because they: - allow businesses to better plan ahead; - meant the RSP would be readily deployable by Inland Revenue in the event it is needed (following the passing of legislation and building the system); - are fiscally sustainable; - cushion the economic blow of higher Alert Levels to firms, limiting scarring effects; - support the transition up Alert Levels, boosting social licence for public health regulations; - encourage the shift to a more COVID-19 resilient economy; - ensure that some low revenue firms do not gain disproportionately from the RSP, in excess of their needs to meet fixed costs and transition costs; and - target vulnerable but viable firms. This approach was informed through consultation with Business New Zealand, the Council of Trade Unions, the Auckland Chamber of Commerce, and Pacific, Māori and Iwi business leaders in developing the RSP. Inland Revenue also engaged with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. The engagement on the specific design aspects of the RSP followed several months’ of conversations between the Treasury and these stakeholders on the impacts of higher Alert Levels and border settings on different sectors. There was extremely strong consensus from across the spectrum that providing greater certainty on the nature of Government support in the event higher Alert Levels were in place would be critical for businesses to plan and right-size smoothly. The RSP responded to this consistent message. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of the approach to create greater certainty on the landscape of government support, and particularly welcoming of measures that would address non-wage costs in addition to the costs covered by the Wage Subsidy Scheme. There was strong feedback that the integrity of the schemes will be critical, with both Māori and Pacific business leaders raising concerns about possible gaming of support available. It was suggested that the communications approach to the package should be accompanied with clear guidance to maximise accessibility of the schemes, and partnerships with trusted community channels would aid access to the schemes and be critical in helping SMEs – which would likely be most vulnerable – prepare now for future outbreaks. This feedback has fed into the policy design and operational implementation of the Payment.

However, the analysis sighted in this report indicates that the scarring effects attached to the risks of not cushioning the blow could be significant, with distributional consequences. We therefore judge that the provision of the RSP has potential to support the social license and capital needed to maintain a robust public health response, for the benefit of all New Zealanders. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 21 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? • When will the arrangements come into effect? Does this allow sufficient preparation time for regulated parties? • How could the preferred option be given effect? E.g., − legislative vehicle − communications − transitional arrangements. The RSP will be given effect through amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994, scheduled to be introduced in February 2021. The RSP was announced on 15 December 2020 and information on eligibility is available on a range of government websites. Cabinet has agreed retrospective payments will be possible in the event there is a resurgence prior to the application opening date, and subject to the legislation being passed. In addition, engagement with key business groups including those representing Māori and Pasifika businesses will be pursued in order to ensure a maximum number of firms are aware of the support available. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the RSP. Have the responsible parties confirmed, or identified any concerns with their ability to implement it in a manner consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for regulatory stewardship by government agencies’? See https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and- services/regulation/regulatory-stewardship/good-regulatory-practice Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement the new arrangements. How will other agencies with a substantive interest in the relevant regulatory system or stakeholders be involved in the implementation and/or operation? Design decisions have been delegated by Cabinet to relevant Joint Ministers, including the Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue, and Minister for Small Business. Interdependencies with complementary support programmes such as the Wage Subsidy are regularly under review by the Treasury, IR and MSD. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 22 6.2 What are the implementation risks? • What issues concerning implementation have been raised through consultation and how will these be addressed? • What are the underlying assumptions or uncertainties, for example about stakeholder motivations and capabilities? • How will risks be mitigated? Compressed timelines create delivery and communications risks, which could lead to: - payments reaching the wrong businesses at an unnecessary fiscal cost; - damaging the social capital that is critical for the success of the COVID-19 public health strategy; - business confusion around the access to the scheme, meaning firms may lose out on support they are entitled to. The main mitigations we have undertaken include: - to agree, via Joint Ministers and Cabinet, detailed design rules in order to enable Inland Revenue to build the scheme at pace with as much certainty as possible; - a series of measures to boost the integrity of the scheme and minimise gaming risks; - taking a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to communications; - engaging with external business stakeholders to inform the design of the scheme and promote its availability, ensuring the widest audiences are reached; and - re-use of components developed for the SBCS as a way to meet challenging system delivery timeframes. Resurgence Support Payment Supplementary Analysis Report | 23 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? • How will you know whether the impacts anticipated actually materialise? • System-level monitoring and evaluation • Are there already monitoring and evaluation provisions in place for the system as a whole (ie, the broader legislation within which this arrangement sits)? If so, what are they? • Are data on system-level impacts already being collected? • Are data on implementation and operational issues, including enforcement already being collected? • New data collection? • Will you need to collect extra data that is not already being collected? Please specify. As with the wage subsidies, SBCS, and COVID-19 Income Relief Payment (CIRP), detailed data will be collected by the implementation agency (IR) on the uptake of the scheme. This will capture and allow government to evaluate outputs of the scheme. Information systems at IR are capable of this data collection. Evaluation of outcomes will be imperfect, given the radical uncertainty that surrounds any resurgence event and the absence of any suitable counterfactual. In line with the objectives of the scheme and analysis that lead to its inception, we expect to minimise the erosion of firm balance sheets during a resurgence event, and ultimately prevent some insolvencies amongst viable firms that would otherwise take place. While we can assess balance sheet resilience quantitatively, much of this evaluation will be through engagement with business. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? • How will the arrangements be reviewed? How often will this happen and by whom will it be done? If there are no plans for review, state so and explain why. • What sort of results (that may become apparent from the monitoring or feedback) might prompt an earlier review of this legislation? • What opportunities will stakeholders have to raise concerns? A review of the system will depend on whether it is activated. Subject to that, the operation of the scheme will be reviewed regularly based on user feedback and system metrics. Monitoring of uptake and engagement will be undertaken in the event that the payment is activated as part of the broader monitoring of the economic situation. If required, a review of any policy settings would be co-led by Treasury and Inland Revenue.

In Confidence IR2021/067: Final Decisions on the length of the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment revenue decline period Page 1 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 15 February 2021 Prime Minister Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Minister for Small Business Final Decisions on the length of the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment revenue decline period Purpose This report seeks your decision on the length of the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment (CRSP) revenue decline period. Inland Revenue recommends, on balance, confirming the Cabinet decision from 14 December 2020 \[CAB-20-MIN-0531 refers\], which is that the CRSP would be available to firms able to demonstrate a 30% revenue decline over a 14-day consecutive period. Background On 14 December 2020 Cabinet agreed to introduce the CRSP, to provide financial support to businesses in the event of an alert level increase \[CAB-20 -MIN-0531 refers\]. On 10 February 2021 the Cabinet Business Committee with Power to Act approved the Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill (the Bill) for introduction as soon as practicable. This Bill contains the amendments necessary to establish the legislative framework under which the CRSP can be implemented. In order for the scheme to be activated, an Order in Council will need to be made. On 14 February New Zealand moved to alert level 2 nationally and alert level 3 in Auckland. As a result of this alert level change and the presence of community COVID-19 cases, Cabinet has decided to progress the Bill under urgency. Cabinet has delegated to joint Ministers the power to make decisions about whether the revenue decline period as part of the CRSP eligibility criteria would be 7-days or remain 14 days. Inland Revenue advice Officials have had a short period of time to consider the implications of a 7-day revenue drop period, and so have not had the opportunity to complete full policy analysis. If timely decisions are made (i.e. by the morning of 16 February), Inland Revenue’s advice is that it should be possible to make the systems changes necessary to accommodate a 7-day eligibility criteria, in time for the scheme to be active from 23 February 2021. Inland Revenue would also need to update communications, guidance and legal documentation (such as the terms and conditions) that support the CRSP. In Confidence IR2021/067: Final Decisions on the length of the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment revenue decline period Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Inland Revenue also notes that while the scheme could be active from 23 February 2021, due to systems changes as part of the Business Transformation Programme we would be unable to receive applications from 5.30pm on Friday 26 February until the morning of Monday 1 March. While a reduced revenue decline period is technically deliverable and would provide financial support to firms slightly earlier, on balance we consider the current 14-day period to be preferable on policy grounds. We are concerned that a 7-day period would result in inconsistencies between the CRSP policy settings and those for other COVID-19 financial supports (such as the wage subsidy). This inconsistency increases the complexity of the policy environment. This both makes the system more difficult for the public to understand and increases the administrative complexity for agencies. There are also consequential impacts to other CRSP settings (such as the cap for low revenue firms) which officials have not had time to consider in detail. If you decide that the revenue decline test should apply to a 7-day period, this report seeks your agreement to confirm that the default comparator period would be the typical weekly revenue in the six weeks prior and that the CRSP payment cap for low revenue firms should become 4 times the weekly loss they experience in the comparator period. Consultation The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been informed of this report. The Treasury has been consulted on the preparation of this report. Their comment is included below. Inland Revenue agrees with the policy reasoning expressed. Treasury Comment Risks of the 7-day rule change Repeat fiscal risk. Whilst there are significant uncertainties, it is more likely that short AL escalations will occur in future compared to prolonged periods, due to the advancement of the public health response since last year. This means that setting a precedent through a 7-day impact rule over a 14-day impact would more likely multiply the fiscal costs over time. If the AL escalation is limited to around 7 days, the 7- day rule doesn’t allow for any lagged effects to businesses. This is more unfair on a range of businesses compared to the 14-day test, which captures this lag. (Note this issue diminishes if the AL escalation is longer). For example, an event firm may cancel an event in the future due to uncertainty or if supply chains are disrupted during the AL escalation, and so a revenue reduction not in the week of elevated ALs but in a subsequent week may be recorded. Such a firm is unlikely be able to demonstrate an impact within the required 7-day period, and therefore will not receive support. Rationale for 14-day period noted in previous advice Opening the Wage Subsidy Scheme and RSP for fewer than 7 days was not proposed because Ministers considered it reasonable for employers to manage the effects of AL escalations that are shorter than one week without support. In Confidence IR2021/067: Final Decisions on the length of the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment revenue decline period Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] It is likely the support will go to a significantly higher number of firms (see fiscals below), as they will not experience a 2nd week during which we would expect revenues to return and the overall reduction would likely be less than 30%. Benefits of the 7-day rule change Government is likely to support a greater number of firms, which may be deemed to be economically fairer. Payments would reach firms’ accounts a week in advance of the original timeline, which could more effectively cushion the blow of the AL escalation costs (however, evidence from our consultation with business suggested 14 days would be manageable and struck a fairer balance with the fiscal costs). Minor decisions to flag if a 7- day rule is applied The comparator period: In order to apply, firms need to demonstrate an incurred impact compared to another period. We have assumed we would maintain the 6- week comparator period but continue with the rule agreed in the December Cabinet paper, i.e. it will be the “typical” weekly revenue in the six weeks prior. We think this will have a marginal gaming impact. Impact on low income firms - so that these firms receive the same support as previously calculated, and to keep it in line with support for most firms (which is unchanged at $1500+(400\*FTE)), we think it would be best to set the rule that payments would be the lesser of four times the weekly revenue drop rather than twice the fortnightly drop, or the $1500+($400\*FTE) rate. Fiscal implications Estimated fiscal cost ($m) Estimated government coverage of economic costs Economic cost ($m) 14-day revenue drop rule (status quo) 7-day revenue drop rule (proposed change) 14-day revenue drop rule (status quo) 7-day revenue drop rule (proposed change) Alert Level 3 in Auckland for one week, AL2 outside of Auckland for one week. 490 280 350 60% 70% Alert Level 3 in Auckland for two weeks, AL2 outside of Auckland for two weeks. 980 340 510 35% 50% Alert Level 3 in Auckland for two weeks, AL2 outside of Auckland for two weeks, followed by a period of nationwide AL2 for at least two weeks 1280 360 550 25% 35% The proposed change to a 7-day period to demonstrate eligibility results in an increase in costs, as it softens the application of the revenue drop test. The marginal firms captured would be those that experience an acute impact in one week, and a rebound in activity in subsequent weeks. This change opens the scheme to capture firms whose average revenue drop over an impacted fortnight is only 15%, rather than the 30% required under current settings. Most of the difference in fiscal cost occurs over the first weeks of the period of elevated Alert Levels – as the resurgence event continues, the number of eligible I n Confidence IR2021/067: Final Decisions on the length of the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment revenue decline period Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] firms taking up the scheme attains a saturation point. As such, costs are not as sensitive to the duration of the Alert Level escalation, as they are to the severity – a more prolonged period at elevated Alert Levels does not continue to result in increased costs beyond the first few weeks. These figures were produced at pace, with limited information. They may be revised if more time or information becomes available. The table only differs from the costings provided earlier today by the addition of the third row, to demonstrate that costs do not continue to increase at the same rate as the duration of the elevated AL period increases. Note that the cost borne by the Government in the table above does not include any costs associated with the wage subsidy scheme or any other COVID-19 supports, should these be reactivated. Next steps The Taxation (COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments and Other Matters) Bill is intended to be introduced and passed under urgency tomorrow (16 February 2021). Cabinet is required to authorise the activation of the RSP. In order for the scheme to be activated, an Order in Council must be made. This Order in Council cannot be drafted until the eligibility settings are determined (including the length of the revenue decline period). Recommended action We recommend that you: note that a decision on the length of the CRSP revenue decline period is urgently needed in order for the legislation enabling the CRSP to be introduced; note that if a decision is not made by the morning of 16 February it is unlikely that the CRSP will be able to be delivered within the required timeframes; EITHER 3.1 agree to confirm the 14-day revenue decline period as previously agreed by Cabinet \[CAB-20-MIN-0531 refers\] (Inland Revenue preferred); Agreed/Not agreed Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern Agreed/Not agreed Hon Grant Robertson Agreed/Not agreed Hon David Parker Agreed/Not agreed Hon Stuart Nash OR 3 .2 agree that the CRSP revenue decline period should be 7 days; Agreed/Not agreed Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern Agreed/Not agreed Hon Grant Robertson Agreed/Not agreed Hon David Parker Agreed/Not agreed Hon Stuart Nash If recommendation 3.2 is agreed In Confidence IR2021/067: Final Decisions on the length of the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment revenue decline period Page 5 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] agree that the default comparator period for the revenue decline period should be the typical weekly revenue in the six weeks prior; Agreed/Not agreed Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern Agreed/Not agreed Hon Grant Robertson Agreed/Not agreed Hon David Parker Agreed/Not agreed Hon Stuart Nash If recommendation 3.2 is agreed agree that where previously a payment rule was to pay double the fortnightly drop in earnings, this would become 4 times the weekly loss.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Revenue’s July 2021 Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides an update regarding Inland Revenue’s progress with modernising the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note Inland Revenue’s plans for implementing the final changes and completing the transformation programme. Executive Summary 2 Inland Revenue’s transformation programme will conclude by 30 June 2022. As far as customers are concerned, it will be complete in October 2021 when the final changes that will affect them go-live. Child support will move to new systems and processes, and Inland Revenue’s online services will be significantly improved. After that, the focus of the programme will be on more internal activities such as decommissioning of heritage systems and processes, which will largely be invisible to anyone outside Inland Revenue. 3 Inland Revenue is very focused on making the most of the investment that has been made in its capabilities. The department’s ongoing support of our COVID-19 response, including the implementation of the resurgence support payment earlier this year, is an excellent demonstration of its agility and customer focus. 4 This year’s issuing of automatic income tax assessments for around 3.2 million customers is further proof of that focus. Inland Revenue began issuing assessments on 26 May 2021, with the bulk of assessments, some 2.1 million, issued by 10 June 2021. The department expects to finish sending all assessments to customers by mid-July 2021. Customers due to receive a refund now get it far more quickly than before and the majority of customers don’t need to do anything as Inland Revenue works it all out for them. It can be a shock to customers who are told they have tax to pay. They have until 7 February 2022 to pay the amount they owe and there are a range of payment options available, including instalment arrangements. 5 The modernisation of the revenue system will continue beyond the programme, as Inland Revenue continues to look for opportunities to improve how services are delivered. Maturing the use of its new assets and capabilities and driving further value from them will be a key focus for the department in the next few years. This will include opportunities to work across agency boundaries and with the private sector to improve wider outcomes for New Zealanders. Inland Revenue is preparing for the final changes in its transformation programme 6 Transformation has involved a combination of changes to policy, process, technology, and Inland Revenue’s people capabilities. Significant changes have been made in all these areas since implementation began in February 2017. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 Changes to policy and legislative settings to frame and support the modernisation of the revenue system have now been completed. This has included simplifying requirements for customers where possible, more frequent reporting of employment and investment income information, and automatic year-end assessments for individuals. 8 By way of example, when income tax moved to new systems and processes in April 2019, it became clear that approximately 1.5 million people were on an incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR). People who invest in a portfolio investment entity, such as KiwiSaver schemes, select a tax rate, referred to as their PIR. At the time, people on a PIR that was too high could not get their overpaid tax refunded as it was a final tax and those on a PIR that was too low paid tax at their marginal tax rate (which was often higher than their PIR). 9 Following changes to legislation, from 1 April 2020, Inland Revenue has provided portfolio investment entities with correct PIRs for people on an incorrect rate. From the year ending 31 March 2021, portfolio investment entity income is included in the end-of- year income tax assessment process and automated where possible. This means that people on a PIR that is too high will have their overpaid tax refunded and those on a rate that is too low will pay tax at the correct PIR rather than their marginal tax rate. 10 Most individual customers no longer have to do anything at the end of the year to work out whether they have a refund or tax to pay. This is making a real difference. For the year ending 31 March 2018, the last year before automatic year-end assessments were introduced, just over 1 million customers claimed refunds totalling $451 million. For the year ending 31 March 2020, approximately 1.8 million people received refunds totalling $713 million. Of this, approximately 1.6 million customers earning less than $70,000 received refunds totalling $641 million (90% of the total value of refunds issued). 11 The issuing of automatic income tax assessments is still a relatively new process. It was run for the first time for the year ending 31 March 2019. As changes to employment and investment income reporting were introduced progressively, the year ending 31 March 2021 was the first full year Inland Revenue received more detailed information about recipients of investment income more often. Improvements are being made each year, for example issuing assessments more quickly, and Inland Revenue will continue to focus on how it can make this process run as smoothly as possible, including how it communicates with customers. Prior to the introduction of automatic year-end assessments, customers had to request a personal tax summary to claim a refund and could choose not to ask for one if they owed tax. 12 New processes, underpinned by new technology, are making tax and payments simpler and more certain. All the products Inland Revenue administers are now running on new systems and processes, with the exception of child support. Online services are available for all these products, making it easier for customers to do more for themselves, with less effort, and without needing to contact Inland Revenue. Customers can now see their tax and payments, and what they need to do in a single place. 13 Moving high-volume, simple transactions online was always the intent of transformation. Inland Revenue is seeing a reduction in the number of calls it receives. Nevertheless it can still be difficult for customers to get through to the department at busy times. Customers who can are using self-service options. The majority of correspondence received from customers is now digital and use of myIR remains high. This frees Inland Revenue up to provide more personal support to customers who have complex needs as 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] well as to those who are unable to use digital services. Call centres and appointments are available for customers in these situations and will remain so. 14 More compliance effort is now upfront rather than waiting until the end of the year when customers may find themselves in debt. This is because Inland Revenue has new analytical tools allowing it to see more, and see it earlier, so errors or non-compliance, whether inadvertent or deliberate, are more quickly identified and addressed. For example, Inland Revenue now proactively contacts Working for Families customers during the year when it can see things have changed to ensure their payments are adjusted as quickly as possible when their circumstances change. This helps to minimise the number of customers with debt at the end of the year and the value of any debt. High- volume/low-value compliance risks are dealt with much more effectively, for example every return that can generate a refund is automatically checked by Inland Revenue’s systems. This enables the department’s tax technical specialists to focus on more complex, higher value customer interventions, such as audits or investigations. 15 The transformation programme has resulted in significant changes not only for Inland Revenue’s customers, but also for its people. A new operating model with new capability- based roles and new workplace technology have been progressively introduced. Roles in Inland Revenue are focused on transferable skills such as customer service or digital literacy, as well as new capabilities such as data analytics. This is enabling people to build their capabilities as work changes. Significant training programmes have also been conducted ahead of each release. On average, Inland Revenue’s front line people have had around 3 days’ of mandatory training for each of the five releases so far, equating to 18 days of training overall per person. 16 Inland Revenue has been transforming for over five years. The 2021/22 year will bring this huge programme to a close with the implementation of the final changes. The final changes affecting customers will be implemented in October 2021 17 The final customer-facing changes are being implemented in two releases during 2021. Paid parental leave, unclaimed money, duties 1 , and New Zealand foreign trusts went live on new systems and processes at 4pm on 28 February 2021, slightly ahead of schedule. These products are running smoothly with few issues encountered following go-live. 18 Child support will move to new systems and processes in October 2021. Following go- live, child support customers will have better visibility of their obligations and payments in myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service, and be able to do more for themselves, including registering online and advising the department of any changes in their circumstances. 19 In addition to improved online services, legislative changes have been enacted that will improve the administration of child support. Since 1 April 2021, Inland Revenue has not charged incremental penalties on outstanding balances for child support, and the situations where child support penalties can be written off have been simplified. Together, these changes will make child support penalties fairer and more effective. 20 Other changes will take effect progressively. When child support moves to new systems and processes in October 2021, deductions of financial support from payments made by an employer will be compulsory for newly liable parents. Employers are already required 1 Including casino, lottery and totalisator duty, and the problem gambling levy. 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] to deduct child support when the liable parent has chosen employer deduction as a payment method or has defaulted on a payment. This change will therefore only affect employers who do not currently deduct child support or employers with an increased number of employees they must make deductions for. 21 From 1 April 2022 changes that impact on child support assessment will apply. For example, a wider definition of “income” will be used for child support purposes. Investment income will be automatically included to get a better picture of an individual’s ability to support their children. Any losses carried forward from an earlier year will no longer be used to offset income as part of calculating child support obligations. 22 Information sharing and communication with other agencies will improve through the use of portals and secure file transfer. The processing of child support payments and employer deductions will be streamlined and will help to ensure receiving carers get their child support as soon as possible after a due date. 23 As part of the final release in October 2021, Inland Revenue will also upgrade the online services all its customers use. A more modern look and feel for myIR, and simplified presentation of information, will make it easier for customers to focus on what is relevant and important. The layout will adapt to fit the size of any screen without loss of functionality, making it seamless to use myIR across different devices, including mobile phones. Simplified navigation will allow customers to easily find and do what they need to do. 24 Solution design for the final release has been completed, and Inland Revenue is on track with testing its systems and processes to ensure that everything will work as intended. Two independent assurance reviews will begin shortly, as has been the case ahead of previous major releases, and the results will be reported to the Minister of Finance and me in due course. 25 Similar to previous major releases, Inland Revenue will be closed to customers for a short period to enable the cutover to new systems and processes. Cutover is scheduled to take place over the Labour Day weekend and, at this stage, officials estimate that it will take approximately six days. This means that Inland Revenue will be closed to customers for up to three days either side of the weekend, which is similar to the amount of time the department was closed for the releases implemented in April 2019 and April 2020. The length of the closure will be confirmed through a series of three mock go-lives, which are full dress rehearsals for go-live, that begin in July 2021. Inland Revenue will make payments in advance to customers for any entitlements they are due to receive during the period the department is closed, such as Working for Families. 26 Given the sometimes complex circumstances of child support customers, and the changes to online services that all customers use, Inland Revenue is expecting some customers to get in contact as they get used to new ways of doing things. It is highly likely that customers will see some differences in the way the new system works compared to the old system. Inland Revenue is very focused on minimising any impacts on customers, however experience with previous releases shows that customer contacts increase following go-live until customers become familiar with the new systems and processes. 27 Inland Revenue is communicating and engaging regularly with customers and stakeholders about the changes being made to ensure they are ready for them. Closer to go-live, the department will send information directly to customers and stakeholders and will supplement this with content on its website and advertising to child support 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] customers. New functionality in myIR will enable customers to link directly to step-by- step demos / quick reference guides. This has not been possible for previous releases. 28 Once these changes have been implemented, following a period of early-life support, Inland Revenue’s focus will turn to completing the final work on the programme which will be largely invisible to customers. Risk remains high 29 Inland Revenue’s operational risk profile has been high during transformation, largely due to co-existence. Co-existence refers to running old and new systems in parallel until all products have migrated to the new core platform. That risk, while much reduced, will remain until the programme closes. Ensuring Inland Revenue moves completely off its heritage systems and processes is critical to fully realise the benefits of transformation, and to reduce the department’s operational risk to more normal levels. 30 The most significant risks I see for the remainder of the programme are: 30.1 Child support customers requiring more support than expected following the move to new systems and processes. To mitigate this, Inland Revenue has extensive communications and engagement activities planned, including sending information directly to customers to ensure they are aware of what is happening, and when. However, there is the potential for difficulties as child support customers can have complex and unique circumstances and can be hard to reach. 30.2 Retaining the specialist and skilled resources needed through until completion, in light of possible demand for these skills from other major change programmes. To mitigate this, Inland Revenue will work with other agencies if necessary to ensure that scarce and skilled resources can be made available in a way that does not put the successful completion of transformation at risk and manages the workloads of individuals appropriately. 30.3 The on-going and unknown impacts of COVID-19. To date, the pandemic has not had a significant impact on transformation timelines. Inland Revenue has been able to keep the programme on track through the disruption caused by the pandemic as a result of the capabilities implemented by transformation. However, the possibility remains that there may be an impact on the final release in the event of another significant outbreak. The main mitigation is planning and preparing to go-live remotely, as has been the case with the two most recent releases. Inland Revenue is on track to complete its transformation programme by 30 June 2022 31 The majority of programme delivery activity will be complete by the end of 2021. The remaining activities to be concluded in the first half of 2022 will be focussed on completing any final technology changes including the decommissioning of all heritage systems. There are a significant number of old systems and supporting infrastructure that require careful turning off. There are also some key dependencies that require careful management, for example moving Inland Revenue’s payroll solution to the cloud. Analysis has been completed to a very detailed level, and decommissioning is well underway. 32 As at May 2021, Inland Revenue had decommissioned approximately 60% of its heritage systems and removed around 15% of the infrastructure components from its heritage 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] data centres. There is not a direct correlation between applications and infrastructure, as much of the infrastructure supports multiple applications. 33 Inland Revenue intends to complete archiving of all heritage data by 31 March 2022, and to decommission all heritage systems by 30 April 2022. Decommissioning of remaining heritage networking and infrastructure will be completed by 30 June 2022. 34 While the transformation programme will conclude, some work will continue beyond 30 June 2022. For example, further refinement of Inland Revenue’s enterprise support services platform and a re-fresh of the software used in contact centres. This is not unusual for a programme of this scale, scope, and duration and will not delay the closure of the programme. 35 Changes to Inland Revenue’s operating model have been made progressively since 2018. This year, those changes will be completed. The department’s new model for back- office services was established on 1 March 2021. Consultation on proposed changes to some customer-facing Team Lead and technical and compliance specialist roles was completed in May 2021. The resulting changes are expected to be completed by September 2021. 36 The number of full time equivalent staff, both those on permanent and fixed term contracts, has declined from 5,662 at 30 June 2016 to 4,269 at 31 March 2021. Inland Revenue has used contingent workers for approximately 20 years, to service its traditionally busy peak income tax periods. One of the aims of transformation was to smooth workflow over peak periods and reduce the need for a large contingent workforce. As a result of the changes made, Inland Revenue is now able to work much more efficiently and effectively and continue to provide the level of service customers expect with fewer people. For example, this year, the department did not need contingent workers to support the issuing of automatic income tax assessments. 37 Inland Revenue is continually updating its forecasts of how much it expects to spend on transformation until its completion in the 2021/22 financial year. By the 2021 October baseline update, the department will have a good idea of the amount of funding that may be handed back at the completion of the programme. It is possible that final adjustments may be made in the 2022 March baseline update. Modernisation of the revenue system will continue after the programme closes 38 While the programme will come to an end, Inland Revenue itself will keep transforming as the changes made over the last few years are embedded and the department matures the use of its new capabilities. This will help to ensure the benefits of transformation are enduring. 39 When the government decided to invest in transformation, Inland Revenue committed to delivering a range of benefits over a 10-year period ending in 2023/24. Although the programme will come to an end, Inland Revenue will continue to report on the progress it is making with achieving its benefit commitments. As there will no longer be programme-specific reporting, the department is considering how it will continue to provide regular, transparent, and visible progress updates. 40 Looking ahead there are opportunities to maximise Inland Revenue’s effectiveness and to drive further value from the significant investment made in transforming the department’s capabilities. The optimal timeframe is from early-mid 2022, once the 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] programme has completed its key deliverables. Inland Revenue is already sharing its experience with others and there are undoubtedly opportunities to work further with both the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for New Zealanders. 41 It’s important to note however that not every opportunity will be a good fit with Inland Revenue’s capabilities. In my view, Inland Revenue’s areas of strength are: 41.1 Delivering services based on core information, particularly income and customer data. 41.2 Collection and payment of money/processing at scale. 41.3 High-volume, digital transaction processing, rather than services that rely on high levels of discretion and/or an extensive customer-facing presence. 41.4 Delivering large scale, consistent, rules-based initiatives that leverage the capabilities of its commercial-off-the-shelf systems. 41.5 Analytical tools and capability, including ‘what-if’ analysis and risk assessment. 42 When considering how to leverage these strengths, there is a balance to be struck with ensuring Inland Revenue can continue to deliver its existing outcomes and respond to our priorities. Any proposals for Inland Revenue to take on additional work or new initiatives will need to be considered in this light. Next steps 43 The next steps are to: 43.1 continue with preparations for the implementation of the final release in the programme; 43.2 continue with the on-going programme of independent quality assurance; and 43.3 provide a further progress update to Cabinet by November 2021. Consultation 44 A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation; the Department of Internal Affairs (Government Chief Digital Officer); the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment; the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development; the New Zealand Customs Service; and Stats NZ. Financial Implications 45 The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Human Rights 46 The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Legislative Implications 47 The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory Impact Analysis 48 The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Gender Implications 49 The proposals in this paper have no gender implications. Disability Perspective 50 The proposals in this paper have no implications for people with disabilities. Proactive Release 51 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes, in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, Public Service Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) 52 The Treasury, Public Service Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer recognise Inland Revenue’s efforts to smoothly roll-out the Business Transformation programme. We are confident that the programme will end on-time and on-budget. This is a substantial achievement, especially given the additional work that was necessary as a result of COVID-19. 53 As Inland Revenue has identified, some risks remain, especially those relating to the go- live of the child support system (in October 2021) and the decommissioning of the heritage system (to June 2022). Central agencies consider appropriate steps are being taken to manage these risks. 54 In the previous update, we noted our concern “...about Inland Revenue’s ability to sustainably realise the projected revenue uplift and administrative savings, while also maintaining the tax system’s integrity at current levels.” Those concerns remain. Funding was reprioritised in March 2021 to enable Inland Revenue to temporarily retain more staff, in addition to new time-limited funding for COVID-related work. However, further funding may need to be considered as the future shape and size of the organisation becomes clearer. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that paid parental leave, unclaimed money, duties, and New Zealand foreign trusts went live on new systems and processes on 28 February 2021; 2 note that child support will migrate to new systems and processes in October 2021 and that Inland Revenue’s online services will be upgraded at the same time; 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 3 note that Inland Revenue estimates it will be closed for up to six days, including Labour Day weekend, to enable child support to migrate to new systems and processes and its online services to be upgraded; 4 note that Inland Revenue is on track to close the programme by 30 June 2022 after decommissioning of heritage systems and processes has been completed; 5 note that by the October 2021 baseline update Inland Revenue will estimate the amount of funding that may be handed back; 6 note the next progress update will be provided to Cabinet by November 2021.

Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Navtej Singh) The submitters support the annual income tax rates for the 2020–21 tax year remaining the same as for the 2019–20 tax year as specified in schedule 1, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comments Officials note the submissions. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 23 Feasibility expenditure 25 OVERVIEW Businesses in New Zealand can generally claim a tax deduction for business expenses. Feasibility expenditure is expenditure that is undertaken to determine the practicability of a new proposal. Not all such expenditure is currently deductible and where a deduction is denied, this can deter a firm from investing in that proposal. The August 2016 Supreme Court ruling in Trustpower v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Trustpower) limited the deductibility of costs incurred to evaluate the feasibility of a project that is later abandoned. Following that decision, the Bill proposes greater deductibility of feasibility expenditure to encourage business innovation and investment, specifically where expenditure is incurred in developing assets where that expenditure does not result in a completed asset. The proposed changes in the Bill would enable deductions to be spread over a five-year period, with de minimis amounts of expenditure of less than $10,000 being able to be immediately deducted. The proposals would come into effect for expenditure incurred in the 2020–21 income year. There were 10 submissions received on the proposals. There was broad support for the main thrust of the proposals, but there was also significant concern that the proposals did not go far enough. All legislative references in this report refer to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise noted. Glossary Abandonment costs – in the course of abandoning a project, a business could incur further costs relating to remediation or terminating contracts. For example, the cost of restoring a river where work had commenced to dam it. Balance date – means the last date of a person’s income year. Many New Zealand-owned companies will have a 31 March balance date, while many foreign-owned companies will have a different balance date that is consistent with the wider international group’s reporting and filing obligations. General permission – The “general permission” allows a deduction where a sufficient link exists between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning activity. That is, a deduction can be claimed for expenditure or loss incurred in the course of earning assessable income or while carrying on a business in order to earn assessable income. Income year – means the period for which a person’s income tax liability is calculated. This period is generally for 12 months. 26 APPLICATION DATE (Clauses 11 and 16) Issue: Proposal should be backdated Submission (Auckland Airport, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, PwC) The submitters consider that application of the feasibility expenditure proposals should be backdated. Submitters have suggested a range of application dates and a range of reasons for backdating. a) The amendments should be backdated to the Trustpower decision given that the Court overruled an established position, creating uncertainty as to the point at which costs must be capitalised. Although there is a need to carefully manage the fiscal impacts of any law change, especially in the current environment, the proposals can effectively achieve that balance. (EY) b) The application date should be brought forward to the 2019–20 income year to allow taxpayers to utilise the rules where projects have been abandoned due to COVID-19. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) c) Implementing tax policy changes based on an income year will usually provide a fair and consistent outcome. However, projects cancelled or deferred as a result of COVID- 19 may produce arbitrary and unfair outcomes based on a taxpayer’s balance date. For example, taxpayers with a 31 March balance date may be able to claim deductions for projects abandoned due to COVID-19 between 1 April 2020 and 30 June 2020, while taxpayers with a 30 June balance date would not be able to claim a deduction under the proposed rules for projects abandoned during the same period. The application date should be brought forward to ensure that it covers all expenditure incurred in relation to qualifying capital projects that are abandoned as a result of the impact of COVID- 19, not just expenditure incurred after the date the rules take effect. (Auckland Airport, PwC) d) Deductions should be allowed for projects that are abandoned on or after 23 March 2020, being the date of the Prime Minister’s announcement of Alert Level 4. (Auckland Airport, PwC) Comment The rules are proposed to apply to expenditure incurred in the 2020–21 or later income years for projects that are abandoned during or after the 2020–21 income year. Officials do not favour backdating the application of the proposals to the Supreme Court’s decision in Trustpower or by a full year (submission points a) and b) above). Either of these approaches would have a significant fiscal cost, as would allowing a deduction for all past expenditure incurred in relation to capital projects abandoned due to COVID-19. Backdating will also not address any economic distortion created by the current law, as taxpayers have already made the relevant investment decisions. 27 Officials do not consider that taxpayers with early or standard balance dates (for example, 31 March) and who have abandoned capital projects after the announcement of the Alert Level 4 lockdown will generally be significantly advantaged relative to taxpayers with late balance dates (for example, 30 June) who have also abandoned projects around the same timeframe. To qualify for a deduction, the expenditure must have been incurred by the taxpayer in the 2020–21 income year or a later income year (which is unlikely to be the case for a project abandoned due to COVID-19, even for a taxpayer with an early or standard balance date). On this basis, officials do not recommend any backdating. However, there could be a significant advantage for early and standard balance date taxpayers compared to late balance date taxpayers if the matter raised below by submitters on widening the scope to include costs in abandoning property is accepted (see Issue: Abandonment costs). This is because costs in abandoning property may be incurred for income tax purposes in the period between the Level 4 lockdown announcement and the beginning of the 2020–21 income year for a late balance date taxpayer. As noted below, officials consider that further work is required to understand the impact of including abandonment costs within the scope of the measures. This work could also take into account the interaction between these costs and backdating the proposals to the Level 4 lockdown announcement. However, any work would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing of deduction Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The timing of the deduction should be clarified in the legislation to confirm that if the decision to abandon the property is made before the tax return for the previous income year has been filed, the deduction can be taken in that tax return, rather than waiting another year to take the deduction in the return relating to the income year in which the property was abandoned. Comment The policy intent is for the first deduction under proposed section DB 66 to be taken in the income year in which the property is abandoned. This outcome should not change simply because an income tax return has not been filed for a previous income year. Officials consider this outcome is clear in the draft legislation and no further changes are required to the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 PRE-COMMENCEMENT EXPENDITURE (Clause 16) Issue: Deductibility of pre-commencement feasibility expenditure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) a) The scope of the proposals should be expanded beyond abandoned capital projects to include expenditure incurred to explore the viability of investing in a new business asset, property, opportunity or model. In particular, the proposals should apply to “pre- commencement expenditure” (expenditure incurred prior to the underlying business being carried on and that would be currently denied a deduction because it does not satisfy the general permission for deductibility in section DA 1). The general permission should not apply where expenditure meets the proposed feasibility cost definition. This also applies where businesses are “pivoting” in new directions due to COVID-19. (Deloitte, KPMG) b) The feasibility rules should provide support to start-ups in particular. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) c) As long as a person is in business and earning section CB 1 business income, they should be allowed a deduction for pre-commencement expenditure. The link to earning business income along with the private limitation should prevent deductions from being taken inappropriately (for example by taxpayers claiming they were exploring a business by incurring expenditure of a private nature). If this is considered insufficient, the Australian “non-commercial loss rules” for individuals could be adapted to only allow a deduction where certain objective tests are met. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) d) An issue is where there is no depreciable asset, but a change to business processes, and progress in relation to a new business process is abandoned (for example a new process is explored in relation to keeping food warm for delivery). It is unclear whether the scope of the rules is wide enough to cover consideration of new business models/services. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) e) The legislation or guidance should confirm whether or not an expense incurred that was non-deductible at that time (because, for example, it did not satisfy the general permission) but is later applied towards completing, creating or acquiring property will be deductible under the feasibility rules. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The general permission requires there to be a nexus between the expenditure and the derivation of income, or for the expenditure to have been incurred in the course of the person carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving income. In the case of a start-up activity, the general permission is not satisfied means that any expenditure relating to the activity incurred before an actual business has materialised is not deductible. 29 For a taxpayer with an existing business who is looking to diversify into new product offerings, it means that the proposed change to the taxpayer’s business model has to be very minor for any expenditure incurred in investigating the feasibility of the proposed change to be deductible. Officials agree there are good reasons for deductions for pre-commencement feasibility expenditure to generally be available to taxpayers with existing businesses. However, expanding the scope of the feasibility proposals to override the general permission in any circumstance is a significant change involving fiscal and integrity risks. Officials refer to a submission to this effect (see Issue: Support for retaining the general permission). A concern (which is particularly relevant in the case of start-ups but in some cases may also apply to taxpayers with existing businesses) is that some taxpayers may claim deductions for expenditure that is of a private rather than business nature, such as for a hobby. Officials acknowledge that submitters have suggested a range of measures aimed at minimising this risk, but consider that it would nevertheless be inappropriate to make such a significant change without properly working through the detail and consulting on it. Therefore, officials consider it would be better to introduce a fully worked-through proposal for allowing deductions for pre-commencement expenditure for taxpayers with existing businesses at a later stage, rather than attempt to make such a change now. However, further consideration of this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Officials disagree with expanding the scope of the proposal to include new business models or processes. This is because the policy intent of the proposed rules is to allow deductions for expenditure that is related to making progress towards acquiring or creating property that, if acquired or completed, would be taxable on disposal (revenue account property) or that would provide benefits that decline in value over time and for which depreciation or amortisation deductions would be available. Finally, officials consider that the appropriate time for considering whether the general permission is satisfied is at the time the expenditure is incurred, rather than when the property is abandoned. Officials consider that this position is reflected in the proposed legislation. In agreement with the submission at paragraph e), guidance will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin on this outcome. Recommendation That submission points a), b), c) and d) be declined, but agree with submission e) that guidance will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin. Issue: Support for retaining general permission Submission (EY) We strongly support the need to maintain a nexus with an established business or income generating activity, and therefore agree with the proposals in so far as they maintain the need to satisfy the general permission for deductibility. An alternate approach risks the tax system 30 being used to subsidise hobbies and business ventures that are not genuine income-earning activities. Comment Officials note the submitter’s support for retaining the requirement that the expenditure satisfy the general permission. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 31 GAP BETWEEN PROPOSAL AND COST BASE FOR DEPRECIATION (Clause 16) Issue: Indirect expenditure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) a) The wording of the proposed legislation should be wide enough to include indirect expenditure that may be ancillary to the creation of the property. All costs should be captured within proposed section DB 66 in order to prevent any black hole expenditure, even if it would not be able to be capitalised to the cost of property if completed, created or acquired. It would be useful if the legislation included a specific rule to determine the expenditure, both direct and indirect, that would qualify for the deduction. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) b) Alternatively, detailed guidance should be published on the Inland Revenue website and in the Tax Information Bulletin or in an Interpretation Statement. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment a) Officials consider that the wording of the proposed provisions is broad and captures expenditure that is incurred in relation to making progress towards creating, completing or acquiring property that would be depreciable property or revenue account property, which would include both direct and indirect costs. b) In line with standard procedure, following enactment of the Bill, guidance and examples of the types of expenditure within the scope of the proposal will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation a) That the submission be declined. b) That the submission be accepted, noting that guidance will be provided. Issue: Asymmetry between feasibility proposals and depreciation Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) There is a potential difference between the expenditure that can be deducted if a capital project is abandoned compared with the counterfactual scenario where the same project is successful. 32 The scope of the provision in the Bill is too narrow and does not align with the announcements made by the Ministers of Revenue and Finance, which indicated that a deduction would be allowed for feasibility expenditure regardless of whether the project is abandoned. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Submitters have made some suggestions to address this asymmetry. a) Proposed section DB 66(1) could be amended to read: “This section applies when a person has—(a) incurred expenditure for the income year in relation to materially advancing, or tangibly progressing, a specific capital project or depreciable asset, that if it were to be completed, created, or acquired, the property would be...”. This would ensure there is no distinction between a successful and unsuccessful project. The definition of “cost” for depreciation purposes should be amended so that it includes indirect costs that are not otherwise deductible, and which are incurred in relation to making progress towards completing, creating or acquiring the property. Taking this approach should mean that there is no gap where expenditure becomes non-deductible black hole expenditure. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) b) The cost of depreciable and revenue account property should be defined consistently in the proposals to ensure there is no residual “black hole” expenditure if the project is successful because the expenditure cannot be capitalised into the cost base of the property. (KPMG) Comment a) Officials acknowledge the matter raised in submissions but consider that the current drafting is broad and sufficient to ensure a broad range of feasibility expenditure will be deductible. The current proposals provide an appropriate balance between fiscal cost considerations and removing tax barriers for investment caused by the non- deductibility of black hole expenditure. In many cases, where property is completed/created/acquired, expenditure on capital account will be able to be capitalised to the cost of the property and be deductible over time. b) Officials also note that changing what is included in the cost of depreciable or revenue account property would be a significant change that ought to be fully consulted on. Further consideration of this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 33 CLAWBACK (Clause 11) Issue: Scope of clawback provision Submission (Matter raised by officials) There is a potential asymmetry between the expenditure that can be deducted under the proposal for feasibility expenditure if the property is abandoned and the expenditure previously deducted that would be returned as income under the clawback provision if the capital project is reinstated (as the clawback provision requires that the expenditure is “directly for the property”). Officials consider that all expenditure deducted under proposed section DB 66 should be returned as income under the clawback if the project is reinstated or the expenditure is used to create, complete or acquire similar property. Comment The clawback is an integrity measure directed at situations where taxpayers may be incentivised to unnecessarily abandon work on property, then subsequently reinstate it in order to obtain greater deductions. In order for the clawback to be effective in ensuring there is no incentive for such behaviour, all of the deductions relating to the abandoned property made under proposed section DB 66 need to be clawed back if the project is reinstated or if the expenditure is used to create, complete or acquire similar property. This would ensure that the taxpayer cannot achieve a more favourable tax outcome by prematurely abandoning and then reinstating the project compared with seeing the project through to completion the first time. Clawing back all expenditure claimed would not undermine the policy intent of the proposals, which would still result in a wide range of costs being deductible for tax purposes and thereby improve productivity and encourage growth. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clawback of deductions – technical/interpretation issues Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) Submitters have raised a number of technical and interpretation issues with the clawback provision in proposed section CH 13. 34 a) References to “or similar property” in proposed section CH 13 should be deleted as this wording is superfluous, may result in overreach and reduces clarity in how the clawback would apply. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) b) While there is a need for this integrity measure, clarity is needed as to what is meant by “similar property” which is acquired later. The legislation should provide clarity and Inland Revenue should issue specific guidance as to what is sufficiently similar for the purposes of proposed section CH 13. (EY) c) The types of expenditure incurred that may be “directly for the property” are likely to be uncertain and a source of debate. The meaning of deductions that are “directly for the property” should be clarified in the Bill. Failing this, detailed guidance on the types of expenses that would be considered by Inland Revenue to be “directly for the property” should be published on Inland Revenue’s website and in the Tax Information Bulletin. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) d) The deductions that are “directly” for the property that are subject to the clawback should be more specific, namely those deductions that on subsequent completion or creation of the property are deductible under the depreciation regime or under section DB 23 (as a cost of revenue account property). (New Zealand Law Society) e) Guidance should be provided on what factors will be considered when determining whether a project represents the restart of an earlier abandoned project. (PwC) Comment In relation to points a) and b) above, officials acknowledge the points raised by submitters about the need for clarity but consider that the “or similar property” wording in proposed section CH 13 is necessary and should be retained. The clawback is an important integrity measure and it would likely be rare for the property that is eventually created, completed or acquired after reinstating a previously abandoned project to be exactly the same as what the taxpayer originally intended to create, complete or acquire, even though it might be very similar. Guidance on the meaning of “similar property” will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin. In the preceding item in this report (see Issue: Scope of clawback provision), officials recommend that the scope of the clawback be widened to ensure that all expenditure previously deducted under proposed section DB 66 related to the property is returned as income under the clawback if the project is reinstated. Officials note that if this recommendation is accepted by the Committee, the “directly for the property” wording in the clawback provision noted by submitters in points c) and d) above would no longer need to be clarified as accepting officials’ recommendation would see this wording removed from the provision. As per officials’ comments under Issue: Scope of clawback provision, we do not consider that the deductions clawed back upon reinstatement of the project should be limited to just those expenditures that would form part of the cost base of depreciable property or revenue account property. In relation to point e), officials agree that guidance on what factors will be considered when determining whether a project represents the restart of an earlier abandoned project would be useful. This guidance will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin. 35 Recommendation That the submission points a), c) and d) be declined, but points b) and e) be accepted and to note that guidance will be provided on the meaning of “similar property” and on what factors would be considered when determining whether a project represents the restart of an earlier abandoned project. Issue: Clawback – requirement to return income in period of reinstatement Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) Deductions should not be required to be returned as income in the period the asset is reinstated. This can result in a high upfront cost which could make restarting a project prohibitively expensive and encourage businesses not to go back to previous projects. A more sensible and compliance cost friendly approach would be for the reinstated asset to simply have a lower cost base for tax depreciation purposes, which ultimately achieves the same outcome and is merely a matter of timing. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) Alternatively, the income arising under the clawback should be able to be spread over five years at the option of the taxpayer to match the period of deductions. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The clawback is an important integrity measure. Without it, taxpayers could potentially accelerate depreciation deductions by prematurely “abandoning” and then reinstating capital projects. Although having a lower cost base for the reinstated property for tax depreciation purposes would ultimately achieve the same outcome in terms of the amount of expenditure deducted, timing is important. To avoid incentivising taxpayers to prematurely abandon and then reinstate projects, the taxpayer’s previous position needs to be reinstated before the property begins to be depreciated. Although officials note the potential cash flow impact of the clawback, it effectively puts a taxpayer back in the position they would have been had they not abandoned the asset. It is important to recognise that the taxpayer would have received a timing benefit from the expenditure claimed under the proposals. Officials also note that spreading the clawback income over five years as suggested by submitters would create complexity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 36 Issue: Lack of time limit for clawback Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Powerco, PwC) Several submitters considered that the clawback should be time limited. A number of different approaches were suggested. a) The clawback should only apply where property is subsequently completed, created or acquired within five years after the original project was abandoned. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) b) The period for which the clawback should apply should be limited to the existing time bar period in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (which in practice would be a period of four to five years). (Powerco) c) At a maximum, the time limit should be no more than seven years (being the period of time for which taxpayers must retain records under the general record keeping rules) (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, PwC). This seven-year time period should begin at the end of the income tax year that the first one-fifth deduction relates to. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) d) The clawback should apply only when an acquisition/project is subsequently completed within two years of the end of the proposed five-year spreading period or where there is a regular pattern of abandoned acquisitions/projects being reinstated. (KPMG) Comment Officials have concerns that it may be possible for expenditure to remain useful and be utilised many years in the future in relation to similar property. However, it is important to balance this against genuine business concerns about the availability of information required to make an adjustment under the clawback. A reasonable compromise in this instance would be to impose a seven-year time limit on the clawback following the end of the income year in which the final deduction is claimed under the five-year spreading method in proposed section DB 66. Recommendation That the submission that the clawback be time limited be accepted subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Interaction between clawback and deductibility proposals Submission (Matter raised by officials) 37 Officials have identified a risk that expenditure could be spread to periods subsequent to the period in which the feasibility expenditure clawback applies. This could result in the clawback potentially not applying to all expenditure claimed under proposed section DB 66. For example, work is abandoned in Year 1 on property that would have been depreciable property if completed. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for relevant expenditure over a five-year period. The taxpayer subsequently reinstates work on the property, which is completed in Year 3. Proposed section CH 13 would apply in Year 3 to clawback income based on the amount of expenditure claimed in Years 1 to 3. However, section DB 66 would continue to spread deductions into Years 4 and 5, with no corresponding clawback in those years or subsequently. Comment Once property is reinstated, a taxpayer should be brought back to the position they would be in if they had not abandoned the property. This means that clawback should apply to all prior year deductions under proposed section DB 66 and no further deductions should be available under the proposals. Any lack of clarity can be addressed by preventing the spreading of expenditure under proposed section DB 66 to any periods in which the underlying property has been completed, created or acquired. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 38 OTHER SCOPE AND TECHNICAL ISSUES (Clause 16) Issue: Abandonment costs Submission (Auckland Airport, New Zealand Law Society, Powerco, PwC) The scope of the proposals should be reviewed to ensure the deductibility of expenditure incurred in the course of abandoning projects, such as termination and remediation costs. While some of the expenditure may be deductible under ordinary principles, material amounts would be treated as non-deductible capital expenditure and this gives rise to the same policy concerns as the current treatment of expenditure on feasibility and abandoned capital projects. Comment Officials acknowledge the policy argument for allowing taxpayers to deduct abandonment costs. However, officials note that there would be a potentially significant fiscal cost involved in allowing these expenditures to be deducted. It is further noted that some abandonment costs (such as termination fees for cancelling contracts) may in some instances be capital in nature and not give rise to taxable income to the supplier. In this situation, allowing the other party to the contract to take a deduction for the expenditure creates a potential asymmetry. Officials consider that further work is required to understand the impact of including abandonment costs within the scope of the measures. However, any work would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Partial abandonment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Where expenditure incurred relates to a component of an item of depreciable property, and the component itself is abandoned but the item of depreciable property is completed (with an alternative component), it is unclear whether a deduction would be allowed for expenditure relating to the abandoned component under these measures or whether expenditure relating to the abandoned component should be capitalised to the cost of the depreciable property and depreciated. Submitters have requested that a clarification be made to the legislation to address this issue. 39 Alternatively, this uncertainty in treatment should be addressed by issuing guidance on this matter. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) As a compliance cost measure where taxpayers have capitalised these costs to the cost of the final depreciable property, they should be allowed to retain this treatment rather than have to separate out the costs and treat them as a separate deduction under proposed section DB 66. A taxpayer election in this respect is consistent with the approach taken for capital contributions where taxpayers can either elect to apply a statutory set spreading period or exclude it from the depreciation base of the asset. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment It is possible that exploring the feasibility project may produce a number of distinct items of property that together make a larger item of property (with the larger item of property being the overall objective of the project). An example of this may be an electricity lines network where various options exist for a new transmission line route. In this situation it would not be unusual for a part or parts of property to be abandoned. Officials consider that if the costs that were incurred in exploring the viability of the abandoned property cannot be capitalised to the cost of the overall project in this situation and are otherwise not deductible, a deduction for the expenditure relating to the abandoned option would be available under the proposals as currently drafted. Guidance clarifying this position will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the request for the legislation to be amended be declined, but the point about the need for clarity as to what happens when there is partial abandonment be noted. Guidance will be provided on this issue. Issue: Improvements to farmland Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Deductibility should be extended to expenditure incurred in relation to abandoned improvements to farmland that, if acquired, created or completed, would have been amortisable under section DO 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment The submitter points out that feasibility expenditure is commonly incurred by taxpayers in the agricultural sector. Examples given by the submitter are boring wells, small dams and small-scale irrigation. Officials acknowledge the issue raised by the submitter and note that further work is required to understand the impact of including improvements to farmland within the scope of the proposals. Officials consider it would be better to make this change after having properly 40 worked through its implications. Further consideration of this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Costs of assessing feasibility of takeover/merger activities Submission (EY) Under the proposed rules no deduction is available for costs incurred in assessing the feasibility of a take-over/merger with another business if the business seeks to acquire the shares (as shares are not a depreciable asset). Given the widespread economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, due diligence is more important than ever. Deductions related to studying options in cases where the expenditure would not produce a depreciable asset should be deductible. (EY) Comment Deductions should only be available under the feasibility expenditure proposal insofar as the expenditure is related to making progress towards acquiring or creating property that, if acquired or completed, would be taxable on disposal (revenue account property), or that would provide benefits that decline in value over time and for which depreciation or amortisation deductions would be available. As the submitter has noted, shares are not a depreciable asset. On this basis, it would not be appropriate to expand the scope of the proposal to include costs incurred in assessing the feasibility of a company take-over or merger to the extent the costs relate to the acquisition of shares. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Property depreciated at a rate of zero percent Submission (Deloitte) These rules should apply to the subset of property that is depreciated at the rate of zero percent. Providing tax relief for this expenditure is consistent with addressing the housing shortage. 41 Comment Deductions should only be available under the feasibility expenditure proposal insofar as the expenditure is related to making progress towards acquiring or creating property that, if acquired or completed, would be taxable on disposal (revenue account property) or for which depreciation or amortisation deductions would be available. Providing deductions for expenditure relating to abandoned property that, if completed or acquired, would be depreciated at the rate of zero percent is inconsistent with this policy intention. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Guidance and examples are needed Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) a) Guidance and examples should be provided to give context to the rules. Examples that consider broader project costs and other expenditures that sit in a more “grey” area would be useful, and situations where apportionment may be required due to the feasibility expenditure being directed towards both depreciable/revenue account property and other property would be useful. b) Alternatively, the uncertainty in situations where apportionment may be required could be resolved by further clarifying the legislation. (Deloitte) Comment Officials agree that guidance and examples in this area would be useful to taxpayers. This will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin in line with standard procedure on enactment of the Bill. Recommendation a) That the submission be accepted, noting that guidance will be provided. b) That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of example in commentary Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Example 3 in the Commentary should be clarified. It is the Group’s understanding that where costs are capitalised towards a depreciable intangible asset which is subsequently abandoned before completion, those costs are included within the scope of these proposals and can be 42 spread and deducted over five years. Example 3 seems to suggest that because the design expenditure is incurred in relation to depreciable intangible property, it is subject to tax depreciation and therefore cannot be deducted under proposed section DB 66 (as a deduction is already being taken). The position in Example 3 should be that the design expenditure should be spread and deducted over five years under section DB 66, unless a more immediate deduction is available as depreciable intangible property. Comment Officials agree that the example could have been clearer and it has since been clarified. A similar example with additional context will also be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, noting that guidance will be provided. Issue: Drafting issue Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) As the legislation currently stands, the de minimis may be read as being on a project-by- project basis. This is on the basis that subsection DB 67(2) refers back to subsection DB 67(1) as the object of the deduction and subsection DB 67(1) is drafted on the basis of a single item of property. The Group understands this is not the intention of the legislation, therefore this should be clarified. Comment Officials will draft changes to the wording of the proposed legislation to make it clearer that the de minimis does not apply on the basis of a single capital project or item of property, and will consult with the submitter on the revised drafting. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: De minimis should be increased Submission (EY, PwC) At the current proposed level, the threshold for proposed section DB 67 is too low and will not materially ease compliance or provide much benefit to small taxpayers. In the current COVID-19 context, a higher value threshold (even a temporary one) would provide a better 43 incentive to undertake the necessary investigations to look to transform or develop a business to survive the recession. The threshold should be set at $50,000. Comment Officials note that proposed section DB 67 is a de minimis rule to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers with very low amounts of feasibility expenditure. This rule is broader in scope than proposed section DB 66 (as it does not require the abandonment of property) and is also not subject to the claw-back rule, meaning that it is important to exercise care in how widely the rule is applied. Officials also note that the $10,000 threshold is consistent with the current threshold for non-deductible legal fees in the income tax legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Separately identifiable assets and goodwill Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current drafting of proposed sections DB 66 and DB 67 is intentionally wide in order to achieve the policy intent of reducing tax barriers for business investment. However, it is possible that the drafting may unintentionally provide deductions for expenditure on separately identifiable assets (such as shares and goodwill) that would otherwise not be deductible. Comment The proposed rules provide an opportunity for a wider range of expenditure to be deductible, and it is important that they contain appropriate integrity measures to ensure they do not give rise to unintended outcomes. For example, in the course of a capital project, a person could acquire shares in a business that holds assets (for example, intellectual property) that it needs in order to make progress towards creating an item of depreciable property. It is not intended that expenditure incurred on shares would be deductible under the proposals, but there is a risk that the current drafting would allow such a deduction. This problem could be remedied by including a list of expenditure (for example, on separately identifiable assets acquired in the course of completing/creating/acquiring property that is abandoned) that would not be deductible under the proposals. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 45 Land 47 OVERVIEW Existing provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 tax sales of land by land developers, dealers, builders, and connected persons. In addition, there is the so-called “intention test”, which applies to all taxpayers. If a person sells a property that was acquired with the purpose or intention of disposal, they are taxed on the income arising from that disposal. There are limited exclusions for properties used as a residence or business premises. However, these exclusions do not apply if the person has a regular pattern of buying and selling land (“regular pattern restriction”). The bright-line test was introduced in 2015 as an additional charging provision in the land sale rules, with the aim of buttressing the intention test. Initially, it applied to disposals of residential land made within two years of acquisition but has since been extended to five years for land acquired on or after 28 March 2018. At the same time as the introduction of the bright-line test, additional reporting requirements were introduced for land transactions – in particular, the introduction of the Land Transfer Tax Statement, which must be completed by buyers and sellers alike. The Bill includes proposals that emerged out of the first tranche of the previous Government’s review of the current land rules undertaken in 2019. In particular, the Bill proposes: • to amend the regular pattern restriction outlined above to ensure that it cannot be circumvented simply by changing ownership patterns and what is done to the land. At the same time, the proposal limits the regular pattern restriction to those who acquire land with a purpose or intention of disposal. The proposal would apply to land acquired on or after the enactment of the Bill, but land acquired before this date could be considered for determining whether there is a pattern; • to clarify that the cost of revenue account property is deductible, even if, at the time the costs were incurred, it was not known that the disposal would be taxed or if the property was used privately. This is particularly relevant in the context of the land sale rules, as someone may not know at the time they purchase a property or make improvements that they will sell it within the bright-line period. This proposal would apply from 1 April 2008, being the commencement date of the Income Tax Act 2007, as it is a taxpayer-friendly measure that would align the law with current practice; and • to relocate the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement to regulations. The content is currently prescribed in primary legislation in the Land Transfer Act 2017. The proposed change would enable the content of the form to be updated in the future in a timely manner. In this report, officials recommend a technical amendment to the definition of “dwelling” to ensure that vacant properties are within the scope of the term. This proposed amendment should be retrospective to the introduction of the bright-line test, 1 October 2015, to ensure that the law aligns with the practical application to date. Overall, there were nine submissions that covered the land sale rules. Four submitters explicitly expressed support for the first proposal (regular pattern restriction), three for the second (deductibility of revenue account property), and one for the third (relocating the contents of the Land Transfer Tax Statement). 48 Regarding the regular pattern restriction proposal, three submitters do not consider that it should impact the business premises exclusion. Officials consider that there needs to be consistency with the other exclusions, and note that genuine commercial transactions would not be caught as the proposal would also require that the land be acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal. No submitters were opposed to the proposals regarding the deductibility of revenue account property and relocating the contents of the Land Transfer Tax Statement. Technical submissions were made on proposed new terms and how they are defined. For example, four submitters considered that the term “significant involvement” used in the regular pattern restriction should be defined. However, as an anti-avoidance rule, it would not be appropriate to have a prescriptive test as it could be easily structured around. Three submitters suggested that instead of referring to a group of persons, it would be better to have an explicit link to the established “associated persons” rules. The intent of the rule is to capture slightly different relationships than those provided for in the associated persons rules. A number of submissions were made in relation to aspects of the land sale rules that are not within scope of the proposals contained in the Bill. Officials note that these issues would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme but could be considered as the land review progresses. 49 HABITUAL BUYING AND SELLING OF LAND (Clauses 5, 6 and 7) Issue: Support for the amendments Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Navtej Singh) Four submitters support the proposed amendments. The submitters note that the amendments are aimed at ensuring the land sales rules are suitably robust, are reasonable and in line with the intention of the overall legislative change in this area, proactively address abuse of the regular pattern rules, which is crucial without a broad-based capital gains tax, and will bring more opportunities for first home buyers. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Support for purpose of disposal limitation Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Three submitters support the proposal that land must be acquired for a purpose or intention of disposal before the regular pattern restrictions will apply. The submitters note this will ensure that the rules are suitably targeted in the first instance and should help ensure that genuine transactions are not unintentionally captured by the proposed rules. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Amendment to business premises exclusion not necessary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG) The proposed amendments should not be made to the business premises exclusion in section CB 19. There is no evidence to suggest that the current regular pattern restrictions in the business premises exclusion are not operating as intended. The requirement in the business premises 50 exclusion that the land must be used for a substantial business already provides sufficient restriction. Larger taxpayer groups are likely to be disadvantaged by the proposed grouping rule since transaction frequency can be expected to be higher across more related/controlled entities. Any specific concerns regarding a person or group and their pattern of behaviour should be addressed under the current anti-avoidance provisions in Part G of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment The substantial business requirement in the business premises exclusion does restrict a taxpayer’s ability to rely on that exclusion. However, the current business premises exclusion also already contains a regular pattern restriction. To clarify – the amendments do not propose to change that overall policy setting. Instead, the proposal to amend the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion aims to ensure that there is consistency with the other regular pattern restrictions. It also ensures that the current regular pattern restriction cannot be structured around by, for example, using subsidiaries to carry out different transactions in order to avoid a pattern being established. This ensures that the current restriction operates as intended. The inclusion of the requirement that the regular pattern restrictions will not operate unless land is acquired with a purpose or intention of disposal will ensure that large taxpayer groups will not be disadvantaged by this amendment simply due to the scale of their transactions. The regular pattern restrictions are not intended to capture genuine commercial transactions where there was no intention to dispose of the land when it was acquired. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Group of persons – clarify “significant involvement or control” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society) The term “significant involvement” should be defined. The word “significant” is imprecise and it is not clear what type of involvement is required. The word “control” is also imprecise, and it is not clear what type of control is required (New Zealand Law Society). Comment Given the context of the regular pattern restrictions as anti-avoidance provisions, it is considered appropriate not to have a prescriptive test that could be structured around. The ordinary meaning of the words “significant involvement” and “control” provide sufficient guidance as to the types of relationships that will give rise to a “group of persons”. As stated 51 in the Commentary to the Bill, in this context these terms indicate that the relevant person is able to direct, alone or as part of a group, the relevant trust or entity’s decision-making. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Group of persons – “significant involvement” is not necessary Submission (KPMG) The term “significant involvement” should be omitted from the definition of a “group of persons”, or the definition should be modified so that it reads “significant involvement, and control in”, similar to section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. If a person is “able to direct, alone or as part of a group, the relevant trust or entity’s decision- making process”, it appears to us that the person would have “control” of the relevant trust or entity and therefore the term “significant involvement” is redundant. It is possible for a person to have “significant involvement” in a trust or entity and not have control of the trust or entity. The term materially expands the meaning of “a group of persons” without clear definition. Comment The use of both “significant involvement” and “control” in the definition of “a group of persons” was intended, as the terms can differ in meaning. As an anti-avoidance rule, the proposed definition of “group of persons” should refer to both. The use of the terms in section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 arises in a slightly different context. The provision provides for an exemption from tax for share disposals by certain foreign investors. For a foreign partnership to qualify for the tax exemption, there needs to be at least one general partner who has significant involvement in, and control of, the business activities. Tax exemptions are generally naturally tighter in scope to ensure they are contained, while anti-avoidance rules need to be broader to ensure they cannot be structured around. Therefore, although requiring both significant involvement in business activities and control thereof may be appropriate for a tax exemption, officials do not consider this appropriate for the “group of persons” definition and it should continue to refer to “significant involvement in, or control of”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 52 Issue: Group of persons – better to use associated person test Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) It would be better to have a clear link to the associated person rules. As currently drafted, the “group of persons” test could capture situations where people are not associated, such as where entities have a common employee but no common ownership, or where a parent and adult child own and occupy a series of properties. Comment It is intended that the “group of persons” test capture relationships where people would not ordinarily be “associated persons”, such as those raised in the submissions. The purpose of extending the regular pattern restrictions to a “group of persons” is to capture situations where people are acting together in a way that results in land being regularly bought and sold without being taxed. This requires capturing different relationships from those already caught by the associated person rules. Concerns about the test being broader than the associated person rules should be mitigated by the requirement that land must first be acquired for the purpose of disposal before the regular pattern restrictions apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Meaning of “regular pattern” – term does not achieve policy intent Submission (KPMG) The High Court considered the meaning of “regular pattern” in Parry v Commissioner of Inland Revenue and considered that it “denotes a similarity or likeness in the transactions”. The Bill commentary states that the policy intent is that the transactions are not required to be similar, so the use of the term “regular pattern” would not achieve this outcome. The word “pattern” should be deleted and the phrase “regularly engaged” should be used instead. Comment The concern being addressed by the current amendment is not the fact that the term “regular pattern” requires a similarity or likeness, but the fact that the current definition, and that considered by the High Court in Parry, required a regular pattern of either acquiring and disposing, or erecting and disposing of dwellinghouses. This led the Court in Parry to consider whether there was a regular pattern of erecting dwellinghouses, rather than focusing on whether there was a regular pattern of acquisition and disposal of land. It is considered that amending the regular pattern restrictions in sections CB 16 and CB 19 to only refer to acquiring and disposing of land used as a residence or business premises will ensure that the focus is on the similarity or likeness of the acquisition and disposal 53 transactions, rather than on whether similar activities (for example, building, renovating, etc) have been done on each piece of land while it is owned. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Group of persons – minor clarification Submission (Matter raised by officials) As currently drafted, the reference to a “trustee of a trust or another entity” in the second limb of the definition of “group of persons” in the regular pattern restrictions for the main home exclusion (section CB 16A) and the residential exclusion (section CB 16) could give rise to confusion because a trustee of a trust is not a legal entity. Comment The second limb of the definition of “group of persons” in the main home and residential exclusions is intended to ensure that persons who are not natural persons can form part of the group of persons where a natural person living in the property has significant involvement in, or control of, the activities of the non-natural person. The reference to a “trustee of a trust or another entity” should be amended to refer to a person that is not a natural person to provide more clarity that this covers all non-natural persons (including persons in their capacity as trustees), whether or not they can be described as an entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Sale and leaseback transactions Submission (EY) The proposed changes should specifically exclude sale and leaseback arrangements from the intention test for the purposes of the business premises exclusion. Large retail businesses are often required to acquire land and undertake the development of their own business premises because of the scarcity of capital and development capability in the New Zealand market. Sometimes land will be acquired and developed with an intention that once the development is complete, the land will be sold to a third-party landlord and leased back to the retailer. Given the land can be acquired with an intention of disposal, and these types of transactions can be repeated, these transactions could fall outside of the amended business premises exclusion in section CB 19. Such transactions should be considered acceptable and within 54 the business premises exclusion provided there is a substantial business that continues to operate on the premises which is not centred on property development/improvement. Comment The current business premises exclusion contains a regular pattern restriction. Under that restriction, a large retail business is not entitled to rely on the business premises exclusion if it regularly acquires land with an intention of entering sale and leaseback transactions once the land is developed. There is no intention to change this policy setting. The amendments simply ensure that large retail businesses that undertake such transactions cannot avoid this outcome by using separate subsidiaries to enter into each transaction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Guidance Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) An education campaign should be undertaken when the legislation is introduced, including publication of the policy intent and examples illustrating the application of the legislation. Comment Officials note that following enactment of the proposed amendments, Inland Revenue will provide guidance through a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, noting that guidance will be provided. 55 COST OF REVENUE ACCOUNT PROPERTY (Clause 14) Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Three submitters support the proposed amendment. Comment Officials note that the proposed amendment would have retrospective effect from 1 April 2008, to coincide with the introduction of the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed amendment ensures that the legislation aligns with the policy intent and how deductions are currently being allowed. The proposed amendment should therefore not have any real impact on taxpayers. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 56 LAND TRANSFER TAX STATEMENT Issue: Direct information sharing between LINZ and Statistics NZ Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Bill proposes changes to the Land Transfer Act 2017 to amend the Land Transfer Tax Statement provisions to allow the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement (LTTS) to be set by regulations. The LTTS is used to collect tax details and residency information of transferors and transferees of property in New Zealand. This information is provided to Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) at the point of property transfer. LINZ provides this information to Inland Revenue to assist in administering the tax system, particularly in relation to compliance with tax obligations. The information is also used to prepare quarterly releases on property transfers. The releases include information on the citizenship, visa status, or tax residency of people and companies involved in property transfers. The role of preparing these releases moved from LINZ to Statistics NZ in May 2018. Currently LINZ is only able to share the data collected from the LTTS with Inland Revenue in accordance with the legislative provisions set out in the Land Transfer Act 2017. To facilitate Statistics NZ’s role in preparing the quarterly releases, Inland Revenue currently on-shares the information collected on the LTTS with Statistics NZ under information sharing provisions contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Officials recommend that an amendment be made to the Land Transfer Act 2017 to allow LINZ to share the information collected on the LTTS with Statistics NZ directly. Comment This amendment will improve the information flows between agencies using the data collected on the LTTS by allowing LINZ as the agency collecting the information, to share this directly with Statistics NZ. Permitting direct information sharing in the Land Transfer Act 2017 is more transparent and will reduce the double handling of information. LINZ and Statistics NZ have an existing information sharing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and currently share other data. Following this amendment, the information-sharing MOU would be amended to facilitate this information sharing. Officials consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on this item, which did not have any issues with the proposed change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 57 Issue: Support for the amendment to move LTTS content to regulations Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 to allow the content of the Land Transfer Tax Statement to be moved to regulations. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 58 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Definition of “dwelling” and related terms Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “dwelling” and related terms in the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure that vacant residential properties are subject to the same tax rules as occupied residential properties, consistent with the policy intent. Comment The term “dwelling” is used in the definition of other terms such as “residential land” and “residential building” to determine whether a property is subject to the bright-line test, residential land withholding tax and the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules, and whether building depreciation and separate depreciation of commercial fit-out are available. The bright-line test taxes sales of residential property that occur within five years of acquisition, and the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules ensure that a property owner is not able to use losses arising from rental properties to offset other income tax liabilities. It was intended that these rules apply, broadly speaking, to land with a house on it regardless of whether the house is used or not used at all. The bright-line test uses the concept of “residential land”, which relies on the term “dwelling” with a few modifications. The existing definition of “dwelling” requires that a property be used predominantly as a place of residence or abode. There are concerns that the focus on actual use as a residence excludes residential properties that are predominantly vacant. This means they would not be subject to the bright-line test and rental loss ring-fencing rules, which is not consistent with the policy intent. Officials consider that the definition of “dwelling”, and potentially “residential building” and “residential land”, should be amended to include vacant residential properties. As this was an unintended oversight in the original drafting and it was never intended that a property could be outside the scope of the bright-line test by keeping it vacant, the amendment should be retrospective to the introduction of the bright-line test, 1 October 2015, to ensure that the law aligns with the practical application to date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 Issue: Future amendments Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC, EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Russell McVeagh) It is important that a comprehensive review of the rules be undertaken in the future to address distortions which may have arisen from ad hoc amendments over time, and to ensure that the rules are both coherent and fit for purpose. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) In particular, the following issues are raised for future consideration: • The business premises exclusion should be extended to apply where: − Premises are leased to, and occupied by, a company in the same wholly owned group as the landowner. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC) − Franchisees should be counted as agents for the purpose of “occupied” in section CB 19. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) − Space leased and occupied by third parties who provide services integral to the operation of the landowner’s business (for example, a hotel) should not be apportioned out under section CB 19, if these spaces are only a small part of the overall property. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • A specific disclosure regime should be introduced to monitor land transactions and provide evidence of a purpose or intention of disposal. (EY) • The bright-line test in section CB 6A should be amended to disregard transfers of land by a person to the trustee of a trust of which the person is a beneficiary and the principal settlor. (Russell McVeagh) Comment Officials acknowledge the matters raised in these submissions but note that it would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 61 Purchase price allocation 63 OVERVIEW The proposal is to insert sections GC 20 and GC 21. These sections will apply to sales of commercial property, businesses, and other bundles of assets, if entered into on or after 1 April 2021. The purpose of the proposal is to require a buyer and seller to make the same allocation of the total purchase price to the different assets (or classes of assets) sold. For example, in a purchase of commercial property, the proposal requires that the seller and buyer allocate the same amount to the land, the building, and the fit-out. This prevents the parties making inconsistent allocations which in aggregate result in a loss of revenue. This can happen, for example, if the seller allocates less of the sale price to fit-out than the buyer does. The proposal requires parties who agree an allocation between themselves to follow that allocation in their respective tax returns. If they do not agree, the vendor may notify an allocation to the buyer and the Commissioner. The allocation binds both the vendor and the purchaser. If the vendor does not make an allocation within two months of the transaction, the purchaser can notify an allocation, which binds both the purchaser and the vendor. Submissions were received, from business groups, advisors and an individual. Only one submitter was explicitly in favour of inconsistent allocations being allowed, but no submitters supported the proposed solution. Some argued that the required level of consistency could be achieved without legislative change, using increased information gathering and case intervention by the Commissioner. Others argued that any legislative change should involve empowering the Commissioner to resolve inconsistencies, rather than giving the seller the power to make a unilateral binding allocation. Yet others argued that the power to make the allocation should first be given to the buyer. As set out below, various technical changes have been recommended in response to submissions, but officials remain of the view that the basic approach adopted in the Bill is sound. 64 COMMENTS ON PROPOSAL AS A WHOLE (Clause 40) Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Navtej Singh) This submission supports the purchase price allocation amendments, as they will help to address the tax mismatches resulting from different price allocations by vendors and purchasers in asset sales. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for requirement that parties follow agreement in tax returns Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) If parties agree a purchase price allocation, they should be required to follow that agreed allocation in their tax returns. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Legislative changes are unnecessary and disproportionate to mischief; operational approach is more appropriate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Russell McVeagh, PwC) Purchasers and vendors will often have different views of the value of a business and its assets – this is a normal and expected outcome of well-functioning markets. Tax law should not interfere with it. (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). The proposals create a compliance burden for virtually the entire transaction market. The proposed rules in section GC 21 are not practical, do not reflect the intricacies of commercial negotiations, and do not appropriately accommodate situations where parties do not or cannot agree an allocation within the timeframe for the transaction. 65 A targeted operational approach would be more appropriate; Inland Revenue should conduct compliance audit activity to estimate the true extent of the problem. It should issue an operational statement outlining that where parties adopt different values, or non-market values, they risk costly and time-consuming disputes with the Commissioner. Also, Inland Revenue should use enforcement action to modify behaviour. Given that in most mixed-asset transactions the parties already agree an allocation, it is not clear that the rules in GC 21 are required. (PwC) Inland Revenue’s concern about the Commissioner’s lack of valuation expertise is inconsistent with the myriad of rules and Commissioner overrides that already exist and require the use of market (or other) values. The Commissioner will challenge some cases, argue valuation and obtain expert advice. Examples of areas in which this occurs are: transfer pricing, dividends, trading stock, and fringe benefit tax. Also section BG 1. The Commissioner sees both sides of a transaction and has access to an unrivalled base of asset sale transactions. (Russell McVeagh) The Government’s aims would be largely achieved by simply requiring written agreement between the vendor and purchaser. The incentive to comply with the rules would be the risk of challenge by Inland Revenue. This could be made even more effective by placing a requirement on the parties to notify Inland Revenue of their agreed allocation. Written agreement between transacting parties has become more common, partly due to increased audit activity in the area, and the suggestion of law change. (PwC) Parties are typically advised to agree an allocation in their documentation, and typically do agree one. The best evidence of what a vendor has received or a purchaser has paid is the contract under which the asset was sold. (Russell McVeagh) Only if that does not work should a legislative approach be considered. Inland Revenue should utilise new systems and processes from BT – Inland Revenue has not grasped the new capabilities of its system. Policy and operational practice should evolve. This legislative approach eschews intelligence gathering, development of commercial capabilities, and fails to enforce existing Income Tax Act rules. It may cause collateral damage and drive bad behaviour. The proposals appear to be based on the troubling premise that existing law is not being enforced. The remedy for this should be to improve enforcement practices, not to introduce new and prescriptive rules that may unnecessarily complicate and in some cases confer on one party a unilateral power to vary commercial arrangements, which is unprecedented in the tax laws. In a self-assessment-based tax system, the fact that Inland Revenue scrutiny is unlikely to occur or result in adjustment is concerning. If this is true, the resource-intensive process of reviewing and amending the law will be somewhat futile. The taxpayers who were not complying with the old law will not, in an environment in which scrutiny is unlikely, comply with the new law (Russell McVeagh) – particularly taxpayers that are currently taking tax positions counter to what they have agreed in a legally binding transaction. (Deloitte) An operational approach should be taken alongside appropriate remedial amendments. (Deloitte) The only law change should be to clarify that purchasers must allocate purchase price based on the market values of the assets acquired. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Symmetrical treatment in all transactions is not the right focus. The real issue is that the Commissioner is not able to monitor which asymmetric allocations are problematic and which ones are justifiable. If parties do not agree an allocation, they should be able to adopt different allocations, but be required to provide electronic disclosures to the Commissioner to justify their allocations and reasons for disagreement. Inland Revenue is underestimating the significant deterrent effect such disclosure requirements would have. The Department can use analytic tools 66 to identify material discrepancies and examine valuations for genuine avoidance. (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials agree and acknowledge that purchasers and vendors will usually have different views of the value of a business and its assets. Commercially, a vendor will not generally sell assets unless the vendor thinks they are worth less than the purchaser is paying for them, and a purchaser will not buy the assets unless the purchaser thinks the opposite – notwithstanding distressed sales. But if only one asset is sold, it is bought and sold for a single price, and that price is the value of the asset for both parties for tax purposes. Officials see no reason why this consistency principle should be departed from where two or more assets with different tax treatments are sold together. Section GC 21 is not a case of the tax law interfering with markets – it is a case of the tax system not tacitly subsidising commercial transactions by allowing parties to treat an asset as bought for one price and sold for another, in order to minimise their respective tax liabilities. With regard to evidence of the problem, audit activity undertaken by investigators is what spurred the development of these proposals in the first place. The evidence base includes a number of large commercial property transactions and sales of going-concern businesses. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence from some tax advisors suggests that inconsistent allocations are a frequent occurrence, due to parties asserting different views of market value. There will always be a debate around how much audit evidence is required for a policy response – whether operational or legislative – to be regarded as necessary. The Commissioner has, on multiple occasions, taken cases against vendors and purchasers adopting inconsistent allocations and has frequently failed to drive the parties to agreement – an unsurprising outcome, given the lack of a statutory requirement for consistency, other than in relation to trading stock. The fact that consistency cannot be reliably achieved, even with considerable resource outlay from Inland Revenue, suggests that a more fundamental change to the regulatory framework is warranted. Officials do not consider the additional compliance burden of a consistency requirement for purchase price allocation to be substantial. Price negotiation may be more protracted in some cases, but business practices can be expected to adapt. The current tax law does not require a vendor or purchaser to file its tax return on the basis of an allocation it agreed with the other transacting party as part of the sale and purchase. This is a gap in the law and is the reason for proposed section GC 20. Some parties may continue to ignore an agreed allocation despite the proposed law change, but if they do, they will be non-compliant and the Commissioner will have a legislative basis for amending their returns. Moreover, parties can be expected to comply with the new law, because they have an incentive to do so. A requirement for disclosure will persuade some taxpayers to agree an allocation. However, Inland Revenue’s experience is that it will not persuade all to do so, and where it does not, existing law makes it difficult, time consuming and in many cases impossible to bring the parties together. Finally, the power to allocate is not the power to vary a commercial arrangement. If the parties agree, they must follow their agreement. If they do not agree, there is no arrangement with respect to the allocation, and the purchase price allocation rules will apply as appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 Issue: Lack of evidence for applying rules to business sales Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rules, if they proceed, should not apply to business sales. There is a lack of evidence about the scale of the issue with businesses. The rules should be restricted to sales of commercial and residential property. Requiring all transactions to comply with highly complex and detailed rules to address an issue caused by a subset of bad taxpayers comes at the expense of all taxpayers. We note: • Commercial property is where most discrepancies have been identified. • Information is provided to Inland Revenue about real property transfer (under the Land Transfer Act). • Most real property transactions are undertaken with a standard form (Auckland District Law Society), which can be updated to specify purchase price allocation rules. • Focusing on property negates many practical issues. • Issues relating to transacting through auctions can be managed to ensure fair outcomes. Comment Officials are aware of a number of transactions involving inconsistent allocation of the purchase price in business sales, some of them very large. Officials have also been told that the requirement for consistency for trading stock is often ignored in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Stakeholder feedback should have greater bearing on proposed amendments Submission (Deloitte, Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) Given the extent of disagreement with the proposals, stakeholder feedback should have a greater bearing on the proposed amendments and ensure they reflect commercial reality, and that the compliance burden is in line with the scale of the problem. The proposals should be withdrawn for further consultation, and then brought back to Parliament. (Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) Comment Stakeholders have provided much useful feedback on the proposals throughout the policy development process – in submissions on the officials’ issues paper, in meetings with officials, and most recently in submissions on the Bill – and officials have made a number of changes in response. Many of these changes have been aimed at reducing compliance costs and 68 acknowledging commercial realities: requiring consistency only at an asset class level rather than asset-by-asset; making the backstop rules for non-agreement more neutral by putting a tax book- value floor on a unilateral allocation by the vendor; and so on. Given the extent of consultation undertaken, in line with the Generic Tax Policy Process, officials do not consider it is necessary to withdraw the proposed amendments from the legislation for later reintroduction. However, officials will continue to engage and consult with stakeholders as the Bill progresses. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax not the only driver of purchase price allocation Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Tax is not the only driver of a purchase price allocation. There are other areas of commercial significance that are relevant for purchase price allocation, including insurance cover terms, caps on damages that can be claimed for a breach of contract, and other regulations. Comment Officials acknowledge that a purchase price allocation can have relevance for non-tax reasons in some cases. However, that is true only for a limited set of transactions, and even then, tax is usually much more significant. For example, it seems unlikely that the amount allocated by a vendor to an asset for tax purposes would limit the amount the purchaser could then insure that asset for. Nor would an excessive tax allocation by a purchaser mean that an insurer was bound to accept that figure as the appropriate replacement value for the asset. Commercial considerations are no more than a weak constraint, if any, on tax-optimising allocations. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Impact of proposals on commercial transactions in COVID-19 context Submission (EY) The impact of the proposals on commercial transactions should not be ignored in the current COVID-19 context, in which there will be more transactions involving distressed businesses, with vendors and purchasers having different views of the value of business assets. 69 Comment Officials consider that the rules will be equally workable for distressed sales as for normal transactions. Inland Revenue will monitor the performance of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendment of disputes regime in the Tax Administration Act to enable three-way dispute would be a better way to achieve consistency Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The disputes regime in the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to clarify that the Commissioner can enter a three-way dispute involving a vendor and purchaser if the parties do not file tax returns with the same allocation. A joint dispute is most efficient. Comment Officials carefully considered the option of amending the disputes regime, and had discussions with legal sections of Inland Revenue. The approach would require the development of a bespoke disputes process, which would most likely have been rarely used and would be unlikely to apply correctly in all situations. The process would generate significant costs on both sides. It is unlikely to be feasible, and the benefits would be outweighed by the costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Degree of acceptable asymmetry should be allowed Submission (EY) There should be some degree of acceptable asymmetry, as there may be genuine reasons for parties to have divergent views as to relative price allocations. Seeking symmetry in all cases is overcorrection. Not all asymmetry is due to tax avoidance. For example: a) Taxpayers could fall outside the proposed rules where the discrepancy in allocations has a tax effect of less than $500,000. b) Alternatively, the law could provide the Commissioner with the discretion to accept an asymmetric allocation under certain conditions. 70 Comment a) The proposal already contains de minimises (though officials are proposing to remove the $100,000 taxable/deductible property threshold – see Issue: “Consistency thresholds too low”). If a transaction falls below the de minimises, the parties are not required to allocate consistently, notwithstanding that they must still allocate based on market values. If an additional de minimis for asymmetry is introduced, parties will simply ensure that they agree divergent allocations equal to the de minimis. Some kind of agreement would still be required between the parties so that they ensured the de minimis would not be exceeded. It is simpler and more effective to have no such de minimis. b) Officials do not consider that a Commissioner discretion in relation to asymmetric allocations would be desirable. The rules are designed to avoid Commissioner intervention in transactions except as a last resort, for reasons set out in officials’ response to the Issue: “Proposal gives vendor incentive not to agree to an allocation”. Recommendation a) That the submission be declined. b) That the submission be declined. Issue: Lack of international precedent for approach Submission (PwC) Other jurisdictions facing the same problems do not seem to have introduced the hierarchy of rules proposed for New Zealand. Comment Many other jurisdictions (for example, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia) have a comprehensive capital gains tax (albeit frequently at discounted rates), which reduces the degree to which vendors and purchasers can gain tax advantages through price apportionment. It presents a stronger risk in New Zealand, which lacks a general capital gains tax. Even so, some countries have made efforts to ensure consistency, though they have not taken precisely the same approach as proposed here. The proposed approach is intended to minimise the need for Inland Revenue intervention. Regardless, although international precedent can be a helpful source of information and insight, its absence should not necessarily preclude New Zealand from implementing a desirable reform. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 71 Issue: Rules will create issues in competitive bids and auctions Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC) The rules will create issues in competitive bid processes, where purchasers must submit bids prior to advancing to a full due diligence process. The outcome of the initial bidding process could be materially influenced by whether particular bidders have specified a potential purchase price allocation (because it could impact on the vendor’s returns). In a competitive bid process where an overseas vendor is bidding against a New Zealand purchaser, the New Zealand purchaser is in a weaker bargaining position because the overseas vendor may care less about the allocation, depending on the tax rules in its home jurisdiction. Comment Market participants will be able to deal with issues arising in competitive bid processes in a number of ways. Bids may be expressed by the bidder to be conditional on a specified allocation, for example. Or the person requesting bids may specify an allocation, in order to ensure that all the bids are made on an even footing. In terms of cross-border transactions, foreign bidders will be subject to a range of regulatory requirements in New Zealand and in their home country, which may improve or worsen their competitive position. Free trade or investment agreements may go some way towards levelling the playing field. New Zealand domestic tax rules should be set with a view to reducing distortions for participants in the domestic economy, and not to accommodate possible cross-border concerns. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Operation of rules unclear where there is foreign purchaser Submission (Deloitte) The operation of proposed section GC 21 is unclear where there is a foreign purchaser. An allocation could be agreed in relation to assets that will remain in New Zealand post-completion but not in relation to assets that will leave New Zealand post-completion (because the foreign purchaser has no incentive to agree an allocation to those assets). Comment If an allocation is agreed in relation to some assets and not others, then the purchase price allocation rules will apply to each bundle of assets separately. In this case, section GC 20 would apply to the agreed allocation for assets that are to remain in New Zealand post-completion, requiring the parties to file on the basis of their agreement. Section GC 21 would apply to the assets that are to leave New Zealand post-completion. The vendor would determine an allocation, 72 and that allocation would have no impact on the purchaser, for whom the assets will not be in the New Zealand tax base going forward. In practice, however, if the purchaser is indifferent to the allocation to some assets, the vendor should not have a problem getting the purchaser to agree with the vendor’s allocation to them. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: GST implications of proposals have not been considered Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, nsaTax Limited) Consideration should be given to the GST consequences of the purchase price allocation when a transaction is not zero-rated, and particular categories have different GST treatments – for example, a taxable supply versus a GST exempt supply. When a transaction includes both taxable and exempt supplies and the parties have not agreed an allocation, it will be important to take GST into account in determining the allocation. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). Under section GC 20, the purchase price allocation needs to be agreed before either party files an income tax return for the year. This is several months after the filing of GST returns for which the allocation could be pertinent. (nsaTax Limited) Comment It is unusual for a transaction subject to GST to require apportionment. Sales of businesses are generally entirely zero rated as sales of a going concern. Most sales involving land are subject to compulsory zero rating. In the rare situations where an apportionment between taxable and exempt supplies is required, it will be a unilateral apportionment by the vendor, as the vendor will provide a tax invoice to the purchaser. The purchaser will then claim input tax credits in accordance with its intended use of the supplies going forward. In most cases, the values used in the GST apportionment will be consistent with the values allocated for income tax purposes, as parties will either have agreed on the values, or the vendor will do the income tax allocation unilaterally and so will naturally be using the same values as for its unilateral GST apportionment. An inconsistency might arise if the vendor sets the GST apportionment but does not agree an income tax allocation with the purchaser or notify it of a binding allocation within the timeframe for doing so. In that case, the purchaser may conceivably notify the vendor a binding allocation on the basis of values that differ from the GST values set by the vendor. Officials consider that this would be a fringe case, and the tax implications of the inconsistency are unlikely to be material. There may be none, if the vendor subsequently issues the purchaser a GST credit or debit note to align the GST values with the income tax values. It is not proposed that the purchase price allocation rules have any effect on, or be affected by, the GST valuation rules. 73 Officials consider that the impact of the proposals on GST is minimal, and no amendments are required. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Rules need to accommodate price adjustments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) The rules should be flexible enough to cover purchase price adjustments; earn-outs; warranty claims; later disbursement of funds held in escrow, where the funds are ultimately paid back to the purchaser rather than across to the vendor; other contractual recourse the purchaser has against the vendor, and so on. Consideration may not be finally determined until months or years after the transaction. The legislation could allow for the same rules to apply at the time any further consideration is paid. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree that a consistent allocation of price adjustments would also be desirable. However, the basis for allocation may not simply be the relative market value of the property. For example, the nature of the adjustment may mean that it is clearly allocable to one asset or class of assets (for example, a payment for breach of a warranty in relation to a defect in an item of property sold). Accordingly, a further consultation process would seem desirable before drafting such rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inland Revenue should educate taxpayers about new rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) Inland Revenue should take a proactive approach to educating taxpayers and tax agents about the new rules. The rules are more likely to be successful if Inland Revenue proactively educates taxpayers, particularly smaller businesses and tax agents. Not all taxpayers seek advice from an accountant or tax agent before entering into a transaction. An education campaign will make smaller taxpayers aware of new requirements and avoid the consequence of no deductions for the purchaser. 74 Inland Revenue could advocate for standard form sale and purchase agreements that reference the need for parties to agree an allocation. It should also issue guidance. Comment Officials acknowledge that it is important for taxpayers to be aware of the new purchase price allocation rules and will undertake an education campaign to achieve this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, noting that guidance will be provided. Issue: Time required for taxpayer education and update of standard form agreements Submission (nsaTax Limited) Any law change should be effected in close consultation with the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ), the Law Society, and the Auckland District Law Society (ADLS), so that there is sufficient time for the ADLS standard form agreements to be available, and adequate education for their respective members before the new rules come in. Comment Officials recognise that these organisations have an important role to play in taxpayer education and compliance, and will ensure these groups are informed about the progress of the proposals. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, noting that guidance will be provided. 75 LEVEL OF ALLOCATION (Clause 40) Issue: Required level of allocation unclear Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, nsaTax Limited) The Bill commentary states that parties do not have to allocate an amount to every individual item – they can allocate at a high level of asset categories. This is not clear in the wording of the legislation and should be added. As the draft legislation refers to “items of depreciable property”, is the required level of allocation for asset categories or individual items? Under the proposals as currently drafted, vendors and purchasers are required to agree an allocation for every item of depreciable property. (nsaTax Limited) Comment Officials agree that the wording of the legislation with respect to the required level of allocation is unclear, and propose that the provisions be rewritten accordingly. Officials note that the existing provisions in the Income Tax Act, requiring individual assets to be valued at market rate, still apply in a mixed supply. However, these need to be modified if the individual assets are part of a class that has been treated as sold for the vendor’s tax book value. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 76 VENDOR’S POWER TO DETERMINE ALLOCATION (Clause 40) Issue: Proposal gives vendor incentive not to agree to an allocation Submission (Russell McVeagh, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC, Navtej Singh, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd, Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated) The proposal fundamentally impacts the relative commercial bargaining position of the parties involved, in favour of the vendor. Allowing either party to determine the allocation will lead to inappropriate valuations which favour the party that sets them. It is fundamentally wrong to give primary power to the vendor. A vendor could use the rules to their own bargaining advantage, and refuse to agree to an allocation with the purchaser, knowing that it will get the power to allocate if it does not (a particular risk where there are multiple possible purchasers). The vendor might wait until the last minute to allocate a price, giving the purchaser less time to negotiate. The onus of proof for a particular purchase price allocation is on the taxpayer (see Buckley v Young Ltd (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). Currently, both parties have an equal incentive to agree an allocation to avoid risk and uncertainty as to their tax position. New section GC 21(2) would change that by giving the vendor an incentive not to agree an allocation, so they can unilaterally determine it instead. Whether or not the purchaser can deal with this by negotiating the price will depend on the strength of the parties’ bargaining positions. There are flow-on effects from this that could negatively impact commercial activity in New Zealand. While in theory the purchaser could refuse to go ahead with the deal until an allocation has been agreed, commercial pressures or a lack of tax advice prior to negotiations could mean that the purchaser is unaware of the importance of agreeing an allocation before the deal is finalised, or is unable to do so. In reality, a number of factors mean allocations are not agreed on or even considered before the sale and purchase agreement is signed, so allocations are often decided afterwards. Comment The vendor will have no incentive not to agree an allocation if by agreeing one it can get a better price. A purchaser faced with a vendor that will not agree an allocation in advance can either refuse to transact, or significantly discount the price. Market value is a range, and naturally the party that allocates will tend to make an allocation favouring itself. Giving priority to one of the parties to unilaterally determine the allocation where the parties have not agreed one, is the only way for consistency to be achieved that does not require the Commissioner’s intervention. The Commissioner knows less about the transaction than the parties, has little valuation expertise, and is generally indifferent to what allocation is chosen, provided it is a single allocation. It would be administratively burdensome, and uncertain for the parties, for the Commissioner to be charged 77 with determining a unilateral allocation in the first instance any time the parties could not agree one themselves. Similar issues would arise with the use of an independent arbitrator. The tax book value floor protects purchasers that are unable to agree an allocation with the vendor as part of the sale and purchase. The floor also means that if the vendor wishes to allocate less than tax book value to taxable property, it must agree an allocation with the purchaser. Officials consider the floor is a useful compromise to improve the neutrality of the consistency rule. Officials note that under section EB 24 the purchaser already has to use the vendor’s allocation for trading stock, and trading stock is defined widely for this purpose to include most assets in the tax base, other than depreciable property and financial arrangements. It has not been made clear to officials why the existing trading stock rule is seemingly unproblematic, but the extension of it to depreciable property and financial arrangements is unacceptable (though officials are aware that some advisors operate on the basis that the provision does not require consistency). Commercial negotiations vary widely depending on the market power and sophistication of the parties. The allocation will be one issue amongst many for negotiation. The parties will be significantly more likely to agree an allocation once the new rules come into effect. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Purchaser allocation would be more appropriate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, PwC) If one of the parties is given the right to unilaterally allocate (in the event the parties fail to agree), the purchaser’s allocation should be given primacy, since the purchaser intends to continue the business and therefore sees the value in the assets going forward. Vendor valuations may misconceive how the business will be used in the future. Moreover, the purchaser is less likely to adopt an unjustifiable price allocation for tax purposes because it will carry an ongoing risk. Some purchasers are required to comply with acquisition accounting and so are more likely to adopt fair values, or risk audit. Comment Officials acknowledge the case for purchaser priority, and consider that it would also be tenable. A purchaser allocation might also be likely to accelerate the recognition of taxable income in some cases, as it would create more income for the vendor. However, there are a number of reasons for preferring a vendor allocation: • Only the vendor will know its tax book value. If tax book value is a useful compromise in cases of no agreement, this supports a vendor allocation. • Adopting a vendor-first approach is consistent with the existing rule for trading stock (section EB 24). 78 • The vendor may wind up its business shortly after the transaction occurs. In the case of a corporate or trust vendor, the sale proceeds, net of income tax, may have been removed by the owner. If the vendor has been left with insufficient funds to pay tax on the basis of a purchaser valuation, the Commissioner will be left with an uncollectable tax debt. Vendor all ocation is less likely to have this outcome. Officials also note that there is no reason for preferring the future value the purchaser sees in the assets over the value the vendor places on the assets. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Safeguard allowing purchaser to allocate if vendor does not is illusory Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The safeguard allowing the purchaser to set values if the vendor fails to do so is more illusory than real. Comment The purchaser allocation is not intended to be a safeguard – it is intended to give an engaged purchaser a way to make an allocation if the vendor does not notify one on a timely basis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Some vendors may be difficult to engage with post-transaction Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Where assets are transferred ahead of liquidation, receivership or similar event, the vendor may be difficult to engage with post-transaction. In these situations, it may be more appropriate to provide priority to the allocation of the purchaser. Comment If the parties have not agreed an allocation and the vendor does not notify an allocation to the purchaser within three months of settlement, the Bill provides that the purchaser will then have three months to notify the vendor of a binding allocation. This will always give the purchaser sufficient time to make an allocation before it has to file a tax return. More details on timeframes are given in the section “Allocation Timeframes”. 79 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Default allocation to depreciable property in absence of agreement should be tax book value Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Rather than the vendor’s value having precedence over the purchaser’s, if the parties do not agree an allocation, the default should be that the depreciable property is transferred at tax book value. The Commissioner will then be in a neutral or more favourable position, compared with the vendor keeping and continuing to depreciate the assets. The purchaser will be restarting depreciation with a lower cost base than the vendor, so annual depreciation deductions will be lower. However, where the market value is clearly less than the tax book value, that value and allocation should be allowed. Comment In effect, section GC 21(8) already provides for a tax book value default (for all classes of property – not just depreciable property) by imposing a tax book value minimum on a vendor’s unilateral allocation. The vendor may choose to allocate a higher than tax book value to depreciable property or other property if it considers that value to be more accurate, though it will not generally be incentivised to do so. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Purchaser may ignore vendor’s allocation if outcome unrealistic or inequitable (Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) The small to medium enterprise (SME) sector already ignores tax legislation that it considers inappropriate (for example, fringe benefit tax). There is a real risk that a purchaser will ignore a vendor allocation of values in order to secure a more realistic outcome that is based on the economics of the transaction and the market values of the assets. Rather than allow the vendor to allocate non-market values to assets, and risk the purchaser ignoring those values and instead using market values, there should be a compulsory requirement for an independent valuation to be obtained for assets in the tax base whose value exceeds a certain minimum amount, and for that valuation to be followed by both parties in their allocations. 80 Comment If parties are unable to agree values between themselves but find the statutory hierarchy of unilateral party allocation rules unacceptable, they may make contractual provision for asset values to be determined by an independent valuer. Nothing in the statute will preclude such an arrangement. During policy development, officials considered the submitter’s suggestion of a mandatory independent valuation to resolve cases of non-agreement. However, this approach would impose an additional valuation cost on parties in all cases where an allocation has not been agreed – as well as a burden on whomever is required to choose the valuer – and parties may not always consider these costs to be warranted. There would be no guarantee that the valuation would produce a more favourable outcome for the purchaser than a vendor allocation or an agreement between the two parties. If the purchaser thinks it is likely to lose more by following a vendor allocation (which in many cases will be tax book value) than by contributing to the cost of a binding independent valuation, it may insist on the latter as part of the sale and purchase agreement. Conversely, if the tax at stake does not justify the costs and uncertainty associated with obtaining a valuation, the purchaser may settle for the statutory backstop of vendor allocation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 81 TAX BOOK VALUE FLOOR ON VENDOR’S UNILATERAL ALLOCATION (Clause 40) Issue: Tax book value floor on vendor’s allocation should be omitted Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, nsaTax Limited,) a) Proposed section GC 21(8) – the rule stipulating that the vendor cannot unilaterally allocate less than carrying values to taxable property, resulting in an additional loss on its sale – should be omitted. The rule is arbitrary, anti-avoidance in nature, and shows that the vendor allocation process is flawed. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) In a distressed sale, the rule does not reflect commercial reality. In these situations, the actual market value of property being sold will be less than its adjusted tax value or cost, and the vendor will suffer a real loss on the sale of the property. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, nsaTax Limited) The rule may be impossible to comply with. The total purchase price may not allow the allocation required under GC 21(8), where a sale is made at a genuine commercial loss. (Deloitte) b) Use of an allocation floor will mean that excess proceeds will be added to remaining assets, inflating their market value. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) c) The rule is inconsistent with the wider intent of the proposals that market values should always be used. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, nsaTax Limited) Comment a) Officials agree that there will be many transactions where the actual market value of taxable property being sold is less than its tax book value, and the vendor will suffer a real loss on that property, even if the transaction as a whole shows a profit. The vendor can recognise this loss by agreeing an allocation with the purchaser. The vendor is only restricted to tax book value if it and the purchaser do not agree an allocation, and the vendor is in the position of unilaterally allocating the purchase price. Officials note that, in a sale where the total sale proceeds are less than the sum of the vendor’s tax book values for all the taxable assets, the vendor will not be able to comply with a tax book value floor. Accordingly, officials recommend amending the legislation to provide that, in such a case, the vendor’s allocation to taxable property will be its tax book value reduced (pro rata) in proportion to the difference between the aggregate tax book value of the taxable property and the purchase price. This pro rata will only be applicable once the value ascribed to property outside the tax base is zero; to the extent that the value is greater than zero, it can be reduced to absorb some or all of the vendor’s loss. The pro rata only applies for the taxable property. b) The argument that the allocation floor will cause “excess proceeds” to be added to remaining assets, inflating their market value, is unclear or incomplete. If the vendor thinks a taxable asset is worth less than its tax book value, then the requirement for the vendor to allocate a 82 minimum of tax book value means that the proceeds remaining to allocate to non-taxable assets will be less than the vendor would otherwise think appropriate. The value of non- taxable assets will only be “inflated” if the vendor believes the value of the taxable assets is higher than their tax book values, but allocates book values anyway. That would be a choice by the vendor, which could be challenged by the Commissioner. c) Officials accept that the tax book value floor is inconsistent with the requirement in the proposals that market values should always be used. As a general principle, the use of market values should be favoured, because they reflect commercial realities. However, officials consider that, in the context of a unilateral vendor allocation, an exception to the principle can be justified. The primary objective of the purchase price allocation proposals is to ensure that vendors and purchasers adopt the same allocation, as the loss to the revenue base arises predominantly from the use of different values, rather than from the use of non-market values per se. The desired outcome under the proposals is that parties agree a market value allocation between themselves, rather than resort to the unilateral allocation rules in section GC 21. The vendor allocation is intended only as a backstop if the parties cannot agree an allocation, and officials consider that improving the neutrality of this backstop with the imposition of a tax book value floor takes precedence over ensuring the allocation is market value. The floor provides some protection for a purchaser that is unable to agree an allocation with the vendor, and has the effect that in most cases, the purchaser will effectively step into the vendor’s shoes. Officials reiterate that a vendor can avoid the tax book value restriction by agreeing an allocation with the purchaser. Agreement is always the desired outcome, and will be respected by the Commissioner in almost all cases. Recommendation a) That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. b) That the submission be declined. c) That the submission be noted. 83 AMORTISABLE IMPROVEMENTS RULE (Clause 40) Issue: Rule for allocation to amortisable improvements unnecessary / problematic Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) Proposed section GC 21(9), which provides that improvements amortised under section DO 4, DO 12 or DP 3 must be allocated their diminished value, should be omitted. Although a purchaser is only allowed to amortise from the diminished value of the improvement, parties should still be permitted to allocate a different value to it if they think the true market value is different. The proposed rule is inconsistent with the market value requirement, and will interfere with true market value allocations to other items. Comment Officials agree that, provided the purchaser is only allowed to amortise from the diminished value (in accordance with tax law), it should not be problematic for the parties to allocate a different value to the improvement in order to better reflect its true market value – and better reflect a market value allocation to the other assets being sold. The relevant section will be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 84 ALLOCATION TIMEFRAMES (Clause 40) Issue: Timeframe for vendor allocation insufficient Submission (Deloitte, KPMG, EY) a) Two months may not be sufficient for a vendor to make an allocation, particularly if attention has not previously been given to the issue during the transaction process, or where pricing was changing. The vendor will often need to obtain new valuation guidance, which may be difficult to finalise within two months of change of ownership. A minimum of three months is more reasonable, and was suggested in the issues paper on the proposal. b) The timing for notification of the tax allocation should be extended to align with the existing timeframe for financial reporting and filing of income tax returns. There is no justification for a truncated timeframe for the allocation ahead of the assessment to which the notification relates. (EY) Comment a) Officials recommend extending the period for a vendor to make an allocation from two months to three months post-settlement. Officials also note that the vendor will have time to work on its allocation in the period between execution of an agreement and settlement. b) The justification for a truncated allocation timeframe ahead of filing due dates is twofold. First, the behavioural objective of the purchase price allocation proposals is for parties to agree an allocation before completing their transaction, so the allocation can be factored into the negotiations. This is the optimal outcome from a revenue and commercial perspective, but is clearly predicated on the parties making an allocation well before filing their tax returns for the transaction. Second, the backstop rules in section GC 21 for determining an allocation in the absence of agreement are intended to give both parties an opportunity to determine the allocation before tax returns are due, notwithstanding that one of the parties (the vendor) is necessarily given the first opportunity. It is possible for a vendor or purchaser to have to file a tax return for a transaction as soon as six months post-settlement, if the transaction was settled on the last day of an income year, and the taxpayer has a late balance date. Accordingly, officials recommend to reformulate the backstop rules so that the vendor has three months post- settlement to notify an allocation and, if it fails to do so, the purchaser has three months. These symmetrical allocation windows total the minimum amount of time a party might have to prepare a tax return for its transaction. Allowing the vendor until the first filing date to make an allocation would mean taking away any ability for the purchaser to make a binding allocation before tax returns are due. Officials consider that it is more equitable and practical to give the purchaser the opportunity to determine the allocation if the vendor fails to use it. This is likely to promote a timelier resolution of allocation in cases where the vendor is disengaged. 85 Recommendation a) That the submission be accepted. b) That the submission be declined. Issue: Timeframe for purchaser allocation unclear Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) Under section GC 21, when the vendor does not allocate and the responsibility falls to the purchaser, there is no timeframe given to the purchaser to make the allocation. The position should be clarified. For example, if a deal is settled on day 1 of an income year, the tax return would not need to be filed until two years later. In this case, the vendor would have two months to make an allocation, and then if it failed to make one, the purchaser would have 22 months. For clarity, section GC 21(3) should require the purchaser to notify the Commissioner and vendor of its allocation within six months of the change of ownership (though the section probably will not be applied very often). (KPMG) Comment As noted in the comment on the previous submission, officials recommend modifying the provisions here. The purchaser will have three months to notify the vendor of a binding allocation – that is, until six months after the transaction. After six months, the Commissioner will have a discretion to achieve consistency as they see fit. The parties may still make and notify allocations (as though they had done them unilaterally within six months of settlement), but the Commissioner may choose whether to bind the vendor to a late purchaser allocation, bind the purchaser to a late vendor allocation, or impose her own allocation (on audit or otherwise). The rationale for this approach is that if an allocation has not been notified by six months post-settlement, it is likely that the parties are either unaware of the purchase price allocation rules or have been deliberately non-compliant, and some level of Commissioner intervention is necessary. Officials consider that it is unlikely parties will get to this point without knowing about the rules, since standard form sale and purchase agreements will be updated to include provisions for the rules, and many small transactions – where parties may have weaker tax knowledge – should be excluded by the de minimis thresholds. However, officials are investigating more ways to improve the visibility of the rules. Lastly, if the parties ignore the rules and file their returns with different allocations, then on audit, the Commissioner may require allocations to be furnished, and may determine the allocation at that time, with all the usual consequences of non-compliance and reassessment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 86 Issue: Vendor could be left with no way to comply with rules Submission (Deloitte) Poorly advised vendors could be left with no way to adhere to the proposed rules if their obligations are only discovered after the two-month period expires and the purchaser is indifferent or sour. This may occur especially with foreign bidders, who will often be indifferent to purchase price allocation due to taxpayer-friendly income tax treatments for some assets (for example, goodwill) in their home jurisdiction. Comment Vendors that fail to notify the purchaser within the recommend three-month time frame, and do not themselves receive a purchaser notification within the three-to-six month period, will be able to notify an allocation to the Commissioner that complies with the tax book value floor, just as they would have done if they had notified the allocation within three months of settlement. Whether that allocation binds the purchaser or is over-ruled in favour of a binding purchaser or Commissioner allocation will be at the Commissioner’s discretion, as explained in officials’ response to the previous submission. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Rules will increase divergence between tax and accounting Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The proposed rules will increase the divergence between tax and accounting balance sheets. Tax will be done quickly – within the two-month period – while accounting, under IFRS 3 or similar, can be done up to a year post-transaction. Given the increasing reliance on the IFRS balance sheet (which is subject to strict regulations) for tax, this divergence seems an odd outcome for Inland Revenue to be enabling. Parties should be allowed to follow the IFRS 3 accounting treatment for tax purposes. Though admittedly this issue will only affect a small number of taxpayers. Comment Tax/book differences are common. For example, there are differences in when depreciation can start, what depreciation rates are, what expenses are included in cost, etc. As the submission notes, this will only affect a small number of taxpayers. Presumably, the period of time required to undertake an IFRS 3 valuation may mean it cannot always be used even by the purchaser for tax purposes. 87 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 88 DENIAL OF PURCHASER DEDUCTIONS (Clause 40) Issue: Denying purchaser deductions if it does not make/notify an allocation is overly punitive Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd, PwC) a) Denying the purchaser deductions if it does not make and notify an allocation is overly punitive. Less sophisticated parties may not be aware of the law change and may find themselves unintentionally subject to this rule. Even an indifferent purchaser could be taxed on gross sale proceeds when it in turn comes to sell. b) The purchaser should be treated as acquiring the property for market value. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) c) If the rule (section GC 21(7)) proceeds, it should be amended so it does not override the de minimis exception (GC 21(5)) or the low value depreciable property exception (GC 21(6)). d) It is not clear what would happen if the ability of the purchaser to notify its allocation was frustrated – for example, if the vendor no longer exists, due to being liquidated following a business sale. The purchaser could lose its cost base in this situation, which seems unreasonably harsh. (PwC) Comment a) The intent of this rule is to defer deductions rather than deny them entirely, though officials recognise that this is not clear in the legislation as drafted. Officials recommend that the purchaser’s deductions be deferred until the earlier of: • the time when the purchaser notifies an allocation to the Commissioner; and • the time when the Commissioner notifies a binding allocation to the purchaser. The purchaser will then become entitled to claim, in the next tax return filed, the deductions it was denied in the year/s in which it and/or the vendor failed to notify an allocation. This approach fits the updated unilateral allocation scheme proposed by officials, set out in the previous section of this officials’ report (“Allocation timeframes”). b) Officials consider that the rule deferring deductions is necessary to incentivise the purchaser to make and notify an allocation, rather than ignore the consistency requirement and file a different allocation from the vendor (if any). Treating the purchaser as acquiring the property for market value would not provide this incentive. Officials understand that, under current section EB 24, purchasers often take the view that the Commissioner is unlikely to penalise them for simply making a market value allocation, even if it is not consistent with the vendor’s allocation. Deferring deductions provides a clear signal to the purchaser that it is expected to notify an allocation so that consistency can be enforced. If, under the proposed rules, the purchaser does ignore the consistency requirement and files a different allocation from the vendor, it will face use-of-money interest and penalties on audit. 89 To address the concern about parties not being aware of the rules, officials are investigating ways to prompt parties to consider their compliance. c) Officials agree that this deduction deferral rule clearly should not override the de minimis exception for consistency (section GC 21(5)), and recommend amending section GC 21(7) accordingly. The deduction deferral rule should be applied in relation to low value depreciable property. The deduction deferral applies where no allocation has been notified to the Commissioner, while the depreciable property safe harbour provides protection to parties from a Commissioner challenge in relation to that property. The objective of the deduction deferral rule is to drive the purchaser to notify an allocation, so that the Commissioner can ensure the purchaser and vendor adopt the same allocation – the presence or absence of low value depreciable property in the transaction is irrelevant to the desirability of that objective. If the transaction is above the de minimis thresholds and the parties have not agreed an allocation, the Commissioner should be notified of an allocation. It is not clear what would be achieved by carving deductions for low value depreciable property out of the deferral rule. d) In terms of what would happen if the purchaser’s ability to notify its allocation was frustrated, due to a vendor no longer existing (for example) then, as a practical matter the purchaser would only have to notify the Commissioner. The purchaser will not be denied deductions merely because it is technically unable to notify its allocation to a vendor that no longer exists. Officials will clarify this in their guidance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Purchaser’s acquisition for nil not symmetrical with vendor Submission (nsaTax Limited) There is a value inconsistency in section GC 21(7): in the absence of an allocated amount, the vendor disposal is treated as occurring at market value, but the purchaser is treated as having acquired the same property for nil. This clearly gives rise to a mismatch, which the proposed amendments are supposedly designed to address. Comment As clarified in comments on the previous submission, officials propose to reframe this rule – which is needed to incentivise the purchaser to notify the Commissioner of a non-agreed allocation – as a deferral of deductions, rather than a denial. In most cases, officials expect the purchaser will eventually notify an allocation, which will either bind the vendor, or – if notified more than six months after settlement – possibly be disregarded in favour of a vendor or Commissioner allocation, at the Commissioner’s discretion. In either case, the final result will be symmetry between the parties. The interim position may be asymmetry where the parties have not been complying with the rules, but that would be a problem under any other possible formulation of the rules. 90 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subjected to officials’ comments. Issue: Timing of deductions unclear where purchaser makes late allocation Submission (New Zealand Law Society, PwC) It is not clear how a purchaser’s allocation made late (under section GC 21(7)) will work with respect to the timing of the purchaser’s deductions. This should be clarified. Under proposed section GC 21(7), if neither party makes an allocation, the vendor is deemed to dispose of the property at market value, and the purchaser is deemed to acquire it for nil consideration, meaning they gets no deductions. It is intended that the purchaser can change this at any time by making an allocation, but the timing of deductions in that case needs to be further considered. For example, if a purchaser acquires a financial arrangement or revenue account property in one accounting period but no allocation is made until the next period, do the relevant deductions/adjustments apply in the year of disposal or the year the allocation is made? Base price adjustments under the financial arrangement rules (EW 31(2)) should occur in the year of disposal. Deductions for revenue account property and trading stock must be taken in the year of disposal (EA 1 & 2). If a deduction does not arise until the allocation is made, it may be too late for the purchaser to actually claim it. Also, the purchaser might manipulate the timing of deductions. The new rules could include a discretion for the Commissioner to agree a reasonable approach with a purchaser where an allocation has not been made, but an unreasonably harsh outcome for the purchaser has arisen. (PwC) Comment Officials recommend clarifying in the legislation that the purchaser’s deductions will be allowed in the income year for which a return is filed, after either the purchaser has notified an allocation to the Commissioner, or the Commissioner has notified a binding allocation to the purchaser – whichever is earlier. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 91 MARKET VALUE AND COMMISSIONER CHALLENGE (Clause 40) Issue: Unclear whether discounts permissible Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) It should be clarified that discounts can be applied as appropriate, where there is bargaining, a fire sale etc, and the Commissioner should not unduly question these transactions. Comment Officials consider that the concept of “respective market values” allows for a discounted purchase price and allocation. However, officials recommend amending the wording to “relative market values” to allow for discounted asset values. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Agreed allocation should not be challenged absent sham or avoidance Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG) Proposed section GC 20(2) should be amended. The Commissioner should be bound by an agreed allocation where negotiations are conducted at arm’s length, absent sham or tax avoidance. Market value is a range, and an allocation within this range should be respected. At the very least, further guidance should be provided, outlining the circumstances in which the Commissioner can challenge an allocation that has been agreed by an unrelated vendor and purchaser. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree and acknowledge that market value is a range. Having regard to their care and management responsibilities under the Tax Administration Act, the Commissioner will not invest resources in challenging an agreed allocation unless she believes there is sham, tax avoidance, or otherwise significantly unrealistic values. The Commissioner will need a reason to challenge. It would not be useful to legislate an additional criteria for the Commissioner to meet. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 Issue: Pro-rata based on vendor’s tax book values should be market Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Where parties have allocated the purchase price to specified asset categories, but based the price on a global market value for each category, a pro-rata allocation of the agreed value to each asset in that category based on the vendor’s net tax book value or cost should be deemed to be market value for the individual depreciable assets. Comment The proposed rules are not intended to require agreement to an allocation to individual assets within an asset class. However, the Commissioner will retain the power to challenge an allocation that is not market value. Parties using sensible methods to allocate an agreed allocation to individual assets – noting the existing provisions that require market value allocations to individual assets – should be safe from challenge. There is no need for a special rule for this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Unclear how fluctuation in market value during negotiation dealt with Submission (Deloitte) Where a transaction is being negotiated over a period of time (for example, two years), the market value of the global purchase price may have fluctuated, whereas the taxpayer’s purchase price allocation was based on an earlier valuation of the assets at the start of the negotiation. How to deal with this is not currently clear in the rules, but could be addressed through guidance. Comment Parties will have practices to deal with potential fluctuations in market value between the time an allocation is agreed and the time the transaction is completed, if they wish to do so. A simple solution would be for the parties to scale an agreed allocation up or down pro rata to equal the final purchase price. Officials will address this question in their guidance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 93 Issue: Commissioner should issue guidance on market value Submission (EY) The Commissioner should issue guidance on the process for determining “market value”, to provide certainty for transacting parties. Comment Taxpayers may find the Commissioner’s Statement for determining the market value of employee share scheme shares (CS 17/01) helpful. The Commissioner may issue more guidance on market value in the future. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Interaction of proposed rules with existing market value provisions unclear Submission (New Zealand Law Society) There are numerous provisions in the Income Tax Act that deem assets to be disposed of at market value. The proposed rules do not specify that an agreed allocation applies for all purposes. The interaction of the purchase price allocation rules with the various market value deeming sections should be clarified. For example, depreciable property, carbon units, revenue account property, trading stock must all be disposed of at market value. See sections GC 1, EE 45(3), EB 24 etc. Comment Officials recognise that, although proposed sections GC 20 and GC 21 will ensure consistency of allocations at the level of the specified asset categories, they will not ensure that the amount allocated to a category is allocated to the assets within that category at market value. Existing rules deal with the valuation of individual assets. These general market value provisions will co- exist with the proposed purchase price allocation rules, with the combined effect that vendors and purchasers must use market values at both an individual asset and asset class level. Officials recommend amendments to make it clear that the total amount allocated to the assets within a class must equal the amount allocated to that class under section GC 20 or GC 21 as applicable. This will be relevant if a vendor is making a unilateral allocation under section GC 21 and is being required to use tax book values at a minimum, even though it considers the market value of the taxable property to be lower. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 94 Issue: Unclear whether tax-accounting divergence indicative of non-market transaction Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The purchase price allocation for financial reporting/accounting may differ from the allocation for tax (accounting normally done post-transaction), for example, to recognise assets fair value, which could include asset impairment, goodwill etc. Officials should form a view on whether such a divergence would be treated as an indication that a transaction occurred on a non-market basis. The allocation for the financial statements is normally audited some time after the transaction. Comment Officials do not consider that a discrepancy between accounting and tax would necessarily cause the Commissioner to treat the tax allocation as not being at arms-length. However, if the discrepancy is material, and there is no explanation for it, then the Commissioner may well make an enquiry, and the accounting valuation might be used as evidence in support of an adjustment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Commissioner currently not required to notify other party of challenge Submission (PwC, Corporate Taxpayers Group) There is currently no requirement on the Commissioner to notify the other party if a party’s allocation has been challenged, so the other party might not know about the challenge. There is also no mechanism for the other party to adjust its allocation when the Commissioner is successful in a challenge. If there is a dispute which leads to a different value being allocated than the value in the parties’ tax returns, the Commissioner should use section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to amend the value in the tax returns. This is compliance-friendly. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The legislation should be amended to require the Commissioner to inform a party if an allocation is altered as a result of a challenge to the other party, and to allow the first party to amend its tax return to reflect the new allocation. (PwC) Comment If the Commissioner is challenging an allocation, they will take the operational steps necessary to ensure any new allocation is adopted by both parties, as consistency is required by the new purchase price allocation rules. 95 The Commissioner would inform the other party of the new allocation and allow it to adjust its tax return accordingly. For example, if the Commissioner successfully challenges a purchaser’s allocation to depreciable property as too high, the Commissioner would inform the vendor and allow it to adjust its return also (assuming it has adopted the purchaser’s allocation). This could be done under section 113 of the TAA. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transfers within wholly owned groups exposed to risk Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Where a business is sold within a wholly owned group, a taxpayer should be able to allocate on the basis of tax book value or cost with no ability for the Commissioner to challenge. This would allow wholly owned groups to restructure without risk. Tax book value and cost are not arbitrary figures – they are already the basis for the business’s tax position. But the taxpayer could apply to the Commissioner for a higher cost base if it wanted to. There is precedent for this in section EB 5 – trading stock transferred within wholly owned groups can be valued at cost. The consolidation regime can be used to get around valuation issues with intra-group transfers, but the regime comes with its own issues, such as removing an entity from the consolidated group. Comment The focus of these amendments is consistent allocation. They are not concerned with the issue of non-recognition for transactions between associated parties. That may be an appropriate subject for a further reform. Officials note that there are already ways for corporate groups to achieve non-recognition treatment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 96 DE MINIMIS/SAFE HARBOUR THRESHOLDS (Clause 40) Issue: Consistency de minimis incomplete Submission (EY, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The de minimis in section GC 21(5), which is intended to exclude parties from the consistency requirement, is incomplete. It only overrides some of the consistency requirements, not all of them. The de minimis needs to override GC 21(7) (“No allocated amount”) etc. Comment This is a drafting error and officials recommend this be addressed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Consistency thresholds too low Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC) The $1 million total purchase price threshold and the $100,000 threshold for the purchaser’s allocation to taxable property should be increased. These thresholds are too low to be of practical use, particularly for transactions involving land and buildings. Most commercial property transactions that will fall under the new rules will exceed $1 million of consideration, with a large amount of the consideration attributable to land outside the tax base. The amount attributable to depreciable property will usually exceed $100,000. The threshold should be materially increased (to say $5 million), where significant value is from land outside the tax base. Comment The de minimis thresholds are intended to exclude small transactions where the amount of tax at stake is low enough for there not to be material discrepancies between parties’ tax positions, and where parties may be relatively unsophisticated in their tax compliance. Although buildings are now depreciable property, residential buildings remain non-depreciable. Accordingly, few sales of residential rental property will be caught by the new rules. Sales of commercial property are unlikely to be made without advice. However, officials recommend two changes to the de minimis thresholds. First, officials recommend removing the $100,000 deductible property threshold. We consider it may be problematic for transactions over $1 million where a vendor assumes the purchaser’s allocation to deductible property will be well under $100,000, and therefore disregards the 97 consistency rules, but then three-to-six months after the transaction the purchaser notifies the vendor of a binding allocation with an allocation to deductible property that is higher than $100,000. The total transaction price threshold is easily evaluated by both parties and is therefore less likely to lead to unexpected outcomes. Second, officials recommend introducing a separate transaction price threshold of $7.5 million for residential property transactions. Residential buildings and most residential fitout are non- depreciable, so in most cases the only taxable/deductible property in residential property transactions will be chattels such as whiteware (if any), which are unlikely to have a high value in aggregate. This makes residential property a low revenue risk area, and a higher de minimis for these transactions is therefore appropriate. This change is unlikely to have a material fiscal impact. Officials recommend keeping the de minimis for all other transactions at $1 million. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Low-value depreciable property threshold incorrectly based on tax book value Submission (Matter raised by officials) The submission is to correct a drafting error from adjusted tax book value to original cost. Comment Proposed sections GC 20(3)(c) and GC 21(6)(c) refer to the “adjusted tax value” of the purchased property being $10,000 or less, while the Commentary refers to the “original cost” of the property being “less than $10,000”. This is a drafting error. The policy intent is for the threshold amount to be original cost, since that is the true upper bound for depreciation planning. For example, a piece of industrial equipment might have an adjusted tax value of $8,000, but an original cost of $80,000 – it has simply been depreciated for the past nine years, and would be fully written-off the next year (if the depreciation rate is 10% straight-line). A tax book value allocation by the vendor may potentially understate the vendor’s true taxable income by tens of thousands of dollars, since the value of the machine could be closer to its original value of $80,000. The corresponding tax effect of this undervaluation could then be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Thus, if the Commissioner cannot challenge the allocation because the adjusted tax value of the machine is less than $10,000, the revenue loss from that single asset could be significant. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 98 Issue: Low-value depreciable property threshold should also apply to purchaser Submission (Deloitte, PwC) The safe harbour for low-value depreciable property in proposed section GC 21(6) should also reference subsection GC 21(3) – currently, the safe harbour does not appear to apply to the purchaser’s allocation. Parties should be able to gain the benefit of certainty if an allocation made under section GC 21(3) meets the GC 21(6) requirements. Not allowing the same protection to purchasers’ allocations further disincentivises vendors to reach an agreed allocation with the purchaser. Comment The safe harbour will be of no value to the purchaser when it is making a unilateral allocation. The Commissioner will generally only challenge an allocation to depreciable property if it is too low, and if they substitute a higher value, it will be favourable for the purchaser, because the purchaser will then get higher depreciation deductions going forward. The other situation in which the Commissioner may challenge the allocation is if it is substantially above the original cost of the property to the vendor; in that case, the purchaser is getting stepped up depreciation with no additional tax consequences for the vendor (the amount above original cost is a capital gain), and for most depreciable assets it would be rare for such a high value to be accurate. But because of that asymmetry, the safe harbour does not protect allocations above original cost. So overall, the safe harbour has no real utility for the purchaser. However, for the sake of simplicity, officials recommend redrafting the legislation so that the safe harbour applies to an allocation by either party. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Low-value depreciable property threshold should be relative or increased Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The $10,000 original cost threshold in section GC 20(3) for allocations to depreciable property ranging from adjusted tax value to original cost should be made relative. Ten thousand dollars is insufficient and should be increased to reduce unnecessary compliance costs for assets which have a low risk of mis-valuation. The amount should be relative – it could be a percentage of the transaction value, to avoid issues with large-scale transactions. Alternatively, the $10,000 threshold should be increased significantly, to at least $100,000. 99 Comment This rule is intended to allow the vendor’s tax book value to be allocated to low-value assets such as office equipment with assurance that this allocation will not be challenged. It would not be appropriate to extend the safe harbour to higher value assets, where discrepancies between tax book value and market value could be material. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 100 APPLICATION DATE (Clauses 40 and 2(22)) Issue: Application date too early Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Russell McVeagh, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd, Federated Farmers of New Zealand)) The application date should be extended to 12 months after the date of enactment (that is, 1 April 2022). This would allow time for the Auckland District Law Society’s standard sale and purchase agreement, and other standard agreements, to be changed. It would also allow time for an education campaign covering all potentially impacted taxpayers. The proposal will significantly affect the primary sector, and there is a risk one or both parties to a primary sector sale and purchase agreement will ignore the new rules if the private sector is not given a chance to understand the rules before they become effective. (Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) Alternatively, as a compromise, the application date for smaller transactions (say below $15 million) could be deferred for three months. This should not adversely affect the Government’s forecasts. Moreover, farmland did not appear to be considered when forecasts were prepared, so any gain from transfers of farmland were likely not included in the forecasts. A window to allow for taxpayer education is necessary to encourage compliant behaviour by SMEs, and farmers in particular. (Federated Farmers of New Zealand) The current application date is too early for parties to prepare for the changes. Comment Changing the application date would have fiscal consequences. Officials consider that a 1 April 2021 enactment date will be feasible for taxpayers, as we are working with private and public- sector organisations to promote these changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 101 VARIOUS DRAFTING ISSUES (Clause 40) Issue: Provisions not appropriately located in legislation Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The provisions should be in part F (recharacterisation of certain transactions), not part G (avoidance and non-market transactions). Comment Officials acknowledge that the provisions could be located in part F. However, it is not inappropriate that they are located in part G. The purpose of the rules is to prevent property being treated as bought for one price and sold for another in order to minimise tax. In this regard, the rules have an anti-avoidance dimension. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Unilateral allocations should be worded as optional and not mandatory Submission (Deloitte) The obligations in proposed sections GC 21(2) and (3) should be expressed with the word “may” instead of “must”; the existing wording strictly makes the obligation for a unilateral allocation to be made mandatory, when this is at odds with the wider proposal. Comment Officials agree that the unilateral allocation rules should be expressed as optional, as it should be clear that the parties can agree an allocation at any time before the first tax return for the transaction is filed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 102 Issue: Term “respective market value” ambiguous Submission (Deloitte) The reference to “respective market value” in sections GC 21(2) and (3) is ambiguous, and a clear definition should be provided in the legislation. Comment Officials recommend changing this wording to “relative market value”. Officials consider that it is clear from the plain meaning of the words in the context that this term means the market value of a class of property in relation to the market values of the other classes of property. “Relative market value” contemplates transactions where the total purchase price is higher or lower than the price that would be calculated as the sum of the market values of all the assets if they were bought and sold individually – that is, where the parties are placing either a premium or a discount on the transfer of the assets as a bundle. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Tax book value floor for vendor should apply as if section EE 11 did not apply Submission (Deloitte) Proposed section GC 21(8)(a) should be amended to clearly state that it is intended to operate as if section EE 11 did not apply. Comment Officials do not see the need for this clarification; section EE 11(4) allows for part-year depreciation loss, so is not in contradiction with proposed section GC 21(8)(a). Officials note that this section will be simplified to refer to “tax book value”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: References to “person A” and “person B” difficult to follow Submission (EY) 103 The references to “person A” and “person B” throughout the proposed sections GC 20 and 21 make the legislation difficult to follow. It would be easier to read if the parties were referred to as the “vendor” and “purchaser” throughout. Comment “Vendor” and “purchaser” are possible synonyms, but would require definition, and may carry legal connotations that unintentionally limit the application of the rules. “Person A” and “person B” are more neutral terms, and their meaning is clear from the context. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Phrase “to which other income or deduction provisions of this Act apply or don’t apply at all” unclear Submission (EY) It is not clear what is meant by the phrase “...to which other income or deduction provisions of this Act apply or do not apply at all.” Comment Officials agree that this phrase is unclear and recommend amending it. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Heading to section GC 21 unclear Submission (EY) The heading to section GC 21 is not reflective of the content and does not adequately differentiate between sections GC 20 and 21. The heading could be better phrased as “Effect of parties not agreeing to a purchase price allocation.” Comment Officials agree that the heading could be clearer and recommend amending it to distinguish it more from section GC 20. 104 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of word “disposes” misleading Submission (nsaTax Limited) Sections GC 20 and 21 apply “when a person (person A) disposes of, to another person (person B), property (the purchased property)”. This wording should be clarified to ensure the rules only apply to sale and purchase situations. The use of the word “disposes” is misleading, as there are many disposal provisions in the Income Tax Act which could result in the new rules having unintended application. For example, trust resettlements, inheritances, disposal of assets to a partnership on formation etc. Comment Officials recommend clarifying that the rules apply to disposals for consideration. Further limitations on the application of the rules are not desirable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Standard of identicality in phrase “materially identical” unclear Submission (nsaTax Limited) In sections GC 20(3) and GC 21 (6), the word “identical” in the phrase “materially identical” would indicate that the assets are not just similar or of the same class. What is the standard? For example, a car yard is sold with a total value of ten vehicles exceeding $1 million. If the vehicles are not materially identical because they are a different make and model, does the de minimis provision apply or not? Comment Officials recommend simplifying the phrase to “identical”. Taxpayers will make a reasonable assessment of identicality. Items that are interchangeable and are ascribed the same per item value by the parties will be identical. For example, a fleet of Priuses which are ascribed the same or a similar value may be identical. A Prius and a Lamborghini would not be. 105 Recommendation That the submission be noted. 107 Unclaimed monies 109 GENERAL SUBMISSIONS Issue: Support for reforms Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Bank of New Zealand, Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated, New Zealand Law Society) General support for the reforms. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 to crypto assets Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The amended definition of unclaimed money focuses on “amounts payable” and would seem to apply to cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets. We believe this is appropriate but would welcome confirmation, particularly if it is not intended that the proposals apply to amounts denominated in cryptocurrency. Comment In the Commissioner’s view, crypto assets are property rather than money (as commonly understood). However, as an “amount payable” can include an amount in money’s worth, it is possible that crypto assets could come within the existing definition contained within proposals. It is not intended that crypto assets be brought within the ambit of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Officials recommend that the legislation refer to money rather than amounts payable. Recommendation That the submission be noted subject to officials’ recommendation. Issue: Extension of binding rulings regime Submission (Russell McVeagh) 110 The binding rulings regime within the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be extended to include the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. This would allow Inland Revenue to make binding rulings in respect of matters affected by the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Comment Officials recommend that the binding rulings regime, including the short binding ruling process regime, be extended to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transitional period Submission (Bank of New Zealand, Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated) The two-year transitional period should be extended by an additional 12 months to allow holders sufficient time to update their systems. Comment The proposed reforms allow holders up to two years to transfer amounts of unclaimed money that fall between the current deeming periods of six and 25 years. However, the reforms are scheduled to come into force from the date of assent for money that becomes unclaimed money after that date. Holders of unclaimed money may require more time to update their systems to comply with the new rules. Officials recommend that a transitional variation provision be added. This would allow holders the ability to apply to the Commissioner for up to two years to implement the reforms where required. This allows the Commissioner to work with holders to update their systems on a case-by- case basis. Holders who are able to comply immediately with the reforms would be able to do so, while holders who require further time to update their systems would be accommodated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Reduction of de minimis threshold of $100 to one cent Submission (New Zealand Law Society) 111 Lawyers can be left with small balances in a trust account without the ability to locate a rightful payee. Under the proposals, amounts below $100 do not qualify as unclaimed money unless the Commissioner exercises a discretion to accept the amount as unclaimed money. The submitter requests that the de minimis threshold for unclaimed money should be reduced from the proposed $100 (or less if the Commissioner agrees), to one cent. If the $100 threshold is to be retained, holders of unclaimed money would welcome clear guidance from Inland Revenue in dealing with amounts below the $100 threshold, including the circumstances in which the Commissioner’s discretion to accept lesser amounts will be exercised. Comment Following stakeholder feedback, officials recommend the inclusion of an alternative use proviso to the existing reforms. This will allow holders to submit any amount of money as unclaimed money to the Commissioner. This will also mean that the Commissioner’s discretion in accepting amounts below $100 is no longer required. This will be the subject of further guidance from Inland Revenue in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Retention of an alternative use proviso for amounts under $100 Submission (KPMG, Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated) Section 4(1)(e)(ii) of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 specifies that amounts under $100 can be applied for the benefit of the holder or for other purposes. The current proposals remove this. Companies need the ability to pay unclaimed monies to Inland Revenue so they can be wound up. Some institutions donate funds under $100 to charity. It may be helpful if this is mandated or the money is paid to Inland Revenue and forfeited, with the holder relieved of any obligation. The existing $100 de minimis should be subject to a proviso allowing a holder to put amounts below $100 to some other purpose. An equivalent proviso exists within the current Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Comment Officials recommend that an alternative use proviso to the de minimis threshold of $100 should be retained in the proposals. This will allow holders the continued option to apply amounts of unclaimed money below the de minimis threshold of $100 to other purposes. 112 The retention of the alternative use proviso will mean that the Commissioner will no longer need the discretion to accept amounts under $100 as there will continue to be a distinction between amounts under $100 that are applied to another purpose (and are therefore not unclaimed money), and other amounts of money, which are under $100 and are not applied to another purpose (and are unclaimed money). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Institutional approach to “account activity” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Bank of New Zealand, Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated) Further guidance should be provided on the concept of “account activity” and an institutional approach should be applied to account interaction. Currently, the treatment of on-call bank accounts which have been set up for the benefit of a third party is unclear and could negatively impact customers (for example, a compounding term deposit set up by grandparents for a grandchild). Without activity on the account, the amount will become “unclaimed money” after five years. a) An “institutional” approach to account activity should be adopted to address situations where a customer deposits funds for the benefit of a third party. This would result in activity on one account held by the customer at an institution being deemed activity on any of their accounts held at that institution, thus avoiding funds being deemed unclaimed when the customer is still “active”. b) Inland Revenue should work with holders to ensure that they have robust procedures in place for contacting owners every five years. Inland Revenue should educate owners of money on the importance of maintaining accurate contact information with holders. Comment a) Officials recommend that an institutional approach to account activity be adopted. This would prevent money within an account from being treated as unclaimed money where it is among the accounts held by an owner at the same institution. Officials also recommend this approach should extend to joint accounts and other products held with the same institution (for example, an account holder’s cash-PIE investment). b) Officials note that on enactment of the proposed amendments, guidance will be provided through a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 113 Issue: Incorporation of portfolio investment entities Submission (KPMG) A clear treatment for Portfolio Investment Entities (PIE) interests is required. The unclear treatment of PIE interests can prevent PIEs being wound up and investors’ funds being distributed. Including PIEs within the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 would allow PIEs to be more efficiently managed while protecting investors funds (as they will need to be paid to Inland Revenue). Officials should be instructed to consult with the funds industry to confirm that a clear regime for dealing with unclaimed money for PIE interests would assist PIEs while protecting investors’ funds. Comment Currently, PIE fund managers choose between transferring unclaimed money to Inland Revenue under the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 or to the Crown under the Trustees Act 1956. 1 Although there is merit to allowing fund managers flexibility in transferring unclaimed money under either the Trustees Act 1956 or the Unclaimed Money Act 1971, it is not intended that units in PIEs should come within the definition of unclaimed money. Rather officials consider it should be possible for fund managers to transfer the proceeds of the redemption of the units (in money) to Inland Revenue once the money has remained in the holder’s possession for the five-year deeming period. The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 excludes the proceeds of pension and superannuation funds. This exception is also present in the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The current proposals maintain this position and officials consider this is the preferred treatment. Officials will provide guidance on the treatment of unclaimed interests in PIE investments in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Information exchange with holders Submission (KPMG) 1 The Trustee Act 1956 is being replaced by the Trusts Act 2019 from 30 January 2021. 114 An ability for Inland Revenue and holders to match IRD numbers should be considered. This would: • stop unclaimed money potentially being paid by Inland Revenue to the wrong person; and/or • enable a holder to track an investor. Although the first objective would not raise privacy concerns if only IRD numbers were matched, the second would require personal information to be provided by Inland Revenue to a holder. A specific information-exchange rule to facilitate the objectives of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 should be considered. Comment Inland Revenue offers banks and employers access to an Application Program Interface (API). This allows banks and employers to validate whether existing IRD number information held by an institution which is believed to be associated with an individual taxpayer, is correct. Inland Revenue is considering expanding access to the API to a broader range of institutions in future. However, the current tax confidentiality framework does not permit Inland Revenue to provide institutions with individual taxpayers’ IRD number information where this is not already held by an institution. Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission; however, further work on IRD information exchange will require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That submission be declined. Issue: Minor drafting amendment Submission (KPMG) There is a circular reference in proposed section 8(1). Comment Officials recommend the drafting of proposed subsection (1) be amended to avoid the circular reference identified by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 115 Issue: Length of deeming period Submission (Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated) Support for a reduction in the deeming period from 25 to five years, but it should be possible for unclaimed money to be paid to Inland Revenue at any time, provided that a proper process has been followed to locate the owners of the money. Further clarification as to what would constitute a period of less than five years, which is acceptable to the Commissioner, should be made. Inland Revenue should work with institutions to determine the data fields that will be required as part of the new reporting, with clear instructions on file type and formatting requirements. Comment Proposed subsection 4(2)(d) provides the ability for holders to, in limited circumstances, pay funds to the Commissioner before the five-year deeming period has passed. Following enactment, further guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin. Officials will continue to work with account holders to ensure that data submission requirements are clear. Recommendation That the submission be noted, with further guidance will be provided. Issue: Guidance on “reasonable efforts” Submission (Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated) Specific guidance should be provided as to what constitutes “reasonable efforts” in attempting to locate the owner of unclaimed money. This should encourage an approach that allows alignment with existing processes within the financial institution for finding customers. A standardised approach for locating customers across various functions should result. This should involve up to three attempts via phone, and email with a physical postal address being the last resort. Comment Requiring a holder of unclaimed money to make “reasonable efforts” to locate an owner of unclaimed money is not intended to increase compliance costs for holders. 116 Provided the holder has taken active steps to locate the owner, using the contact details the holder has available, officials consider that the obligation to make “reasonable efforts” will have been met. Officials expect that most holders will have met this requirement by the time the proposed five-year deeming period has expired. However, holders are not expected to use avenues of contact that they know will prove unproductive (for example, an invalid physical address), or to identify and pursue other avenues of contact beyond those they have available. For this reason, officials do not consider it is appropriate to specify a series of formal criteria that must be satisfied. Instead, holders should use their judgment and acumen in making “reasonable efforts” to contact the owner of the funds. Following enactment, further guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, noting that guidance will be provided. Issue: Data collection amendment Submission (Bank of New Zealand) The data collection requirements in proposed subsection 4(7) should be limited to those which are in a “readily retrievable electronic format”. This would clarify that the reforms are not intended to impose new information collection costs on holders of unclaimed money, but are directed towards encouraging holders to provide Inland Revenue with information in their possession which may assist the Commissioner in locating the owner of the money. Comment Officials agree that the existing proposed data collection requirements could increase compliance costs for holders of unclaimed money and recommend the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of unclaimed money Submission (Bank of New Zealand) 117 The proposed definition of money is difficult to follow and apply to practical situations. It is not clear whether subsection (4)(2)(c)(ii) allows the holder and owner to agree at the outset a standing instruction to automatically roll over term deposits, or whether this requires an explicit instruction from the owner at the expiry of the first term. A strict interpretation of subsection 4(2)(c)(ii) would mean that holders would be required to categorise all term deposits that have rolled beyond 10 years as unclaimed money unless they had a positive agreement at the end of every period to extend the term. This would be exacerbated if a holder cannot rely on other activity the customer has with the bank as evidence of continued engagement. A requirement to seek new instructions near the end of every fixed-rate term deposit to avoid the funds being classified as unclaimed money would introduce significant complexity into a regime which the proposed reforms seek to simplify. Automatically rolling term deposits should not be unintentionally caught by the definition of “unclaimed money” as this would not be the customer’s expectation. If this is the intention, it should be clearly communicated and sufficient time should be allowed within the transition period. Clarity is sought on the meaning of proposed subsection (4)(2)(d). Comment Officials have previously recommended an institutional approach to account interaction. Under this approach, the five-year deeming period would not begin in connection with any account where the customer continues to interact with at least one other account that the customer holds at the institution. For customers with only one term deposit account at an institution, officials agree that these customers could expect their term deposit to be rolled over without an express instruction where this is in keeping with the originating term deposit agreement. Officials have consulted with stakeholders and recommend that term deposits that are made under an agreement which provides they are to be automatically reinvested, only come within the definition of unclaimed money five years after the maturation of the first term. This means that the five-year deeming period would only commence at the beginning of the second term of the deposit. However, in order to avoid breaking a term deposit mid-term, officials recommend that the proposals should provide that a term deposit should be deemed unclaimed money after five years, or at the conclusion of the term the five-year deeming period falls within, whichever is the later. Additionally, officials recommend that the drafting of proposed subsections 4(2)(c) and 4(2)(d) should be clarified. Following enactment, further guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 118 MATTERS RAISED BY OFFICIALS Issue: Commencement date of clause 83B Submission (Matter raised by officials) The effective date for the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 to become an Inland Revenue Act should be 1 March 2021. Comment Changing the effective date for the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 to become an Inland Revenue Act to 1 March 2021 would allow the administration of unclaimed money to synchronise with Inland Revenue’s next phase of its business transformation programme, and improve the ability for unclaimed money to be matched to owners. The current effective date in the Bill is the date of Royal assent. Officials recommend clause 83B be amended to effect this change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Gender-neutral drafting Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend that the drafting of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 be updated to include gender-neutral language. This will have no practical implications for claimants or holders. Comment Updating the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 to gender-neutral language will have no practical implications for claimants or holders. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 119 Issue: Repeal of secrecy provision Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 12 of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 should be repealed. Comment The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 contains a bespoke secrecy provision in section 12. This requires officials to keep matters relating to the unclaimed money confidential. However, as the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 will become an Inland Revenue Act under the proposals, administrative matters will be covered by the general confidentiality provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This means the bespoke secrecy provision in the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 is no longer necessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Publication of unclaimed money data Submission (Matter raised by officials) A specific exclusion from the confidentiality of information provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be enacted, which will allow for the publication of unclaimed money data. Comment When the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 becomes an Inland Revenue Act, Inland Revenue intends to provide searchable information on its website to make it easier for people to find and claim funds. Under current law, the Commissioner is able to publish only the names of the owners of unclaimed money and the amounts received. A specific exclusion from the confidentiality of information provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 will allow for the publication of unclaimed money data. This disclosure would permit the publication of information that would assist owners in being reunited with their money. Publishing additional information aligns with the approach taken in other jurisdictions and by the Treasury for Trustees Act 1956. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 120 Issue: Allowing use of unclaimed money to offset a liability Submission (Matter raised by officials) Claimants of unclaimed money should be able to offset those funds to a liability they may owe to Inland Revenue on a voluntary basis. Comment On some occasions, customers may owe money to Inland Revenue and also be entitled to claim unclaimed money. These customers should have the ability to apply any amount of unclaimed money against a liability that they may owe to Inland Revenue. This option would be available to taxpayers on a voluntary basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Alignment of KiwiSaver Act 2006 with proposed reforms Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current, six-year deeming period mandated in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 be reduced to a period of five years, to align with the time period proposed for the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Comment Section 83 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 deals with KiwiSaver contributions that the Commissioner is unable to process in accordance with that Act due to insufficient information. These are contributions that are not paid to a fund due to lack of information as to where the funds should be directed. As the proposed reforms to the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 will reduce the current six- and 25-year deeming periods to a single, uniform period of five years, officials recommend aligning section 83 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 with the proposed five-year rule. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 121 Issue: Withdrawal of minor data collection requirement proposal Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed subsection 4(7)(d) be withdrawn from the Supplementary Order Paper (SOP). Comment Tracking a holder’s efforts in seeking to reunite owners with their funds would impose compliance costs in transferring funds and data to Inland Revenue. Following enactment, further guidance on what efforts would be expected of holders to reunite funds with their owners will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, noting that guidance will be provided. Issue: Flexible filing and payment regime Submission (Matter raised by officials) Holders be permitted to file on a quarterly basis with the ability to apply to the Commissioner for a variation, which would allow a longer period to suit their organisational needs. Comment Officials recommend flexibility in filing frequency for unclaimed money holders, due to varying operational constraints. Where some holders have indicated a willingness to file money and information with Inland Revenue immediately upon it qualifying as unclaimed money, others have expressed a preference for filing these in “batches”, on a quarterly or even six-monthly basis. Filing would be required by one month and 20 days after the conclusion of the chosen period. It is intended that the filing of unclaimed money related information and the payment of unclaimed money should occur concurrently. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 122 Issue: Definition of unclaimed money Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of unclaimed money should be re-drafted to focus on “money” rather than “an amount”. Comment The proposed amended definition of unclaimed money defines unclaimed money in terms of “an amount”. This differs from the current definition within the Act, which focuses on money. Although the intention had been to update the language of the Act, officials are concerned that reference to “an amount” may substantially extend the application of the Act to various investment vehicles or other stores of value. Additionally, officials recommend that a minor amendment to the proposed section 4(2)(d)(e), to ensure that amounts of exactly $100 are governed by the Unclaimed Money Act 1971. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Consolidation of deeming period under KiwiSaver Act 2006 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Where it has not been possible to associate an employee or employer contribution with a customer, the date that the money is in the Commissioner’s possession for the purposes of section 83 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be deemed to be the last day of the month to which the employment income information applies. Comment Section 83 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that any money which the Commissioner is unable to administer will become unclaimed money once it has been in the Commissioner’s possession for a period of no less than six years. Under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, different dates can apply to determine when employee and employer KiwiSaver contributions are deemed to be in the Commissioner’s possession. This creates administrative issues where it is not possible to associate a contribution with a particular customer. To simplify the administration of unclaimed money, officials recommend that where it has not been possible to associate an employee or employer contribution with a customer, the date that the money is in the Commissioner’s possession 123 for the purposes of section 83 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will be deemed to be the last day of the month to which the employment income information applies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 125 Other policy and remedial changes 127 GST ON OUTBOUND MOBILE ROAMING SERVICES (Clauses 86, 87, 89 and 91) Issue: Opposition to the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and Deloitte on behalf of Vodafone New Zealand Limited, Spark New Zealand Limited and 2degrees Mobile Limited) Most submitters expressed strong opposition to the proposed changes. The reasons provided include: • The changes are inconsistent with the “destination principle”. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) • The proposals seek to impose GST on a supply which is consumed outside of New Zealand. (Deloitte) • The changes will result in costly software upgrades for the telecommunications industry. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • The revenue that may be obtained from this measure is minimal and not commensurate with the costs involved. (Deloitte) One submitter stated that the implementation of these changes will not achieve the intended outcome in the short-to-medium term, and recommended the proposal be withdrawn from the Bill and reconsidered for the Tax Policy Work Programme at a later date when COVID- 19 is controlled and there is greater certainty with regards to international travel. (Deloitte on behalf of Vodafone New Zealand Limited, Spark New Zealand Limited and 2degrees Mobile Limited) One submitter expressed support in principle, where the changes are consistent with the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development International VAT/GST Guidelines 2017 (“OECD VAT/GST Guidelines”) and where double taxation could be avoided. (PwC) Comment New Zealand’s existing rules are inconsistent with international best practice. The rules should be modernised to reflect modern use of mobile phone technology, and alignment with the OECD’s VAT/GST guidelines which are considered to be international best practice. Currently, there are instances of non-taxation of New Zealand residents’ consumption of mobile roaming services. The status quo is not a principled option under a broad-based GST framework, as neither outbound nor inbound mobile roaming services are subject to New Zealand GST. Imposing GST on outbound roaming services will resolve the issue of the potential non-taxation of mobile roaming services - recognising that New Zealand residents are purchasing mobile roaming services via their New Zealand-based mobile service provider. Compared to taxing 128 inbound mobile roaming services, imposing GST on outbound mobile roaming services will minimise compliance costs, as a whole. Additionally, as other countries adopt the OECD VAT/GST Guidelines, the instances of non-taxation and double taxation will reduce. Officials acknowledge submitters’ concerns that the proposed application date of the changes will result in the imposition of additional compliance costs on telecommunication service providers at a time where there is currently, significant uncertainty as to when New Zealanders will be able to travel internationally freely. Further consideration of this specific issue is discussed in other sections of this report. Recommendation That the submission be noted, but the proposal still proceed, subject to officials’ comments above. Issue: Alignment with the OECD’s VAT/GST Guidelines and overseas jurisdictions Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC) There should be a greater focus on alignment with Australia, rather than with the OECD VAT/GST Guidelines, the European Union and the United Kingdom. This is because there is little to gain for New Zealand with aligning with the OECD VAT/GST Guidelines ahead of Australia. Additionally, comparisons should not be drawn with the European Union and the United Kingdom, as these jurisdictions operate in an essentially “borderless” way and operate in a very different landscape to New Zealand. One submitter did note that alignment with the OECD VAT/GST Guidelines will minimise the instances of double taxation or double non-taxation (PwC). Comment Alignment with the OECD VAT/GST Guidelines represents a move to international best practice. The guidelines (finalised in 2015) are a set of principles and standards, with a particular focus on the trade in services and intangibles, which seek to minimise inconsistences in the application of GST where goods and services are exchanged between jurisdictions (cross-border), with a view to reducing uncertainty and risks of double taxation and non-taxation. The guidelines are known to have significant influence when tax jurisdictions are seeking to modernise their VAT/GST rules. The benefits of alignment can be significant and enduring. 129 Aligning New Zealand’s GST mobile roaming services rules with the OECD’s VAT/GST Guidelines will reduce the instances of double taxation and double non-taxation, globally, and officials consider this is where New Zealand’s focus should lie. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, Deloitte, Deloitte on behalf of Vodafone New Zealand Limited, Spark New Zealand Limited and 2degrees Mobile Limited) Almost all submitters supported a delay in the proposal’s application date to beyond 1 April 2022, with Deloitte and the telecommunication industry submitting that, as a minimum, the proposal should be delayed until 1 April 2024. The reasons provided include the adverse impact of COVID-19 on New Zealanders’ ability to travel overseas, and the expected lead time required for the telecommunications industry to prepare their IT systems (in particular their real-time customer billing systems) to administer these GST changes. Comment When the proposal was first announced as part of Budget 2019, it had an application date of 1 October 2020. Subsequent to this, in part to provide more time for telecommunication services suppliers to implement the proposal, the application date was delayed by six months to 1 April 2021. In April 2020, in light of the growing impact of COVID-19 on New Zealanders’ ability to travel overseas, a decision was made to further delay the proposal’s application date by 12 months to 1 April 2022. This is the application date in the draft legislation before the Committee. Officials acknowledge submitters’ concerns for the continuing uncertainty created by COVID-19 and, consequently, the limitations on New Zealanders’ ability to travel overseas freely. The likely continuing overseas travel restrictions during 2021 was one of the reasons why the proposal’s application date was delayed to 1 April 2022. However, since April 2020, in light of recent announcements regarding successful COVID- 19 vaccines, and an increased likelihood of travel “bubbles” with Australia and the South Pacific in the short-to-medium term, there is growing confidence that New Zealanders will be able to travel overseas freely (particularly to Australia) in the near future, and well before 1 April 2024. Although telecommunication services suppliers have stated that their IT systems are complex, telecommunication services suppliers will have approximately 12 months to implement the proposed changes before 1 April 2022. It is unclear why the telecommunication services suppliers would require an additional two years (from 1 April 2022 to 1 April 2024) to complete the necessary IT changes required. 130 Therefore, officials do not support a further delay in the application date. It is important to note that any further delay to the proposal’s application date would likely have a fiscal cost to the Government. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: GST revenue collected by the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, Deloitte and Deloitte on behalf of Vodafone New Zealand Limited, Spark New Zealand Limited and 2degrees Mobile Limited) Due to the impact of COVID-19, the proposal is unlikely to collect the forecasted $7 million per annum in revenue, in the short-to-medium term. The revenue collected would, in the short-to-medium term, be disproportionate to the implementation costs expected to be borne by the telecommunication industry (estimated to be approximately $1 million). (Deloitte) Comment The forecasted GST revenue of $7 million represents the net GST collected as a result of the proposal and is stated as a “per annum” figure. Therefore, over the four-year forecast period, the proposal was estimated to collect approximately $22.88 million. The forecasted amount of $7 million per annum was provided by representatives of the telecommunication industry. Officials acknowledge that, due to the impact and uncertainty created by COVID-19 and New Zealanders travelling abroad, the GST revenue collected is likely to be less than forecasted in the short-to-medium term (after the proposed application date of 1 April 2022). However, some GST revenue is expected to be collected in the short-to-medium term because, as acknowledged by one submitter, overseas travel is expected to rebound after a successful vaccine rollout, and a sufficient portion of the population is expected to become immune to the virus. Also, in the interim, an increased likelihood of travel “bubbles” with Australia and the South Pacific means there is likely to be an opportunity for New Zealanders to travel and consume mobile outbound roaming services. In addition, the implementation costs should be considered in the context of total long-term revenues (and not just revenue for one year), which are expected to be relatively stable once “normal” overseas travel resumes in due course. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 131 Issue: Proposals do not adhere to the destination principle and New Zealand’s GST system Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, and KPMG) Submitters noted that the proposal is inconsistent with the “destination principle”. This is because New Zealand GST will be charged when the recipient is receiving the mobile roaming service while outside New Zealand. Likewise, GST will not be charged when mobile roaming services are received by international travellers visiting New Zealand. Comment One of the principles of a VAT/GST system is where to levy a tax on the final consumption of a good or service. The destination principle refers to the location where the tax should be levied (that is, the jurisdiction where the person receives the goods or services, rather than the jurisdiction where those goods or services were dispatched from). The destination principle covers a vast majority of goods and services supplied to consumers. However, for certain services where the supplier and the consumer are not necessarily in the same place, the OECD VAT/GST Guidelines suggest that the consumer’s usual place of residence can be used as a proxy for determining the place of consumption. The OECD VAT/GST Guidelines explicitly include telecommunication services as an example of a service that can be subject to this proxy for determining the place of consumption. This is because it is usually more practical (and minimises compliance costs for telecommunication suppliers) for such services to be subject to GST in the consumer’s usual place of residence, compared to the alternative of applying VAT or GST on the same service at different points in time, as the consumer travels between countries. There are other examples of services that do not adhere to the destination principle, such as remote services (digital content and other forms of intangible goods). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The proposal should instead be included within the remove services rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and PwC) Rather than continuing with the use of special GST rules for telecommunications services, the proposal should be embedded within the remote services rules, as consulted on as part of the policy development process. Continuing with separate rules for telecommunication services (including mobile roaming services) will create boundary issues and may be confusing for taxpayers to determine the 132 correct GST treatment of services, whether they relate to mobile roaming, telecommunication services and remote services. Comment As part of the policy consultation process, officials examined the various ways that the proposal could be legislatively drafted, including potentially embedding the rules within the GST remote services rules. Representatives of the telecommunication industry advised officials that, rather than embedding the proposal within the remote services rules, the use of special rules for telecommunications services, and in particular, mobile roaming services, should be retained. Including the proposed rules within the remote services rules would add complexity to both the remote services rules and also the proposed mobile roaming services rules. The draft legislation in the Bill reflects this feedback. Additionally, although the proposal seeks to amend the existing special rules, the GST Act has included special rules for telecommunication services since 2003, and so it is likely that New Zealand-based telecommunication suppliers have experience in accurately determining the GST treatment of a particular type of service. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of telecommunication services includes mobile roaming services Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition of “telecommunications services” would include “mobile roaming services”. This means the proposed rules overlap with other rules in the Goods and Services Act 1985 and must be removed. Comment The GST Act has an existing definition for telecommunication services that is widely understood. The proposal seeks to amend the definition by adding new rules for both outbound and inbound mobile roaming services. Officials do not believe that the overlap creates any definitional issues. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 133 Issue: Definition of remote services includes mobile roaming services Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition of “remote services” arguably also includes “mobile roaming services”. This overlap results in the proposed rules overlapping with other rules in the Goods and Services Act 1985 and must be removed. Comment Section 8(5) of the GST Act states that sections relating to the remote services rules do not apply to telecommunication services. This means that there is no overlap between the remote services rules and the telecommunication services rules, which includes mobile roaming services. Recommendation That the submission be declined. (Clause 86) Issue: Definition of “mobile roaming services” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Notwithstanding the issues above regarding the overlap with the remote services rules and the definition of telecommunication services, the submitter supported the proposed definition of mobile roaming services. Recommendation That the support for the proposed definition be noted. (Clause 89) Issue: Inbound mobile roaming services being zero-rated Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and KPMG) The proposal provides for symmetry between inbound and outbound roaming services, whereby inbound mobile roaming services supplied to a non-resident while visiting New Zealand will be zero-rated. 134 Comment Officials agree that if a resident of another country that has adopted the OECD VAT/GST Guidelines for mobile roaming services, uses their mobile phone service while visiting New Zealand, any mobile roaming charges they incur will be subject to VAT or GST in their home country. Recommendation That the support for this issue be noted. Issue: Double taxation issues Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and PwC) Submitters are concerned that, for some countries that continue to impose GST on inbound mobile roaming services, there is a risk that double taxation may be incurred on a single supply of mobile roaming services. This could occur where a New Zealand-based telecommunications services supplier is considered to provide outbound mobile roaming services to a New Zealand resident travelling overseas, and the New Zealand resident is receiving these mobile services in a foreign country where inbound mobile roaming services are subject to VAT or GST. In these circumstances, GST would be charged twice on the single supply of telecommunication services. The issue of double taxation must be avoided for the new rules to be a success. (PwC) Comment The proposed rules are not intended to apply double taxation to mobile roaming services and, where they do give rise to double taxation, this should be avoided, where practicable. With regard to the issue of double taxation with mobile roaming services, officials support, in theory, a non-double taxation rule that limits the overall VAT/GST paid on mobile roaming services. This could potentially be achieved, for example, by effectively providing an input credit for the amount of “consumption tax” paid in the other country, in recognition of the double tax effect. Further consultation with stakeholders is required to develop a policy solution that will resolve this issue. This also gives stakeholders time in which to plan and implement any systems changes that may be required. Officials note that this would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 135 Issue: Withdraw the proposal and reconsider post COVID-19 Submission (Deloitte on behalf of Vodafone New Zealand Limited, Spark New Zealand Limited and 2degrees Mobile Limited) Due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the likely minimal GST revenue collected for the short-to-medium term, the proposal should be removed from the Bill and reconsidered for the Tax Policy Work Programme at a later date, when the COVID-19 pandemic is controlled and there is greater certainty in the international travel industry. Comment Officials acknowledge that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on New Zealanders’ ability to travel overseas, and it is currently difficult to accurately predict when international travel will resume. However, the proposal is based around the modernisation of New Zealand’s mobile outbound roaming services rules and resolving a misalignment with the OECD’s VAT/GST Guidelines. Officials do not believe that the impact of COVID-19 means the proposal should be withdrawn from the Bill. The proposal should proceed, as current information suggests that it is likely there will be New Zealand travellers moving freely across international borders by April 2022. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 136 INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF LEASES SUBJECT TO NZ IFRS 16 (Clauses 8, 15, 22, 23, 26 and 58) Issue: Alignment with accounting Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC) Submitters supported closer alignment between accounting and tax for lease expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Optional application Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Submitters supported the IFRS 16 tax rules being optional for taxpayers to apply. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Timing of proposals Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) The delay in introducing the proposals means many taxpayers have already had to develop systems to unwind the impact of NZ IFRS 16. This will reduce the number of people choosing to adopt NZ IFRS 16 for tax. In the future, tax legislation should be more closely aligned to timings on change in accounting policy. Comment Officials agree it is beneficial to align the timing of changes in tax rules with changes in accounting policies to the extent possible. These proposals have been in development for some time and there have also been delays in the Bill, due, for example to COVID-19. Officials note that the proposals have benefited from the greater understanding that arose from taxpayers having to apply the accounting standard. 137 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Adjustments should not be required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC) Impairment, revaluation, make good and direct costs adjustments, which are only timing in nature, will negate the proposed compliance cost benefits. Practically, entities will have to maintain separate tax schedules recording the original interest and accounting amortisation to ensure the correct tax deduction. Officials should explore how any adverse impacts that may arise can be managed if there are no, or minimal tax adjustments, if the leasing tax rules are fully aligned with NZ IFRS 16. Comment Officials are aware that the requirement to make adjustments increases complexity, but have attempted to minimise compliance costs in the design of adjustments. For example, when an adjustment is made, this will be on a straight-line basis, with no recalculation required for events such as an extension of the lease term. This means a recurring annual adjustment will only need to be calculated once. The direct cost adjustment is also optional for taxpayers who wish to forego the timing advantage of bringing forward the deduction if the compliance costs of doing so are considered too high. It is a general principle of the Income Tax Act that business expenditure is deductible when it is incurred rather than when an impairment or revaluation provision is created. If adjustments were not made to reverse these provisions for tax purposes, this would provide a significant timing advantage for taxpayers applying the new rules compared with non- IFRS taxpayers. Accordingly, officials do not consider it would be appropriate to have a full alignment without impairment and revaluation adjustments. However, we acknowledge the timing impact of these adjustments may be small for certain lower value and/or shorter term leases, so officials recommend de minimis thresholds below which fewer adjustments will be necessary. These are considered separately below. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 138 Issue: Adjustments for low-value assets and short-term leases Submission (Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) It is understandable that tax policy officials want certain NZ IFRS adjustments to be reversed for tax purposes. This, however, has the effect of reducing, and in some cases significantly so, the simplification that can be achieved by having tax follow the financial reporting treatment. A half-way house is needed whereby only major accounting adjustments that significantly affect tax are reversed for tax purposes. However, for low value or shorter-term leases, where the effect of the NZ IFRS adjustment is less material, there seems to be no real problem in following the NZ IFRS treatment, with the proviso that a wash-up is necessary to make sure that the aggregate tax treatment over the term of the lease is appropriate. Comment NZ IFRS 16 already has a different treatment for low value and short-term leases which will minimise compliance costs for the lowest value leases. This is explained on page 43 of the Bill Commentary. However, officials agree that the compliance costs of the NZ IFRS 16 proposals could be reduced if certain adjustments were not required for shorter-term and lower-value leases beyond that contemplated by NZ IFRS 16. This could potentially make the new rules more concessionary than the rules applied by non-IFRS taxpayers, so should only apply where the timing difference is relatively immaterial. While any distinction between shorter-term and longer-term leases or low and high value leases is necessarily arbitrary, officials have discussed with submitters where these thresholds should be set. Officials recommend that the add-back adjustment, impairment and revaluation adjustment and the make-good and direct costs adjustment should not be made for an IFRS lease that has an initial right of use asset value of $100,000 and a term of four years or less. Officials note these thresholds are significantly above the value and term thresholds in NZ IFRS 16 referred to above, which are approximately a US$5,000 asset value and terms less than 12 months respectively. Officials expect this concession will cover the majority of personal property leases businesses enter into, for example, motor vehicles. Typically few, if any, adjustments would be expected for these leases, however introducing a de minimis will increase certainty for taxpayers that adjustments will not be necessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Carve out for real property Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PwC) 139 The carve out for real property will result in many taxpayers being less likely to adopt NZ IFRS 16 for tax. Where a taxpayer has several leases that are real property and several that are not, the processes required to determine the differences between accounting and tax will differ between the lease assets. Comment Real property leases are generally of higher value and for longer terms than other assets. Therefore, the fiscal cost of accelerating deductions for real property by adopting NZ IFRS 16 for tax, for real property, is significantly higher. Furthermore, real property is more likely to have impairment and revaluation adjustments, meaning the compliance costs of applying NZ IFRS 16 for tax are likely to be higher than for shorter term, lower-value assets. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Irrevocable election Submission (EY) Taxpayers should be allowed to cease to follow NZ IFRS 16 for tax if they perform a wash- up calculation at exit, and account appropriately for any income/expenditure that arises. Comment Officials consider it is appropriate for a taxpayer that elects to follow NZ IFRS 16 for tax to be required to continue to follow it for the remainder of that lease. This will prevent taxpayers going into and out of the rules to gain a favourable tax outcome. This will also minimise the number of adjustments and wash-ups required. However, to reduce the barriers to entry to these rules, officials consider that a taxpayer should be able to choose whether to apply the new rules on a lease-by-lease basis. The consequence of this choosing to apply the new rules to some or all current leases would not prevent the taxpayer choosing not to apply it for other leases. This is covered further separately below. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transitional adjustment for early adopters Submission (EY) 140 In cases where taxpayers adopted NZ IFRS 15 and 16 early, it is possible they will have already filed at least their 2019 and 2020 income tax returns before the Bill is enacted. In order to reduce compliance costs, the proposals should allow a transitional adjustment. We suggest that the proposed spread of the transitional adjustment over a four-year period should be reduced to two years for these early adopters. Comment The proposed four-year spread of the transitional adjustment is designed to spread the fiscal cost of deductions being brought forward on adoption of NZ IFRS 16. If the adjustment period were reduced to two years, this would increase the fiscal cost of the proposals without significantly reducing the compliance costs of early adopters. Officials note that the updated proposal covered below, to allow taxpayers to choose to apply the new rules on a lease-by-lease basis, will provide greater flexibility for early adopters of NZ IFRS 16 who wish to apply the new rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Certain leases should be excluded from wash-up calculation Submission (EY) A wash-up calculation will currently be required for leases that cease to qualify for the proposed treatment. Concessionary carve outs should apply to remove the need to perform a wash-up calculation in the following scenarios: • when leased assets are on-leased or sub-leased between New Zealand group entities with at least 66% commonality of ownership; • any sub-leasing between members of a tax consolidated group; and • any short-term sub-leasing to a person. Comment The proposed new rules align the timing of deductions for certain operating lease expenditure more closely with accounting. The purpose of the wash-up calculation is to ensure that, where deductions claimed based on this modified timing are above or below the expenditure incurred, an adjustment is made to align deductions claimed with the amount incurred. If no wash-up adjustment is made, some expenditure incurred may be deducted twice, or not deducted, in certain circumstances. The policy intention is that total deductions claimed in relation to a lease until the point of wash-up should equal the deduction available to non-IFRS taxpayers. Removing the need to perform a wash-up calculation in certain circumstances will undermine the integrity of the new rules. 141 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Effect on thin capitalisation Submission (EY) The NZ IFRS 16 treatment could negatively impact thin capitalisation ratios, resulting in interest disallowances beyond the intended scope of those rules. The proposals in the Bill do not exclude the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognised on the balance sheet as a consequence of NZ IFRS 16 from thin capitalisation calculations. Deferred tax in relation to leases will also be included in debt-to-asset ratio calculations. The proposals should be amended to include confirmation that thin capitalisation calculations should exclude the right-of-use asset, lease liability and associated deferred tax components; or alternatively should include a mechanism to remove any net impact of NZ IFRS 16. Comment The thin capitalisation debt percentage calculation is based on the accounting balance sheet using the formula:– group debt/(group assets – non-debt liabilities) A group’s balance sheet position is impacted by the right-of-use asset and the lease liability recognised under NZ IFRS 16. These amounts increase group assets and non-debt liabilities respectively. Accordingly, when the two amounts are equal, there is no impact on the thin capitalisation debt percentage. However, officials acknowledge that there will be differences between the amount of a right- of-use asset and lease liability, and lease-related deferred tax assets or liabilities, that flow through to the debt percentage calculation. These impacts arise as a result of adopting NZ IFRS 16 for accounting, rather than any of the proposed tax changes in the Bill. From time to time, existing accounting standards are updated, and new standards are introduced, that impact a taxpayer’s balance sheet, and these changes flow through to their thin capitalisation debt percentage calculations. As a test based on accounting information, the policy intent is that the debt percentage calculation is affected by these changes and the formula is not updated to reverse their impact. Officials do not support a special treatment for NZ IFRS 16. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 142 Issue: Dedicated IFRS resource Submission (EY) NZ IFRS standards should be pro-actively reviewed for tax impacts ahead of the change in the standard applying, to provide NZ IFRS taxpayers with certainty on the related tax consequences. Inland Revenue should establish a dedicated project on its Policy Work Programme on NZ IFRS-related impacts. Comment Inland Revenue considers information from a variety of sources, including consultation with the private sector, when advising the Government on the Tax Policy Work Programme. There have been numerous legislative updates to reflect changes in NZ IFRS, and officials will continue to monitor NZ IFRS to determine further legislative change is required. This can be achieved without establishing a dedicated NZ IFRS resource. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Election process Submission (Matter raised by officials) Taxpayers should be able to apply the new rules on a lease-by-lease basis. Comment Under the rules proposed in the Bill, once a taxpayer has elected to follow NZ IFRS 16 for tax it must continue to do so for all eligible leases for all future periods. Officials now consider that this is more restrictive than necessary. Officials recommend taxpayers should be able to choose whether to follow NZ IFRS 16 for tax for each eligible lease. This would allow taxpayers to follow NZ IFRS 16 for tax for an individual lease, while continuing to follow the standard rules for other leases. Once a taxpayer chooses to follow NZ IFRS 16 for tax for a particular lease, it should continue to follow this for the life of the lease, provided the lease remains eligible under the originally proposed criteria. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 143 Issue: Minor drafting improvements Submission (Matter raised by officials) Minor drafting changes should be made to the proposed provisions as follows: • The words “other than subsection (5)” should be deleted from subsection EJ 10B(1) to clarify that the wash-up rule in subsections EJ 10B(5) and (6) applies for the income year in which an IFRS lease ends or ceases to be an IFRS lease. • The word “accounts” in subsection EJ 10B(1)(a) should be replaced with “financial statements” to align with the term used in NZ IFRS. • The words “or would use NZ IFRS 16 if that lease met the materiality thresholds for NZ IFRS 16” should be deleted from subsection EJ 10B(1)(a) because the treatment of low value and short-term leases is specified within NZ IFRS 16, so the standard will be used for these leases. • The words “leases described in paragraphs (a) to (c)” in subsection EJ 10B(1)(d) should be replaced with “IFRS lease” to simplify the drafting. • The words “a deduction for an income year for the IFRS lease equal to the amount calculated using the formula” in subsection EJ 10B(2) should be replaced with “for an income year, a deduction for a positive amount, and has income for a negative amount, for amounts calculated using the formula” to clarify that the formula result can be the amount of a deduction or income. • The term “accounting expenditure” in the formula in subsection EJ 10B(2) and in subsection EJ 10B(3)(a) should be changed to “accounting amount” because the accounting amount could be accounting expenditure or income. • The words “relevant positive or negative” should be deleted from subsection EJ 10B(3)(b) and (d) to simplify the drafting. • The words “for any income year” should be inserted after the words “add-back adjustment” in subsection EJ 10B(3)(c) to improve clarity. • The words “an amount of income or deduction” in subsection EJ 10B(5) should be replaced with “a deduction for a positive amount, and has income for a negative amount” to improve clarity. • The word “or” should be replaced with “and has” in subsection EJ 10B(7) to improve clarity. Comment Officials recommend these drafting changes as they will improve the clarity of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 144 SCHEDULE 32 OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS (Clause 62) Issue: Support for proposed additions Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the addition of Active Hearts Foundation, Kiwilink and Shimshal Trust to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, with effect 1 April 2020. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 145 GST CREDIT NOTES (Clause 90) Issue: The proposed amendment to allow a supplier to issue a credit note when 15% GST was incorrectly charged is unnecessary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) We disagree with Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the current law. Section 25 already allows an adjustment of the full amount of the reduction in consideration. The proposed change is being enacted to achieve an outcome that is achieved with the current GST legislation. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Comment Officials consider the amendment is necessary. Even if the same outcome can already be achieved under the current law, it is still useful to explicitly clarify in the legislation that a credit note can be issued to adjust GST in the scenario when a zero rated or exempt supply was incorrectly standard rated. The amendment is designed to accommodate existing business practices so should increase certainty and reduce compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Supports proposal to allow a supplier to issue a credit note when 15% GST was incorrectly charged Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, PwC, EY) If Inland Revenue continues to take the view that the legislation as it stands is unclear, then the change is welcome. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Supports the proposal to align this process with business practice and the proposal for retrospective application. (Deloitte, PwC) We support the proposed simplifications that seek to align the issuing of credit notes to the assessment amendment approach, currently available. (EY) Comment Most submitters support the proposed amendment. 146 Recommendation That the submissions should be noted. Issue: Supports proposal, but further amendments are required to align provisions with modern business practices Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The Group submits that the suggestions it made to improve credit note requirements in its submission on the officials’ issues paper GST policy issues should be considered and implemented as part of the modifications to section 25 contained in this Bill. The legislation should be modernised to explicitly allow a document to simultaneously be a tax invoice, credit note and debit note. This would align with common business practice which is designed to ensure invoicing documentation is streamlined and one document can deal with all scenarios. Although the intention to align the legislation with modern business practice is commendable, section 25 will still remain outdated and not fit for purpose after this amendment is made. For example, it is not technically possible to issue a valid credit note if there is an error on the corresponding tax invoice (that is, the wrong entity is being invoiced) but the consideration and GST amounts on the tax invoice are correct. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment The points raised by submitters require wider reforms to modernise the invoicing provisions. Proposed reforms to modernise invoicing are intended to be introduced in the next omnibus taxation bill. The submitters’ points will be considered for inclusion in that Bill. As with other policy reforms, inclusion in the Bill will require officials’ consideration, ministerial approval and finally Cabinet approval. Recommendation That these submissions be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Scope of the proposed provision should be broadened Submission (PwC) A further amendment should be made to clarify that a credit note can also be issued for a transaction where GST was inadvertently charged despite there being no supply at all. For 147 example, if GST was charged in error in relation to a compensation payment not subject to GST. Comment Under the current GST Act, a credit note can only be issued when a GST-registered person has made a supply of goods and services. Allowing a credit note to be issued when there has in fact been no supply would require a complete redrafting of the credit note provisions, so could be considered as part of the package of changes to modernise the invoicing provisions, which are planned to be included in a subsequent taxation Bill. In considering this submission, officials have identified that the proposed specific provision that was included in the Bill as introduced is too narrow, as it is limited to credit notes issued when a supplier has mistakenly charged GST on an exempt or zero-rated supply. The intended policy outcome would be better achieved by a more general provision which clarifies that a credit or debit note can be issued for any supply of goods of services where an incorrect GST treatment was applied to the supply. Officials recommend including this more general provision in the current Bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Consequential amendments to similar provisions Submission (PwC) Existing sections 25(1)(ab) and (abb) allow a credit note to be issued in relation to a supply which should have been zero rated under two specific zero-rating rules. Following the introduction of new section 25(1)(aaa), consideration should be given to amending sections 25(1)(ab) and (abb), as the supplies to which these subsections apply may now be adjusted under the new, more general section 25(1)(aaa). Comment Officials note that the proposed general provision will make the existing specific provisions in sections 25(1)(ab) and (abb) effectively redundant. Officials recommend amendments that would allow those specific provisions to be replaced by the new general provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 148 Issue: Proposed time limit on issuing a credit note Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) The change should not proceed. The Commentary to the Bill states that the amendment is being introduced because there is a fiscal risk to the current rules. We question the size of such a risk. Any GST input tax claimed is merely passed on to the recipient and is not retained by the supplier. The supplier would be able to retain the refund if the price paid was GST-inclusive, but this will be determined by the original agreements, not by any subsequent decision to issue a credit note. The issue of a credit note remains the most practical means for correcting an error in the pricing of the supply. To require suppliers to apply to the Commissioner to obtain a refund would create additional compliance costs. Conversely, to not allow the supplier to obtain a refund would be inequitable. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Group does not support the proposal to align the time limit for issuing a credit note with the time bar that applies to GST refunds. The reason for this is that it is not uncommon for an amount of an invoice to remain in dispute for an extended period of time, which may exceed four years. Taxpayers should retain the ability to correct tax invoicing, via a credit note, at the conclusion of a commercial dispute. If a time limit is to be placed on credit notes, this should be a period of eight years. This would align with the rules for GST returns which are incorrect due to a clear mistake or simple oversight. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Although we recognise the Government’s concern around the fiscal risks of unlimited ability to issue credit notes, we do not support the proposed time limits as they are currently drafted. A better outcome would be to align the time limit for issuing credit notes consistent with the input tax rules; that there be no time limit where a credit note is required to be issued due to a simple mistake or oversight. If Inland Revenue is worried about the integrity of the system, we recommend that officials consider whether increased disclosures could alleviate the risk to the tax base. (EY) Comment Officials consider it is necessary to provide a time limit on issuing a credit note to limit the potential fiscal risks from a change in how the GST treatment of a supply is interpreted by the GST-registered person or Inland Revenue. The proposed time limits are four years or eight years (when the credit note is issued to correct a clear mistake or simple oversight) and are consistent with the corresponding time limits for amending the original GST return that the relevant supply had been included in. This time bar on amending tax returns is an accepted approach of providing certainty for taxpayers and Inland Revenue, and in the absence of a similar time limit on credit notes, the credit note provisions could be used to defeat the intent of the time bar. Without a time limit on credit notes, it would be possible for GST-registered persons to claim large tax refunds in relation to positions taken more than four or eight years ago. Other options for addressing this fiscal risk, such as increased disclosures or a value-based limit could be ineffective or unfair. 149 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 150 PORTABILITY OF AUSTRALIAN UNCLAIMED SUPERANNUATION MONEY (Clauses 58(3) and 93) Issue: Support for proposed amendments Submission (Anthony Harper, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated, and Navtej Singh) The submitters voiced their support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Commencement date Submission (Anthony Harper, Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated) Two of the submitters noted that the proposed commencement date for the amendments is the date that relevant amendments to the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand (the Arrangement) come into effect. Amendments to this Arrangement will be made only once reciprocal changes are made to Australian domestic legislation. The submitters encouraged New Zealand and Australian Governments to pursue these changes as soon as practicable. Comment The relevant Australian legislation was passed on 11 December 2020. New Zealand officials will continue to engage with their Australian counterparts as changes to the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Arrangement are agreed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Implementation implications Submission (Financial Services Council of New Zealand Incorporated) 151 Open dialogue with the KiwiSaver scheme provider industry must be maintained to ensure that any implementation issues (examples of possible issues the submitter provided relate to system changes, possible anti-money laundering issues and ensuring funds are correctly applied to the right member) are appropriately worked through, and suitable implementation timeframes are provided prior to commencement. Comment Officials agree that it is important to work closely with KiwiSaver scheme providers on the implementation of the proposed amendments. With both nations progressing the needed legislative changes domestically, it is not possible to include a specific date for commencement in this legislation. It would not be appropriate to have a commencement date that does not match Australia’s. However, in order to increase certainty for taxpayers, officials are recommending a a time limit to the commencement of this provision. This would specify that the relevant amendments would commence with the exchanging of diplomatic notes or 12 months after the legislation receives Royal Assent. Such an approach would echo that taken by Australia in introducing their complementary legislative changes and increase certainty for KiwiSaver scheme providers. Officials also note that linking the commencement date for the amendments to the date diplomatic notes are exchanged between Australia and New Zealand (rather than prescribing a set application date at this time) will ensure that there is the flexibility to set a commencement date that gives scheme providers sufficient lead-in time to implement the changes. It is also possible to defer the date of application for a set time after the notes have been exchanged. The application date for the original portability legislative amendments was similarly linked to the date that an exchange of diplomatic notes brought the Trans-Tasman Retirement Savings Portability Arrangement into effect (see: section 2(25) of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010). Recommendation That the submission be noted. 152 MYCOPLASMA BOVIS TAX ISSUE (Clause 33) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd, Navtej Singh) That the proposal is supported and should proceed. Comment Officials note the general support for the proposal. Some of the submitters made further points which are dealt with below. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Retrospective application Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is appropriate that the legislation be backdated to the 2017–18 income year, given some farmers may have had to cull livestock in the 2017–18 income year because of Mycoplasma bovis. Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed retrospective application date. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Generic provision Submission (Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) 153 That either the Mycoplasma bovis proposal be made generic to all biosecurity events, or that all event-specific relief legislation for adverse events be reconsidered with a view to making it generic, and applicable to Mycoplasma bovis impacted situations. Comment The current proposal is confined to the culling of livestock as part of eradicating Mycoplasma bovis in New Zealand and therefore terminates before the 2028–29 income year. Officials agree in principle that there should be an equivalent generic provision to cover future biosecurity events that lead to the culling of livestock valued under the national standard cost scheme or cost price method. This would expedite addressing the tax implications of such events and create more certainty for livestock owners. Officials have discussed the possible criteria for a separate generic provision with submitters, and the matter has been included on the tax policy work programme. It may therefore be feasible to include a generic provision covering future biosecurity events in a tax bill in 2021, which would enable wider public submissions on the proposal. In the meantime, the Mycoplasma bovis specific provision should proceed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Unwinding of income equalisation deposits Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) Mycoplasma bovis affected farmers should be allowed to reconsider past income equalisation deposits if they retrospectively elect to use the Mycoplasma bovis spread. Comment Income equalisation deposits are a way of smoothing farmers’ incomes. This is achieved by deposits being deductible for tax purposes, and withdrawals being income. Deposits in any one income year are capped at the amount of net income from the qualifying activity for that year. Some farmers whose herds have been affected by Mycoplasma bovis will have, in the absence of other options, made deposits into the scheme to mitigate the income arising from their herds being culled. Income equalisation deposits are, however, not an effective mechanism to mitigate the unexpected income effects when farmers need the cash to restock their breeding herds, as the deferred income is then brought to account around a year later. The proposed six-year spread will be far more effective in such cases. Therefore, some farmers will now prefer to retrospectively unwind the tax effects of their earlier income equalisation deposits and instead take up the income-spreading option. Unwinding the tax effects of a deposit requires 154 specific additional legislation. However, it does not involve unwinding the deposit, on which interest would have likely already been paid. Points of difference In principle, officials agree with the submission but the matter is still under consideration given that there are some fiscal implications. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Removal of reference to “owner” in proposed section EZ 4B(1) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the proposed section EZ 4B(1) should apply to farming businesses, rather than the owners, and that the section should be rewritten to reflect this. Comment Proposed section EZ 4B(1) begins with the wording: “This section applies when a person who owns or carries on a business has mixed-age cows on hand at the start of the income year”. The submitter is concerned that this proposed wording by referring to “owners”, will encompass the shareholders of a company when it is the company, not the shareholders, that returns the income. Officials consider that this interpretation is not correct. In the example, the company is the “person” carrying on the business and will be entitled to use the spread, provided the various other criteria are met. Officials note that section EZ 4B(1) is based on wording already used in those parts of the Income Tax Act that deal with the valuation of livestock and trading stock in general. It is difficult to envisage a scenario in which a business is not being carried on, even in the case of a trust or individual. However, officials are reluctant to recommend what could prove to be narrower wording that inadvertently precludes someone from being able to use the spread. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Generally rewording proposed section EZ 4B(1) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) 155 That the eligibility criteria in proposed section EZ 4B(1)(a)(i) should be reworded to better reflect the criteria for spreading, or alternatively deleted. Comment Currently, proposed section EZ 4B(1(a)(i) refers to mixed-age cows held “for the purposes of sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business”. Officials recommend that the proposed provision should be reworded to better reflect the intended coverage of the spread, which is stock used for breeding. Officials do not recommend that the provision should be deleted, as it is necessary to have a reference to using the livestock in the business. Being clearer on the intended type of business should be sufficient. Recommendation That the submission to amend the wording of section EZ 4B(1(a)(i) to more specifically reflect the intended coverage of the spread be accepted, but the submission to delete section EZ 4B(1(a)(i) be declined. Issue: Use of the word “choose” rather than “elect” in section EZ 4B(2) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the word “choose” in proposed section EZ 4B(2) should be replaced with “elect”. Comment Taxpayers will need to make an election to use the income spread. Proposed section EZ 4B(2) sets out the requirement. It is standard drafting style to use “choose” as the verb rather than “elect” when referring to an election in the Tax Acts. Therefore, officials do not agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Business cessation Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the requirement for allocation on death of a business owner is unnecessary and the draft section EZ 4B(4) should be reworded. 156 Comment The proposed provision spreads the income evenly over a six-year period. However, proposed section EZ 4B(4) requires that, if a business ceases or a natural person owner dies, any remaining spread income at the time of cessation or death is allocated to the year of cessation or death. This is consistent with the standard requirement for tax matters to be brought to account on death or cessation of business. The submitters are concerned that the reference to death of an owner will mean that companies that continue after the death of one of their owners will be required to bring the unallocated spread income to account at that stage. Officials agree that the crucial test is whether the person stops owning or carrying on the business, and the provision should just reflect that. For example, the death of a sole trader will mean that the person has stopped owning or ceased their business. Officials recommend the draft legislation should be clarified in this area. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Shareholder salaries Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That taxpayers who meet the criteria to use the spreading method should be able to adjust prior year shareholder salaries to reflect the spreads impact on business profits. In particular, Inland Revenue should consider whether a change to the tax position as a result of a legislative change falls within the parameters of Standard Practice Statement (SPS 18/01): Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder employees. Comment Many farming businesses pay shareholder-employees a salary, which may be linked to the level of business profits. The submission notes that Inland Revenue’s Standard Practice Statement outlined the circumstances in which the Commissioner will allow a retrospective adjustment of previously paid shareholder salaries. Those circumstances focus on when the company profit can be shown to be in error, or when the salary shown in the company accounts was not the amount agreed at the time of the salary and wages. An error in the company profit can include when a company has a policy of declaring salaries at no more than the company’s profit in any year, and it is found, subsequent to declaring a salary, that the company’s profit was overstated. The Standard Practice Statement may, therefore, enable some companies who can apply the spread retrospectively to also make retrospective adjustments to salaries, as past profits will then have been overstated. Officials therefore recommend reminding taxpayers of the Standard Practice Statement through the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. 157 Officials recommend any retrospective adjustment of salaries should be limited to the circumstances specified in the Standard Practice Statement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Amendment to spread formula term “number” Submission (Matter raised by officials) That proposed section EZ 4B(8)(b) be revised to refer to the number of livestock of that class that the person had on hand at the start of the cull year and valued under the national standard cost scheme or the cost price method, in the income year before the cull. Comment Proposed section EZ 4B(8) defines the term “number” for the purposes of the spread formula. “Number” is the number of livestock that are eligible to be included in the spread calculation. Officials are suggesting a change to this term to ensure the spread formula works as intended when there are additional livestock numbers in the cull year. The change would exclude those additional livestock from the spread by limiting “number” to being no more than the number of livestock of that class that the person had on hand at the start of the cull year, which were valued under either the national standard cost scheme or the cost price method. Officials have discussed this submission with Federated Farmers of New Zealand Incorporated, who confirm that it would be an unnecessary complication for the spread to factor in adjustments for expanding herds in the cull year, and that, in practice herd numbers have been generally stable or contracting. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 158 INDIVIDUAL TAX WRITE-OFF THRESHOLD Issue: Temporary increase to the automatically calculated individual income tax write-off threshold Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the amendment is supported but the write-off should be extended to all individuals with tax to pay of less than $200. The amendment applies only to those individuals whose assessments are automatically calculated by Inland Revenue. For those whose assessments are not automatically calculated, such as those who are required to file an IR 3 return, the measure will not apply. The rationale for the change is to ease financial pressure for individuals following COVID- 19. Return filers are under the same financial pressure as those whose assessments are calculated automatically. Comment The current $50 write-off threshold only applies to individuals whose assessments are automatically calculated, not all taxpayers, so this temporary change targets individuals who received only reportable income (that is, income that has already had tax withheld at source). In such cases, income tax obligations are automatically calculated by Inland Revenue and any assessed refund or tax to pay would be due to the income payer not withholding the correct amount of tax. By contrast, other taxpayers’ tax assessments are due to their income that may not be taxed at source at all. Officials note that increasing the write-off threshold was designed both to remove compliance costs for taxpayers seeking to have the tax written off under the financial hardship rules and to reduce the administrative burden for Inland Revenue who were under pressure with regular work and implementing COVID-19 measures. As part of the auto- calculation process, Inland Revenue calculated around 154,000 tax assessments for tax liabilities of between $50 and $200 and, as a result of the increased write-off threshold, did not have to deal with customer contacts about these liabilities. Inland Revenue knows from previous experience that auto-calculation customers who receive a tax bill contact Inland Revenue to understand why. Taxpayers who do not qualify for the automatic write-off can still use the current mechanisms available to help people in financial hardship. Extending the write-off threshold increase to all taxpayers will also have a fiscal cost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 159 Remedials 161 GENERAL COMMENTS (Clauses 45, 59, 60, 76, 79) Issue: General support Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The submitters expressed support for the proposals. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Changes appear more than merely remedial Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We are concerned about changes being made to the schedules of eligible activities and expenditure types which are presented as “remedial” or as “clarifications.” While they may appear minor in nature, the R&D tax credit legislation is very prescriptive and even small changes can have a major impact on what is or is not eligible. Presenting these changes as “remedial” is disingenuous. Comment Officials consider that the changes to the schedules mentioned by the submitter are remedial in nature. These amendments are based on evidence and advice that the legislation is being interpreted, or could be interpreted, in a manner that is clearly beyond the original policy intent. The amendments seek to address these potential interpretation issues and ensure the legislation gives effect to the policy intent. There is one change to the schedules that reflects a policy change (the carve-in for labour expenditure on core R&D that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property). This amendment is taxpayer-friendly in nature and explicitly supported by all submitters. Aside from this, officials believe all changes to the schedules do not alter the intent of the regime, but confirm and clarify it; as such, officials expect the effect on taxpayers filing within the policy intent will be minimal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 162 Issue: Changes not based on evidence Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) As most R&D claims for the 2019–20 income year have not yet been made, we do not believe that the changes are based on actual evidence of any issues with the application of the regime. Comment Many proposals in the Bill are based on operational experience from the R&D tax incentive’s pilot regime, which ran from November 2019 to June 2020. The pilot was intended to trial the in- year approval regime in advance of its deployment in the 2020–21 income year, but also to give officials advance indication of areas where issues may arise around interpretation before the majority of claims are filed for the 2019–20 income year (the first year of the regime), as it took place before applications for that year are due. This design meant that the scheme would evolve as new challenges came to light through the pilot. Officials consider evidence from the pilot justifies clarification in certain areas to ensure the original policy intent is being met. Other proposals concern areas where officials have considered certain issues and received both legal advice and public feedback to the effect that the current legislation could be interpreted inconsistently with the original intent, or evidence from tax incentive regimes overseas that legislation similar to our own could be interpreted in ways contrary to the original intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Changes decrease certainty Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We are concerned that there seem to be constant changes to the R&D tax credit regime, when returns have not yet been filed. This makes it hard for taxpayers who are claiming or wishing to claim, as the rules are being amended relatively often. Comment Evidence from the pilot regime (see Issue: Changes not based on evidence for more information) and from overseas jurisdictions has highlighted some areas of the regime where there are potential interpretations of the existing legislation that are inconsistent with those policy decisions. The amendments are primarily aimed at clarifying or tightening up the language around some of the activity or expenditure exclusions to bring them in line with the original policy intent. 163 We expect that applications should be made in good faith in line with the policy intent of those exclusions. Applicants acting in this way will not be affected by any of the proposed changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Approach is counter to original intent Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The process being adopted in this Bill is counter to the process which was legislated via the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019. Section LY 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for an Order in Council process for making prospective changes to schedules 21 and 21B with effect from the tax year following the tax year in which the amendment is made (with a requirement to convert this to legislation within a period of three years). This approach is fairer than the proposed approach. Comment The mechanism provided for in section LY 9 is intended to allow officials to respond quickly to emerging areas of risk that might arise out of changes in the business R&D environment. The tax incentive is intended to be sustainable and provide certainty for businesses. To maintain this intent, the policy intent of the regime is to allow for minor amendments on a regular basis to address emerging areas of risk. This is key to ensuring a sustainable credit regime and avoiding the sudden major changes officials have observed in other jurisdictions. Overall, this provides more certainty for applicants in the long run. The proposed changes are not responses to newly-identified risks or changes in the business R&D environment and do not represent a new policy decision. Instead, they address areas of the existing legislation where evidence shows there is potential for interpretations that are inconsistent with the original policy intent. Officials do not believe it is appropriate to generalise the intent of section LY 9 to cover all legislative changes to the R&D tax credit regime, regardless of their purpose. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Retrospective application dates Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 164 a) We support the retrospective application dates for the proposed amendments. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) b) The proposed amendments should not take effect retrospectively, unless they are taxpayer-friendly, particularly where exclusions are broadened or definitions changed. Making the amendments fully retrospective increases the compliance burden on taxpayers who will have to reassess based on these changes (which may not be enacted prior to taxpayers needing to lodge R&D tax credit returns). This imposes an unfair burden on taxpayers. A prospective change would be fairer. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment The fully retrospective application date of (most of) the amendments is intended to address areas where the effect of the legislation does not match the original policy intent of the regime. Officials do not believe the proposals alter the intended effect of the regime, but either close unintended gaps in the legislation or clarify certain aspects of the policy intent for the avoidance of doubt. As such, it is not anticipated that most taxpayers will need to re- evaluate their claims based on these amendments. However, officials acknowledge that this is likely the last tax bill that will pass before the bulk of year one claims have been filed. Officials therefore concur that, after this Bill, any changes made to the regime ought not to be retrospective to the start of the regime (unless the change is to correct a major gap between the policy intent and the legislation), as this undermines the intent of providing certainty to applicants. Recommendation a) That the submission be noted. b) That the submission be declined. 165 DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE R&D EXPENDITURE (Clause 45) Issue: Support the amendment Submission (EY) We support the intent of this amendment. The regime needs to remain robust. Identifying and addressing risks early will support the longevity of the scheme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendment may overreach Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) The Bill commentary suggests the proposed changes clarify existing requirements. We believe, however, that the changes go further and require a closer nexus between activity and expenditure than was originally intended. As the nexus appears to be tighter, some costs that were previously eligible will fall out of the regime. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) While we acknowledge the Government is merely trying to protect the tax base, we are also concerned that the intended policy could overreach. Without robust guidance as to the intended scope of these words, the tests could be read too narrowly. (EY) Comment From the inception of the R&D scheme, it has always been a policy principle that in order for the scheme to be sustainable, it had to have strong integrity measures to prevent expenditure on activities unrelated to R&D being claimed. The intent therefore has always been that expenditure must have a close nexus with an R&D activity to be claimable for the incentive. However, the current legislative requirements require only a relatively loose nexus. Expenditure on R&D activities is claimable to the extent that it relates to an R&D activity (whether core or supporting), as long as it is not listed in the schedules of ineligible expenditure. When the policy was being formulated, it was contemplated that activities that did not relate directly to the core R&D being conducted, such as cleaning, HR or payroll activities, or procurement, would only be eligible if they satisfied the supporting R&D activity test. The test stipulates that an activity be “integral to” or for the “only or main purpose of” supporting a core R&D activity to be eligible as a supporting activity and requires a close connection between a supporting activity and a core activity. As expenditure must be on an approved 166 activity to be eligible, it was initially envisaged that expenditure on activities not directly related to core R&D would effectively be covered by the supporting activity tests (as the activity itself must first meet the requirements before expenditure on it can be claimed), and therefore no comparable test requiring expenditure to be closely related to core R&D was needed. However, it has come to officials’ attention that the nexus requirement can be circumvented, and the policy intent defeated, by simply characterising indirect activities as “overhead” expenditure on core R&D activities rather than an activity at all. To remove this opportunity for exploitation, the proposed amendment effectively brings the supporting activity requirements into the definition of eligible expenditure. This will ensure that expenditure that is not directly related to R&D will be subject to the supporting activity tests, regardless of whether it is claimed as a supporting activity or as overhead expenditure on a core activity. This confirms the policy intent as these requirements were always intended to apply to this kind of expenditure. It is not proposed that the intended nexus test between activities and expenditure will change. Officials understand the concern that, although they are intended to confirm the policy intent, the tests may be read more narrowly than intended. Officials agree that clear guidance is necessary to allay these concerns. Following enactment of the Bill, guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin, and Inland Revenue’s official guidance material will be updated to clarify the intended meaning of the tests. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Potential for government interference Submission (EY) The wording creates a risk that the government could narrow what expenditure will be considered eligible. Further consideration is required to ensure the wording does not open up an opportunity for officials to debate or influence how R&D is being conducted within a business. This includes references to expenditure being “required for” and “integral to” the activity. For example, some expenditure may make the R&D more efficient or may be linked to a business strategy, but if it cannot be directly related to the R&D activity and be considered integral and required, then it would not be eligible. To address this risk, the provisions should make it clear that the taxpayer’s assessment of whether the expenditure is required or integral takes primacy. The onus should be on IR to argue the contrary. Comment Officials understand the concern, but do not believe the risk of this interference is high. The proposed tests simply reinforce the supporting R&D activity requirements already present in the regime, which do not force businesses to adopt a certain approach to their expenditure 167 on R&D, but only require that the expenditure has a reasonably close connection with R&D. Guidance material on these existing tests makes it clear that they are not intended to tell businesses how to do their R&D or obligate them to carry out R&D in the simplest or cheapest manner possible; they only require that a supporting R&D activity has a certain degree of closeness to an approved core R&D activity. Officials fully intend this approach to be transferred to the proposed expenditure tests. In keeping with New Zealand’s self-assessment system, the more efficient approach is for taxpayers to keep and provide records detailing the purpose of their expenditure and its connection with their R&D activities, rather than requiring the Commissioner to provide proof for any expenditure she considers not to meet the proposed tests. This is consistent with the design of the regime, which is that the taxpayer should have to keep records that adequately detail the particulars of their claim and demonstrate that it meets legislative requirements. It is also consistent with the general tax provisions in the context of resolving disputes. Officials instead believe that this issue is best addressed by making the meaning of the proposed tests as clear as possible in supporting material. Following the enactment of the Bill, guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin and Inland Revenue’s official guidance material. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 168 MINING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY EXCLUSION (Clause 59) Issue: Support the amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Changes not necessary Submission (Deloitte) We do not consider that a mining development exclusion is necessary. There is no evidence of taxpayers in these industries taking aggressive approaches to making R&D tax credit claims. Comment The objective of this exclusion is not to address any perceived exploitative behaviour but to address an inconsistency between the policy intent of the tax credit and the legislative treatment of assets used in the petroleum and mineral mining industries. The upfront cost of capital assets should, in most cases, be ineligible for the credit. These assets come with high associated costs that threaten the sustainability of the regime, but they also generally have a long lifetime and commercial uses beyond R&D. The objective of the credit is to incentivise R&D expenditure, not to subsidise high-cost capital assets that the claimant can then use in their commercial activities. Aside from industry-specific activity exclusions in Schedule 21, this is largely addressed by excluding expenditure on most tangible depreciable assets. However, officials do not consider that the present legislation adequately gives effect to this intent when it comes to the petroleum or mineral mining industries. The existing exclusions are tied to depreciable property, but the tax rules affecting the petroleum and mineral mining industries do not use the depreciation rules. Instead, they have separate treatments for their assets in part D of the Income Tax Act, and are thus not technically depreciable. While an activity exclusion exists for some phases of the mining lifecycle, assets used in the development phase (essentially the production phase of mining) are not caught by the existing exclusions, and the upfront cost of these assets may be claimable for the credit. This 169 is counter to the policy intent and the intended treatment of the upfront cost of capital assets within the regime. It could lead to unintended and inequitable outcomes between different sectors within the regime and could reduce the sustainability of the regime. Amendments to remove this risk and bring the treatment of mining assets closer to the treatment of other assets are therefore necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Further clarity needed on amendment’s scope Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) It needs to be made clear that the exclusion only targets development activity itself, and R&D related to the development activity may still be eligible. Comment Officials agree that it is important that taxpayers have clarity around the intended effect of the amendment. Following enactment of the Bill, guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin and Inland Revenue’s official guidance material. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendment may impact New Zealand’s emissions targets Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The industries affected by this change need R&D investment to help New Zealand move towards its goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050. Making this exclusion casts doubt for the industry as to what support will actually be available to make the transition. Comment The intent of the proposed amendment is not to cut out expenditure on R&D to do with mining development, but only expenditure on development activities themselves. If a mining business is performing R&D that will assist its transition to carbon-neutral status, it will still be able to claim a credit for this R&D (provided it meets the legislative criteria). 170 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendment should be aligned with existing tax treatment Submission (Matter raised by officials) a) The exclusion on petroleum and mining development should be redrafted to exclude development as eligible expenditure rather than as an eligible activity, using language which aligns with the petroleum and mining tax regimes that already exist in the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). This should be achieved by refocussing the exclusion to exclude expenditure or loss by a “petroleum miner” or “mineral miner” (as defined in section YA 1 of the Act). b) The new exclusion should include exceptions for labour costs that contribute to core R&D and for prototypes (parallel to the treatment of tangible depreciable property). c) The new exclusion should also include miners of “minerals” (as defined in section YA 1 of the Act) and geothermal energy. d) As its intent will be covered by the new exclusion, clause 5 of schedule 21 parts A and B of the Act (which excludes “prospecting for, exploring for, or drilling for, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy”) should be repealed. Comment Clause 59 seeks to exclude mining development activities in relation to minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy from the tax credit as activities. This would prevent a taxpayer from seeking approval for such activities, meaning they also cannot claim a credit for any expenditure associated with the activities. The purpose of this exclusion is to ensure that the upfront costs of assets used in the mining industry, which are not covered by the depreciation rules and which are therefore not currently covered by the expenditure exclusions in the R&D tax credit regime, are not inappropriately eligible for the credit. Assets used in petroleum and mineral mining have their own tax regimes in the Act. These regimes centre on the terms “petroleum miner” and “mineral miner,” as defined in the Act. These terms are linked to a number of expenditure-related defined terms, such as “mining development expenditure” and “petroleum development expenditure,” which provide for the alternative tax treatment of assets created and used by miners when undertaking mining activities. Anchoring the amendment to these pre-existing definitions by refocussing the exclusion on petroleum and mineral miners would provide further certainty for taxpayers around what is covered by this exclusion. As these pre-existing definitions centre on expenditure, it is conceptually simpler to align the proposed exclusion with these definitions by targeting it towards expenditure rather than activities. Excluding expenditure incurred by a miner is also more targeted than excluding mining development as an activity, as currently proposed in the Bill. Any R&D activities performed by a business involved in mining that meet the other legislative requirements could potentially be claimed for the credit, so long as it is not performed by the business in their 171 capacity as a miner. This is more in line with the policy intent, which is to exclude the cost of assets used in the mining industries from the tax credit while still allowing a credit for R&D performed in these industries (see Issue: Changes not necessary for rationale). The clause should be redrafted as an expenditure exclusion rather than an activity exclusion, with wording that incorporates the petroleum miner and mineral miner definitions for consistency within the Act. As its intent and function would be similar to existing exclusions on tangible depreciable property, the new expenditure exclusion should contain similar exceptions for labour costs that contribute to core R&D and for prototypes only used in R&D (see Tangible depreciable property expenditure exclusion, Issue: Scope of amendment should be expanded and Issue: Prototype exemption amendment for more information on these exceptions). This will bring the treatment of expenditure on assets in the affected industries fully into line with the treatment of expenditure on depreciable tangible property in other industries. However, the term “mineral miner” and the terms associated with it in the Act (for example, “mining prospecting expenditure,” “mining exploration expenditure”) refer only to “listed industrial minerals,” rather than minerals in the broader sense. The definition of “listed industrial minerals” in the Act does not cover some minerals intended to be covered by the exclusion, such as coal. Geothermal energy, which is also covered by the present exclusion, would not be covered. To achieve the policy intent, the new clause should also deem miners of “minerals” (as defined in the Act) and geothermal energy to be “miners”. The mining regimes in the Act include terminology that covers the intent of clause 5 of schedule 21 parts A and B (which excludes “prospecting for, exploring for, or drilling for, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy”). If the amendment proceeds in the form proposed by officials, this clause should be removed. Recommendation a) That the submission be accepted. b) That the submission be accepted. c) That the submission be accepted. d) That the submission be accepted. 172 TANGIBLE DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY EXPENDITURE EXCLUSION (Clause 60(2)) Issue: Support the amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) We support the proposed amendment to include expenditure on employees performing core R&D activity that contributes to the cost of an item of tangible depreciable property as eligible expenditure for the tax credit. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Scope of amendment should be expanded Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) a) While we support the amendment, we believe its scope needs to be expanded. External labour costs that are capitalised should also be eligible for the regime. R&D work lends itself to having more outsourced labour costs, particularly in asset-heavy industries, and excluding these costs from the regime disadvantages these industries. The proposal as drafted creates a bias against using contractor labour and will lead to arbitrary outcomes. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) b) Additionally, we do not agree with restricting the amendment to only include capitalised expenditure on core R&D activities. Allowing only capitalised core R&D costs while excluding capitalised supporting R&D costs will create arbitrary outcomes. The amendment should include capitalised labour expenditure on both core and supporting activities. (EY, KPMG) c) To achieve the above proposals, we suggest the amendment be redrafted as follows: “Expenditure or loss, other than for amounts for employees or services provided by contractors in relation to research and development activities, to the extent to which...” (KPMG) Comment a) The amendment as proposed only allows capitalised expenditure on employees performing core R&D activity to be claimed for the credit. Officials acknowledge that excluding contracted labour costs may disadvantage asset-heavy industries. The 173 original intent behind only allowing employee expenditure was a concern about having less visibility over contracted expenditure, which might allow other costs unrelated to labour included in contractors’ invoices to be claimed for the credit. However, officials have talked to industry experts (advisors and businesses) about this issue, and agree that these risks can be addressed through disclosure requirements (for example, claimants requiring that their contractors separate out their labour costs from other costs when submitting invoices in order to provide clear records for their tax incentive claim). Officials therefore accept that contracted labour costs should be included, and will recommend an amendment to the legislation on this basis. b) Officials do not accept that labour on supporting R&D activities should also be eligible. Restricting the amendment to labour costs that directly contribute to core R&D activities (that is, activities that resolve scientific or technological uncertainty) allows genuine R&D that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property to be recognised by the regime, while minimising fiscal risks associated with the high construction cost of these assets. Allowing all labour on an asset that involves R&D to be claimed brings in a significant amount of these costs and may reduce the integrity of the regime. c) Officials believe the proposed wording to incorporate contractor costs (“services provided by contractors”) is too broad and may allow costs beyond labour expenditure (such as materials provided by contractors) into the regime, contrary to the policy intent. This is covered in (a) above. Officials will recommend an amendment to the legislation that ensures clarity and maintains the policy intent. Recommendation a) That the submission be accepted. b) That the submission be declined. c) That the submission be declined. Issue: Prototype exemption amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) a) We agree with the prototype exemption amendment, as it confirms what was initially intended when the law was enacted. (KPMG) b) We agree with the intent of the prototype exemption. Expenditure on prototypes should be eligible for the credit. However, one of the proposed requirements for the prototype exemption (that the property never be intended for any purpose other than R&D) seems like a very high test to meet. It is not in line with the policy intent of the R&D tax credit regime to exclude legitimate R&D expenditure based on a (potential) later use of the property when the initial activity qualified. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The policy intent of the exclusion on expenditure that contributes to the cost of tangible depreciable property is to keep the cost of large capital assets out of the regime (see Mining 174 development activity exclusion, Issue: Changes not necessary for rationale). An exemption exists for expenditure that contributes to an asset that is solely used in R&D. The intent of this is to allow the credit for assets solely used for R&D throughout their lifetime (that is, prototypes). As these assets would only be used for R&D and have no subsequent commercial use, the cost of producing them is plainly R&D expenditure and falls within the intent of the credit. The amendment in the Bill clarifies this intent, as the current wording of the prototype exemption could be read as only requiring that the asset be used solely for R&D during the relevant income year, but not for any subsequent years. As the exemption allows an applicant to claim the incentive on the entire upfront cost of such an asset, officials believe it is appropriate that the threshold for accessing it be correspondingly high. Recommendation a) That the submission be noted. b) That the submission be declined. 175 OTHER EXPENDITURE EXCLUSIONS (Clause 60) Issue: Support the amendments Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Unclear why amendments are required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The stated intent of clauses 13B, 20B, and 20C (which exclude expenditure on corporate governance costs, decommissioning, and remediating land) is to clarify areas already excluded under current legislation. If these areas are already excluded, it’s unclear why the amendments are needed. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We do not consider clauses 20B and 20C necessary. (Deloitte) Comment The purpose of clauses 13B, 20B, and 20C is to clarify that certain types of expenditure are ineligible for the credit for the avoidance of doubt. Officials believe it is arguable that the areas covered by these clauses are already excluded from the credit, as was the original policy intent. However, experience from the pilot suggested that some taxpayers were unsure about whether corporate governance costs were eligible or not, while clauses 20B and 20C are intended as a response to recent overseas experience that suggests legislation similar to our own does not effectively keep out these costs. As none of these costs are intended to be eligible, the proposals make it clear for the avoidance of doubt that a taxpayer cannot claim them, ensuring the integrity of the regime and improving certainty for applicants. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 176 Issue: Better fit as activity exclusions Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) New clauses 13B, 20B, and 20C may fit better as activity exclusions, rather than expenditure exclusions. Comment The intention of the proposed clauses is to provide more certainty about areas meant to be ineligible under the existing policy intent. As the pre-existing definitions of remediation and decommissioning in the Income Tax Act 2007 are predicated on expenditure, rather than activity as such, officials consider that aligning the exclusions with these existing definitions by using the expenditure schedule is conceptually simpler and provides more certainty for taxpayers. While corporate governance could be excluded as an activity rather than as expenditure, officials believe the intent of the exclusion is better served as an expenditure exclusion. Officials do not consider that corporate governance costs should be eligible as they would have been incurred regardless of whether the R&D took place. Excluding these costs as an activity would have left it ambiguous as to whether they could be claimed as overhead expenditure on an eligible activity, contrary to the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Further clarity needed Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The concepts of “decommissioning” and “remediating land” are very broad. Further clarity is required on what this relates to, as some legitimate R&D exists in this space. If new clauses 20B and 20C proceed, it’s important that the intention stated in the commentary (that R&D on decommissioning and/or remediating land should still be eligible) be reflected in guidance. (Deloitte) Comment Officials agree with the submitters. More clarity on the intended meaning of the exclusions will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin and Inland Revenue’s official guidance material. The intention that R&D in these areas remain eligible will be preserved. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 177 ADMINISTRATION (Clauses 76, 79) Issue: Criteria and methodologies application due date change Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) Support the amendment to bring the due date for applying for criteria and methodologies (CAM) approval to six months before the end of the first income year to which the approval relates. Comment The proposal amends the due date for applying for CAM approvals to six months before the end of the first income year to which a CAM approval relates (CAM approvals can be obtained for up to three years). The earlier due date ensures businesses have the correct R&D processes and methodologies in place during the relevant income year and reduces the need to retrospectively amend their processes to ensure their claims are correct. In addition, an earlier due date means businesses have more time to seek general approval should their CAM approval application be declined or only cover part of their R&D. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Important that responses are timely Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) It is important that responses to CAM approval applications are provided in a timely manner. Many of our members will need this to satisfy their auditors on their tax positions. Comment Officials agree that it is important that applications be completed in a timely manner. CAM approval applications are likely to take longer than general approval applications, as they involve the taxpayer and the Commissioner agreeing on a bespoke set of criteria and methodologies which the taxpayer will use to determine the eligibility of their R&D activities and expenditure. Requiring the application to be submitted earlier will allow the taxpayer and the Commissioner to agree on these criteria sooner, so that tax positions can be taken in the annual and supplementary returns with much greater confidence. This should also assist in any future audit process. 178 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Discretion for companies with balance date changes Submission (EY) The amendment should allow for adjusted timeframes for a taxpayer who has a transitional tax year due to a change in their balance date. The Commissioner could be given a discretion to allow a different timeframe for these taxpayers on an application basis. Comment The intent of this amendment is defeated if a taxpayer becomes unable to apply for CAM approval in a timely manner due to their balance date being brought forward. In such cases, officials believe it is appropriate that the Commissioner have discretion to allow a different timeframe for the taxpayer to submit their application. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Example should be provided in the legislation Submission (EY) It is not clear which income year is being referred to in the CAM due date amendment as currently drafted. An example should be included in the legislation to help clarify this for taxpayers. Comment Officials agree that further clarification would be useful for taxpayers. However, the R&D tax credit already has comprehensive guidance material for taxpayers seeking to understand how the regime operates in practice. Officials believe that the appropriate place for an example of how the proposed change will work is in the official guidance material , rather than the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 179 Issue: Timeframe for completing disputes process Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) We support the amendment around the timeframe for completing the disputes process. Comment The legislation currently requires a section 113 request to increase an R&D tax credit claim to be initiated and processed within a year of the relevant taxpayer’s income tax return due date. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is simply that the person must initiate the disputes process within that timeframe. The proposed amendment would remove the requirement that the request be fully processed within that timeframe, while still requiring the request to be initiated within a year of the relevant taxpayer’s income tax return due date. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 180 OTHER R&D SUBMISSIONS (Clause 76) Issue: Drafting corrections Submission (EY, matter raised by officials) a) There is a drafting error in clause 76 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which states that section 68CC(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 currently reads “before the end of the first income year.” However, the legislation actually reads “after the end of the first income year.” b) There is a drafting error in section 68CC(2)(iv) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section is intended to require that a person applying for criteria and methodologies approval must submit an R&D certificate to the Commissioner with their R&D supplementary return. However, the words “the person” are missing from the section, making 68CC(2)(iv) effectively meaningless. Comment Officials agree that these should be corrected. Recommendation a) That the submission be accepted. b) That the submission be accepted. Issue: Growth Grant exclusion – association test should be removed Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) a) The association test should be removed from the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant exclusion rules. We do not support the outcome that shareholders in a Growth Grant recipient or two or more companies who share a common 50% shareholder(s) will be ineligible for the credit. The rule makes it difficult for Growth Grant recipients to obtain capital needed to expand. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) b) There are already rules in the R&D tax credit regime that prevent a person from “double-dipping” on Government R&D funding. These rules make the association test unnecessary. (Deloitte) Comment The policy intent is that a person can only claim either the credit or the Growth Grant, because the credit is intended to replace the Growth Grant regime. The association test was 181 introduced at the Select Committee stage of the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 to prevent Growth Grant recipients from artificially structuring their businesses so that they could claim both the credit and the Growth Grant at the same time. During the Select Committee phase of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020, the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Deloitte raised an essentially identical submission to this one. Officials’ response at the time was that the association rule is necessary to prevent businesses deliberately structuring themselves so that they can claim both the credit and the Growth Grant. Officials’ position on this matter is unchanged. The association rule is still vital for preventing artificial restructuring in order to claim both the credit and the Growth Grant; no other part of the legislation fulfils a similar purpose. At the time, as the association test was not one of the measures contained in the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill as introduced, officials proposed a grandfathering approach. This would allow claims submitted before the report-back date by the Select Committee to use the rules without the association test, while those submitted after that date would have to use it. This approach, and the taxpayers’ suggestion that the test be removed altogether, were both rejected by Select Committee on the grounds that a business can decide to return its Growth Grant, including its subsidiaries’ Growth Grants, if it wishes to be eligible for the credit. The intent is that a business must choose between the Growth Grant and the credit. The provisions in the legislation that prevent taxpayers from claiming multiple forms of government R&D funding for the same expenditure are more limited in scope and would not prevent taxpayers from claiming the credit for some R&D activities and the Growth Grant for others. If the association test were to be removed, nothing would prevent a company from structuring itself to claim both the Growth Grant and the credit at once, contrary to the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Partnerships and receiving the credit Submission (KPMG) We recommend an amendment to ensure the tax credit is received by a limited partnership or general partnership (rather than by the partners). This will ensure the R&D tax credit is available for the partnership to use in its R&D, rather than being diverted to the partners, and will also reduce the risk of abuse, as the credit will be claimed in a single return rather than across multiple partners’ returns. Additionally, administering the pass-through of the credit from the partnership to its partners is administratively cumbersome. This is important as limited partnerships are a common vehicle for start-up R&D. 182 Comment Currently, while certain entity eligibility requirements can be met collectively by a partnership, most eligibility and filing requirements must be met by the individual members of the partnership. This includes filing applications for pre-approval and submitting returns to claim the credit. In the cases of partnerships with a high number of members, this may be administratively onerous. However, officials do not consider that this justifies allowing partnerships to claim the credit at the partnership level. Requiring members of a partnership to claim at the individual level is an integrity measure that prevents ineligible entities (such as non-resident partners) or partners who are not eligible for refunds in their own right from claiming refundable credits. Allowing refunds to be claimed at the partnership level would remove this oversight and create an integrity risk. Officials believe, however, that work could be done to streamline the pre-approval application process for partnerships. Allowing partnerships to submit a joint pre-approval application poses far fewer integrity risks than partnership-level refundability and would significantly reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers conducting R&D through a partnership. Officials will consider this further. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Meaning of “acquire” in R&D expenditure exclusions Submission (Matter raised by officials) A remedial amendment should be made to clause 2 of schedule 21B part B of the Income Tax Act 2007, clarifying that “acquiring depreciable property,” in relation to clause 2, does not include making depreciable property. Comment Schedule 21B part B of the Income Tax Act 2007 lists types of expenditure that are ineligible for the tax credit. Clause 2 renders “expenditure or loss incurred in acquiring depreciable property” ineligible. The intent of clause 2 is to exclude expenditure or loss incurred on obtaining depreciable property through any method other than making the property. However, “acquire” is defined in subpart YA 1, in the context of depreciable property, to include “make”. Clause 2 thus has a much greater reach than intended, effectively cutting all expenditure on depreciable property out of the regime. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is that some expenditure incurred on making depreciable property should be eligible (provided it is not covered by any other exclusion in schedule 21B part B), and should be corrected. 183 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Scope of grant-related expenditure exclusion should be narrowed Submission (Matter raised by officials) A remedial amendment should be made to clause 21 of schedule 21B part B of the Income Tax Act 2007, allowing R&D expenditure not supported through other government funding sources to be claimed for the credit. Comment Schedule 21B part B of the Income Tax Act 2007 lists types of expenditure that are ineligible for the tax credit. Clause 21 renders “expenditure or loss that is a precondition to, subject to the terms of, required by, or otherwise related to a grant made by the Crown or a local authority” ineligible, except where the expenditure relates to loans under the R&D loan scheme. The intent of this exclusion is to prevent a person from claiming multiple forms of government R&D funding for the same expenditure. However, officials have become aware of circumstances where the exclusion means that expenditure can become ineligible where the R&D performer receives some government funding, such as a Callaghan Innovation Project Grant, even if the expenditure in question is not itself supported through that funding. A person claiming a Project Grant provides an estimate of the total project expenditure to Callaghan Innovation, and can receive up to 40% of that estimate as a grant (with the remaining 60% being required co-funding). Should the actual expenditure on the project exceed this estimate, any cost overruns are not eligible for further Grant funding. However, they are also not eligible for support through the tax incentive under the exclusion as currently written; the Grant funding agreement requires the person to complete their project, and as the cost overrun is technically required for the completion of the project, it is covered by the funding agreement (and therefore excluded by clause 21). This outcome is contrary to the broader policy intent of the tax incentive, which is to incentivise and support businesses to increase their expenditure on R&D. Officials consider that the exclusion should be clarified to allow genuine R&D expenditure that is not being supported through other government funding to be eligible for the credit. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 184 HYBRID RULES REMEDIALS A submitter raised a number of issues in relation to the hybrid and branch mismatch rules in the Income Tax Act 2007, which do not relate to any specific amendments currently included in the Bill. These submissions are summarised below, alongside officials’ recommendations on them. Issue: Non-resident group members should be able to group surplus assessable income Submission (PwC) The submitter proposes that the New Zealand residency requirement in section FH 12(10) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be removed. As a result of this requirement, currently only New Zealand-resident companies are able to group their surplus assessable income (SAI), non-resident companies paying tax in New Zealand are not. As a consequence of this limitation, the SAI of a non-resident company may go unused, while another non-resident in the same group is denied New Zealand deductions (where the non-resident company’s SAI could have otherwise been used to offset the denied deductions). This could result in over- taxation of the group as a whole. Comment The policy intent of the SAI grouping mechanism in section FH 12(10) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is to ensure that the right economic outcome is reached for the group as a whole (that is, if one group company has more SAI than it can use, it can make its SAI available to another wholly owned group member who has a hybrid or branch mismatch for which a deduction would otherwise be denied). Officials agree that the current limitation, which prevents non-resident companies paying tax in New Zealand (such as a non-resident company with a New Zealand branch) from grouping SAI with other group members, is inconsistent with the policy intent of this section. Officials recommend that section FH 12(10) be amended to remove the requirement that companies eligible to group SAI must be resident in New Zealand. The amendment is a taxpayer-friendly measure that ensures the provision does not result in over-taxation for a corporate group. Although officials are not aware of the number of taxpayers affected by the amendment, it is an issue raised by a tax adviser based on a real- life example faced by at least one of their clients. To ensure the provision applies appropriately, the amendment should be retrospective to the application date of the provision. That is, it should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Taxpayers who have taken a tax position under the existing law would, if relevant, be able to request the Commissioner amend the assessment in order to take advantage of the recommended change. The rationale above for retrospective law change is equally applicable to the other recommended changes to the hybrid and branch mismatch rules below. 185 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Payments made within a consolidated group should be included in SAI calculation Submission (PwC) The submitter proposes that section FH 12(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended so that excluded payments between members of a New Zealand consolidated group that are taxable to a non-resident group parent are included in the calculation of SAI. Currently, the SAI calculation formula includes an exempt item, which covers exempt dividends between two New Zealand members of a 100% commonly owned group that are taxable to a foreign owner. The inclusion of these dividends in the formula is to reflect that the hybrid nature of an entity may cause a payment to be taxable in another jurisdiction, with no corresponding deduction for the payer in New Zealand. This same hybridity issue can arise in relation to payments made within a New Zealand consolidated group. Such a payment will be excluded income in New Zealand and no deduction will be permitted for the payer. However, if the payee is fiscally transparent in another country, income may be recognised in that country in relation to the consolidated group transaction. Currently, such a payment would not be captured in the SAI calculation formula, despite the same income potentially being subject to tax in two jurisdictions: first in New Zealand to the consolidated group on recipient of a third-party payment, and second in the parent jurisdiction, as a regarded transaction between New Zealand companies in the same consolidated group. Comment Officials recommended that the SAI, calculation formula be amended to include payments made within a New Zealand consolidated group, where certain conditions are satisfied. To be included as SAI officials consider that a payment would need to meet the following conditions: • is both excluded income and non-deductible in New Zealand, due to being paid between consolidated group members (that would have been assessable income in New Zealand in the absence of consolidation), and • is taxable and non-deductible in the jurisdiction of a non-resident group parent of the consolidated group. For the same reasons as those discussed above (in relation to Issue: Non-resident group members should be able to group surplus assessable income), officials recommend the amendment be retrospective to the application date of section FH 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. That is, it should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. 186 To ensure that this change operates as intended, officials also recommend that amendments be made to address remedial issues in section CX 60 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (Section CX 60(1) currently contains an incorrect cross-reference to section FM 8(3), and it is not necessary to have both section CX 60(1B) and section CX 60(2), as both provisions are expressing the same concept.) Section CX 60 is intended to have the effect of treating payments made between companies in consolidated groups as excluded income, so this section should be referenced as part of the amendment to the SAI calculation formula to achieve the outcome outlined above. Officials recommend the amendments apply for the 2019–20 and later income years, this being the application date for the previous amendments to section CX 60, which resulted in the current errors. It is not anticipated that many taxpayers will be impacted by this change, nor that it will have a fiscal impact. Taxpayers who have relied on the current law are not expected to be advantaged or disadvantaged as a result of correcting the current legislative errors. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Hybrid financial instrument rule should not apply to income fully taxed in New Zealand Submission (PwC) The submitter considers that the hybrid financial instrument rule (section FH 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007) should be amended, so that it does not apply where any country or territory (including New Zealand) recognises the relevant payment as giving rise to ordinary income (that is, income taxed at the recipient’s full applicable tax rate). As currently drafted, section FH 3 does not apply where a country or territory outside New Zealand recognises the income. However, the section could still apply to deny a deduction where New Zealand taxes a payment received by the payee at the full applicable tax rate. Comment As there is no deduction/no-inclusion hybrid mismatch if a payment is taxed as ordinary income of the payee in New Zealand, this is not a situation that should be captured by the hybrid rules. Therefore, officials recommend section FH 3 be amended so that the section does not apply to a payment taxed at a payee’s full applicable rate in any country or territory, including New Zealand. For the same reasons as those discussed above (in relation to Issue: Non-resident group members should be able to group surplus assessable income), officials recommend the amendment be retrospective to the application date of the provision. That is, it should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. 187 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transfer pricing deemed arm’s length amount – exception should be extended to deductions denied under the hybrid rules Submission (PwC) The submitter proposes that the exception to the deemed arm’s length amount rule in section GC 8(2) – which currently applies where an amount would be deductible but for the application of the thin capitalisation rules – should be extended to cover deductions denied under the hybrid rules. The submitter notes that, as section GC 8(2) currently does not take into account the hybrid rules, section GC 8 would deem a non-resident payee to have transfer pricing taxable income in New Zealand in relation to an interest free loan where the payer would be denied a deduction for any interest that was paid under the hybrid rules. Comment Where inadequate consideration is received under a transfer pricing arrangement, section GC 8(1) deems an arm’s length amount to have been received by the payee for income and withholding tax purposes. Section GC 8(2) contains an exception to this rule, where the general rule in section GC 8(1) will not apply and the below arm’s length consideration will stand (non-resident’s exemption: deduction to the payer). Section GC 8(2)(b) currently does not account for the hybrid rules, meaning section GC 8(1) could deem a taxpayer to have income taxable in New Zealand under the transfer pricing rules, in circumstances where the hybrid rules could then deny or limit deductions for expenses arising in relation to that income. This is an issue for interest-free loans, where if a deemed arm’s length amount of interest were to be substituted under section GC 8(1), then the hybrid rules could apply to deny a deduction for the deemed amount (that is, non-resident withholding tax would be payable on a deemed interest payment, with the payment not being deductible to the payer). This is an unintended outcome. In relation to interest-bearing loans, section GC 8(2) also currently does not take into account disallowances under the hybrid rules where, from a policy perspective, the focus of the rule is on deferring – not permanently denying – a deduction, as is the case under sections FH 5, FH 8 and FH 9 (in these cases, the interest may still be deductible in future if there is sufficient “surplus assessable income”). As a deduction may become available for the interest payment in these instances, the original policy rationale for section GC 8(2) outlined above would apply and section GC 8(1) should not apply. For the same reasons as those discussed above (in relation to Issue: Non-resident group members should be able to group surplus assessable income), officials recommend the amendments be retrospective to the general application date for the hybrid rules. That is, they should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. 188 Officials recommend the above amendments. Officials have also identified an error in section GC 8(2)(b) in the reference to deductions being denied under “subpart FE (Interest apportionment on thin capitalisation)”. The thin capitalisation rules do not deny deductions but rather deem additional income. It is likely that this reference was missed when the thin capitalisation regime moved from a deduction denial mechanism to the current income deeming method. Officials recommend this omission be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reverse hybrid rule should be clarified in how it applies to hybrid entities and branches Submission (PwC) The submitter considers that, under section FH 7, deductions may be denied to hybrid entities in circumstances where the relevant income is received, but is not taxable due to the application of exemptions (and not the non-recognition of income) in the recipient jurisdiction. The intended scope of this provision in Inland Revenue’s Special Report (page 41) on the hybrid and branch mismatch rules provides that the appropriate application of the rules depends on whether a branch or hybrid entity is involved in the transaction. Comment Section FH 7 is intended to deny a deduction for a payment in two separate situations: • where the payment is not taxable because of a branch mismatch • where the payment is not taxable because it is made to a reverse hybrid. A payment will be non-taxable because of a branch mismatch if paragraphs (a), (b)(i), (c), (d) and (e)(i) are met. A payment will be non-taxable because it is made to a reverse hybrid if paragraphs (a), (b)(ii), (c), (d) and (e)(ii) are met. There are three issues with the section. • As drafted, the section can apply if paragraphs (a), (b)(i), (c), (d) and (e)(ii) are met, or if paragraphs (a), (b)(ii), (c), (d) and (e)(i) are met. This was not intended. • With respect to (b)(ii), it should only apply if the amount is treated under the law of the payee country as being income of a person who is in the same control group as the payer and is not the payee. If the income is income of the payee, the payment will not be to a reverse hybrid. However, the subparagraph currently could apply if the income is income of the payee. 189 • Also with respect to paragraph (b)(ii), it should be met if: (a), the person treated as deriving the income under the law of the payee country is a person in the payer’s control group who is not the payee; or (b), the arrangement is a structured arrangement (regardless of whether or not that last mentioned person is in the same control group as the payer). For the same reasons as those discussed above (in relation to Issue: Non-resident group members should be able to group surplus assessable income), officials recommend the amendments be retrospective to the application date of the provision. That is, they should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. Officials recommend the above amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The disregarded payments rule should not apply where the end investor is exempt from tax Submission (PwC) The submission proposes that there is a risk that section FH 5 could deny deductions where the income would not be subject to tax in the hands of the recipient due to jurisdiction- specific tax exemptions (for example, due to the source of income or an exemption for pension funds). The hybrid rules should only operate to deny deductions for payments that are not subject to tax as a result of a hybrid mismatch. The rules should not deny deductions where the hybridity of an entity has no overall impact on the tax outcome of the payment (that is, where the income is not taxable due to specific legislation in the recipient jurisdiction). Comment Officials understand that the issue raised by the submitters relates to a specific structure that involves an intermediary foreign entity between the ultimate investor and the New Zealand payer. In this scenario, the investor elects to treat the intermediary entity as “disregarded” for tax purposes in the payee jurisdiction, meaning that, for tax purposes, the intermediary is not treated as a separate person from the investor. Officials understand the technical issue raised, but consider that the issue could be resolved by removing the intermediary entity from the particular structure, or inserting an entity that New Zealand would not see as fiscally transparent for tax purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 190 Issue: Definition of “hybrid mismatch” should clarify the payee Submission (PwC) The definition of hybrid mismatch in section FH 15(a)(ii) should be amended to clarify that the relevant amount need only be recognised by a person or entity as ordinary income (and not a person or entity “in the payee jurisdiction”). Comment As the provision is currently drafted, a payment will fall outside the definition of hybrid mismatch if the relevant amount is recognised as ordinary income of a person or other entity in the payee jurisdiction. It is possible that this definition could cause a hybrid mismatch to arise for payments that are recognised as ordinary income, but are attributable to branches. Therefore, the definition of hybrid mismatch may be met even if the payment is subject to tax as ordinary income in the branch jurisdiction, because it will not be subject to tax in the payee jurisdiction. However, further work on this matter requires prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Reverse hybrid rule should only apply where a mismatch in tax outcome arises due to differences in tax treatment of relevant entities Submission (PwC) The submission suggests that section FH 7 should be amended so that it only captures branch mismatches (where relevant), and not mismatches that happen to involve a branch. The risk identified is that the provision might apply to deny deductions in relation to structures that involve a branch and produce mismatched tax outcomes, despite those outcomes not arising from a branch mismatch. For example, the provision may apply due to the tax regime of the branch jurisdiction (in which case there should be no hybrid mismatch), or due to the payer being disregarded in the branch jurisdiction (in which case section FH 5 should apply). From a policy perspective, it is suggested that section FH 7 should be limited to situations where the mismatch arises due to differences in: (a) the characterisation of the branch (disregarded branch structure), or (b) the attribution of profits to the branch (diverted branch payments), and not merely because a structure includes a branch. Further work on this matter requires prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 191 Issue: Domestic transactions should not be denied by the imported hybrid mismatch rule Submission (PwC) The submitter has raised an issue that may arise where both a New Zealand resident company and a non-resident company (through a New Zealand deducting branch) claim New Zealand deductions in relation to a payment that funds a mismatch higher in the global chain. In this situation, it is considered that section FH 11 could apply to deny the New Zealand deductions from both the New Zealand resident company and the New Zealand-deducting branch of the non-resident company. Only one of these deductions should be denied. It would be preferable to have legislative certainty that only one deduction will be disallowed. It is suggested that the deduction denial in this scenario should be for the deduction claimed by the non-resident company with the New Zealand-deducting branch. Officials expect that at an operational level, only one deduction would be allowed. Further work on this matter requires prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. 192 BRINGING KIWISAVER EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THE PENALTIES, RECOVER AND USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST REGIMES (Clauses 67(4), 68, 80 and 83) Issue: General support for reform Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the reform. The amendment would bring voluntary employer contributions within the same penalty and debt collections rules as compulsory contributions. This is appropriate. Comment Clause 67 in the Bill is intended to ensure that compulsory and voluntary employer KiwiSaver contributions are treated consistently under the penalties, recoveries and Use-of- Money-Interest (UOMI) regimes. In March 2019, Cabinet agreed that Inland Revenue would pay an amount of employer contribution to a KiwiSaver scheme in advance of the contribution being received by Inland Revenue. This payment would be based on the employer information filed with Inland Revenue which stated that an employer contribution had been made. This meant that the Crown would provide a limited guarantee to recipients of compulsory and voluntary KiwiSaver employer contributions. However, the Crown’s provision of a limited guarantee exposes it to fiscal risk. While, in the case of compulsory employer KiwiSaver contributions, this risk is mitigated by the application of the penalties and recoveries regimes, these regimes do not currently apply to voluntary employer contributions. Additionally, the UOMI regime currently does not apply to either category of employer contribution (that is, compulsory or voluntary). It is not intended that the KiwiSaver funds which are received by an employee’s scheme provider be used to satisfy a tax obligation owed by the employee to the Commissioner. The intention of the amendments is to allow the Commissioner to ensure that employers meet their obligations to pay contributions which the Crown has guaranteed. Additionally, under section 73 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, once the Commissioner has received employment income information relating to an employee or employer KiwiSaver contribution, they must enter this amount into the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account. This amount must then be transferred to the KiwiSaver member’s scheme provider. This means the Commissioner does not have the ability to apply KiwiSaver contributions to another purpose (for example, an individual taxpayer’s tax liability). It was not considered necessary to consult the Ministry of Justice on this item as it is remedial in nature. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 193 CONFIRMING HOUSING NEW ZEALAND BUILD LIMITED SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX (Clause 63) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) That the remedial proposal to confirm that Housing New Zealand Build Limited is subject to income tax is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 194 CHANGING THE DUE DATE FOR LOCKED-IN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITIES (Clauses 70, 71, 72 and 75) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposals to bring forward the date of reporting to the Commissioner by a portfolio investment entity (PIE) that is a superannuation fund or retirement saving scheme, which will align reporting by locked-in and non locked-in funds. Recommendation That the submission be noted. (Clauses 70, 71, 72 and 75) Issue: Discretion when applying late filing penalties on income information filed by locked-in portfolio investment entities Submission (Deloitte) The legislation proposes bringing forward the filing date by which multi-rate PIEs with locked-in funds are required to file detailed income information for their investors to 15 May. This relates to multi-rate PIEs that are a superannuation fund or retirement saving scheme. Some PIEs may not be able to meet the proposed amended date, and in these situations a longer time period may be needed. Appropriate discretion must be applied to late filing penalties in these situations. Comment The filing date was brought forward from 30 June to 15 May for locked-in PIE funds to align information reporting on investors with non-locked-in PIE funds. This is to allow Inland Revenue to undertake the PIE end-of-year square-up process as part of the auto- calculation process for individual income tax assessments. In further correspondence, the submitter noted that there are alternatives available, such as allocating PIE income and deductions. Officials note that late filing penalties may be waived if there is reasonable cause to do so. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 195 APPLICATION OF THE MINORS’ INCOME TAX EXEMPTION TO MINOR BENEFICIARY INCOME (Clause 12) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the amendment. Comment Section CW 55BB provides school children with an income tax exemption on up to $2,340 of income. This is a compliance cost measure preventing them from having to a file a return. The exemption is not intended to apply where there is someone in a position to pay tax on behalf of the child – for example, it does not apply where tax has been withheld at source such as on investment income or salary and wages. Beneficiary income up to $1,000 paid to a minor is taxed at the beneficiary’s tax rate. Under current law, this $1,000 distribution would be eligible to be exempt under CW 55BB. This is contrary to the policy intent as the trustee is in a position to pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary. The proposed amendment therefore provides that income derived by a minor beneficiary does not qualify for the income tax exemption in section CW 55BB, and is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal rate. This amendment is retrospective to 29 May 2012 (the date the minors’ income tax exemption was introduced), with a savings provision for people who took a tax position relying on the current law in a return filed before the Bill was introduced into Parliament. The savings provision allows taxpayers who filed a return before the Bill was introduced into Parliament to rely on the current law. It is limited to the date the Bill was introduced because from that point taxpayers will be aware of an impending amendment. The provision only applies to those who have already filed a return, in order to prevent taxpayers from amending a previous return and getting a windfall gain. The amendment will prevent minors from reopening returns and claiming an exemption on the up to $1,000 of beneficiary income already allocated, as well as preventing them from claiming the $1,000 exemption going forward. This is expected to affect approximately 9,000 minor beneficiaries – 2,675 beneficiaries who paid tax and would be prevented from reopening a return, and 6,258 who previously did not pay tax on distributions received but who would be required to do so going ward. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 196 NOMINEE TREATMENT FOR TRUSTEE OF EXEMPT EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME (ESS) (Clauses 2(1) and 10) Issue: Support for amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the clarification that a trustee of an exempt employee share scheme can be treated as a nominee of a company providing the scheme. We also support the amendment applying from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Transitional effects of section CE 6 (trusts are nominees) Submission (Russell McVeagh) The consequences of the existing section CE 6 are uncertain in various respects, and may result in unexpected tax liabilities. a) There is a question as to whether section CE 6 is intended to apply to a trustee of a taxable ESS that is grandparented under section CZ 1. The application of section CE 6 to a taxable ESS – including a grandparented ESS – and an exempt ESS should be optional, as taxpayers may have taken, or wish to take, different approaches. b) There is a question as to the transitional consequences for the trustee of becoming a nominee. For example, it is unclear whether the trustee is treated as disposing of any unallocated shares to the company. It is also unclear whether the trustee is treated as being relieved of any financial arrangements liabilities it owes, such that debt remission income arises. A taxpayer should be entitled to elect to treat assets or liabilities as transferred at cost, or otherwise on a basis that does not give rise to an income tax liability for the trust purely by virtue of the application of section CE 6. This could be similar to the approach adopted for a solvent company under a resident’s restricted amalgamation, for example. c) Where section CE 6 applies, unallocated shares held by the trust are treated as treasury stock of the company. If shares remain unallocated after one year, the company has a reduction in available subscribed capital (ASC), under section CD 25(4). It should be clarified that if the trust subsequently allocates or disposes of the shares, an amount the trust receives is included in “subscriptions” (in section CD 43), increasing the company’s ASC. Otherwise the reduction in ASC under section CD 25(4) would be permanent. 197 Comment a) Section CE 6 applies to a person who is a trustee of an employee share scheme. An employee share scheme is defined in section CE 7. This definition includes a scheme that provides benefits which are, by virtue of section CZ 1(2), subject to section CE 2 before its amendment in 2018. In officials’ view, it is employee share scheme benefits that are grandparented, not particular schemes. Therefore, section CE 6 applies to a trustee of an employee share scheme that provides benefits; some or all of which are grandparented by section CZ 1. Officials consider it is simpler for nominee treatment to apply to all ESS/exempt ESS trustees, rather than for trustees to have to determine their own status. b) Officials have discussed with the submitter and others the effect of deeming trustees to be nominees to the extent provided for by section CE 6. The purpose of this deeming provision was to simplify compliance for employee share schemes. Officials appreciate that, in the absence of detailed provisions, such as those that apply to amalgamations in subpart FO of the Act, there may be a slightly untidy transition for trustees of some schemes. However, given that the issue is very technical and is not a recurring one, officials at this stage do not believe that it is a good use of resources to give detailed consideration to the development of a suite of rules for this purpose. As a general proposition, and in the absence of any firm evidence to the contrary, we believe that any difficult issues should be resolvable on an administrative basis. c) An issue of treasury stock by a company is included in available subscribed capital simply because it is an amount received by a company from the issue of shares (section CD 43(2)(b)). However, officials recommend amending the definition of “subscriptions” to clarify that consideration received by the company for the issue of shares as a result of the application of section CE 6 is included. Recommendation a) That the submission be declined. b) That the submission be declined. c) That the submission be accepted. Issue: Typo in section CW 26C(7)(a)(ii) should be corrected Submission (Matter raised by officials) There is a typographical error in section CW 26C(7)(a)(ii), which deals with the period of restriction for the exempt ESS rules. The word “employer” (the eighth word of the subsection) should be “employee”, as it is the date of the employee’s acquisition of the shares that is relevant to the period of restriction. Comment Officials recommend this error be corrected. 198 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 199 DISPOSAL OF COMPANY’S OWN SHARES BY EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME TRUSTEE (Clauses 2(1) and 13) Issue: Support for amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the clarification that income derived by a trustee of an ESS from disposing of the company’s own shares (treasury stock), while acting in its capacity as nominee of the company, is exempt. We also support the amendment applying from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 200 GST COMPULSORY ZERO RATING OF COMMERCIAL LAND LEASES (Clause 88) Issue: Supports proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Support the changes as they ensure that the compulsory zero rating rules achieve the intended policy outcome in relation to land leases, and validates how these rules have been applied by many (if not most) taxpayers and practitioners. (KPMG) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: One of the proposed amendments is unnecessary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) One of the proposed amendments, which would zero-rate business assets where a business sale that includes a zero-rated supply of a land lease is unnecessary as the legislation already provides this outcome. Comment Officials consider that the proposed amendment is a useful clarification that the relevant supply will still be zero-rated if it includes a lease assignment or surrender and other business assets. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 201 WHEN INCOME IS DERIVED FROM A CASH DIVIDEND (Clause 9) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The submitters support the proposed change. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Replace “received” with “paid” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The use of the term “received” does not align with concepts in the Inland Revenue Acts. The concept of “pay” or “paid” is the correct approach and should be adopted in the amendment. The term “pay” is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The salient part of the definition relevant for the purposes of the proposed amendment is, broadly, an amount that is distributed, credited, or dealt with on a person’s behalf. It is generally well understood by practitioners and taxpayers. The objective that the amendment is seeking to achieve is to change the timing of when a cash dividend will be assessable, effectively overriding accrual treatment. This can be done under current concepts by a “pay” or “paid” approach. Comment Officials note that the term “received” is not a defined term in the Income Tax Act 2007. However, it is a well-understood term and is defined in case law. “Received” is the standard term used in the timing rules where income is to be returned on a cash basis, which is the policy intent of this clause. The term “received” is used multiple times throughout the Income Tax Act 2007, for example in sections CC 2, CG 5, CG 5B, and CG 6 when describing the timing of income from superannuation schemes and insurance. The policy intent is to simplify the process for accrual-based taxpayers to be able to account for cash dividends on a cash basis. The issue identified was that taxpayers who accounted for their business income on an accrual basis would also have to accrue any business-related dividends, which officials understand is contrary to existing practice. The simpler approach is for taxpayers to allocate the income when they receive the dividend, rather than having to determine when the dividend has been accrued. 202 Officials consider the use of that the term “paid” could also create further confusion, as the person receiving the dividend may not know the date the dividend was paid by the payer if they have yet to receive the amount. Officials therefore prefer the use of “received”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarify application to company paying dividend by resolution Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed amendment should clarify how the rule would apply to small-to-medium sized companies that resolve to pay a dividend before year-end, where the amount of the dividend is quantified after year-end. Comment The proposal in the Bill clarifies that a person who receives a dividend is treated as deriving it on a cash basis. This means that a dividend cannot be treated as derived if a company resolves to pay a dividend but does not pay it – if it is not paid, it cannot be received. Officials therefore consider it unnecessary for amendments that address the circumstances where a company makes a resolution to pay a dividend, but that dividend is not paid until a later time. In that situation, the dividend cannot be treated as “received” by the recipient. Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission, but note that further clarification would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Clarify interaction with investment income reporting rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The legislation should clarify how the investment income reporting rules apply to a payment of a dividend that is deemed to be paid in an earlier income year. It is timely to clarify in the Income Tax Act 2007 how the investment income rules apply to a dividend paid by resolution before the end of an income year but quantified after that date. 203 Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission, but note that it would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Availability of tax credits should be confirmed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The legislation should confirm that the associated imputation credits and resident withholding tax credits will be available to the shareholder in the income year that the dividend is assessable. The availability of imputation credits and resident withholding tax credits on dividends that are paid with retrospective effect can be uncertain. Comment Officials consider that the law is clear regarding this practice and therefore does not need further clarification. However, officials will look to provide some confirmation of the position in a future Tax Information Bulletin following the enactment of this Bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendment more appropriate in Part E of the Income Tax Act 2007 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The amendment may be more appropriate in Part E of the Income Tax Act 2007. The intention of the amendment is to change the timing of the assessment of a cash dividend. Therefore, the amendment may be more appropriately placed in Part E of the Income Tax Act 2007 (timing and quantifying rules). Comment Officials note that the Income Tax Act 2007 contemplates the fact that the provisions dealing with the timing of income are included in Parts C and E to I. This is reflected in section BD 3(2), which deals with the allocation of income to particular years, and states: “An 204 amount of income is allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived, unless a provision in any of Parts C or E to I provides for allocation on another basis”. On this basis, it would not be unprecedented for a provision in Part C to contain a timing rule, such as the case proposed in the Bill and the amendments proposed to section CD 1. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Assurance that the Commissioner will not seek to review prior tax positions taken on basis of previous law Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Commissioner should assure taxpayers that resources will not be employed to review the tax treatment of dividends derived before the 2020–21 income year. Although we broadly support the policy intent of the amendment, it would be helpful if the Commissioner assured taxpayers that resources will not be employed to review the past tax treatment of dividends derived before the 2020–21 income year. Comment Inland Revenue will consider this operational matter. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 205 NRFAI DEFERRAL CALCULATION FORMULA – HYBRID DEDUCTION ITEM Issue: Amendment may result in formula producing an undefined outcome Submission (PwC) The submitter proposes that the amendment could result in the non-resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI) formula producing an undefined answer where the accumulated accruals figure is reduced to zero for a reason other than by operation of the hybrid rules (such as transfer pricing). The submitter recommends that the proposed amendment to section RF 2C(6)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (which would specify if “the item accumulated accruals is equal to the item hybrid deductions” then NRFAI would not arise) should be changed to read: “the item accumulated accruals is equal to the item hybrid deductions, or zero”. Comment In the situation the submitter is referring to, where the hybrid deduction item is not the cause of the accumulated accruals item being reduced to zero, the hybrid deduction item must itself be zero. This would mean that the accumulated accruals item would be equal to the hybrid deduction item (that is, they would both be zero). Therefore, officials are of the view that the proposed amendment would not produce an undefined answer in situations where the accumulated accruals figure was reduced to zero for reasons outside of the hybrid rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 206 THIN CAPITALISATION REMEDIALS (Clauses 34 and 35) Issue: Support for carve out Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Submitters supported the insertion of proposed section FE 2(4B). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Scope of carve out should be extended Submission (Chapman Tripp) Sections FE 6 and FE 7 of the Income Tax Act contain interest apportionment rules. Section FE 2(1)(d)(i) states that these may apply to a trust settled by a non-resident or an associated person of a non-resident. Proposed section FE 2(4B) should be amended so that it carves out from the meaning of “associated person” for the purpose of section FE 2(1)(d)(i) all associations between a New Zealand-resident settlor of a trust and a non-resident that has not made a settlement on the trust. Due to the breadth of the association rules in subpart YB, there are many other scenarios in which a resident settlor of a trust would be associated with a non-resident but it is not intended that the trust be brought within the ambit of the thin capitalisation rules solely by reason of that association because the non-resident is not itself a settlor of the trust. Examples of trusts that would not be saved from inadvertent/unintended application of section FE 2(1)(d)(i) by the current drafting of proposed section FE 2(4B) include: • where a New Zealand-resident company settlor of a trust has a non-resident sister company that it is associated with under section YB 2 but the sister company does not make a settlement on the trust; and • where a beneficiary of a trust, who is associated with the New Zealand-resident settlor under section YB 9, moves overseas and becomes a non-resident but the beneficiary does not make a settlement on the trust. Comment Officials agree that the proposed carve outs do not cover all possible scenarios where certain trusts with a New Zealand resident settlor should not be subject to thin capitalisation. 207 Section FE 2(1)(d)(i) was intended to cover settlements by a non-resident as well as any New Zealand resident associates of that non-resident. However, the current provision is much wider than this. It includes a trust settled by any New Zealand resident who is associated with a non-resident, unless that associate is specifically carved out. Points of difference Officials agree with the submitter’s proposal with the following adjustment. Rather than further extending the scope of the carve outs, officials recommend section FE 2(1)(d)(i) is narrowed so that it only covers settlements by a non-resident, or an associate of that non-resident and that proposed section FE 2(4B) be removed. It would also remove the need for existing section FE 2(4)(b), as a non-resident relative would only be covered by the revised section FE 2(1)(d)(i) if they had also made a settlement on the trust, in which case section FE 2(4)(b) would already not apply to them. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Resident and non-resident trusts Submission (Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh) References to resident/non-resident trusts in proposed section FE 2(4B) should be consistent with existing terminology in the Income Tax Act for trusts and trustees. Comment Officials agree that the terms used in this provision should be consistent with the existing terminology and concepts used in the trust rules that describe the relationship of trusts, trustees, and settlors with tax residence. However, the recommendation above to remove proposed section FE 2(4B) deletes the issue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date of section FE 2(4B) Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 208 a) Proposed section FE 2(4B) should have retrospective effect from the 2015–16 income year. This is because it is a remedial amendment to correct a mistake in the current drafting of section FE 2(1)(d)(i), which arose when the section was amended in 2014 by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 with effect from the 2015–16 income year. If desired, a savings provision could be added to preserve tax positions taken under the existing provision. (Chapman Tripp) b) It is appropriate that section FE 2(4B) should apply to income years beginning on or after the date of enactment. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment A prospective application date was considered appropriate, as proposed section FE 2(4B) would extend the scope of carve outs from section FE 2(1)(d)(i) in a way that had not previously been contemplated, rather than correcting a previous error. However, officials’ recommendation above, to narrow the scope of section FE 2(1)(d)(i) rather than proceed with proposed section FE 2(4B), reflects that the original scope of section FE 2(1)(d)(i) brought trusts with a New Zealand settlor within the thin capitalisation rules in a way that was not intended. Officials do not support a savings provision, as this would provide a benefit to trusts that had not complied with the current rules over trusts that had applied thin capitalisation consistent with the current rules. Instead, officials recommend that the revised position is applied effective from 1 April 2015 to align with the original amendments. Recommendation a) That the submission be accepted. b) That the submission be noted. Issue: Support for new apportionment formula Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Powerco) Submitters supported the introduction of a new formula for calculating apportionment of interest by an excess debt entity that is controlled by a non-resident owning body or trustee. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 209 Issue: “Group world debt percentages” higher than 60% Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Powerco, PwC) The proposed formula should be amended to work in situations where the “group world debt percentage” is higher than the 60% threshold, as the deemed income is overstated under the proposed formula. Comment The formula proposed in the Bill includes: (group NZ debt percentage – 60%) (group NZ debt percentage – group world debt percentage) Provided that the group world debt percentage is below 60%, this will result in a fraction between zero and one, so the taxpayer derives an amount of income that is a fraction of their total interest expenditure that would be excluded from their worldwide group (essentially related party interest). However, when the group world debt percentage is greater than 60% the fraction will be greater than one meaning the taxpayer could derive an amount of income greater than their total interest expenditure that would be excluded from their worldwide group. Officials recommend that this should be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Negative total assets Submission (KPMG) The introduction of the non-debt liabilities adjustment for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018 can, in rare cases, result in the denominator of the thin capitalisation safe harbour calculation being negative (for example, a company has non-debt liabilities exceeding its total assets). It is unclear what a negative debt percentage means for interest limitation under the thin capitalisation rules. When the non-debt liabilities adjustment to total assets results in a negative debt percentage, for thin capitalisation purposes, the interest limitation should be the total interest expense for the year. Comment Under the current law, when there is a negative debt percentage, two possible interpretations are that interest-income arising due to breaching the thin capitalisation safe harbour could be either zero or larger than total interest expense. Neither of these outcomes are appropriate. 210 The submitter is correct that when the debt percentage is negative, the amount of income derived by the taxpayer should be equal to their total interest expense for the year. Officials recommend amendments to clarify this situation. Officials note that this outcome should also apply to the restricted transfer pricing rules, so that a taxpayer with a negative debt percentage should be treated as having a debt percentage of greater than 40% for the purpose of applying the group credit rating and restricted credit rating. Officials also recommend similar amendments be made to apply to the restricted transfer pricing rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 211 TAX RULES RELATING TO CUSTODIAL INSTITUTIONS (Clauses 56 and 73) Issue: Extending the definition of custodial institutions Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, HSBC, KPMG) The submitters support the proposals that the definition of a “custodial institution” be extended to include a New Zealand operation that is a fixed establishment of a non-resident entity. The amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. This aligns the date of the amendment with the commencement date of the investment income reporting rules, in particular the rules for custodial institutions. The amendment is taxpayer friendly. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarifying the withholding obligations of custodial institutions Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The submitters support the proposals that the requirement for custodial institutions to withhold RWT be extended to include NRWT as applicable. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Foreign currency and resident withholding tax Submissions (Deloitte) The submitter suggests that there should be further alignments of the options for converting foreign currency for investment income payers and investors, which refers to subsections RE 4(5), (6) and (7) of the Income Tax Act 2007. This submission was made in relation to custodial institutions but relates to all investment income payers. The option for investment income payers to use the foreign exchange conversion rate on the date the payment of income is received is not matched with the conversion rate with the options for RWT credits. 212 Investment income payers may not be able to use the exchange rate for the day the income is received, as their systems process conversions on a different date. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission; however, further work requires prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amending the definition of “end investor” Submission (KPMG, HSBC NZ) The exclusion of a non-resident custodial institution which carries on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand should be removed from the definition of an “end investor”. The requirement prevents custodians caught by the exclusion from being able to withhold and report investment income on an aggregated basis. This is contrary to the policy intention. The fixed establishment requirement should be modified to permit foreign custodians to be treated as end investors, to the extent that the underlying clients of the custodian are not clients of the foreign custodian’s New Zealand fixed establishment. This should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2020. (HSBC NZ) Comment Officials agree that the policy intention was to allow reporting and withholding on an aggregated basis where a payment of investment income passes to a non-resident custodian. It was not intended that a non-resident custodian’s New Zealand business model should affect reporting and withholding requirements. The normal reporting rules require detailed information which is used to pre-populate New Zealand investors’ myIR account. Aggregation is intended to relax the normal rules where a New Zealand custodial institution passes a payment of investment income to a non-resident custodial institution. This means that information in respect of non-New Zealand resident individual investors (who may be many steps further along an investment chain) is not required by Inland Revenue. Officials note the difficulties that have arisen with definitions involving non-resident custodial institutions, and ensuring that obligations are clear and unambiguous. In consequence, officials’ view is that the proposed amendment would benefit from further work. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 213 BENEFICIARIES AS SETTLORS (Clause 43) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Beneficiaries owed money by a trust should not be deemed settlors where they have no knowledge of the debt Submission (PwC) A beneficiary owed more than $25,000 by a trust should not be deemed a settlor where they have no knowledge of the debt. This could have significant tax consequences – for example, if the beneficiary acquires land during a period in which the trust is in the business of developing land, that land may be subject to tax if sold within 10 years. Comment Section HC 27(2) provides that a person who transfers value to a trust is a settlor. A beneficiary can become a settlor when money is paid out to them but is retained in their current account with the trust. This is because they “transfer value” to the trust by leaving money in the trust interest-free. A recent legislative amendment to section HC 27(6) aimed to ensure that beneficiaries with current account balances below $25,000, or on which the prescribed or market rate of interest has been paid, do not become settlors. This was a taxpayer-friendly amendment, ensuring that beneficiaries with modest current account balances do not because settlors. Being a settlor has implications in numerous areas, such as social assistance and student loan repayment obligations. It has become apparent that this amendment may be ineffective because, from a legal point of view, a beneficiary’s knowledge as to the way the trustee is using the money is required for a transfer of value to occur. Therefore, a beneficiary could be owed any amount by the trust but not be a settlor if the beneficiary had no knowledge of the debt. The amendments in the Bill ensure the original policy intent is achieved by providing that a beneficiary of a trust who is owed money by the trustee and does not meet the requirements of subsection (6) is a settlor, regardless of knowledge. 214 Officials disagree with the submitter that a beneficiary should only be treated as a settlor where they have knowledge of the debt. It would be difficult for the Commissioner to ascertain the beneficiary’s level of knowledge. To introduce such a requirement would also be inconsistent with other aspects of the tax system, such as the bright-line test for residential property, which replaced a test that was based on the taxpayer’s purpose or intent. As the trustee deciding on the use of a trust’s funds is often a family member, it is expected that the trustee would inform the beneficiary of the debt. The additional disclosure requirements to beneficiaries in the Trust Act 2019 may assist in keeping beneficiaries more informed. Alternatively, the beneficiary being deemed a settlor can be prevented by the trustee paying market interest or ensuring the amount owed to the beneficiary is not more than $25,000. It was always intended that beneficiaries who owed more than $25,000 on which interest has not been paid would become settlors of the trust, regardless of knowledge. The Bill as currently drafted is consistent with this intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 215 MIGRATING SETTLOR OF A TRUST (Clauses 41, 42, and 44) Issue: Electing to pay New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed amendments to allow a distribution of tax-paid income to be exempt to the beneficiary, following a voluntary disclosure or an election to pay tax on world-wide trustee income, are supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Distributions from trusts – terminology used inconsistent with policy purpose Submission (Wallis Tax Advisory Ltd) That the reference to “a distribution from income” in clause 44 should refer to the term “a distribution of an amount”, to ensure that a distribution of a capital gain from a trust can be treated as being made from a complying trust. Comment A complying trust is a trust for which the trustee has paid tax on world-wide trustee income. However, such a trust may make a capital gain, which is not taxable under the Income Tax Act 2007, and the non-taxation of such a gain is not intended to affect the complying trust status. A distribution of a capital gain from such a trust is also intended to be exempt to the beneficiary. Officials recommend the submission be accepted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Taxation of trusts and interaction with Double Taxation Agreements Submission (Wallis Tax Advisory Ltd) 216 That the provision allowing an election to pay tax on world-wide trustee income explicitly provide an override of the allocation of taxing rights under a double taxation agreement (DTA). Comment When a person makes an election for a trust to pay tax under section HC 33, the trustee is, by choice, agreeing to pay New Zealand tax at the trustee rate on their world-wide trustee income, without reference to any DTA. The purpose of this election is to permit the trust to be treated as a complying trust for distributions from the trust fund of amounts derived after the effective date of the election. These distributions are tax-exempt to the beneficiary. Officials consider that this policy, and the associated legislative outcome, is supported by the general principle of the OECD commentary on tax treaties which states that countries are free to tax their own residents as they choose. Article 11 of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty- related measures that address base erosion and profit shifting clarifies that a DTA generally does not restrict a country’s ability to tax its own residents, except in certain listed circumstances. Taxing a trust based on an election to pay tax on world-wide trustee income is not one of those listed circumstances. Therefore, officials consider that the suggested change is unnecessary, as officials are concerned that a specific override in the election rules for tax treaties may create an adverse inference for other trust provisions that are intended to override tax treaties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 217 RESTRICTED TRANSFER PRICING (Clause 39) Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, PwC) Submitters supported replacing references to “associated persons” so that cross-border related borrowing is treated consistently with loans from an associated person. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Cross-border related borrowing with terms greater than five years Submission (PwC) The calculation to allow for exotic features seen in third-party debt to be “regarded” under the restricted transfer pricing rule should be simplified. Where taxpayers have significant third-party funding arrangements with terms longer than five years, there is limited practical ability for such features to be regarded under the restricted transfer pricing rule. This is on the basis that, in order for this feature to apply, the rules effectively require related-party debt to be executed in tranches with differing loan terms. Specifically, the requirement to calculate and adjust for the threshold fraction prohibits the ability to recognise third-party debt with a threshold term longer than five years where a taxpayer only has one tranche of related party debt (which is common in order to manage compliance obligation). Effectively, where there is only one tranche of related-party debt, the taxpayer will never be able to apply the threshold term. Comment Section GC 18 removes terms of greater than five years from being included in pricing cross- border related borrowing unless the New Zealand group or the worldwide group has significant third-party debt with a term that is equal or greater than five years. These rules were explained on page 24 of the BEPS interest limitation special report and page 113 of Tax Information Bulletin Volume 31, No 3, April 2019. The threshold fraction calculates third-party debt with a term over five years as a proportion of total third-party debt. This was intended to require a group to have terms for cross-border related borrowing that resembled their third-party funding. For example, if a group had 50% of its funding with a term of two years and 50% of its funding with a term of 10 years, it could also have 50% of its cross-border related borrowing with a term of 10 years. Although 218 the rules operate correctly when a group structures itself in this way, as noted by the submitter, groups may prefer to have a single cross-border related borrowing rather than splitting it into below-five-year and above-five-year components. For example, instead of the two loans above, they could have a single loan with a term of six years for the same average maturity. When a group has a single cross-border related borrowing with a term of greater than five years, they will only satisfy the threshold term if they have no third-party debt with a term of less than five years. Officials recommend that an alternative approach should be added to the restricted transfer pricing rules, so that cross-border related borrowing can have a term of greater than five years without having to satisfy the threshold term if: • the term is less than the weighted average of all third-party debt, and • total cross-border related borrowing is less than four times the third-party debt. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Notching for group credit rating Submission (EY) We understand that section GC 16(10) was intended to provide for downward notching adjustments under both paragraphs (a) and (ab), rather than only under paragraph (a) as the section currently stands. This inconsistency should be addressed. Comment Section GC 16(10)(ab) was introduced by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 to cover situations where the group credit rating could not be applied as the group had no external debt. As the submitter notes, it was not intended that a taxpayer relying on this provision would not be able to apply the same one- or two-notch adjustment that is already available for a taxpayer relying on section GC 16(10)(a). Officials recommend correcting this error and the amendment should apply from 1 July 2018 to align with the start of the Restricted Transfer Pricing rules and the previous amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 219 NZ SUPERANNUITANTS AND THE END-OF-YEAR AUTO- CALCULATION PROCESS (Clause 84) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed change to clarify that recipients of New Zealand Superannuation and Veteran’s Pension are limited to a $50 write-off if they have used a tailored tax code. Recommendation That the submission be noted. (Clause 84) Issue: Clarification that clause 1(b) of Part B of schedule 8 is subject to the same limitation Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to clause 84 to include clause (1)(b) of Part B of Schedule 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 in order to effectively limit the proposed write off to New Zealand superannuation and veterans pension precipitants who use a tailored tax code. Comments Part B of Schedule 8 to the Income Tax Act 2007 outlines when the Commissioner must write off certain amounts of tax. The write off is available under both clauses 1(a) and 1(b) of Part B. The current proposal in clause 84 of this Bill aims to limit the write off available to taxpayers that use a tailored tax code and receive New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension through an amendment to clause 1(a). However, a write off is also available under clause 1(b). Accordingly, an amendment should also be made to clause 1(b) in order to also limit the write-off amount under that clause. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 220 THE COMMITTEE’S ASSURANCE PROCESSES Issue: The Committee’s assurance processes Submission (KPMG) The submitter raised an issue in relation to withholding tax rules for custodians and a square- up mechanism for PIE tax contained in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The submitter expressed the view that a change to the proposals had not been fully considered by the Select Committee. The Committee should consider whether and when further assurance is required for changes to a tax bill before it is reported back. Comment Officials acknowledge the matters raised in this submission, being the development of: • amendments to the withholding and reporting rules for custodial institutions (“custodians’ rules”); and • refundability of overpaid portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax. As the submitter notes, the development of the custodians’ rules was subject to external consultation. This consisted of an initial survey of issues facing custodians, targeted consultation to develop the solution and early-stage consultation on the draft provision. This was intended to provide an opportunity for subject matter experts to comment on the wording of the draft provisions. Officials acknowledge that the timeframe was short and that additional time for consideration may have enabled earlier identification and addressing of potential issues. Officials have reviewed the process and confirm the change was made in response to feedback received from external stakeholders. When the errors were identified, administrative flexibility was used to enable those custodians who were inadvertently excluded from the rules to access them. This enabled the correction of the provision to be further consulted on as part of the current Bill. The policy to allow for the refundability of overpaid tax on PIE income was developed quickly in response to data showing that a large number of individuals (approximately 950,000) overpay tax. The legislation did not allow for a refund of any overpayment. The policy development involved targeted consultation and the proposal was discussed with the Committee’s specialist advisor. Implementation of the PIE tax square-up required embedding of the square-up calculation and refund process into existing income tax year-end processes provisions throughout the tax Acts. Due to the way the square-up calculation and definitions were drafted in the new legislation, a supplementary order paper at the Committee of the Whole House stage of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loan and Remedial Matters) Bill clarified that the calculation allowed a credit for PIE tax paid, which had been a part of the square-up policy from the start. 221 Recommendation That the submission be noted. 223 General support for proposed amendments 225 (Clause 61) Issue: PIE investor interest exemption for lines trusts Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. (Clauses 48, 49, 50, and 51) Issue: Pre-consolidation imputation credits – Clarifying the imputation rules for the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits by corporate groups Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The proposed changes to clarify the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits are welcomed and supported. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. (Clause 67(2)) Issue: Amend the definition of deferrable tax Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Support for the reform. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 226 (Clauses 77 and 78) Issue: Restricting the ability to challenge a tax position Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Support for the reform. Recommendation That the submission be noted. (Clause 21) Issue: Spreading forward of fertiliser expenditure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Support for the reform. Recommendation That the submission be noted. (Clause 54) Issue: Non-resident contractors’ tax Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The amendment, which requires a non-resident contractor seeking an exemption from income tax for a payment to show that the amount derived from that payment is not “assessable income”, and the application date of the amendment, is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 227 (Clauses 46 and 47) Issue: Removal of the three-yearly parental tax credit review Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The submitter supports the proposed amendment to remove the requirement to review the parental tax credit every three years. Recommendation That the submission be noted. (Clauses 58(13), 64 and 65) Issue: Aligning the definition of benefit Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed amendments to align the definition of a main benefit in the Acts administered by Inland Revenue with that used in the Social Security Act 2018. Recommendation That the submission be noted. (Clause 69) Issue: Clarifying the Commissioner’s powers to take copies of documents Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We support the reform. The amendment will extend the Commissioner’s powers under section 17C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to take copies and the like in relation to documents provided under other sections of the TAA, to documents that are produced in the course of the Commissioner’s inquiries under section 17I. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 229 Items raised by officials 231 DEPRECIATION ON NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS Issue: Restrictions on depreciation rates for depreciable property transferred to an associate Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EE 40 should be amended to allow a new owner of an asset to change depreciation rates where the depreciation rate has changed in legislation. Comment Non-residential buildings are depreciable at a rate of 1.5% or 2% from the 2020–21 income year, as opposed to the 0% that applied from the 2011–12 income year. The depreciation rate that can apply where a person has acquired depreciable property from an associate is restricted by section EE 40 to the rate used by the associate. As a result, a purchaser who acquired a non-residential building from an associate could be restricted to a 0% depreciation rate, rather than the allowable rate of 1.5% or 2%. Section EE 40 is intended to ensure that the purchaser is unable to claim more depreciation for the item than the associated person would have been able to claim had they retained the item. However, it was not intended to limit a purchaser’s use of a deprecation rate where the rate has been changed by legislation as this is a change clearly intended by Parliament. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date of repeal for building fit-out transitional rule Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section DB 65, which provided a transitional rule for fit-out depreciated as part of a building, should be repealed with effect from the 2020–21 and later income years. Comment Section DB 65 was repealed with effect from 1 April 2020 by the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020, as a result of depreciation for non-residential buildings being reinstated. The section should have been repealed with effect from the 2020–21 and later income years, to match the reinstatement of depreciation on non-residential buildings. 232 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 233 PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITY SCHEDULAR INCOME Changes to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules made in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Act 2020 introduced a year-end adjustment process to allow for refundability of overpaid tax on multi-rate PIE income of individuals from the 2020–21 tax year. These changes require some remedial amendments and clarifications to ensure that the PIE year-end process works with the existing provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the year-end income tax processes for individuals. The changes should apply retrospectively to the 2020–21 tax year, the first year of the PIE year-end adjustments. Auto-calculated year-end processes for individuals for the 2020–21 tax year are planned to commence from late May 2021. Issue: Simplifying the PIE schedular income year-end adjustment calculation Submission (Matter raised by officials) The prescriptive calculation in subsections HM 36B(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be changed to an outline of the items that should be taken into account when calculating PIE schedular income. Comment The current prescriptive calculation in subsections HM 36B(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 can result in situations where the calculation may not include some attributed tax credits for the future benefit of the investor. Moving from a prescriptive formula to an outline of what the Commissioner needs to take into account when calculating PIE schedular income adjustments simplifies the subsections. It also future-proofs the calculation, enabling the Commissioner to incorporate any improved data reporting on credits. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying that PIE losses and loss tax credits are incorporated when calculating a person’s income tax adjustment Submission (Matter raised by officials) PIE schedular income adjustments calculated under section HM 36B only refer to attributed PIE income. The provision should be clarified to specifically include attributed losses and resulting tax credits when calculating the PIE schedular income tax adjustment. 234 Comment Including attributed losses and resulting tax credits in the calculation of PIE schedular income would clarify that a natural person investor who is attributed a loss, and who has or is entitled to have a tax credit calculated on the loss using their prescribed investor rate, can also receive an adjustment where the rate used during the tax year was incorrect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying that a natural person investor is a New Zealand resident Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that the PIE schedular income tax adjustment only applies to natural person New Zealand residents. Comment Specific rules apply to non-resident investors in a multi-rate PIE. Section HM 36B of the Income Tax Act 2007 introduced a process to calculate PIE schedular income tax adjustments for a natural person investor. However, the process was not intended to make any changes to these rules. It should be clarified that the new adjustment only applies to a natural person investor who is resident in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying that the adjustment does not apply to a trustee of a trust Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that the PIE schedular income tax adjustment does not apply to a trustee of a trust. Comment Specific legislative rules apply in relation to a trustee of a trust investing in a multi-rate PIE. The new year-end PIE schedular tax adjustment was not intended to make any changes to these rules. 235 Section HM 36B of the income Tax Act 2007 should be clarified to ensure that the new year- end adjustment does not apply to a person who is an investor in a multi-rate PIE and derives income as a trustee of a trust. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Limiting the removal of excluded income status for multi-rate PIE income Submission (Matter raised by officials) The removal of the excluded income status for natural person multi-rate PIE income should be limited to the calculation of the PIE schedular tax adjustment. Comment Before the introduction of the new year-end adjustment rules income from multi-rate PIEs was largely considered to be the excluded income of a natural person. This meant that it did not flow through to the person’s income tax return and assessment. To better incorporate the new year-end adjustment process into existing year-end income tax processes, this excluded income status was removed entirely. However, this may have unintended flow-on consequences for loss offsets, and added complications for Working for Families tax credit, student loans and child support. To avoid this, the removal of the excluded income status for natural person multi-rate PIE income should be limited to the calculation of the PIE schedular tax adjustment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Tax adjustments for under- and over-payments of tax on PIE income are included when calculating residual income tax Submission (Matter raised by officials) To simplify the PIE adjustment process, the year-end adjustment rules should be changed so that any PIE adjustment (debit or credit) is included in the person’s final income tax calculation and therefore residual income tax. 236 Comment As currently drafted, any PIE tax payable or refundable as a result of the year-end adjustment is initially included in the calculation of the person’s tax due, then backed-out for the calculation of their residual income tax. This adjustment, or PIE square-up, will happen alongside the year-end process for income tax. This creates two different end-of-year amounts that need to be used for establishing due dates for any late payment or use-of-money interest for the current year’s income tax, and as the basis for next year’s provisional tax. This different treatment increases complexity for taxpayers and Inland Revenue’s systems. To simplify the adjustment process, the year-end adjustment rules should be changed so that any PIE adjustment (debit or credit) is included in the person’s final income tax calculation and therefore residual income tax. This would result in one tax liability figure for the year- end tax payment, which would also be the basis for provisional tax for the following year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 237 SMALL BUSINESS CASHFLOW (LOAN) SCHEME Issue: Ability to transfer tax refunds to an amount borrowed under the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “tax” for the purpose of Part 10B in the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be widened to include a loan advanced to a taxpayer under the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) Scheme (SBCS), to enable tax refunds owed to that taxpayer to be transferred to their loan balance. Comment Currently, if a borrower is owed a tax refund, they are unable to request that Inland Revenue transfer this amount toward paying down their SBCS balance. This is because a loan under the SBCS is not included in the definition of “tax” for the purpose of Part 10B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, where transfers of excess tax can be made to another tax type or to another amount due. At the moment, any tax refund must be made to the borrower’s bank account, so the borrower then has to make a manual repayment to repay their loan under the SBCS. The widened definition would simplify this transaction by allowing Inland Revenue to apply a taxpayer’s tax refund to their loan balance if requested to do so. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 238 OTHER MATTERS Issue: Initial provisional tax liability definition Submission (Matter raised by officials) The provisional tax threshold increased from $2,500 to $5,000 following amendments contained in the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020. To do this, all references to the old threshold of $2,500 were changed to $5,000. In doing this, a change was made to the definition of “initial provisional tax liability” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which could adversely affect some taxpayers. To correct this, officials recommend adding a transitional provision to the definition of “initial provisional tax liability”, so that taxpayers who were over the old threshold but were not over the new threshold do not become initial provisional taxpayers again. Comment An initial provisional taxpayer is a taxpayer who has not been required to pay provisional tax in the previous four years because their residual income tax is beneath the threshold for paying provisional tax. It was not intended for a person to become a person with an “initial provisional tax liability” under the old threshold and the new threshold. Without an amending transitional provision, a person who has previously had residual income tax of more than $2,500 but not more than $5,000 could meet the definition again. This could give them an adverse outcome compared to someone who does not have an initial provisional tax liability. The transitional provision would provide that a person who, in the previous four years, had residual income tax of more than $2,500 but not more than $5,000 does not have an initial provisional tax liability. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Foreign trust registration and annual return fees Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 brought in new disclosure rules for foreign trusts. Those rules included fees for registering a foreign trust (section 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994) and for filing its annual return (section 59D). 239 Technically, these fees are a “tax” under section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, as they are payable to the Commissioner under a tax law and are not explicitly excluded from being a “tax”. This has unintended consequences, such as late payment penalties and use-of- money interest applying when the fees are not paid. It was never intended that these fees be “taxes”. Officials therefore recommend carving the fees out of the definition of “tax”, retrospectively to 21 February 2017, when the disclosure rules came into force. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Using passport numbers in the student loan customs information match Submission (Matter raised by officials) A student loan borrower who is New Zealand-based is entitled to an interest-free student loan and loan repayments are based on their income. Interest is payable on student loans for borrowers who are based overseas. Currently, Inland Revenue undertakes an information match with the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) for the purpose of verifying whether a borrower is in New Zealand or overseas. This information allows Inland Revenue to ensure that borrowers are correctly treated as New Zealand or overseas-based, and to identify borrowers in serious default when they leave or enter New Zealand. The legislation governing this match currently allows Inland Revenue to share the borrower’s name, date of birth and IRD number with Customs. Inland Revenue would like to improve the accuracy of this match by adding the borrower’s passport number to this information. Officials propose an application date of 1 October 2021 to align with planned system changes as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. Comment Adding the passport number to the match will improve the accuracy of the match because passport numbers are a unique identifier used by Customs. This in turn improves the integrity of the student loans system by reducing the possibility that borrowers could be overseas without Inland Revenue being aware of this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 240 Issue: Tax treatment of distributions on wind-up of an approved unit trust Submission (Matter raised by officials) All distributions by an approved unit trust should be treated as trustee income. Comment An approved unit trust is a special type of unit trust that is declared not to be a unit trust for tax purposes under the Income Tax Act (Exempt Unit Trusts) Order 1990. An approved unit trust is instead treated as a trust for tax purposes. Trustee income of an approved unit trust is taxed at a rate of 28%. Bonus Bonds is the only approved unit trust. It pays prizes out of prior year after-tax earnings, as tax-free distributions to beneficiaries. On 26 August 2020, it was announced that Bonus Bonds would stop accepting new investments, with the intention of being wound up. In the year Bonus Bonds winds up, it will have to distribute income derived to beneficiaries. Under current law, income derived in an income year is beneficiary income to the extent to which it vests in a beneficiary in the income year, or is paid to a beneficiary in the income year or within a certain period after the end of the income year, and as such will be taxed at beneficiaries’ marginal tax rates. The recommended change will ensure that all income of an approved unit trust that would have been beneficiary income, including income derived in the year Bonus Bonds is wound up, will be taxed consistently with other income derived over the life of the trust: as trustee income. This is in line with the policy intent and will deliver compliance cost savings for bondholders, Bonus Bonds and Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Direct crediting of Problem Gambling Levy Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend including the Problem Gambling Levy within the meaning of tax for the purpose of section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to allow Inland Revenue to make refunds by direct credit. Comment As part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation, the administration of the Problem Gambling Levy will transition to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform in March 2021. The Problem Gambling Levy is not considered to be a tax for the purpose of section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Gambling Act 2003 makes clear that the levy is neither a tax nor a duty under the Act except for the purposes of “collection, recovery and enforcement” – there is no mention of refunding. 241 Section 184A of the Tax Administration Act (which only applies to the refunding of tax) cannot apply to the Problem Gambling Levy if this amendment is not made. Therefore, section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act needs an amendment to include the levy within the meaning of tax. This will allow direct crediting of overpaid levy by gaming machine and casino operators into a bank account. The recommended amendment will apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Temporary loss carry-back remedial to enable loss grouping for groups that are not wholly owned Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend amending section IZ 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007, so that a company that is 66% or more commonly owned with another company is able to carry losses back to offset against the income of the other company if it meets certain criteria. The amendment would be backdated so that it applies for the duration of the temporary loss carry-back. Comment Section IZ 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains the temporary loss carry-back rules. The rules allow a company with net losses in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 income years to carry losses back to offset taxable income in the immediately preceding income year. Special rules apply for companies that are part of wholly owned corporate groups. To be eligible for the loss carry-back, a company that is not in a wholly owned corporate group must have net loss in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 income years (the “loss year”) and must also have taxable income in the income year immediately preceding the loss year (the “profit year”). This rule applies as intended to companies using the loss carry-back individually but is problematic for some companies that are in non-wholly owned corporate groups (companies with at least 66%, but less than 100%, common ownership). Under current rules, a company that is in losses in both the loss and profit years cannot use the carry-back to offset its losses against the taxable income of a (non-wholly owned) group member in the profit year. This is contrary to the policy intent expressed in the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Bill Commentary, which is for a company that has 66% or more common ownership with another company to be able to carry back and offset its losses against the other company’s taxable income in the profit year. Officials recommend the legislation be amended so that it satisfies the policy intent. 242 Example Mippy Co and Speckles Co are 80% commonly owned. In 2018–19, Mippy Co has net income of $100k and Speckles Co has $50k of losses. Speckles Co decides to offset its $50k of losses against Mippy Co’s income that year, so Mippy Co has taxable income of $50k. In 2019–20, Mippy Co has net income of $50k and Speckles Co has net losses of $75k. After offsetting Speckles Co’s losses against Mippy Co’s net income,\* Speckles Co still has $25k of losses remaining. It decides to use the temporary loss carry-back so that it can offset its remaining $25k of losses against Mippy Co’s 2018–19 taxable income. Speckles Co carries its remaining $25k of losses back to 2018 –19, and offsets the losses against Mippy Co’s 2018 -19 taxable income of $50k. Mippy Co receives a tax refund of $7,000 ($25k x 28%, which is the corporate tax rate). After using the loss carry-back, Mippy Co still has $25k of taxable income remaining in 2018–19. Speckles has $0 losses remaining in 2019–20 after using the loss carry-back. 2018–19 income year Mippy Co Speckles Co Net income/(loss) (before offsets and loss carry-back) $100k ($50k) Taxable income/(loss) (after offsets but before loss carry-back) $50k $0 2019–20 income year Net income/loss (before offsets and loss carry-back) $50k ($75k) Taxable income/loss (after offsets but before loss carry-back) $0 ($25k) Temporary loss carry-back 2018–19 taxable income/(loss) (after loss carry-back) $25k $0 2019–20 taxable income/(loss) (after loss carry-back) $0 $0 Amount refunded under loss carry-back $7k $0 \*In this example the two companies have chosen to offset losses within the group in the loss year before using the loss carry-back. This is not a requirement for groups that are not wholly owned. The remedial amendment would apply for the duration of the temporary scheme, so would apply to two pairs of income years: the 2018 –19/2019–20 and 2019–20/2020–21 profit/loss years.

That clause 83 contains a drafting error that requires correction. Comment The proposed amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes. The submitter comments that clause 83 proposes to insert a new paragraph (j) in section 157(10) after paragraph (i). As section 157(10(j) already exists, we agree with the submission that the insertion should be renumbered appropriately. Recommendation That the first submission be noted.
