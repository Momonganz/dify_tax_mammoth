August 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Permanent establishment anti-avoidance rules Sections GB 54, YD 4(17C), YD 4B, YD 5(1BA), YD 5B and schedule 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 inserts a new anti-avoidance rule into the Income Tax Act for large multinationals (with over EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover) that structure to avoid having a permanent establishment (PE) in New Zealand. The rule deems a non-resident to have a PE in New Zealand if a related entity carries out sales-related activities for it here under an arrangement with a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance (and the other requirements of the rule are met). This PE is deemed to exist for the purpose of any applicable double tax agreement (DTA), unless the DTA incorporates the OECD’s latest PE article. 1 In addition, the Act inserts further provisions under which an amount of income will be deemed to have a source in New Zealand if that income can be attributed to a PE in New Zealand. If a New Zealand DTA applies to the non-resident, the definition of a PE in that DTA will apply for this purpose. If no New Zealand DTA applies to the non- resident, then a new domestic law definition of a PE will apply. Background PE anti-avoidance rule New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents on their New Zealand sales income is determined by our domestic tax rules in conjunction with our DTAs. Under our DTAs, like those for most other countries, New Zealand is generally prevented from taxing a non-resident’s business income unless the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. This is the case even if that income has a source in New Zealand under our domestic legislation. A PE is basically a fixed place of business of the non-resident, but it also includes a dependent agent that habitually concludes contracts on behalf of the non-resident. If a PE exists, then under the DTA New Zealand may tax only the income attributable to that PE (unless that income is also subject to another DTA provision). The non-resident must also have a PE in New Zealand (if a DTA applies) for New Zealand to charge non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on certain payments by the 1 This is contained in Article 12(1) of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures To Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) 1 non-resident (such as a royalty) to other parties in connection with the New Zealand sales income. The problem the new rule is trying to address is the ability of some multinationals to structure their affairs so they do not have a PE in New Zealand, despite having significant economic activity carried on for them here. This usually involves the non- resident entity establishing a New Zealand subsidiary to carry out local sales related activities. The OECD and the G20 are also concerned about PE avoidance, and have recommended measures to address it as part of their 15 point base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) Action Plan. This includes a new, broader definition of a PE for DTAs. Under this new PE definition, a representative of the non-resident will only need to habitually play a principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification in order to give rise to a PE for the non- resident. This contrasts with the current PE definition in most DTAs, where the representative must habitually conclude contracts on behalf of the non-resident in order to give rise to a PE. The OECD has prepared the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) to rapidly implement the treaty changes recommended as part of its BEPS Action Plan. New Zealand signed the MLI on 7 June 2017. Under the MLI, the OECD’s new widened PE definition will be included in New Zealand’s DTAs, but only if the other country signs the MLI and elects to adopt that new PE definit ion. This new, widened definition should be effective in addressing the kinds of PE avoidance we have seen in New Zealand. However a majorit y of New Zealand’s trading partners have not elected to adopt the widened PE definition, including some countries from which significant investment into New Zealand is made. Therefore, the OECD’s widened PE definition will not be sufficient to address the issue of PE avoidance in New Zealand. Source rules Under the current rules, there is a possibility that New Zealand may be entitled to tax a non-resident on its sales income under the PE article of a DTA, but cannot do so under our domestic source rules. There is general international consensus that if income is derived through a PE in a country, then it is sufficiently connected with that country to be taxed there. Accordingly, any income that is attributable to a PE should also have a New Zealand source under our domestic rules. In addition, in order to tax a non-resident on its New Zealand sales income, it is currently necessary to show that the income both has a New Zealand source and is attributable to a PE under a DTA. This increases the compliance and administrative burden of determining a non-resident’s tax liability for its sales to New Zealand customers. 2 Key features PE anti-avoidance rule The Act introduces a new PE anti-avoidance rule in section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act. The rule deems a PE to exist in New Zealand for a non-resident if all the following criteria are met: • The non-resident is part of a large multinational group. The OECD has defined a “large multinational group” as a group with at least EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. The same revenue threshold is used for section GB 54. • The non-resident makes a supply of goods or services to a person in New Zealand. • A person (the “facilitator”) carries out an activity in New Zealand for the purpose of bringing about that particular supply. • The facilitator is associated with the non-resident, is an employee of the non- resident, or is commercially dependent on the non-resident. • The facilitator’s activities are more than preparatory or auxiliary to the non- resident’s supply. • The non-resident’s income from the supply is subject to a DTA that does not include the OECD’s latest PE article. • A more than merely incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement is to avoid New Zealand tax, or a combination of New Zealand tax and foreign tax. Where a supply is subject to the rule, the non-resident is deemed to make that supply through the deemed PE. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supply are also attributed to the PE. The deemed PE exists for all the purposes of both the Act and the applicable DTA, notwithstanding anything in that DTA. The tax consequences of the deemed PE are determined by the other provisions of the Act and the DTA. For example, New Zealand will have a right to tax the profits attributable to the PE under the business profits article of an applicable DTA (unless that business profits article provides otherwise). Section GB 54 may also apply in the context of a third-party channel provider arrangement. This is a single arrangement under which the non-resident supplies goods or services to a non-associated New Zealand resident and the New Zealand resident on- supplies the goods or services to identified New Zealand customers with the assistance of the facilitator. If the new rule applies in these circumstances, then the facilitator’s activities will give rise to a PE for the non-resident in respect of its supplies to the third- party channel provider. Source rule The Act also introduces a new source rule for PEs. This rule provides that any income attributable to a PE in New Zealand has a source in New Zealand. The Act introduces the fo llowing definit io ns for a PE: • Where a taxpayer is resident in a jurisdiction that has a DTA with New Zealand, the definition will be the same as the definition of a PE in that DTA. Any PE 3 deemed to arise under section GB 54 will also be a PE under the definition (but only if the DTA does not include the OECD’s new PE definition). • Where a taxpayer is resident in a jurisdiction that does not have a DTA with New Zealand, the definition of a PE will be that set out in the new schedule 23 to the Act (domest ic PE definit io n). This definition includes the OECD’s new PE definit ion. The high level application of all these new rules can be summarised as follows. In determining whether the non-resident has a deemed PE in New Zealand, the new PE anti-avo idance rule: • Applies if the jurisdiction where the non-resident is resident has a DTA with New Zealand, but that DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s new PE definition. • Does not apply if the non-resident’s jurisdiction has a DTA with New Zealand, and that DTA does incorporate the OECD’s new PE definition. Instead the OECD’s new PE definition in the DTA applies. • Does not apply if the non-resident’s jurisdiction does not have a DTA with New Zealand. Instead the new domestic PE definition (which incorporates the OECD’s new PE definit io n) applies. In all the above circumstances, if the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand then any income attributable to that PE will have a New Zealand source. Whether income is attributable to the PE will be determined under the standard PE profit attribution methodology applied by New Zealand. The application of these rules is illustrated in the flowchart below. 4 Flow chart for application of new rules Does the non-resident’s home jurisdiction have a DTA with NZ? Does the DTA include the extended PE definition (either under the MLI or via bilateral DTA negotiation)? Whether the non-resident has a NZ PE will be determined by the new domestic PE definition in schedule 23. No Yes Is a NZ facilitator undertaking activities to bring about a sale by the non-resident?

Whether the non-resident has a NZ PE will be determined by the relevant DTA’s PE definition. Yes Yes No No Whether the non-resident has a NZ PE will be determined by the proposed new NZ PE avoidance rule which, inter alia, requires a tax avoidance purpose. No Not caught by any of the rules 5 Application date(s) The new rules apply for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. Detailed analysis PE anti-avoidance rule New section GB 54 deems a PE to exist in New Zealand for a non-resident if all the listed criteria in section GB 54(1) are met. These criteria are discussed below. The non-resident is, or is part of, a large multinational group - paragraph (j) A large multinational group is defined in section YA 1 of the Act to require a consolidated accounting group turnover of at least EUR €750m (being the threshold described in paragraph 5.53 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines) for the previous period. This revenue threshold was agreed by the OECD as a way to define large multinational groups for the purpose of filing Country-by-Country reports. The mult inat ional must also have a member in New Zealand (or income with a source in New Zealand) and a member overseas to be a “large multinational group” under the definit ion. The non-resident makes a supply of goods or services to a person in New Zealand - paragraph (a) The definit io n o f “supply” from the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 will apply for this purpose. In addition the relevant supply may be made by the non-resident either: • directly to a person in New Zealand; or • to another person in New Zealand (the intermediary) under an arrangement that includes the intermediary on-supplying the goods to another person in New Zealand. The intermediary does not need to be associated or otherwise related to the non-resident. The provision for intermediaries is intended to include third-party channel provider arrangements within the scope of the rule. Specifically, the provision is intended to ensure the rule can cover the sale by a non-resident to a third party where that sale is part of an arrangement under which those same goods or services are to be on-so ld by the third party to an identified customer, and the non-resident’s facilitator deals with the end-customers to bring the particular sale about. Figure 4 illustrates this kind of arrangement (with the “Related party” in figure 4 being the facilitator). 6 Figure 4 N on-res id en t Sa le of go ods Third party channel provider Sa le of go ods Related party 10 0% owner ship Sales p rom otion and ser vices Customer The customer must be known to the facilitator at the time the non-resident makes its supply to the recipient for this rule to apply. This is to ensure that only arrangements involving an identifiable customer are caught by the rule. There can be good commercial reasons for third-party channel provider arrangements. However, they should also give rise to a PE for the non-resident in respect of its sale to the third party in appropriate circumstances. This is because under such an arrangement, the non-resident, the facilitator, and the third party are working together to sell the particular goods or services to the end customer. Further, the non-resident’s sale to the third party is wholly dependent on the customer agreeing to purchase the goods. This means that the facilitator’s activities are made in relation to the non-resident’s sale to the third party as well as the third party’s on-sale to the end customer (which makes sense given that the facilitator acts for the non-resident, not the third party). Therefore, the activities of the non-resident’s facilitator should still be able to give rise to a PE for the non-resident (provided the other requirements of section GB 54 are met). Where section GB 54 does apply to deem a PE to exist in respect of a third party channel provider arrangement, only the supply by the non-resident to the intermediary, and the facilitator’s activit ies, will be attributed to the deemed PE for the purposes of determining the profit attributable to that PE. The supply by the third party channel provider to the customer, and the activities of the third party channel provider, will not be attributed to the deemed PE. A person (the “facilitator”) in New Zealand carries out in New Zealand an activity for the purposes of bringing about the supply - paragraph (b) The facilitator must carry on an activity for the purpose of bringing the supply about. It is intended that only activities designed to bring about a particular sale to an identifiable person should potentially result in a deemed PE. Therefore activities that do not relate to a particular sale, such as advertising and marketing, would not be sufficient to trigger a possible PE under this requirement. After-sales activities, such as technical support, would also not be sufficient to meet this requirement, as they occur after the supply has been made. 7 The kinds of activities that are within the intended scope of this provision primarily include activities designed to convince a particular customer to acquire the supply. Paragraph GB 54(1)(b) specifies that the facilitator cannot also be the intermediary. This is to ensure that section GB 54(1)(b) does cause section GB 54 to apply to an ordinary distributor arrangement. In an ordinary distributor arrangement, the distributor would be carrying out all the particular sales activities on its own behalf, rather than on the non-resident’s behalf (and the non-resident would not have a separate facilitator in New Zealand assisting with the sales). Accordingly, in these circumstances the distributor’s activities should not give rise to a PE for the non-resident. The facilitator is associated, an employee, or commercially dependent on the non- resident - paragraph (c) Section GB 54 is aimed at circumstances where the facilitator is part of the same economic or control group as the non-resident. It is these circumstances which allow the multinational to avoid having a PE by splitting its activities between related companies (the non-resident supplier and the facilitator). Accordingly, for the section to apply, the facilitator must be associated with the non-resident under paragraph (c). The same concern also arises where the non-resident’s sales activities are carried out by a New Zealand entity that is not associated with the non-resident, but is commercially dependent on it. In this case, the non-resident is also able to have sales activities carried out by a special purpose entity over which it has significant de-facto control (by virtue of its commercial dependency). Accordingly, paragraph (c) also applies in these circumstances. The concept of “commercially dependent” is subjective. Therefore paragraph (c) instead uses the more precise test of whether the facilitator derives more than eight y percent of its assessable income from the non-resident or its associates in both the current and preceding income years. The requirement for the eighty percent test to be met for both years is to protect against the risk of a person unexpectedly falling within the definition for a year, which will give more certainty about when the test applies. It also ensures that a facilitator will not be commercially dependent in its first year of operation, when it is trying to build up its client base and may have a single customer only. For the sake of clarity, paragraph (c) also states that a facilitator includes an employee of the non-resident. This means that section GB 54 could potentially apply to “fly- in/fly-out” arrangements, where a non-resident sends one of its employees to New Zealand to undertake sales related activities. The reason for this is that there is no black letter rule in DTAs providing that fly in, fly out employees or representatives cannot give rise to a PE for a non-resident (in particular, there is no requirement in our DTAs for a dependent agent’s activities to be connected with a fixed and permanent place in New Zealand in order for them to give rise to a PE). Whether a PE arises is always a question of fact and circumstance. There may be some circumstances in which a fly in, fly out employee or representatives does give rise to a PE. Fly in, fly out employees and other representatives of the non-resident should therefore not be automatically excluded from section GB 54. Otherwise, a PE could still be avoided in a fly in and fly out arrangement. However, the dependent agent provision in most DTAs requires that the non-resident’s representative (that is, the employee) habitually concludes contracts on behalf of the 8 non-resident. This means that the employee’s activity in New Zealand must be regular to some degree before it can potentially result in the avoidance of any tax under section GB 54(1)(h). For example if an employee of the non-resident only made a short visit to New Zealand in order to promote or negotiate a single sale, we would not expect this to result in the avoidance of any tax under section GB 54(1)(h) (as the employee’s activity would not have given rise to a PE under the DTA even if the employee had executed the contract in New Zealand). Therefore, we would not expect section GB 54 to apply in this case. As a result of paragraph (c), any sales-related activity carried on by an unrelated independent agent will generally not give rise to a PE under section GB 54. This also reflects the current definition of a PE in New Zealand’s DTAs. The activity is more than preparatory or auxiliary - paragraph (d) As stated above, only activities that are designed to bring about a particular sale should be within the scope of section GB 54. To support this, paragraph (d) provides that any activities that are only preparatory or auxiliary to the non-resident’s supply of goods or services do not trigger the application of section GB 54. An example of preparatory or auxiliary activities is general marketing or advertising of a non-resident’s products. Warehousing and delivery of the supplied goods would also usually be preparatory or auxiliary. However, this would not be the case for example where the main business activity of the non-resident was delivering goods. Paragraph (d) is also intended to incorporate the exception in most DTAs, which provides that preparatory and auxiliary activities do not give rise to a PE. Therefore in interpreting the meaning of “preparatory or auxiliary” in paragraph (d), it is intended that the OECD’s Commentary on the articles of the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (OECD Commentary) will be relevant. The following table sets out examples of when paragraphs GB 54(1)(a) to GB 54(1)(d) (collectively referred to as the “sales test”) would apply. Even if the sales test is met for an example, section GB 54 would apply only if the section’s remaining requirements were met (in particular, the requirement that the relevant arrangement was carried out for a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance). 9 New Zealand activity Application of the sales test in paragraphs GB 54(1)(a)–(d) There is no activity in New Zealand in relation to the sale. The sales test is not satisfied. There is no “facilitator” under paragraph (b). There is an online platform operated by a subsidiary of the non-resident through which New Zealand customers can order goods over the internet. The web-server for the platform is located in Australia and the platform is maintained and run by staff located in Australia. The sales test is not satisfied. Although the platform can be accessed by customers located in New Zealand, all the activity in respect of the platform is carried on by the subsidiary’s employees and assets in Australia. Accordingly, paragraph (b) is not met as the subsidiary does not carry on any activity in New Zealand. A non-resident operates a website through which customers worldwide can order goods and services. The website is located and maintained outside New Zealand. General advertising and marketing activity is undertaken in New Zealand by a subsidiary of the non-resident to make potential users of the website aware of its benefits and uses. The subsidiary does not deal directly with any particular customers. In this case, there is an activity carried on in New Zealand, however the activity does not facilitate a particular supply to a customer. Accordingly paragraph (b) is not met. In addition advertising and marketing activities are considered to be preparatory or auxiliary to making a supply. Consequently paragraph (d) also is not met. A non-resident sells technical equipment to New Zealand customers. It has a subsidiary in New Zealand which undertakes technical demonstrations of the equipment to existing or potential customers to make them aware of the equipment’s capabilities. The subsidiary does not discuss any of the sales terms or customise orders for a particular customer. The sales test is not satisfied. The subsidiary’s activity is in the nature of general advertising / marketing and does not relate to a particular supply to a customer. Accordingly paragraph (b) is not met. In addition, the subsidiary’s activities would also be preparatory or auxiliary, so paragraph (d) is not met either. However, if the subsidiary went beyond demonstrating the equipment and instead worked with a particular customer to specify the equipment best suited to the customer’s needs, and/or directly persuade the particular customer to acquire the equipment, then the subsidiary’s activity would relate to any subsequent supply of that specified equipment to the customer, and so paragraph (b) would be met. Such an activity would also be more than preparatory or auxiliary, and so paragraph (d) would be met. Accordingly the sales test would be met in these circumstances. A non-resident company offers a horse-riding platform, under which owners of horses in New Zealand can contract with riders to supply their horses for a fixed period. The platform is accessed via a smartphone app, with the server and all staff responsible for maintaining it are located outside New Zealand. The non-resident company does have a su bsidiary in New Zealand, which assists horse-owners in meeting the requirements to list their horses on the platform. However the subsidiary does not liaise with any horse riders. The sales test is not satisfied. The activity of the subsidiary is essentially technical support for horse owners that have already decided they want to join the platform. Accordingly it is preparatory or auxiliary to the supply of platform services by the non-resident. However, if the subsidiary instead persuaded individual horse-owners to sign up to the platform, then the sales test would be met in respect of the platform’s recurring supply of services to the horse owner. A non-resident supplies photocopiers to New Zealand businesses. Its sale team is located offshore. However the non-resident has a subsidiary in New Zealand which provides technical support to existing customers . The subsidiary repairs malfunctioning photocopiers as part of the non-resident’s warranty programme and trains new purchasers on how to use the photocopiers. The sales test is not satisfied. The subsidiary’s activity of providing repairs and training is made after the non- resident’s supply has occurred, and therefore is not made for the purpose of bringing about the supply. This is the case even though the promise to provide such repairs and training may have encouraged the New Zealand businesses to acquire the photocopiers. A non-resident has a subsidiary in New Zealand. The non-resident sells cars to the subsidiary. The The sales test is not met. The subsidiary is a normal distributor, rather than a facilitator for the sale of 10 subsidiary then markets and sells the cars to customers in New Zealand. Sometimes a customer requests a car with specifications that the subsidiary does not stock. In this case, the subsidiary enters into a contract to sell the car to the customer, and then buys that car from the non- resident for on-supply to the customer. cars by the non-resident to New Zealand customers. In particular the subsidiary is not acting as an intermediary for the sale of the cars by the non-resident. This is because there is not a single arrangement under which the non-resident supplies the cars to the subsidiary and the subsidiary on- supplies the cars to the customer. Inst ead there are two arrangements – one for the sale of the cars to the subsidiary, and another for the sale of the cars by the subsidiary to the customer. It does not matter in this regard whether the subsidiary acquires the car before or after it agrees to sell that car to the customer. A multinational has a New Zealand subsidiary, whose staff have initial and on-going contact with customers. The subsidiary negotiates the contractual terms for the first sale to the customer. However orders after the first are placed directly with the offshore sales representative. The sales test will be met for the first order. Whether the sales test is met for subsequent orders will depend on whether the subsequent sales are part of the same arrangement as the sale that was facilitated by the subsidiary. For example, if the subsidiary negotiated an arrangement under which the New Zealand customer could make repeat orders of paper from the non- resident, then the sales test would be met in respect of any repeat orders even if the customer sent the order directly to the offshore sales representative. However if for example the subsidiary fac ilitated an order for one product sold by the non-resident, but then the New Zealand customer ordered a completely different product and negotiated the terms of sale for that product with the offshore sales representative directly, then the sales test would not be met for that different product. A non-resident has a subsidiary in New Zealand that discusses a potential sale by the non-resident with targeted customers and ensures that the non- resident’s contractual terms for the sale are acceptable to the customer. The sales test is met. The subsidiary is carrying out an activity in respect of a particular supply and the activity is undertaken for the purpose of bringing that supply about. A non-resident does not have a subsidiary in New Zealand. Instead the non-resident sends one of its employees to New Zealand for 4 weeks every year to meet with potential customers. The employee markets the non-resident’ s products to potential customers and answers any questions they may have about the operation of the products. However the employee does not discuss contractual terms and does not help customise particular orders for customers. The employee in this case is a facilitator for the non-resident under paragraph (c)(i). However, the employee’s activity does not relate to a particular supply by the non-resident, so paragraph (b) is not met. In addition, the employee’s activities are preparatory or auxiliary, so paragraph (d) also is not met. However if the employee instead worked with a particular customer to specify the products best suited to the customer’s needs and/or negotiated contractual terms for the supply of those products, then the employee’s activity would relate to the subsequent supply of those products to the customer, and so paragraph (b) would be met. Such an activity would also be more than preparatory or auxiliary, and so paragraph (d) would also be met. Accordingly, the sales test would be met. A non-resident supplies home theatre components to custom installers in New Zealand. The custom installers work with customers to design their home theatres, and on-sell the home theatre components to the customers as part of the installation of the agreed design. The non-resident also has a subsidiary in New Zealand. For large projects, the non- resident’s subsidiary works with both the custom installer and the customer to determine the The intent of the rules is for the sales test to be met for large projects (but not for smaller projects that do not involve the subsidiary working with the customer installer and the customer). The non- resident’s subsidiary is the facilitator in this example. The non-resident makes a supply to an intermediary in New Zealand (the custom installer) who in turn on-sells the products to another person in New Zealand (the customer). The facilitator (the 11 The non-resident is relying on a DTA that does not include the OECD’s new PE definition – paragraph (e) As discussed above, the OECD has introduced a new PE definition to counter PE avoidance. This new PE definition has been included in its Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (Model Treaty), and will also be inserted into the DTAs of participating countries under the MLI (provided both jurisdictions elect to include it). The OECD’s new PE definition has several components. The relevant component here is that contained in article 12(1) of the MLI. In particular, the part of article 12(1) providing that a dependent agent PE will arise for a non-resident where a person habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts by the non- resident that are routinely concluded without material modificat ion. The Government’s view is that this amended definition should be sufficient to prevent the kind of PE avoidance we have seen in New Zealand. It is also expected that section GB 54 and the OECD’s new PE definition will apply in broadly similar circumstances. For this reason, paragraph (e) provides that section GB 54 will not apply where the non- resident’s income from its supplies to New Zealand customers is covered by a DTA which incorporates the OECD’s new PE rule. It does not matter for this purpose whether the OECD’s new PE rule is inserted into the DTA by the MLI, or is subsequently agreed by New Zealand and the other party in bilateral treaty negotiations. The domestic law definition of a PE does not apply to a non-resident – paragraph (f) New section YD 4B(3) inserts a definition of a PE into the Act for non-residents to whom no DTA with New Zealand applies. This domestic definition includes the OECD’s new PE definit io n. Accordingly, paragraph (f) provides that section GB 54 does not apply if the non-resident is subject to the domestic definition of a PE under section YD 4B(3). The income from the supply is not already attributable to a PE – paragraph (g) This is a mechanical provision. If the non-resident’s income is already attributable to a PE, then there should not be any PE avoidance occurring in respect of that income. Accordingly, paragraph (g) provides that section GB 54 will not apply in these circumstances. The arrangement does not have a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance – paragraphs (h) and (i) In order for section GB 54 to apply, the relevant arrangement must have a more than merely incidental purpose of avoiding tax under paragraphs (h) and (i). This requirement has been inserted for two reasons: customer’s needs, select the products best suited to those needs, and provide expert technical oversight on their installation. The non- resident still supplies the home-theatre components to the custom- installer, who on-supplies them to the customer. subsidiary) carries out an activity for the purpose of bringing about the sale to the recipient (the customer). Finally, the supply by the non-resident to the custom installer, and the supply by the custom installer to the customer, are both part of the same arrangement. 12 • to target the rule’s application at BEPS activities, rather than more ordinary commercial arrangements; and • to make the rule consistent with New Zealand’s DTA obligations. The OECD Commentary states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between anti- avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA (as discussed further below under “other matters”). Tax for this purpose means both New Zealand tax, and a combination of New Zealand tax and foreign tax. This is to prevent any argument that an arrangement’s avoidance of New Zealand tax was only incidental to its avoidance of foreign tax. The general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) in section BG 1 also requires that an arrangement has a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. However, in applying the GAAR, the courts have imposed a further requirement that the arrangement uses the relevant provisions in a manner not contemplated by Parliament (see Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115). This further requirement arises out of the need to reconcile Parliament’s purpose for the specific tax provisions (which may have been intended to confer a benefit in the circumstances) with its purpose for section BG 1 (see Ben Nevis at \[102\]). This further requirement is usually referred to as the ‘Parliamentary contemplation test’. Section GB 54 is a specific anti-avoidance provision, rather than a GAAR. Further, the scope of section GB 54 has been carefully circumscribed. For these reasons, there is no need to reconcile the application of section GB 54 with the intended application of any other provisions. Instead, the intention is for only the merely incidental purpose test to be used in determining whether section GB 54 applies. It is not intended for the Parliamentary contemplation test (or the earlier scheme and purpose test) to also apply. Subparagraphs (h) and (i) have been drafted to achieve this. It would not be appropriate to refer directly to the Parliamentary contemplation test in the legislation, as this is a judicial rather than a statutory requirement (and so might change in the future). Instead, the subparagraph has been drafted without reference to the definitions of “tax avoidance arrangement” or “tax avoidance” used by section BG 1. This is to make it clear that the test under subparagraphs (h) and (i) does not import the Parliamentary contemplat io n test (or the earlier scheme and purpose test) associated with those definitions. Only the case law relevant to whether there is a more than merely incidental purpose or effect of tax avoidance should apply (for example, excluding any Parliamentary contemplation or scheme and purpose component of the test under the GAAR) in determining whether the more than merely incidental purpose test in subparagraphs (h) and (i) is met. There is a significant body of case law on the merely incidental test. This case-law has generally required a degree of artificiality or contrivance before the test can apply (see the decision of Woodhouse P in Challenge Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513 (CA)). In particular, the test has been held not to apply to ordinary commercial arrangements (i.e. arrangements undertaken for commercial purposes only). More information on the application of the merely incidental test is set out in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, paragraphs 395– 438. 13 An example of the application of section GB 54 is set out below. The facts of this example are loosely based the French Valueclick tax case, in which the non-resident was held not to have a PE under the French/Irish DTA (Sté Valueclick Ltd., n° 17PA01538 (CAA Paris, 9e ch., 1 March 2018)). Example A non-resident (Parent) operates a business of personalised digital marketing, allowing brands to connect with consumers individually. Parent is part of a large multinational group, with consolidated global revenues well in excess of €750 million. Parent is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA, but that DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s new PE article. Parent has a subsidiary in New Zealand (Subsidiary), whose purpose is to promote Parent’s services in the New Zealand market. Subsidiary contractually agrees to provide the following services to Parent: - marketing and sales support, which includes the identification and prospection of potential customers; - ongoing management services and back office support services; and - administrative assistance, including accounting, human resources management, information technology and treasury. Subsidiary’s employees in practice negotiate the terms of the sales agreements and draft certain key terms with the customers. In addition, Subsidiary’s employees behave towards customers as if they were representatives of the Parent. Subsidiary’s employees legally cannot bind or otherwise act in the name of Parent. The acceptance of the customer contract always requires Parent to sign the contract offshore. In practice however the signature is an automatic validation of the contracts negotiated and developed by the employees of Subsidiary. Applying section GB 54 to this case: - There is a non-resident (Parent) making supplies to a person in New Zealand (the customers). Consequently, paragraph GB 54 (1)(a) is met. - A facilitator (Subsidiary) carries on an activity in New Zealand for the purpose of bringing about those supplies under an arrangement with the non-resident (Parent). Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(b) is met. - The facilitator (Subsidiary) is associated with the non-resident (Parent), as it is a 100% subsidiary of Parent. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(c) is met. - Subsidiary carries our significant sales activities for Parent. Accordingly, Subsidiary’s activities are more than preparatory for, or auxiliary to, Parent’s supplies. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(d) is met. - Parent’s income from the supply is subject to a DTA, but that DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s latest PE definition (as set out in article 12(1) of the MLI). Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(e) is met. - Section YD 4B(3) incorporates a definition of a PE into domestic law, but only for non-residents that are not subject to a DTA. In this case, Parent’s income from the supply is subject to a DTA, and so section YD 4B(3) does not apply to Parent. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(f) is met. - The non-resident does not already have a PE in New Zealand. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(g) is met. - The arrangement results in the non-resident paying less tax in New Zealand compared to if the non- resident had a PE in New Zealand. Consequently, paragraph GB 54(1)(h) is met. 14 - The non-resident is part of a large multinational group, as that term is defined in section YA 1. This is because Parent’s consolidated accounting group has: - over EUR €750 of revenue for the preceding income year; - a member resident in New Zealand (Subsidiary); and - a member resident overseas (Parent). Therefore, section GB 54(1)(j) is met. As a result, section GB 54 will apply if the reduction in tax for the Parent is a more than a merely incidental purpose of the arrangement between Parent and Subsidiary. In determining whether this test is met, previous case law on the more than merely incidental component of the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 will be applicable. The Commissioner’s interpretation of this case law is set out in her Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 Tax Avoidance and the Interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (particularly paragraphs 395–438). However, the Parliamentary contemplation component of the general anti-avoidance rule will not apply. In applying the more than merely incidental test to the arrangement, it is significant that all the sales activity is carried out by Subsidiary in New Zealand. Parent’s only role is the pro-forma execution of the contracts negotiated by Subsidiary. There is no convincing commercial purpose for the non-resident to formally execute the contracts offshore when it was not involved in negotiating the contracts. In addition, the legal form of the arrangement does not reflect its substance. This is because in reality Subsidiary creates the customer contracts in New Zealand. The formal execution of the customer contracts by Parent offshore is thus artificial. It is also this feature that also allows Parent to avoid having a PE in New Zealand, and so allows the non-resident to avoid tax in New Zealand. Accordingly it can be objectively concluded that Parent’s execution of the contracts offshore was inserted into the arrangement for the purpose of avoiding New Zealand tax. Consequently this tax avoidance purpose is not merely incidental to another purpose of the arrangement. Therefore, the arrangement has a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance, and so paragraph GB 54(1)(i) is met. As a result, section GB 54 will apply to the arrangement. Consequences of application (sections GB 54(2), BH 1(4)) If section GB 54 applies, then under section GB 54(2) the non-resident is treated as having a PE in New Zealand. Supplies made by the non-resident are then treated as being made though that PE – but only if section GB 54(2) applies to those particular supplies. So for example, if the non-resident made some supplies in New Zealand in respect of which a related entity in New Zealand carried out sales activities (and the other requirements of the rule were met), then those supplies would be treated as made through the PE. However, if the non-resident also made other supplies in New Zealand and no related entity in New Zealand carried out any sales related activities in respect of those supplies, then those supplies would not be treated as made through the deemed PE for tax purposes. The activities of the facilitator in relation to the supplies will also be attributed to the PE for the purposes of determining the profit attributable to it (and so the taxable income in New Zealand). The normal PE profit attribution rules apply to determine the amount of profits attributable to the deemed PE under section GB 54. In this regard, New Zealand follows an earlier version of the OECD’s latest PE profit attribution rules (known as the “authorised OECD approach”, or AOA). This is for two reasons: 1. The AOA only applies to DTAs which incorporate the latest version of Article 7 (business profits) of the Model Treaty. None of New Zealand’s DTAs incorporate this version of Article 7, so the AOA is not relevant to New Zealand’s DTAs. 15 2. New Zealand does not agree with some aspects of the AOA and has made an explicit reservation against it. DTAs, as international agreements, do not have any legislative effect except to the extent provided for in domestic legislation. DTAs are given legislative effect for tax purposes by section BH 1(4) of the Income Tax Act. This provides that DTAs have effect, despite anything else in the Act (subject to a list of exceptions). To make it clear that section GB 54 overrides any applicable DTA, the Act amends section BH 1(4) to include section GB 54 in the list of sections in respect of which a DTA does not have overriding effect. This means that section GB 54 will deem a PE to exist for all the purposes of the Income Tax Act and any applicable DTA, notwithstanding anything in that DTA. It is important to note that section GB 54 on its own simply deems a PE to exist. It does not directly impose any tax or deem any assessable income to arise. Instead, the tax consequences of a deemed PE will be determined under the other provisions of the Income Tax Act and any applicable DTA. Example Section GB 54 applies to a non-resident subject to the New Zealand-Australia DTA. Consequently: • The taxpayer is deemed to have a PE for the purposes of that DTA under Article 5. • The business profits article of the DTA (Article 7) applies to allow New Zealand to tax the profits attributable to that PE. • The ordinary tax rules apply on the basis that the taxpayer has a PE in New Zealand. In particular, new section YD 4(17C) deems the income attributable to the PE to have a New Zealand source. • The PE under section GB 54 exists for the purposes of any other provision of the DTA. For example, it is deemed to exist for the purposes of Article 12(5) of the DTA. This means that New Zealand could impose NRWT on any royalties paid by the non-resident that are borne by or deductible in calculating the profits of the PE. In this regard the Act also inserts new section YD 4(17D), which provides that income has a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax it under an applicable DTA. Accordingly if New Zealand was entitled to impose NRWT on royalties under Article 12(5) in respect of the deemed PE, then those royalties would also have a New Zealand source under article YD 4(17D). This means that the royalties would also be subject to NRWT under the Income Tax Act. • Items of income that are dealt with by other articles of a DTA will continue to be taxed in accordance with those other articles. This is because any conflicts between the tax treatment under a specific article (assuming the existence of a PE) and the tax treatment under Article 7 are dealt with under Article 7(5) of the DTA. Article 7(5) provides that the provisions of the other articles are not affected by the provisions of Article 7. For example, an Australian resident’s profits from shipping and air transport would continue to be dealt with under Article 8 of the DTA (rather than Article 7), even if section GB 54 applied to deem the non-resident to have a PE in New Zealand in respect of that activity. Other matters The Government anticipates that some multinationals may wish to restructure their New Zealand operations in response to section GB 54. One of the policy goals of section GB 54 is to encourage taxpayers to move away from PE avoidance structures. Therefore, the Government is happy for taxpayers to restructure their New Zealand operations in response to section GB 54 by either adopting a formal PE, or by moving to a standard 16 distributor model (where the goods or services are sold by the non-resident to an associated party in New Zealand, who then on-sells the goods to unrelated customers). Section GB 54 applies for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The standard income year for taxpayers starts on 1 April (see the definition of “income year” and “tax year” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). This means that non-residents to whom section GB 54 will also have income years starting on 1 April (meaning section GB 54 will apply to them from 1 April 2019), unless they have applied to the Commissioner for a different balance date under section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Non-residents to whom section GB 54 applies may wish to change their New Zealand income year to align it with their financial reporting period. The Commissioner’s policy on requests to change balance dates for income years is set out in standard practice statement SPS 18/02 Requests to change a Balance Date. The statement notes that the Commissioner will accept retrospective requests to change balance dates provided certain criteria are met. While section GB 54 will override DTAs, it should not conflict with New Zealand’s obligations under those DTAs. This is because New Zealand’s DTAs are based on the OECD’s Model Treaty. The OECD Commentary is an important part of the context in which these DTAs are internationally understood. Section GB 54 is an anti-avoidance provision, as it only applies to an arrangement with a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. The OECD Commentary states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between such anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. It also confirms that states are not obliged to grant the benefits of a DTA if the DTA has been abused (noting that this should not be lightly assumed). However, it is important that section GB 54 applies notwithstanding anything in a DTA. This is to simplify the application of the rule. Otherwise it would be necessary to show that the application of section GB 54 was consistent with a DTA in each particular case. This would be a time-consuming and resource intensive exercise. The Government also considers that taxpayers should not be able to rely on DTAs to protect their tax avoidance arrangements. This is the same position that the UK and Australia have taken in respect of their PE anti-avoidance rules. Finally, the Government expects section GB 54 to apply in broadly similar circumstances to the OECD’s new PE definition. However, there will be differences in the application of the two rules, due to their different formulations. PE source rule Section YD 4(17C) Under the new source rule in section YD 4(17C), inco me of a non-resident will have a New Zealand source if it is attributable to a PE in New Zealand. This is subject to exceptions for certain dividends and income already subject to a specific source rule. Dividends are excluded from section YD 4(17C), provided they are paid on a share in a foreign company that is not revenue account property. The reason for this exclusion is so that income earned overseas by a subsidiary of a non-resident does not become not subject to New Zealand tax just because the shareholding of the subsidiary is managed 17 by the New Zealand PE. However where the shares are held for the purpose of resale (or are otherwise on revenue account), then the dividends will be attributable to the New Zealand PE. This is because such shares will be investment property of the PE (rather than part of its operating structure), and so any returns in respect of them should be assessable. Officials plan to consider whether this exclusion for dividends should be limited to active income earned by the foreign company (as determined under the CFC rules). This is to address a concern that non-residents could avoid New Zealand tax by shifting passive income out of the New Zealand PE and into an overseas subsidiary that is still managed by the PE. Officials were aware of this concern when the Act was passed, however there was insufficient time to consult on the fairly complex legislation that would be needed to include an active/passive distinction. Officials will consult on proposals to introduce an active/passive distinction before any further legislative action is taken. Income with a source under section YD 4(17C) has its own apportionment rule under new section YD 5B. However the Income Tax Act currently has specific source apportionment rules for income from sea transport (sections YD 4(15) and YD 6), non- resident general insurers (sections YD 4(16) and YD 8(2)) and non-resident life insurers (sections YD 4(17) and EY 48). The intention is for these specific apportionment rules to still apply to income from these sources, rather than the PE income apportionment rule in section YD 5B. To allow for this, the new source rule in section YD 4(17C) is stated to be subject to sections YD 4(15) to YD 4(17). Section YD 4B Section YD 4(17C) only applies if a taxpayer has a PE in New Zealand. New section YD 4B inserts a definition of a PE into the Act for this purpose. Under section YD 4B: • If a New Zealand DTA applies in respect of the taxpayer, then: o The definition of a PE in that particular DTA will be used (section YD 4B(2)). The effect of this will be that where income is attributable to a PE in New Zealand under an applicable DTA, that income will automatically have a New Zealand source under section YD 4(17C). o Any PE arising under section GB 54 will also be a PE, as defined under section YD 4B(2). However section GB 54 only applies if the relevant DTA does not incorporate the OECD’s new PE definition (section GB 54(1)(e)). • If no New Zealand DTA applies to the taxpayer, then the new definition of a PE in schedule 23 of the Income Tax Act will apply. The PE definition in schedule 23 is based on New Zealand’s model PE article, and incorporates the OECD’s new PE definit io n. New section YD 4B(4) has been inserted to clarify that the OECD Commentary should be used as a guide in interpreting the definition of a PE in schedule 23. However, the OECD Commentary does not itself have legislative effect. Therefore, the guidance in the OECD Commentary should not be applied in contradiction to the words of schedule 23. 18 In particular, the OECD Commentary applies in respect of the OECD’s model PE definition, which the definition in schedule 23 departs from in some areas. In addit io n, New Zealand has made reservations and observations on the Commentary to the PE definit ion (Art icle 5). The OECD Commentary should therefore be used as a guide subject to these differences, reservations and observat ions. It is the OECD Commentary, as amended at the start of the relevant income year, which is to be used as a guide in interpreting schedule 23. This version of the OECD Commentary may be later than the version applying at the commencement of the Act. Section YD 5B Under section YD 4(17C), it is only income attributable to the New Zealand PE that has a New Zealand source. New section YD 5B sets out how both the income and the expenses attributable to a PE are to be determined. This section has been drafted to replicate the wording of the business profits articles of most of New Zealand’s DTAs (adjusted to reflect differences in terminology between the Income Tax Act and DTAs). Accordingly, whether income and expenditure are attributable to a PE for the purposes of section YD 5B should be determined under the normal PE profit attribution principles (as applied by New Zealand). As noted above, New Zealand does not follow the AOA for PE profit attribut ion. The AOA also only applies in respect of the latest version of the business profits article in the OECD’s Model Treaty. Section YD 5B has been deliberately worded to follow the earlier version of the business profits article, and not the latest version in respect of which the AOA applies. Accordingly the AOA should not apply to determine the profit attributable to a PE under section YD 5B. Instead, the earlier version of the OECD’s profit attribution method currently followed by New Zealand should be used. It is important to note that sections YD 4(17C) and YD 5B determine the amount of income and expenditure attributed to the PE. They do not determine whether such income and expenditure is assessable or deductible. This will be determined under the Income Tax Act’s usual assessability and deductibility rules. This is the same tax treatment as for a PE under the DTA. In particular, the deductibility of expenses attributed to a PE under the DTA is also determined under the Income Tax Act’s general deductibility rules (see paragraphs 30–34 of the OECD Commentary to Article 7). Section YD 5(1BA) The Income Tax Act 2007 already contains a source apportionment rule in section YD 5 for income from carrying on business in New Zealand (section YD 4(2)) or making or performing a contract in New Zealand (section YD 4(3)). A PE in New Zealand will also usually derive income from carrying on business in New Zealand or making or performing contracts in New Zealand. Accordingly without amendment section YD 5 would also apply to apportion the income attributable to a PE. Consequently, section YD 5(1BA) has been inserted to confirm that, where there is a PE, the PE attribution rules in new section YD 5B should be used, rather than the existing apportionment rules in section YD 5. 19 It is not expected that there would be material differences in the amount of income apportioned to New Zealand under section YD 5B and section YD 5. However, one of the purposes of section YD 4(17C) is to simplify the taxation of income attributable to a PE, by not requiring taxpayers and Inland Revenue to apply two sets of rules (the DTA rules and the domestic source rules). Consequently, section YD 5B has been inserted to remove any doubt that the PE profit attribution methodology which applies under the DTA should also be used in the domestic source rules. Example S Co is a company resident in Panama. It carries on a shipping business, and has an office in New Zealand through which it enters into contracts to ship goods from New Zealand around the world. It also imports its own goods into New Zealand on its ships and sells them through a retail shop located under its offices. Whether S Co has a PE in New Zealand is determined under section YD 4B. Because Panama and New Zealand do not have a double tax agreement, the permanent establishment definition in schedule 23 will apply (under section YD 4B(3)). S Co should use the OECD Commentary on article 5 as a guide in determining whether S Co has a PE under the definition in schedule 23, as the OECD Commentary was at the beginning of that income year. For S Co’s 2017–18 income year, this means that it should ignore the amendments made to article 5 of the OECD Commentary part way through 2017. It is clear that S Co has two PEs in New Zealand under the schedule 23 definition, as it has two fixed places of business in New Zealand through which it carries on its shipping and its retail businesses. Therefore S Co has a separate PE for each of those separate businesses. Under section YD 5B, S Co should determine the amount of profit attributable to its retail PE using New Zealand’s standard (non-AOA) approach to PE profit attribution. S Co can use the relevant parts of the OECD’s guidance on PE profit attribution for this purpose. In particular, since section YD 5B does not incorporate the wording needed to implement the authorised OCED approach (AOA) to profit attribution, none of the OECD guidance relating to the AOA will be applicable. \[Inland Revenue will shortly issue guidance on what parts of the OECD’s profit attribution guidance are relevant for New Zealand.\] Once S Co has determined the profit attributable to the retail PE, the amount of income and expenditure comprising that profit will automatically have a New Zealand source under sections YD 4(17C) and YD 5B. S Co will then need to apply the ordinary tax rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 for assessability, deductibility, and timing to that income and expenditure in order to calculate its taxable income for the year. In respect of S Co’s income from its shipping PE, the source of this income is specifically dealt under section YD 4(15) and YD 6. Income with a source under section YD 4(15) is specifically excluded from the application of section YD 4(17C). Therefore section YD 4(17C) will not apply to S Co’s shipping income (with section YD 4(15) applying instead). If S Co was resident in a country with which New Zealand had a DTA, then the tax treatment would be the same as above, except that: - whether S Co had a PE would be determined under the DTA itself (and section GB 54), rather than schedule 23 (see section YD 4B(2)); - S Co’s ability to tax the shipping PE’s income would be restricted by the terms of the DTA. For example, if the New Zealand/Australia DTA applied, article 8 of that DTA would prevent New Zealand from taxing S Co’s shipping activity. 20 DEEMED SOURCE RULE YD 4(17D) The Act inserts new section YD 4(17D) into the Income Tax Act 2007. The new subsection will deem an item of income to have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation if New Zealand has a right to tax that item of income under a DTA. There is an exclusion from this rule for dividends from shares in foreign companies that are not revenue account property. The new rules aim to both simplify the test for determining whether an item of income has a source in New Zealand, and ensure that all items o f inco me that New Zealand is entitled to tax under a DTA will be taxable under domestic law. Background Under our domestic law, New Zealand can only tax income if it has a source in New Zealand. Section YD 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out the types of income that are treated as having a source in New Zealand for income tax purposes. New Zealand has also entered into DTAs, which set out when New Zealand has a right to tax the income of a taxpayer resident in the counterparty to the DTA. These rules override anything in our source rules. This gives rise to two issues: • The DTA may give New Zealand a right to tax income of the non-resident. However that income may not have a New Zealand source under section YD 4. This means that New Zealand is unable to tax the income, despite the other country having agreed in the DTA that New Zealand may tax that income. • It is necessary to apply 2 sets of rules – one in the DTA and one in section YD 4, to determine whether New Zealand may tax an item of income. Australia has a rule deeming income which Australia may tax under its DTAs to have a source in Australia for domestic law purposes. Detailed analysis The Act inserts new subsection (17D) into section YD 4. The subsection deems an item of income to have a source in New Zealand if we have a right to tax the item of income under a DTA. There is an exclusion from this rule for dividends from shares in foreign companies that are not revenue account property. This is to preserve the exclusion fro m dividends under section YD 4(17C), discussed above. The apportionment rules for shipping in YD 6, non-resident general insurers in sect io n YD 8(2)) and non-resident life insurers in EY 48 should continue to apply in respect of income from those sources notwithstanding new subsection (17D). Application date The amendment applies for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. 21 HYBRID MISMATCH RULE FOR NRWT Sections BH 1(4), RF 11C New section RF 11C inserts a new hybrid mismatch rule allowing New Zealand to charge non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on payments under certain cross border hybrid financing instruments if New Zealand treats the payment as interest. This rule overrides our double tax agreements (DTAs). Background The Government has identified a further hybrid mismatch issue that arises in the following circumstances. The New Zealand PE of a non-resident company borrows money from another non- resident in the same overseas jurisdiction as the corporate headquarters of the PE. This occurs under a hybrid instrument which New Zealand treats as debt but the other country treats as shares. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is able to charge NRWT on interest payments made by a non-resident’s New Zealand PE to another non-resident. However, New Zealand is not able to charge NRWT on dividends paid by one non-resident company to another (regardless of whether the dividends are connected with a PE in New Zealand). This means that whether New Zealand can charge NRWT on payments under a hybrid financial instrument in these circumstances depends on whether the payments are classified as interest or dividends for DTA purposes. Inland Revenue’s view has been that New Zealand can charge NRWT on the payments on the basis that the source state’s (that is, New Zealand’s) classification of the payment determines its tax treatment under the DTA. However, a question has recently been raised as to whether this view is correct. If this view is not correct, then the PE would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for the payments (as the payments are characterised as “interest” under New Zealand domestic law), but the payments would not be subject to NRWT (as the payments are characterised as “dividends” under the DTA). This is contrary to the intent of the relevant DTA provisions, as outbound interest, which is deductible in determining the profits of a PE, should always have NRWT withheld unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise (for example, some of our DTAs provide specific exemptions to the sovereign wealth funds of the other country). The hybrid mismatch measures in the Act ensure that payments made under such hybrids cannot be both deductible in New Zealand and non-assessable overseas. This removes the incentive to use these types of hybrids in most, but not all cases. In particular the existing hybrid measures still permit payments under a hybrid financial instrument to be deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT in some cases. This tax treatment differs from that applying to either ordinary interest (which is deductible and subject to NRWT) or dividends (which are non-deductible), and could be attractive to some taxpayers. 22 Australia already has a rule effectively providing that outgoing payments are not dividends for DTA purposes (and so are subject to Australian NRWT) if they are treated as interest under Australia’s domestic law. 2 Application date(s) New section RF 11C applies retrospectively from 1 April 2008. A savings provision is available for payments where taxpayers have already adopted the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable in respect of such cross border interest payments made prior to the introduction of the Bill (on 6 December 2017). Key features The Act inserts new section RF 11C. Section RF 11C(1) provides that the section applies to a payment of interest (as defined in section YA 1) by a company that is resident outside New Zealand under an applicable DTA to another person who is also resident outside New Zealand under that DTA. Section RF 11C(2) then provides that the payment is treated as interest under the NRWT rules and the DTA, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the DTA. The Act also amends section BH 1(4) to clarify that section RF 11C overrides the applicable DTA. The combined effect of the legislation is that New Zealand may withhold NRWT from a cross border payment that is interest under section YA 1, regardless of whether it is treated as a dividend under the applicable DTA. 2 Section 3(2A) of Australia’s International Tax Agreements Act 1953 23
August 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Transfer pricing rules Sections GC 6 to GC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Summary of amendments 1 Application date 1 Key features 2 Background 2 Detailed analysis 3 GC 6(1): Purpose of the transfer pricing rules 3 GC 6(1B): Applying the OECD transfer pricing guidelines 4 GC 6(2)(b): Defining the related party arrangements to which the transfer pricing rules apply 5 GC 7 to GC 12 7 GC 13(1): Determining arm’s length amounts 7 GC 13(1)(b): Arm’s length conditions 8 GC 13(1B): Determination of identified transaction 9 GC 13(1C): No transaction or differing transaction 10 GC 13(2): Approved transfer pricing methods 11 Onus of proof shifted to the taxpayer 12 Documentation 13 Seven year time bar for transfer pricing issues in some circumstances 14 Summary of amendments Transfer pricing rules guard against multinationals using related-party arrangements to shift profits offshore by requiring the profits fro m these arrangements to be determined using the arm’s length conditions, including price, which unrelated parties would agree to use. Sections GC 6 and GC 13 have been amended to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. Application date The amendments to the transfer pricing rules generally apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. 1 Arrangements that comply with an Advance Pricing Agreement issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before 1 July 2018 will be grand-parented so they remain subject to the old transfer pricing rules until the Advance Pricing Agreement expires. Key features The Act makes the following amendments to New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation: • In addition to applying to transactions between associated persons, the transfer pricing rules will also apply when there are transactions between members of non-resident owning bodies and companies, and to cross-border related borrowings. (Section GC 6(2) (b)) • Including a reference to using the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines as guidance for how the transfer pricing rules are applied. (Section GC 6(1B)) • The economic substance and actual conduct of the parties, along with the legal contract, will inform the transfer pricing analysis. In certain circumstances, the economic substance and actual conduct will have priority over the terms of the legal contract. This is achieved by requiring the transfer pricing transaction to be “accurately delineated” using the approach in section D.1 of chapter I of the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines. (Section GC 13(1B)) • Where a transfer pricing arrangement is not commercially rational because it includes unrealistic terms that unrelated parties would not be willing to agree, the approach described in section D.2 of chapter I of the new OECD guidelines may apply to disregard and, if appropriate, replace the transaction. (Section GC 13(1C)) • Requiring the arm’s length amount of consideration to be determined using arm’s length conditions. This clarifies that it may be necessary to adjust some conditions of the arrangement other than the price, in order to determine the arm’s length price. (Section GC 13(1)(b)) • Placing the onus of proof onto the taxpayer for providing evidence (such as transfer pricing documentation) that their transfer pricing posit ions are correct (that is, they are determined using arm’s length conditions). The general onus of proof in section 149A(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will now apply to transfer pricing as well as other tax matters. • The time bar that limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position can be increased to seven years, in those cases where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has notified the taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation has commenced within the usual four-year time bar. (Section GC 13(6)) Background The OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines were substantially updated in 2017 as part of the OECD’s BEPS project. The updates to chapter I of the guidelines were designed to align transfer pricing outcomes wit h value creat ion (BEPS Act ions 8–10). The OECD has noted that the new guidance ensures that: 2 • actual business transactions undertaken by associated enterprises are identified, and transfer pricing is not based on contractual arrangements that do not reflect economic realit y; • contractual allocations of risk are respected only when they are supported by actual decisio n-making; • capital without functionality will generate no more than a risk-free return, assuring that no premium returns will be allocated to cash boxes without relevant substance; and • tax administrations may disregard transactions which are commercially irrational. The Act amends New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation to ensure New Zealand’s legislation aligns with the new OECD transfer pricing guidelines and that our rules remain effective at combatting BEPS. Other changes have been made to strengthen Inland Revenue’s ability to monitor and enforce the new transfer pricing rules. These changes include: • Putting the onus of proof onto the taxpayer for providing evidence (such as documentation) that their transfer pricing positions are correct (that is, they are determined using arm’s length conditions). • Allowing Inland Revenue to extend the time bar for assessing transfer pricing issues to seven years, in those cases where Inland Revenue has notified the taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation has commenced within the usual four-year time bar. • Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide Inland Revenue with additional powers to request information from large multinational groups in order to assist a tax investigation of the relevant multinational. These information changes are explained in the special report on administrative measures (see the section on “Requesting information from large multinational groups”). Detailed analysis GC 6(1): Purpose of the transfer pricing rules The purpose of the transfer pricing rules is to substitute an arm’s length amount of consideration if a person’s net income has been reduced by the conditions of a cross-border arrangement with a related party. The purpose statement in section GC 6(1) has been updated so it refers to the special rules for pricing cross-border related borrowing as well as the general transfer pricing rules for pricing the acquisition or supply of goods, services, or anything else. This reflects the fact that the transfer pricing rules now include some special rules for determining how cross-border related borrowing is priced. These rules are in sections GC 6(3B) and GC 15 to 19 and require certain adjustments to be made to the credit rating of the borrower and conditions of the financial arrangement, prior to the general transfer pricing rules in sections GC 6 to GC 14 being used to price the adjusted financial arrangement. The special rules for cross-border related borrowing are explained in the special report on interest limitat ion (see the section on “Cross-border related borrowing”). 3 GC 6(1B): Applying the OECD transfer pricing guidelines New Zealand has contributed to and applied the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines since they were first published in 1995. As transfer pricing practices have become more sophisticated, the OECD through its BEPS work has updated its guidelines to represent the agreed international best practice. Subsection GC 6(1B) has been added so that New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation explicitly refers to the OECD transfer pricing guidelines by requiring the transfer pricing rules in sections GC 6 to GC 14 to be applied consistently with these guidelines. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines are defined in section YA 1 as the guidelines published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as OECD 2017, OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2017, OECD Publishing, Paris. This definition refers to the July 2017 edition of the guidelines available on the OECD’s website at http://www.oecd.org/tax/transfer-pricing . The general policy intention is that when a taxpayer has correctly applied the OECD transfer pricing guidelines to perform a transfer pricing analysis that demonstrates that their transfer pricing posit ions satisfy the arm’s length principle, they should have a reasonable degree of certainty that these tax posit ions will also meet the requirements of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules. However, the guidelines still need to be applied in conjunction with New Zealand’s legislation as there are some specific rules in New Zealand’s legislation which are addit io nal to the guidance material in the OECD transfer guidelines. For example, the OECD transfer pricing guidelines were developed to provide guidance for how to apply Article 9 of the OECD model double tax agreement to “associated enterprises” as defined in that Article. New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation applies to a wider range of cross-border related party arrangements (as is further explained in section GC 6(2)(b) below). Another area where New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules are more prescriptive is that New Zealand’s legislation has special rules that must be used for determining how cross-border related borrowing is priced. These rules are in sections GC 6(3B) and GC 15 to 19 and can require certain adjustments to be made to the credit rating of the borrower and conditions of the financial arrangement, prior to the general transfer pricing rules in sections GC 6 to GC 14 (and the OECD transfer pricing guidelines) being used to price the adjusted financial arrangement. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines are periodically updated by the OECD and New Zealand participates in developing the updated guidelines. When these updates occur, we will review the revisions to the guidelines with a view to updating the definition of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines in section YA 1 so it refers to the latest version of the guidelines. Future taxation bills would be used to include these updates to the definition in section YA 1. In many cases the updates to the guidelines clarify or provide further guidance on existing concepts, rather than introducing significant new concepts or practices. In this regard applying the latest version of the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines can aid with the application and interpretation of transfer pricing legislation that was enacted earlier. Inland Revenue and 4 many taxpayers routinely apply the latest versions of the guidelines to assist in analysing cases from earlier years, as the latest guidelines are generally consistent with our existing law. The application date for new section GC 6(1B) is income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This means transfer pricing positions taken on or after 1 July 2018 will need to be analysed in a way that is consistent with the July 2017 version of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. GC 6(2)(b): Defining the related party arrangements to which the transfer pricing rules apply Section GC 6(2) defines the transfer pricing arrangements that the transfer pricing rules apply to. A transfer pricing arrangement is a cross-border arrangement between related parties. The meaning of “arrangement” (which is described in section GC 6(2)(a)) and “cross-border arrangement” (which is defined in section GC 6(3)), are unchanged under the new legislation. However, the concept of “related party” has been expanded under the new legislation. Prior to July 2018, the transfer pricing rules only applied to arrangements between “associated persons” as defined in section YA 1. For example, two companies are associated persons if they have fifty percent or more common ownership. The new rules apply to cross-border arrangements between: • associated persons (as defined in section YA 1); • a company and a member of a non-resident owning body where the members of the non-resident owning body collectively have voting or market value interests in the company of fifty percent or more; and • a non-resident (lender) and another person (borrower) that includes a financial arrangement that is a cross-border related borrowing (as defined in GC 6(3)). Associated persons Associated persons are defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The definition of “associated persons” is unchanged by the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. This means the set of “associated persons” who were required to apply the transfer pricing rules prior to 1 July 2018, will continue to be subject to the transfer pricing rules after 1 July 2018 (assuming they continue to meet the definition of “associated persons” in section YA 1). Some typical cases where persons are associated include: • Two companies, where the same group of persons own fifty percent or more of the voting interests, market value interests or control by other means in both of the companies. • When a person who is not a company owns twenty five percent or more of the voting interests or market value interests of the company. 5 • A limited partnership and a partner when the partner owns twenty five percent or more in a right, obligation, or other property, status or thing of the limited partnership. • A non-limited partnership and a partner in the partnership. • Natural persons who are close relatives. Many of these tests also include aggregation rules whereby if two persons are associated under another rule their interests are aggregated for determining whether the relevant voting, market value or control thresholds are met. So, for example if a mother owns more than fift y percent of one company and her daughter owns more than fifty percent of another, the companies would be associated with each other. Non-resident owning bodies Section GC 6(2)(b) extends the application of the transfer pricing rules so they also apply when the transfer pricing arrangement is between a company and a person who is a member of a non-resident owning body that has at least fifty percent of the ownership interests in the company. This rule is intended to capture private equity structures where it is common for a group of shareholders to co-ordinate on how to debt fund the New Zealand company. In addition to using debt funding such private equity structures can also use other arrangements such as service fees or royalties to shift profits out of New Zealand in order to reduce the overall tax paid on their investments. The extension of the application of the transfer pricing rules to non- resident owning bodies means that the transfer pricing rules will apply to both debt and non- debt transactions that members of these non-resident owning bodies have wit h co mpanies in New Zealand. The concept of a “non-resident owning body” is defined in section YA 1. It is used in the non- resident withho lding tax (NRWT) rules as an interest payment to a member of a non-resident owning body is not eligible for a 0% rate of NRWT (when the approved issuer levy has been paid by the borrower). The concept is also used for determining whether the thin capitalisation rules apply as companies which are controlled by a non-resident owing body are subject to thin capitalisation rules. This means that the transfer pricing rules will generally apply to the same set of companies and non-resident investors as the thin capitalisation rules and the NRWT rules for related party interest payments. A non-resident owning body is a group of non-residents or entities (such as trusts settled by non-residents), that have one or more characteristics indicating they are acting together to debt-fund a New Zealand company. These characteristics include: • having proportionate levels of debt and equity among the group. Proportionality is a characteristic of acting together as it generally requires a degree of coordination to achieve; • having an agreement that sets out how the company should be funded with an arrangement between the members of the group concerning debt if the company is not widely held. Widely held is defined in section YA 1 and means a company has at least 25 shareholders (counting any associated shareholders as one shareholder) and is not controlled by five or fewer of these shareholders; and 6 • having an arrangement between the members of the group concerning debt in the company in a way recommended by a person (such as a private equity manager), or implemented on behalf of the members. Because the definition of a non-resident owning body requires the shareholders to hold debt in the company in proportion to their shareholding or for the relevant agreement or arrangement to be a co-ordinated debt funding arrangement, the transfer pricing rules should not apply simply because a company has a typical shareholder’s agreement setting out how shareholders agree to exercise their individual shareholder rights. Ownership interest is defined in YA 1 to mean voting or market value interests. Therefore if the group of members in the non-resident owning body collectively own fift y percent or more of the voting or market value interests of the company, the transfer pricing rules will apply to all debt and non-debt arrangements between the company and a member of the non-resident owning body. Cross-border related borrowings The application of the rules also specifically includes cross-border related borrowings subject to the new transfer pricing rules for debt arrangements. A cross-border related borrowing is defined in section GC 6(3B). This definition is further explained in the special report on interest limitation (see the section on “Cross-border related borrowing”). GC 7 to GC 12 Sections GC 7 to GC 12 are unchanged under the new legislation. These sections go through the various cases where the amount of consideration is substituted with an arm’s length amount of consideration because a person’s net income has been reduced by the conditions of a cross-border arrangement with a related party. GC 13(1): Determining arm’s length amounts Section GC 13(1) outlines the process for determining an arm’s length amount of consideration. This is the amount of consideration that independent parties after real and independent bargaining would have agreed upon as the price for the identified transaction if the identified transaction had occurred under arm’s length conditions. Identifying the related party transaction The first step is to take the transfer pricing arrangement (between the related parties) and apply section D.1 of chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines to accurately delineate the transaction. If the accurately delineated transaction is not commercially rational so that there is no price which would be acceptable to independent parties in exchange for the relevant goods or 7 services being supplied, the approach described in section D.2 of chapter I of the guidelines will apply, and can be used to disregard or replace the transaction. Section GC 13(1)(a) defines the term “the identified transaction”. In most cases this will be the accurately delineated transaction found by applying section D.1 of chapter I. However, in cases where section D.2. of chapter I applies to replace the transaction, the “identified transaction” will instead be the replacement transaction. Comparability analysis In order to determine the arm’s length conditions, including the arm’s length price, the identified transaction is benchmarked against comparable transactions between independent parties. This involves the use of a comparability analysis whereby the taxpayer: • identifies the arm’s length conditions which might be expected to be agreed between independent parties operating at arm’s length for comparable arrangements to the identified transaction; and • uses one or more of the approved transfer pricing methods to produce the most reliable measure of the arm’s length amount of consideration that would be agreed upon as part of the arm’s length conditions. One of the five approved transfer pricing methods (or a combination of these methods) described in chapter III of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines must be used to perform the comparability analysis. The references in GC 13(1) to the “identified transaction” are not intended to limit the methods that taxpayers may use to perform a comparability analysis – any of the five methods listed in GC 13(2) can be used to perform this analysis. The meaning of “identified transaction”, arm’s length conditions and “arm’s length amount of consideration” are further explained below. GC 13(1)(b): Arm’s length conditions “Arm’s length conditions” are defined in section GC 13(b) as the conditions independent parties after real and independent bargaining might be expected to agree upon for the identified transaction. In the phrase “arm’s length conditions”, “conditions” is not a defined term in the Act but is intended to include financial values such as the price, gross margin, net profit, and the division of profit between the acquirer and supplier as well as other conditions. This is consistent with paragraph 1.7 of the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines which refers to “...conditions (including prices, but not only prices).” Conditions may also include features going beyond the financial indicators relevant in applying transfer pricing methods. The insertion of “conditions” is intended to clarify that a wider set of features, other than the price may be relevant when considering if the conditions of the transfer pricing arrangement need to be substituted with the conditions that would apply under comparable arm’s length arrangements. 8 New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation also refers to the concept of an “arm’s length amount of consideration” (and has done so since the rules were first introduced 1995). The Federal Court in Chevron Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation \[2015\] FCA 1092 found that the term “consideration”, which was used in Australia’s transfer pricing rules at the time the disputed transaction took place, had a broader meaning than just the price (interest rate). The Federal Court agreed that the Commissioner could make adjustments to other conditions (security and loan covenants in the Chevron case), that could have an impact on the price. GC 13(1B): Determination of identified transaction The transfer pricing rules require the overall economic substance of the arrangement to be considered. The analysis is not limited to the legal contracts and takes into account the wider economic arrangement and commercial environment. In particular, if the legal contracts do not reflect the actual conduct of the parties, the actual conduct of the parties will be used to apply the transfer pricing rules. New section GC 13(1B) achieves these outcomes by requiring the transfer pricing arrangement to be “accurately delineated using the approach described in section D.1 of chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines.” Section D.1 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines describes the process for accurately delineating the transaction. This process involves identifying the economically relevant characteristics. Some broad categories of the economically relevant characteristics are listed in paragraph 1.36 of the guidelines as: • The contractual terms of the transaction (as described in section D.1.1). • The functions performed by each of the parties to the transaction, taking into account assets used and risks assumed, including: – how those functions relate to the wider generation of value by the mult inat ional enterprise group to which the parties belong; – the circumstances surrounding the transaction; and – industry practices (D.1.2). • The characteristics of property transferred or services provided (D.1.3). • The economic circumstances of the parties and of the market in which the parties operate (D.1.4). • The business strategies pursued by the parties (D.1.5). As part of accurately delineating the controlled transaction, the terms of the legal agreement may be disregarded to the extent that they are inconsistent with the actual conduct of the parties. This is explained in paragraphs 1.45 and 1.46 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines provide several examples that illustrate particular aspects of how to accurately delineate transactions. This includes examples of: 9 • how the terms of the written contract may be clarified or supplemented by examining the actual conduct of the parties (see paragraph 1.44); • how to deal with differences between written contractual terms and conduct of the parties, with the result being that the actual conduct of the parties is used to accurately delineate the transaction (paragraph 1.48); • using the conduct of the parties to identify a transaction where one has not been identified by the multinational (paragraph 1.50); and • how risks should be assumed according to how the parties actually manage and control these risks (see paragraphs 1.83–1.85 and 1.89). GC 13(1C): No transaction or differing transaction Where the transfer pricing arrangements entered into are not commercially rational there is consequently no price which would be acceptable to independent parties in exchange for the relevant goods or services being supplied and acquired. In such cases it is not possible to apply a transfer pricing analysis as transfer pricing relies on being able to identify the arm’s length price which would be agreed between independent parties. To address this problem, section D.2 of chapter I of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provides guidance about the circumstances where a transaction can be disregarded, and if appropriate replaced with an alternative transaction that allows for a transfer pricing analysis to be performed. Proposed new section GC 13(1C) applies when the requirements of paragraph 1.122 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines are met. In summary, this paragraph states that the accurately delineated transaction can be disregarded and potentially replaced, if it would not be commercially rational for independent enterprises to enter into the transaction, because it would not be possible to determine a price which would be acceptable to both of the independent parties at the time that the transaction was entered into. The full text of paragraph 1.122 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines: “1.122 This section sets out circumstances in which the transaction between the parties as accurately delineated can be disregarded for transfer pricing purposes. Because nonrecognition can be contentious and a source of double taxation, every effort should be made to determine the actual nature of the transaction and apply arm’s length pricing to the accurately delineated transaction, and to ensure that non- recognition is not used simply because determining an arm’s length price is difficult. Where the same transaction can be seen between independent parties in comparable circumstances (i.e. where all economically relevant characteristics are the same as those under which the tested transaction occurs other than that the parties are associated enterprises) non-recognition would not apply. Importantly, the mere fact that the transaction may not be seen between independent parties does not mean that it should not be recognised. Associated enterprises may have the ability to enter into a much greater variety of arrangements than can independent enterprises, and may conclude transactions of a specific nature that are not encountered, or are only very rarely encountered, between independent parties, and may do so for sound business reasons. The transaction as accurately delineated may be disregarded, and if 10 appropriate, replaced by an alternative transaction, where the arrangements made in relation to the transaction, viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner in comparable circumstances, thereby preventing determination of a price that would be acceptable to both of the parties taking into account their respective perspectives and the options realistically available to each of them at the time of entering into the transaction. It is also a relevant pointer to consider whether the MNE group as a whole is left worse off on a pre-tax basis since this may be an indicator that the transaction viewed in its entirety lacks the commercial rationality of arrangements between unrelated parties.” In cases where the accurately delineated transaction is replaced it should be replaced with a new transaction that enables a price that would be commercially rational for independent enterprises to agree to. As noted in paragraph 1.124 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines, the replacement transaction should closely adhere to the facts (as accurately delineated) of the original transfer pricing transaction and only diverge from those facts to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a commercially rational outcome: “1.124 The structure that for transfer pricing purposes, replaces that actually adopted by the taxpayers should comport as closely as possible with the facts of the actual transaction undertaken whilst achieving a commercially rational expected result that would have enabled the parties to come to a price acceptable to both of them at the time the arrangement was entered into.” Paragraph 1.128 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provides an example where an arrangement is replaced. The example involves a lump sum payment for all future intangibles developed by an associated company over the next 20 years. This arrangement would not be commercially rational for independent parties to agree on as it is not possible to value these future intangibles. In this example, a number of potential replacement transactions could be considered including a financing arrangement, a contract for research services or a licencing agreement for some specific identified intangibles. The transaction will be disregarded and not replaced if the commercially rational deal that independent parties would accept in comparable circumstances is one that involves no supply or acquisit io n. This is provided for by new section GC (13)(1C)(a). If the transaction is disregarded under section GC 13(1C)(a) of the transfer pricing rules it will be null and void for determining the person’s New Zealand income tax liability. Note that there may still be NRWT on the payments as existing section GC 12 means that transfer pricing adjustments do not affect NRWT obligations. Paragraphs 1.126 and 1.127 of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines provide an example of a transaction which is disregarded and not replaced. This example involves a property prone to flooding which an independent insurer would not agree to insure as evidenced by there being no active insurance market for properties in that area. GC 13(2): Approved transfer pricing methods Section GC 13(2) requires the taxpayer to determine the arm’s length amount of consideration under arm’s length conditions by performing a comparability analysis as required by the OECD transfer pricing guidelines, chapter III, using any one or a combination of the five 11 transfer pricing methods that are described in chapter II of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. The choice of method that should be used is the method (or combination of methods) which produces the most reliable measure of the arm’s length amount of consideration (see section GC 13(1)(c)). Chapter II of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines includes some further guidance on what transfer pricing method should be used, depending on the relevant circumstances of the arrangement and data availability. The requirements under the updated section GC 13(2) are very similar to requirements under the previous section GC 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The main differences are that the names of the transfer pricing methods have been updated to the modern terminology and the updated provision now refers to using the OECD guidelines as guidance for how to perform a comparability analysis using the methods described in those guidelines. In addition to the guidance in chapter III of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines, there is some relevant guidance on the factors that a comparability analysis should take into account in section D.1 of chapter I of the OECD guidelines. In particular, paragraph 1.39 of the OECD guidelines notes that “differences in economically relevant characteristics between the controlled and uncontrolled arrangements need to be taken into account when establishing whether there is comparability between the situations being compared and what adjustments may be necessary to achieve comparability.” The economically relevant characterist ics are the same characteristics that were considered when accurately delineating the identified transaction. Some broad categories of what these economically relevant characteristics could include are listed in paragraph 1.36 of the OECD guidelines. Onus of proof shifted to the taxpayer When New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules were introduced in 1995 they placed the onus of proof on the Commissioner. That is, the arm’s length amount of consideration has generally been determined by the taxpayer under section GC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This position has changed with the repeal of sections GC 13(4) and (5). This means that the general onus of proof in section 149A(2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will place the onus of proof for transfer pricing issues onto the taxpayer. New Zealand’s tax system operates on a self-assessment basis, where the taxpayer is expected to keep sufficient records to support its tax position. This change is therefore consistent with the fact that the onus of proof is already on the taxpayer for other tax matters. It also reflects the practical reality of a transfer pricing analysis. As transfer pricing is driven by specific facts and circumstances and involves comparisons with similar arm’s length transactions, the taxpayer is far more likely to hold the relevant information to support its pricing than Inland Revenue. At the time of publication, the onus of proof was on the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters in Australia, the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Germany. This means most multinationals already prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the burden of proof for other countries. 12 Putting the onus of proof for transfer pricing matters onto the taxpayer means that taxpayers who have material transfer pricing arrangements will need to prepare transfer pricing documentation that provides adequate evidence that their transfer pricing positions are correct (that is, they are determined using arm’s length conditions). The standard of proof required to apply a civil penalty such as a shortfall penalty imposed on an incorrect transfer pricing position is the “balance of probabilities” (under section 149A(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). This means that there must be a reasonable degree of probability that the offence was committed. Inland Revenue’s administrative practice and the OECD transfer pricing guidelines both acknowledge that there may be a range of conditions that can be considered to be arm’s length conditions. The OECD guidelines state that “If the relevant condition of the controlled transaction (e.g. price or margin) is within the arm’s length range, no adjustment should be made.” Documentation The revised chapter V of the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines recommends a three-tiered approach to transfer pricing documentation: • a master file providing an overview of the multinational's global business operations, transfer pricing policies and global allocation of income and economic activity; • a local file providing detailed information regarding material related party transactions; and • a Country-by-Country report which must be prepared and filed by large multinational groups. New Zealand’s Country-by-Country reporting requirements apply to New Zealand-headquartered multinational groups with EUR €750m of consolidated revenue in the preceding income year. These requirements are further described in the special report on administrative measures (see the section on “Country-by-Country reports” covering the new section 78G of the Tax Administration Act 1994). New Zealand endorses this approach to transfer pricing documentation. Further guidance on transfer pricing documentation is available in chapter V of the OECD guidelines and the annexes I and II to chapter V which outline the information which should be included in the master file and the local file. To supplement the OECD guidelines, Inland Revenue publishes some short guidance on certain transfer pricing topics on its website at https://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/transfer-pricing/ . This supplementary guidance includes a topic on Inland Revenue’s view on best practices for preparing useful and suitably focused transfer pricing documentation at https://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/transfer-pricing/transfer- pricing/practice/transfer-pricing-practice-documentation.html. In practice, the actual level of documentation required to demonstrate compliance with the transfer pricing rules will depend on the complexity and risk profile of the relevant transactions. Some transfer pricing practices can be easily shown to align with comparable 13 arm’s length arrangements whilst others require more evidence. Inland Revenue considers that taxpayers are best placed to exercise their own judgement and prepare documentation that manages their associated transfer pricing tax risks. New Zealand does not require taxpayers to file their transfer pricing documentation with Inland Revenue unless Inland Revenue has specifically requested the documentation as part of a risk review or audit. However, a failure to prepare adequate transfer pricing documentation or acceptance of pricing that is clearly incorrect could result in a 40% shortfall penalty for gross carelessness if problems involving material associated party transactions are identified as a result of an Inland Revenue audit. Although there is no explicit requirement for taxpayers to prepare the documentation contemporaneously, Inland Revenue will generally apply a 20% “lack of reasonable care” penalty to incorrect transfer pricing positions taken by taxpayers who have failed to adequately document their transfer pricing positions at the time those tax positions were taken. There is no New Zealand-specific prescribed format for transfer pricing documentation. Multinationals may therefore be able to leverage off the local file documentation they have prepared for other countries (as these will also include the transactions wit h New Zealand parties). However, in those cases where the transfer pricing documentation has been prepared on a worldwide basis (for example, by the headquarters of the multinational) it may be necessary to do some further work to adapt or add to the information that is included in the local file for New Zealand to ensure that it accurately reflects the reality of the market place in which each company is operating. For example, a multinational may provide the same intangible property rights to its subsidiaries. The US subsidiary is a market leader and the intangible property is highly recognised. The New Zealand subsidiary has a low market share and the intangible property is not well recognised. Documentation prepared for the US subsidiary may be leveraged to prepare the New Zealand local file. However, it would need to be added to and adapted to ensure that the New Zealand specific circumstances are adequately documented. Another area where it may be necessary to adapt the documentation for New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules is that New Zealand has special rules determining how cross-border related borrowing is priced. These rules are in sections GC 6(3B) and GC 15 to 19 and can require certain adjustments to be made to the credit rating of the borrower and conditions of the financial arrangement, prior to the general transfer pricing rules in sections GC 6 to GC 14 (and the OECD transfer pricing guidelines) being used to price the adjusted financial arrangement. Seven year time bar for transfer pricing issues in some circumstances Inland Revenue generally has four years from the end of the tax year in which a taxpayer files an income tax return to investigate and amend the tax position taken by the taxpayer in their return. This four year limit is known as the time bar. 14 The general four year time bar has been extended to seven years for the purposes of the transfer pricing rules in limited circumstances. New section GC 13(6) extends the time bar by allowing the Commissioner to amend an assessment of tax, under the transfer pricing rules, within a seven year period after the tax year in which the relevant tax return was originally filed, if the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer that a tax audit or investigation has commenced within the usual four year time bar. The notification that a tax audit or investigation has commenced and that the Commissioner is applying GC 13(6) will be provided in writing. If the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (or an officer of Inland Revenue who has been delegated this authority) has not provided the relevant taxpayer with a written notification within four years of the tax return being filed, the general time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply. The notification requirement means the majority of taxpayers will have the same level of certainty as the general four year time bar as they will know after four years that since Inland Revenue has not provided written notification that the time bar for their transfer pricing positions is being extended that these positions are final. Example In May 2020, Company B files a tax return for their income year from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 which includes some transfer pricing positions. In May 2024, four years have passed since the tax return was filed. As Inland Revenue has not notified the taxpayer that their transfer pricing positions are being investigated, the taxpayer will have certainty that their transfer pricing positions (and any other tax positions) taken in their May 2020 tax return can be considered final under the general time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. In other cases, where Inland Revenue identified a tax risk and notifies the taxpayer wit hin four years of the relevant tax return being filed, Inland Revenue will have seven years from the date the tax return was filed to make a transfer pricing adjustment. The use of the words “despite the time bar...” in section GC 13(6) means the that in those cases where 13(6) applies, the seven year time bar overrides the general time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The seven year time bar can be applied for all transfer pricing issues that are subject to sections GC 6 to GC 19, including “cross-border related loans” that are subject to sections GC 15 to 19. The ability to extend the time bar for transfer pricing issues to seven years under section GC 13(6) applies from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018. This means that tax positions taken in returns relating to income years that began before 1 July 2018 will continue to be subject to the existing four year time bar. 15 Example In June 2020, Company C files a tax return for their income year from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. In 2021, Inland Revenue begins an investigation of Company C’s tax return for their 2019/20 tax year. The investigation involves a series of meetings, site visits, interviews, and requests for information held by Company C and other members of their group as well as procuring expert views on certain issues from independent international specialists. In January 2024 Inland Revenue provides written notification to Company C that they are being investigated for the transfer pricing positions that they have taken in their June 2020 tax return and that the Commissioner is applying section GC 13(6) to extend the time bar for the transfer pricing issues so adjustments can potentially be made up until June 2027. In March 2024, Inland Revenue issues a Notice of Proposed Adjustment to Company C regarding their transfer pricing position in their June 2020 tax return. In this case, the extension of the time bar was not actually required, as an assessment was made within four years of the relevant tax return being filed. 16
1 April 2019 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Taxation of bloodstock Sections CG 8B, CG 8C, EC 39, EC 39B, EC 39C, EC 47B to EC 47E, EZ 6B, YA 1, and schedules 18B and 18C of the Income Tax Act 2007 Section 225AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 made changes to the taxation of bloodstock. This special report provides early information on the new rules and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the May 2019 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Background In Budget 2018, the Government announced its intention to amend the tax treatment of expenditure incurred on high quality yearlings when an investor has an intention to breed for profit in the future. The Government’s expectation is that, on average, 20 thoroughbred and 10 standardbred yearlings will qualify each year. The policy objective is to encourage new investment in the New Zealand racing industry. Key features Generally, a person must have a bloodstock breeding business to qualify for tax deductions in relation to owning bloodstock. These amendments allow investors that do not currently have a bloodstock breeding business to qualify for tax deductions in relation to owning bloodstock if they acquire “high priced yearlings” with an intention to breed in the future for profit. High-priced yearling refers to bloodstock acquired, either directly or indirectly, from a premier yearling sale for an amount above the relevant price threshold set for that calendar year. Each year the thresholds are set by the Commissioner, taking into account the last year’s sales results. 2 To qualify for tax deductions, investors must also: • notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of their intention to use the bloodstock for breeding for profit in the future; and • provide the information required by the Commissioner. The sale of a high-priced yearling by a prospective bloodstock breeder is assessable income in accordance with the existing bloodstock rules. There are also recovery rules where a high-priced yearling is sold to a non-resident or exported without first racing or being used for breeding in New Zealand. Application date Most of the amendments apply from 1 January 2019. The amendments requiring the Commissioner to set and publish the national minimum price thresholds each calendar year apply from 1 January 2020. Detailed analysis Prospective bloodstock breeders treated as being in breeding business New section EC 47C treats a prospective bloodstock breeder as having a bloodstock breeding business from the day that they acquire stud-founding bloodstock. Stud-founding bloodstock means high-priced bloodstock acquired by a prospective bloodstock breeder before the yearling turns two years of age and where the notification requirements are met. This rule allows the syndication of a yearling that is high-priced bloodstock prior to the yearling turning two. High-priced bloodstock is bloodstock that has been acquired at a premier yearling sale (these sales are defined in schedule 18B) for an amount greater than the relevant national minimum price threshold. For 2019, these thresholds are in the new section EZ 6B. For the 2020 calendar year and beyond, the Commissioner must set and publish the national minimum price thresholds before the first premier yearling sale in the relevant calendar year. Where the Commissioner fails to do this, the most recently published thresholds will apply to sales occurring until the Commissioner sets and publishes thresholds for that calendar year. A prospective bloodstock breeder means a person who acquires bloodstock when they do not have an existing bloodstock breeding business but intend to first race the bloodstock in New Zealand and use the bloodstock for breeding in New Zealand for profit. Notification requirements of an intention to breed Under the notification requirements the owner(s) must, within four months of acquiring the high-priced bloodstock, provide the Commissioner with the following: 1. Notification of intention to breed. 3 2. Sale and purchase documentation (and, if not included in documentation, lot number/sale name/horse identification (colt/filly, dam/sire etc)). 3. IRD/GST number of the owner. If multiple owners (syndicate/partnership) details of the entity, including all owners. 4. Contact details of all owners: physical address, phone number, e-mail address. 5. Balance date. 6. Owner’s founding documents (syndicate/partnership agreement). 7. Breeding business plan that includes: a. A description of the business. b. The research undertaken on the yearling’s breeding pedigree and future commercial breeding prospects. c. Location of activity. d. Racing programme designed to prove the horse’s breeding value (how is horse to be raced/racing management?). e. Where and when is horse to commence breeding and who/how is this to be managed? f. Financial forecasts. g. Involvement of racing/breeding/syndicate manager (overall management of horse). 8. Veterinarian reports: a. For syndicates required to operate in accordance with the “Bloodstock Syndication Code of Practice”, a copy of the veterinarian certificate obtained; and b. For all other syndicates, confirmation that an external physical examination was carried out by a veterinarian prior to purchase together with the details of the veterinarian who performed the examination. 9. Any other relevant communication within the syndicate prior to filing the application for a deduction for the cost of the high-priced bloodstock. Meeting these requirements entitles a prospective bloodstock breeder to claim tax deductions for the write-down in the horse’s value and other expenses, just like the owner of an existing bloodstock breeding business. Notification requirements on change of intention to breed There is significant uncertainty whether a particular high-priced yearling will be used in a breeding business. This is because many yearlings never get to be used in a bloodstock breeding business due to injury, being gelded and/or poor racing performance. 4 New section EC 47D applies when a prospective breeder has been allowed deductions in relat ion to their high-priced bloodstock and change their intention or the horse is no longer expected to be used for future breeding. The owner is treated as having disposed of the high- priced bloodstock at the bloodstock’s market value on the day their expectation or intention changes. When the owner(s) of high-priced bloodstock changes their intention to breed from the bloodstock in the future for profit, the Commissioner requires them to provide the following information: 1. If horse is gelded or deceased, a copy of the invoice noting the date of gelding or death. 2. If exported, a copy of the export documentation. 3. Copies of any change of ownership forms. 4. All communication relating to any change of intention to breed. 5. Financial statements (or financial statements summary IR10 form, where no other financial statements have been prepared) tax reconciliations and bloodstock schedules. Other bloodstock owned by a prospective bloodstock breeder New section EC 47C also has rules relating to other bloodstock owned by a prospective bloodstock breeder. If a prospective bloodstock breeder concurrently owns bloodstock that is not stud-founding bloodstock, that bloodstock is not treated as part of the prospective bloodstock breeder’s bloodstock breeding business. Bloodstock breeding business commences When a bloodstock breeding business commences with the stud-founding bloodstock, the existing bloodstock rules apply. Where a prospective breeder commences breeding using bloodstock that is not stud-founding bloodstock section EC 47E applies. The breeding business owner can apply to the Commissioner to have the stud-founding bloodstock treated as being used in the existing bloodstock breeding business. The application must be made within one month after the day that the bloodstock business commences. If the application is approved, then the recovery rules that apply to stud-founding bloodstock removed from New Zealand or sold to non-residents no longer apply. Recovery rules If stud-founding bloodstock is removed from New Zealand before first being raced in New Zealand or used for breeding in New Zealand, the owner can make deductions in relation to that bloodstock, and the bloodstock is expected to be able to be used for future breeding, then the owner is treated as having disposed of the high-priced bloodstock. New sections CG 8B and CG 8C apply as appropriate in these circumstances. These sections recover the greater of the amount of the consideration received for the sale of the high-priced bloodstock or the total deductions that have been allowed in relation to that bloodstock.
May 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Employee share schemes Sections CD 25, CD 43, CE 1, CE 2, CE 6, CE 7, CE 7B, CE 7C, CE 7D, CV 20, CW 26B, CW 26C, CW 26D, CW 26E, CW 26F, CW 26G, CZ 1, DV 27, DV 28, EX 38, GB 49B, HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 3(1) and 63B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This special report provides early information on changes to employee share schemes in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018, enacted on 29 March 2018, and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the June 2018 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Employee share schemes are arrangements for companies to provide shares and share options to their emplo yees. They are an important form of employee remuneration in New Zealand and internationally. Although the design and the accounting treatment of these plans have evolved considerably over recent decades, the tax rules applying to them in New Zealand had not been comprehensively reviewed during that period and were out of date. R ecently a number of problems with these rules emerged, primarily in three areas: •c omplex arrangements allow taxable labour income to be converted into tax-free capital gains; •there is no employer deduction for the provision of employee share scheme benefits in some circumstances; and •the rules and thresholds relating to tax-exempt widely-offered employee share schemes are outdated and need review. N ew core rules C hanges have been made to the core rules for the taxation of employee share schemes following enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018. The objective of the proposals is neutral tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits. That is, to the extent possible, the tax position of both the employer and the employee should be the same whether remuneratio n for labour is paid in cash or shares. This will ensure that employee share schemes cannot be structured to reduce the tax payable in respect of these arrangements, as compared to an equivalent cash salary or other more straight-forward employee share schemes. G enerally, these rules will apply to benefits where the taxing point under the previous law has not occurred before 29 September 2018. 1 This special report covers changes that: • determine the taxing point for employee share schemes as being when an employee is treated as having earned shares under an employee share scheme, and after which they hold the shares like any other shareholder; • provide a new deduction rule for employers providing employee share scheme benefits to employees, which aligns the tax treatment of providing employee share scheme benefits with the tax treatment of paying other types of employment income; • simplify the rules for certain exempt employee share schemes, with a greater level of exempt benefits able to be provided and more flexibility in the design of these schemes; and • make other consequential and technical amendments. 2 SCOPE OF THE NEW RULES Sections CE 1, CE 2, CE 6, CE 7, CE 7B, CE 7C, CE 7D, DV 27 The new income and deduction rules apply to arrangements where employees receive shares as part of their remuneration package. There are a number of qualifications and carve outs to the definition of “employee share scheme” so that the rules are appropriately targeted. Background The definition of “employee share scheme” is a key component of the rules. The core employee share scheme rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 previously applied to “share purchase agreements”. These are agreements to dispose of or issue shares to an employee, entered into in connection with the employee’s employment or service, whether or not an employment relationship exists when the employee receives a benefit under the agreement. Under the old rules there was some uncertainty as to whether this definition encompassed arrangements entered into before a person commenced a formal employment relationship and had received a PAYE income payment. This definition also excluded shareholder-employees to the extent to which they chose not to deduct PAYE. There is no policy rationale for excluding these classes of recipients of employee share scheme benefits. Key features The new rules apply to benefits provided under arrangements that involve issuing or transferring shares to past, present and future employees 1 or shareholder-emplo yees (or their associates) of the issuing company (or a group company). They do not apply to arrangements that involve issuing shares to other goods or service providers. The new rules do not apply to arrangements that require emplo yees to: • pay market value for the shares on the “share scheme taxing date” (described in more detail below, but generally the date on which the employee holds the shares like any other shareholder); or • put at risk shares they acquired for market value, where the scheme provides no protection to the person against a fall in the value of the shares. They also do not apply to exempt employee share schemes (which have their own specific rules, discussed below). 1 This includes any person receiving a PAYE income payment. A PAYE income payment includes a schedular payment – that is, a payment subject to withholding because it is of a class set out in Schedule 4 of the Act. 3 When the new rules do not apply, shares provided in exchange for goods and services will be taxable to the recipient under general principles applying to barter transactions. Application date The new rules apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules before 29 September 2018. There are further details on the application date in the section on technical, consequential and transit ional matters. Detailed analysis Under sections CE 1(1)(d), CE 2, and CE 6 – 7D, a benefit received under an employee share scheme is income of a person. Section DV 27 governs the corresponding deductions available to the employer offering the employee share scheme. “Employee share scheme” is defined in section CE 7 as an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder-employee) of that company or of another company in the same group, if that arrangement is connected to the person’s employment or service. It also includes the provision of shares to an associate of the employee or shareholder- employee (for example, a family trust), if the arrangement is connected with the emplo yee’s emplo yment or service. The use of the term “arrangement” covers all aspects of a scheme, for example, direct transfers of shares, loans to buy shares, bonuses, put and call options, and transfers to trusts, etc. The definition also covers past, present and future employees, and includes shareholder- emplo yees. However, an employee share scheme does not include an arrangement that requires an employee, shareholder-employee, or associate to: • pay market value for the shares on the “share scheme taxing date” (described in more detail below, but generally the date on which the employee holds the shares like any other shareholder); or • put at risk shares they acquired for market value where the scheme provides no protection to the person against a fall in the value of the shares. This exception does not apply if the person acquired the shares using funds which were required to be used for the acquisit io n. 4 Example 1 Jim is employed by ABC Co, a closely-held company. As part of his employment agreement, after he has worked for the company for three years, if the company’s other shareholders are happy with his performance, they will let him buy twenty five percent of the company’s shares for their current market value at that time. While this is an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder-employee), market value will be paid for the shares on the share scheme taxing date. Accordingly, this arrangement is not an employee share scheme for the purposes of the proposed new definition. Example 2 Casey, Hamish and Steve get together and incorporate a company to develop some technology-related intellectual property (IP). They are each employed by the company. When the shares are issued they are worth virtually nothing (on a balance sheet basis) and a nominal subscription price of $0.01 is paid by each shareholder-employee. The shareholders’ agreement states that to ensure they commit to developing the IP over three years, if they leave within three years they forfeit their shares. While this is an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder-employee), market value was paid for the shares, not using money provided to the employees for that purpose, and the employees have then chosen to put the shares at risk. Accordingly, this arrangement is not an employee share scheme for the purposes of the proposed new definition. Example 3 Melissa is hired as CEO by X Co, a closely-held company with exciting but uncertain prospects. She is paid a $120,000 per annum salary. Because she is an employee, she is also able to buy $50,000 worth of shares (which is the current market value – established by an independent valuation). If Melissa leaves employment within three years, X Co has the right to buy her shares back for the lesser of $50,000 and market value. After that date, it has the right to buy the shares back for full market value. This is because X Co does not want Melissa to hold its shares if she is not part of their team, but after three years they are prepared for Melissa to receive the upside in the shares. Before then, she bears the risk of loss but no chance of gain. If the shares fall to $10,000 and Melissa leaves X Co within three years, the company will buy her shares back for $10,000 and she will lose $40,000 of her $50,000 investment. If Melissa leaves the company within three years and the shares are worth $1 million, then the company will buy them back for $50,000 and Melissa will be denied the upside. This arrangement is not an employee share scheme as defined as Melissa has paid market value for her shares not using consideration provide to her for this purpose, and has then effectively put them at risk for three years. If X Co paid Melissa a signing bonus of $74,627 on the basis that the after tax amount of $50,000 would be used to acquire the shares, the arrangement would be an employee share scheme – see in particular section CE 7(b)(iii). 5 Example 4 Think Big Ltd is an engineering consultancy firm, in which the principal employees are also shareholders and directors. New principals are required to subscribe for shares pro rata with existing principals. The price is: 3 × the average of previous three year’s earnings ÷ number of principals The shares must be sold back to the company when the principal ceases employment. The same formula is used to determine the amount payable to a principal when they leave the company. However, if the principal leaves to go to another engineering consultancy in New Zealand, the principal gets back no more than the amount subscribed for their shares. Think Big Ltd has received advice that the formula is a reasonable approximation of how a third party purchaser would value the firm. The company is prepared to lend the share subscription amount to new principals. Over the following five years a portion of the dividends payable by the principal on their shares must be used to repay the loan. If the principal leaves the firm before the loan is repaid, they still have to repay the loan in full. In order to be an employee share scheme as defined in section CE 7, the arrangement must come within one of the limbs of paragraph (a) and not be excluded by any of the limbs of paragraph (b). The arrangement has a purpose of transferring shares in Think Big Ltd to the new principal, who is either an employee or a shareholder-employee (as defined) of the company. The arrangement is connected with the new principal’s employment or service. It therefore satisfies paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii). The arrangement is not an exempt employee share scheme, so is not excluded by paragraph (b)(i). If the three times average earnings formula is a reasonable way to determine market value consideration, the arrangement might be excluded from being an employee share scheme by paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition. However, because this amount is not payable if the employee leaves to go to a competitor, paragraph (ii) is not in fact satisfied. Neither is paragraph (b)(iii) satisfied. Assuming the amount paid for the shares is their market value: • The arrangement does require the person to put the shares at risk, because if the amount in the formula declines, the person will get less on the sale of their shares than they paid. • However, the consideration for the shares is provided by the company by way of a loan, on the basis that it is used for acquiring the shares. If a new principal uses their own funds to acquire the shares, paragraph (b)(iii) would be satisfied. The definition of employee share scheme also excludes exempt schemes (which have their own specific rules, discussed below). 6 TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEE’S INCOME Sections CE 1, CE 2, CE 6, CE 7, CE 7B, CE 7C, CE 7D, DV 27 The amendments ensure that the timing and amount of an employee’s inco me fro m an employee share scheme is consistent with other forms of employment income. Background Any reward for services is generally taxable as income, under the ordinary definition. However, the application of the common law of income tax to the provision of rewards in the form of property, for example shares or options, has sometimes been problematic. For that reason, since 1968, New Zealand tax law has contained special provisions relating to the taxation of emplo yee share scheme benefits. Under the previous law, shares provided under an employee share scheme were taxable when the employee acquired the shares. The previous section CE 6(2) provided that: • shares acquired pursuant to an option were treated as acquired when the option was exercised. This meant that an employee was not taxed on the grant or vesting of an option, but on its exercise; and • shares acquired by a trustee for the benefit of an employee (that is, a specific employee) were treated as acquired by the employee, even if the employee might be required to forfeit the shares. The second of these rules led to outcomes that were neither tax-neutral nor consistent with the taxation of employee share options. Examples 5, 6, 7 and 8 reflect the previous rules. Example 5 Jim has a tax rate of 33%. If his employer offers him a $1,000 bonus if he is still working for the employer in a year’s time, he will receive (if he satisfies the condition) $1,000 of taxable income. If instead his employer decides to pay Jim the same bonus in shares, the tax neutral outcome would be for the employer to provide $1,000 of shares, and for Jim to pay $330 tax. In both cases Jim receives $1,000 of before-tax income and has paid $330 of tax. Tax will not be a factor in how Jim wants to be paid. 7 Example 6 Suppose that Jim’s employer offers him a cash bonus if he is still working for the employer in a year’s time. The amount of the bonus is the value of 1,000 shares in one year’s time. Suppose that 1,000 shares are worth $1,000 at the start of the year, when the offer is made, and $1,500 at the end of the year. Jim will not be taxed on $1,000. He will be taxed on $1,500 when he receives the cash bonus. Instead of offering a cash bonus dependent on the value of the shares, suppose Jim’s employer transfers 1,000 shares to a trustee, on the basis that the trustee will transfer them to Jim at the end of the year if he is still with the company, and not otherwise. The economic benefit to Jim is the same as in the first variation of this example. However, under prior law, Jim had income of $1,000 when the shares were transferred to the trustee. This was not consistent with the treatment of equivalent cash remuneration (that is, the first variation of this example), and therefore was not a neutral tax treatment. Example 7 Jane’s employer decides to provide her with options to buy 1,000 shares in the company. The shares are currently worth $1, and the options have a strike price of $1 (that is, they are issued “at the money”). The options can be exercised only if Jane is still employed in a year. Suppose there is an equal chance that the shares will be worth $600 or $1,600 in a year’s time. If they are worth $1,600, Jane exercises the options, and has $600 of taxable income. If they are worth $600, she does not exercise the options, and gets nothing. Example 8 Instead of providing options, suppose Jane’s employer sells her 1,000 shares for $1,000, and provides her with an interest-free loan to fund the purchase. The loan must be repaid after one year. The employer specifies that if the shares have fallen in value at the repayment date, Jane must sell the shares back to the employer for $1,000. Suppose the same share values and probabilities as in example 3. If the shares are worth $1,600 in one year, Jane will keep the shares and pay off the loan. If they are worth $600, she will sell them to the employer for $1,000 and use that money to pay off the loan. Under prior law, Jane had no taxable income from this arrangement, even though it produced outcomes identical with the option arrangement, under which Jane has $600 of income if she acquires the shares. The new rules prevent these inconsistent outcomes by deferring the time at which an employee recognises income from an employee share scheme in certain situations. In examples 2 and 5, under the new rules, both Jim and Jane will be taxed on the value of the shares once the employment condition is satisfied (in Jim’s case) or the employer’s right to acquire the shares for $1,000 no longer exists (in Jane’s case). Key features Section CE 7B provides that benefits provided under an employee share scheme (usually in the form of shares) are assessable income for an employee at the earlier of the date when: • the benefits are either transferred or cancelled; or • the employee share scheme beneficiary owns the shares in the same way as any other shareholder. They will not own the shares in the same way as any other shareholder if (for example) the employee is required to forfeit the shares if they choose to leave the 8 company, or the emplo yee is entit led to be compensated for a decline in the value of the shares. This time is referred to as the “share scheme taxing date”. There is no change to the share scheme taxing date for straight-forward employee share options, which already reflects this principle, in that the employee is not taxed until the option is exercised. The amount of the benefit is the amount received for the transfer or cancellation, or the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date. It is reduced by the amount paid (if any) for the benefit. The new rules require matching between the employee’s income and the employer’s deduction, so the rules outlined above also determine the amount and time of the deduction to the employer (the employer’s deduction is discussed further below). Application date The new share scheme taxing date and rules for calculating employee share scheme income will apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules on or before 29 September 2018. There is further detail on the transitional arrangements below. Timing of income The time when the employee is taxable is defined as the “share scheme taxing date”, and is defined in section CE 7B. Unless a share scheme beneficiary first transfers their share scheme benefits to a non- associate, or the company cancels them, the share scheme taxing date is when: • there is no material risk that beneficial ownership of the shares will change, or that the shares will be required to be transferred or cancelled; • the employee is not entitled to be compensated for a fall in the value of the shares; and • there is no material risk that there will be a change in the terms of the shares affecting their value. 9 Previous law All treated as tax-free capital gains N ew la w Em plo ym ent in com e Tax-free capital gains Entry into ESS (old taxing point) Shares owned by employee unrestricted Shares sold Em plo yee is no t the eco n om ic ow n er, and the shares are still being earned Employee has earned the shares, an d ho lds them like any other shareholder If the benefits are cancelled or transferred to a non-associate before these events occur, then the share scheme taxing date is at the time of the cancellation or transfer. In determining whether there is a risk of a change of ownership, transfer or cancellation, certain rights and requirements do not affect the employee’s status as the economic owner of the shares under the scheme (section CE 7B(2)) and are ignored. They are rights or requirements: • for transfer for market value; • not contemplated by the employee share scheme; • that have no material risk of occurring; • that are of no material commercial significance; or • that also apply to shares not subject to the employee share scheme. The following series of examples illustrate how the new rules will work in practice for commo n types of employee share schemes. Example 9: Simple vesting period Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee leaves the company for any reason during the next three years, the shares are forfeited for no consideration. After three years, the shares are transferred to the employee. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the three years is up and the employee is still employed. Analysis The risk of loss of the shares for the first three years means there is a material risk that the beneficial ownership of the share will change under the terms of the scheme. None of the exceptions apply. 10 Example 10: Vesting period with good leaver exception Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee leaves the company for any reason during the next three years, the shares are forfeited for no consideration. However, if the employee ceases employment because of death, illness, disability, redundancy or retirement within the three-year period they are entitled to the shares. After three years, the shares are transferred to the employee. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the end of the three-year period if the person is still employed, or when the person leaves for any of the above reasons. Analysis There is a material risk that the employee will leave employment for some other reason than those listed (for example, a better opportunity presents itself). The share scheme taxing date does not occur so long as that risk exists, because it means that there is a material risk that the beneficial ownership of the shares may change under the terms of the scheme. Example 11: Vesting subject to misconduct Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. The shares are transferred to the employee if they are still employed by the company after three years. Also, if the employee ceases employment for any reason other than being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment-related misconduct during the three-year period (that is, being a “bad leaver”) the employee is entitled to the shares at that time. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the shares are initially transferred to the trust, and the income will be their value at that time. Analysis The risk of the employee losing their job for these “bad” reasons during the three year period, and thus losing entitlement to the shares, is not sufficiently material to require deferral. 11 Example 12: Vesting subject to misconduct with accrual Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee is still employed by the company after three years, the shares will be transferred to the employee. If the employee ceases employment for any reason other than being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment-related misconduct during the three-year period (that is, being a “bad leaver”) the employee is entitled to a pro rata portion of the shares based on completed years’ service (for example, nothing for the first year, one third of the shares if the employee leaves between one and two years, etc.). Result There will be three share scheme taxing dates – at the end of years one, two and three respectively. The employee will be taxed at the end of each year on the value at that time of one third of the shares. Analysis Until the end of the first year, if the employee leaves for another job, they will not be entitled to any shares. Once the first year is completed, they will be entitled to one third of the shares, provided they are not a bad leaver during the next two years. The risk that the employee will leave for another job is sufficiently material that it defers the share scheme taxing date for two thirds of the shares. The risk that the employee will leave as a bad leaver is not material so it does not defer the share scheme taxing date for the other third. The fact that the shares are held by the trustee until the end of year three does not of itself defer the share scheme taxing date. Example 13: Complex vesting Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee ceases employment during the next three years due to being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment related misconduct, the employee forfeits all shares. If the employee ceases employment during the next three years due to death, illness, disability, redundancy or retirement, all shares are transferred to the employee. If the employee ceases employment during the next three years for any other reason, a pro rata portion of the shares is transferred to the employee, equal to the number of complete months since the transfer divided by 36 (months). After three years if the employee is still employed, all the shares are transferred to the employee. Result The employee has income at the end of each month equal to the value at that time of the additional number of shares to which the employee is entitled if the employee leaves “for any other reason”. Analysis The risk of the employee leaving voluntarily for another job is sufficiently high to be material. The risk of the employee leaving as a bad leaver is not. Accordingly the share scheme taxing date arises as the employee becomes entitled to retain the shares if she leaves the company other than as a bad leaver. 12 Example 14: Performance hurdles Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. The employee is not entitled to the shares unless a total shareholder return 2 hurdle (measured as an annual percentage) is also met. If the hurdle is met in year one, one third of the shares vest. If it is met in year two, a further one third of the shares vest. Also, if it was not met in year one, but is met on a combined basis over years one and two, a further one-third of the shares will vest. The same approach applies in year three. No shares vest once the employee leaves the company. Vested shares are not transferred to the employee, but held by the trustee until the three years is up. If the employee leaves during that period for any reason other than being a bad leaver, the vested shares will be transferred to the employee. Result There will be three possible share scheme taxing dates – at the end of years one, two and three respectively. The employee will be taxed at the end of each year on the value of the shares that vest at that time. Analysis Until the end of the first year, if the employee leaves for another job, they will not be entitled to any shares. Once the first year is completed, they will be entitled to retain one third of the shares, provided they are not a bad leaver during the next two years, and provided the year one performance hurdle is met. The risk that the employee will be a bad leaver is not material so it does not defer the share scheme taxing date. The fact that the shares are held by the trustee until the end of year three does not of itself defer the share scheme taxing date. Example 15: Vesting period, with compulsory sale for market value thereafter Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee leaves the company for any reason during the next three years, the shares are forfeited for no consideration. After three years, the trustee retains legal ownership of the shares, and the employee must transfer their rights back to the trustee or A Co when the employee leaves. However, once the three-year period is up, the employee will receive the market value of the shares when their beneficial ownership is transferred. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the three years is up and the employee is still employed. Analysis Once the three-year period has expired, the employer’s or trustee’s right to acquire the beneficial interest in the shares is for market value, and is therefore not taken into account in determining the share scheme taxing date (section CE 7B(2)(a)). 2 A nnual “ total sharehol der return” i s a combi nati on of di vi dends pai d and appreci ati on i n share pri ce duri ng a year. 13 Example 16: Insubstantial put option Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. The shares will be transferred to the employee if she is still employed in three years’ time. Also, if the employee ceases employment during that time for any reason other than being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment-related misconduct during the three-year period (that is, being a “bad leaver”) the employee is entitled to the shares. Until the shares are transferred, the employee has the right to sell its beneficial interest in the shares back to the trustee for a total price of $1. Result The share scheme taxing date would be when the shares are provided to the trustee. Analysis The employee’s right to sell the shares for $1 is not, at the time it is granted, a right which has a material risk of being exercised, given that there is no liability attached to the shares and that they are then worth $10,000. This right would therefore not defer the share scheme taxing date. Example 17: Loan funded scheme A Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; and • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the earlier of when the employee leaves employment, or the expiry of the three years. Analysis Until the three years are up, if the employee leaves B Co for whatever reason, they lose their beneficial ownership of the shares for an amount that is not their market value. So the share scheme taxing date will, on the face of it, be the end of that three-year period. If the employee leaves within that period and is therefore required to transfer their rights, the sale price will be taxed. But since the sale price is the same as the amount contributed, there will be no gain or loss. Once the three-year period is up, the employee will either have no employee share scheme income (if they sell the shares back to the trustee for $10,000) or will pay tax on the difference between the value of the shares at that time and their $10,000 price (if they choose to keep the shares). 14 Example 18: Loan funded scheme B Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold; • the loan is limited recourse for the first three years (that is, during that period, the amount repayable is limited to the value of the shares at the time of repayment); and • if the employee leaves within three years, or chooses at the end of the three years to sell the shares to the trustee, they must be sold back to the trustee for market value. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the earlier of when the employee leaves employment, or the expiry of the three years. Analysis The requirement to sell the shares for their market value, if the employee leaves in the first three years, does not defer the share scheme taxing date. However, the limited recourse loan provides a benefit to the employee which compensates the employee for a fall in the value of the shares. Accordingly, the share scheme taxing date is the same as for example 17 – that is, the end of three years (when the loan ceases to be limited recourse) or when the shares are sold to the trustee. If the employee sells the shares for less than $10,000 (because that is their market value), the employee will have a deductible loss from the scheme under the employee share scheme rules, equal to the difference between the sale price and the $10,000 cost of the shares. They will have debt forgiveness income of an equal amount. If they retain the shares at the end of the three year period, they will have income equal to the difference between the shares’ value at that time and $10,000. 15 Example 19: Loan funded scheme C Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold; • if the employee leaves within three years, or chooses at the end of the three years to sell the shares to the trustee, they must be sold back to the trustee for market value; and • at the time of such a sale, the employer must pay the employee the amount of any decline in the value of the shares since the grant date. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the earlier of when the employee leaves employment, or the expiry of the three years. Analysis The employer’s promise to pay a bonus equal to the decline in the value of the shares is a benefit which compensates the employee for a decline in the value of the shares. The share scheme taxing date does not arise until that promise ceases to apply. If the employee sells the shares for less than $10,000 they will have a deductible loss from the scheme, which will be equal to the income they will recognise due to the payment from the employer. 16 Example 20: Loan funded scheme D Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold; and • if the employee leaves within three years, or chooses at the end of the three years to sell the shares to the trustee, they must be sold back to the trustee for market value. Unlike in example 12, there is no arrangement for the employer to pay the employee the amount of any decline in value of the shares. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the agreement is entered into. Analysis From the time the agreement is entered into, the employee has the full risk and reward of share ownership. Although the funding for the purchase is provided by the employer, the funding is full recourse and the employee holds the shares in the same way as any other shareholder. Example 21: Vesting only in the event of a sale or IPO Facts C Co transfers 1,000 shares to a trustee for an employee. The shares remain held on trust until the employee leaves, more than fifty percent of C Co is sold, or C Co is listed (whichever happens first). If the employee leaves first, the shares are forfeited. If more than fifty percent of C Co is sold, the employee’s shares must al so be sold and the employee will receive the proceeds. If C Co is listed, the shares are released to the employee. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the employee leaves, or C Co is sold or listed. Analysis Because the employee forfeits the shares for no consideration if they leave, the share scheme taxing date will be deferred until the employee leaves (in which case there will be no income), the shares are sold (in which case the sale price will be taxable), or the shares are released to the employee (the market value of the shares will be taxable). 17 Example 22: Blackout periods Facts Acme Limited (a listed company) agrees to issue 1,000 shares to Jason under an employee share scheme, if Jason remains employed for three years. Jason does so, and Acme Limited transfers 1,000 shares worth $10,000 to him on 31 December 2018. Under securities law, Jason is unable to sell the shares at that time, due to restrictions on insider trading. On 20 February 2019, the restrictions on selling the shares no longer apply and Jason sells half of his shares. The sale price is $4,200, or $8.40 per share. He sells the remaining shares six months later for $7,500. Result Jason’s share scheme taxing date is the date when the shares vested (31 December 2018), not the end of the blackout period (20 February 2019). Jason therefore has employment income of $10,000. The $800 loss on the first sale of fifty percent of his shares will generally be a capital loss. The profit of $2,500 on the sale of the remaining parcel will generally be a capital gain. Analysis The issue in this example is whether the insider trading restriction defers the share scheme taxing date. A prohibition on the sale of shares does not create a risk that beneficial ownership may change, and is a right or requirement in relation to the retention of shares, not the transfer of shares. The general principle illustrated by this example is that inability to sell employee share scheme shares does not mean that the employee has received no value or that they should not be taxed (the same principle applies to employees of unlisted companies who are prohibited from selling their shares by the company’s constitution or shareholder agreement). Regardless of the transfer restriction, the employee will be entitled to dividends and any increase or decrease in the shares’ value over time. The same outcome would be produced if the trading restrictions were part of the terms of the scheme as opposed to being a statutory restriction. Example 23: Reclassifying shares Facts On 30 November 2018, Startup Co issued 10,000 special employee shares, which it calls E Class shares, to its CEO. The E class shares have no rights to a dividend, no voting rights, and a right to 0.1 cents per share on liquidation of the company. However, the terms of the E Class shares also provide that if Startup Co achieves certain performance hurdles by the third balance date post-issue, the terms of all or some of the E Class shares will change so that they have the same rights as ordinary shares in Startup Co. Shares whose rights to do not change, will be cancelled. At the time the E Class shares were issued, they were valued at $1,000. The performance of the company by 31 March 2021 means seventy five percent of them are reclassified into ordinary shares, valued at $12.50 per share, giving a total value of $93,750. Result The share scheme taxing date for the E Class shares will be the date when their rights change or they are cancelled. Analysis So long as there is a material possibility that the E class shares will become ordinary shares, there is a material risk that there will be a change in their terms affecting their value (section CE 7B(1)(a)(iii)). Accordingly the share scheme taxing date cannot occur until the possibility of that change no longer exists. 18 Amount of income The amount of income to the employee is the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date (or the transfer price if transferred to a non-associate, or the amount paid for cancellation, if cancelled by the employer), less the amount paid for them. Even where benefits are conferred on or transferred to an associate of an employee, it is always the employee who is taxed on the income. If the amount paid exceeds the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date, the difference is deductible to the employee (sections CE 2(3) and DV 27(3)). Apportionment for overseas service The new rules contain an expanded income apportionment formula (section CE 2(5) and (6)). The expanded formula applies to all employees (rather than only transitional residents as in the old section CE 2(9)). It excludes from taxable income employee share scheme benefits which accrue while a person is neither New Zealand resident nor deriving New Zealand source income. The extent of such accrual is determined by first establishing the entire period over which the benefit accrues, and then determining the proportion of that period during which the person is non-resident and not deriving New Zealand source income from their employment. The period of accrual ends once the rights vest, rather than when the income arises. So, for example, in the case of an option, the period of accrual ends once the options are exercisable rather than when they are actually exercised. The employee share scheme income is treated as non-residents’ foreign source income (which is not taxable income) to the extent of this proportion. 19 Example 24: Apportionment for overseas service – options Facts Nick is employed by Eagle Limited. On 1 June 2017 he was granted an option to buy 1,000 shares for $500. The option vests one year after it was granted (1 June 2018). He can exercise the option at any time between 1 June 2018 and 1 June 2020. Nick is sent on secondment to Eagle Limited’s Australian parent company, Philly Limited, on 30 June 2017 for two years. He does not return to New Zealand throughout his secondment and loses his New Zealand tax residence from the day he left New Zealand, as he has been away for more than 325 of 365 days, and does not have a permanent home in New Zealand. Nick returns to New Zealand at the end of his secondment (30 June 2020). On 1 December 2018, Eagle Limited shares are worth $2 per share. Nick decides to exercise his option for $500. He therefore earns income of $1,500 on 1 December 2018. Result Nick’s income of $1,500 is apportioned by reference to the date when the options vested (1 June 2018), not the share scheme taxing date (1 December 2018): $1,500 × 336 days (offshore period) ÷ 365 days (earning period) = $1,380.82 The earning period is from 1 June 2017 to 31 May 2018. The offshore period in this case would be from 30 June 2018 to 31 May 2018 – the number of days in the earning period when Nick was not resident in New Zealand. Therefore $1,380.82 is treated as non-residents’ foreign-sourced income and is not taxed in New Zealand. Nick will be taxable on the remaining $119.18 of his employee share scheme benefits. Analysis The earning period ends when the option vests, not when it is in fact exercised. However, that does not affect the principle that the amount of income that must be apportioned is determined by the value of the shares when the option is exercised. Transfers to associates There is no change to the treatment of transfers to associates. Such transfers do not trigger the share scheme taxing date (section CE 7B(1)(b)). Rollover relief for transfer to new scheme If a person’s employee share scheme rights are cancelled and replaced with rights in a different scheme, the value of the replacement rights is not included in the person’s income arising due to the cancellation of the original scheme (sections CE 2(2)(c) and CE 7D). In the usual case where an employee’s rights in an existing scheme are simply replaced by rights in a new scheme, no income will arise under section CE 2. The benefit provided by the replacement scheme is taxed appropriately by applying the new rules to that scheme. 20 TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYERS’ DEDUCTION Sections CV 20, DV 27 and DV 28 A deduction is available to employers providing employee share benefits, which matches the income to employees in timing and quantity. Deductions previously available for other payments are disallowed where those payments would otherwise lead to a double deduction. Background The principle of neutral tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits supports employers being entitled to a deduction for the value of the benefit provided. The fact that the issue of shares by a company does not involve an explicit cash cost does not affect this principle. There is a transfer of value to the employee from the other shareholders, which arises whether that value is transferred as cash or as shares in the company. Under the corporate tax system, where company expenses are deducted by the company as a separate taxpayer from its shareholders, this cost must be recognised in the calculation of income by the company, rather than the shareholders on whose behalf the income is earned and the cost incurred. Ways to create a deduction existed under the old rules. For example, the employer could claim a deduction for: • payment of a bonus to the employee which was used to fund a full value share acquisit ion; • contributions to an employee share trust, which would then acquire shares for the emplo yee; or • reimbursement to a parent company to compensate it for providing employee shares. However, the tax treatment of these transactions was uncertain, and structuring to achieve the deduction sometimes incurred unnecessary transaction costs. There was also the potential for the amount and timing of the deduction created by such transactions to not correctly reflect the economic cost to the company of providing the employee share scheme benefits. Key features The new rules allow a deduction to an employer equal in amount and timing to the income derived by an employee under the new rules, and deny a deduction for any other amount incurred to provide that benefit. They do not affect the deductibility of costs incurred in establishing or operating a scheme. They also allow an employee who pays more for shares than they are worth at the share scheme taxing date a deduction for that amount. 21 Application date The new share scheme taxing date and rules for calculating employee share scheme income will apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules on or before 29 September 2018. Detail analysis An employer is denied a deduction for expenditure or loss incurred in providing employee share scheme benefits (section DV 27(2)), except for: • costs incurred in making a loan under the scheme or in establishing or managing the scheme (section DV 27(3)). Costs of establishing or managing include legal and accounting fees incurred in setting up the scheme, as well as on-going management fees. Deductibility of these costs is left to the usual capital/revenue tests. Costs incurred by an employee share scheme trust are treated as incurred by the employer or issuing company, as a result of the new provision treating the trustee of an employee share scheme trust as a nominee of the employer or issuing company (section CE 6); • an amount equal to the employee’s income, which is treated as a cost incurred at the same time as the employee recognises the income (section DV 27(6)-(8)). Deductibility of this cost depends on meeting the general permission and not being subject to any of the limitat ions. However, deductibility is not limited by the apportionment formula in new section CE 2(5) and (6); and • amounts which are taxable to the employee as employment income other than as employee share scheme benefits (section DV 27(5)). This is intended to preserve a deduction for the cost of paying a bonus where the payment of the bonus is part of the terms of an employee share scheme. Accordingly: • payments to fund an employee share scheme trust to acquire shares, or to reimburse a parent for providing shares, are not deductible; and • in order to correctly calculate their deduction, as a practical matter, employers need to either prohibit employees from transferring their rights to a non-associate before the share scheme taxing date, or place a requirement on employees to inform them of the time and amount paid in such a transfer. In order to prevent double deductions, when shares are provided to an employee and a deduction has been taken for that provision other than in accordance with to the new section, the deduction under the new section is reduced by the earlier deduction (section DV 27(8)(b)). However, it is only the amount of any deductions in respect of costs attributable to the particular share scheme benefits which have given rise to taxable income to the employee in question which are taken into account. Transitional arrangements As a transitional measure, the deduction rules provide for a mechanism to make adjustments to deductions incurred before 29 September 2018 (six months after the date of enactment) (section DV 27(8)(b)(ii)). 22 Example 25 Facts On 1 July 2016, a New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian multinational provided an employee with an option to acquire 5,000 shares in the Australian parent for $3 per share, exercisable on or after 1 July 2018, provided the employee was still employed by the group at that date. The employee remained employed, and exercises the option on 3 December 2018, when the shares are worth $3.50 each. Scenario 1 Suppose that the employer had to make a recharge payment to the parent when the options were issued, of $500, being their value at that time. The employer took a deduction for this payment. Result of scenario 1 The employer has income of $250. This is the result of the formula in section DV 27(7), being $250 − $500. The $250 is the employee’s income under section CE 2(1). The $500 is the previous deduction allowed to the employer. Subsection (9) states that a negative amount is income. Scenario 2 Suppose that the recharge payment is still $500, but it is made when the option is exercised. Result of scenario 2 The employer has a deduction of $250. The recharge is not deductible due to section DV 27(2). Subsection (7) gives a deduction for the $250 which is taxable to the employee. 23 EFFECT OF DEDUCTION AND PAYMENTS ON AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL Sections CD 25 and CD 43 The new rules tax any benefit conferred on an employee by the issuance of shares in an employee share scheme in the same way as an equivalent cash payment followed by an acquisit ion o f shares in the issuing company. Consistent with this principle, the rules provide for an increase in the employer’s available subscribed capital (ASC) by the amount deemed to be paid (plus actually paid) for the shares. The rules also cater for the situation where the employer is not the company issuing the shares. This is a taxpayer-friendly measure to ensure employee share schemes are not disadvantaged as a form of remuneration compared with an equivalent cash transaction, which would generally give rise to an ASC increase. Background To ensure neutrality between provision of benefits under an employee share scheme and an equivalent cash transaction, as well as providing for the income and deduction consequences, the new rules provide for changes to a company’s ASC. To do this, the rules provide for an increase in the employer’s ASC by the amount deemed to be paid (plus actually paid) for the shares. The proposed rules also cater for the situation where the employer is not the company issuing the shares (this is common where the employer company is a subsidiary and the employee receives shares in the parent company). In order to cater for the common practice of acquiring employee share scheme shares from other shareholders rather than by a fresh issue of shares, it is also necessary to ensure that the treasury stock regime can apply sensibly to employee share schemes. Key features The ASC provisions deal with the effect of employee share scheme transactions on the employer and (if different) the company whose shares are provided to the employee (the share provider). The amount of the deduction to the employer will give rise to additional ASC for the employer and, if the shares issued are in the parent of the employer, the parent. In the latter case, any reimbursement paid to the parent reduces the subsidiary’s ASC but does not increase the parent’s ASC. If the employer has income from the issue of the shares, its ASC is reduced. The rules also ensure that the acquisition of shares from an employee as part of an employee share scheme can be treated for tax purposes as an acquisition of treasury stock provided the shares are re-allocated within a certain period of time. This rule applies regardless of whether the shares are acquired by the company itself and not cancelled, or they are acquired by a trustee who is treated for tax purposes as a nominee of the company. 24 A company can choose not to apply these new ASC rules if it issues employee share scheme shares for market value. Application date The ASC rules apply to the provision of shares which are taxed under the new rules. Detailed analysis Under section CD 43, if the employer is also the company whose shares are provided, then the emplo yer’s ASC is: • increased by: – the amount received for the provision of the shares (under existing section CD 43(2)(b)); and – the amount of its deduction for the provision of the shares (under new section CD 43(6E)(a)); • decreased by the amount of any income arising if it has income because the value of the shares provided is less than the amount received from the employee (under new section CD 43(29)). ASC Example 1 Facts Employer Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee for $2 per share (that is, at a $1 per share discount). The scheme taxing date is the date of issue. The employee has $700 income and Employer Co has a $700 deduction. ASC Result Employer Co’s ASC increases by $2,100, being the total of the $1,400 received for the provision of the shares and its $700 expenditure incurred for providing the shares. 25 ASC Example 2 Facts Employer Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee for $2 per share, funded by a loan from the employer. If the employee is still employed by the company after one year, the employee will receive a bonus of $1,400 grossed-up for PAYE, the net amount of which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $4 each. ASC result Issuing the shares gives rise to ASC of $1,400. If the shares are repurchased because the employee does not remain employed, that will usually give rise to an ASC reduction of $1,400 (unless the shares are held by a trustee or as treasury stock). Otherwise, at the share scheme taxing date, Employer Co’s ASC will increase by a further $1,400. This is made up of the $1,400 that it received from the employee for the shares and $1,400 it incurred in providing the shares (the difference between the value of the shares on the vesting date and their cost to the employee). ASC Example 3 Facts Employer Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee for $2 per share, funded by a loan from the employer. If the employee is still employed by the company after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus (grossed-up for PAYE), which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $1 each. ASC result As for ASC Example 2, at the share scheme taxing date Employer Co’s ASC will first increase by $2,800 (made up of the amount received from the employee for the shares plus the expenditure incurred by the company to provide the shares). However, the ASC amount will then decrease by $700 because the value of the shares provided is less than the amount received from the employee (section CD 43(29)). If the employer is not the company whose shares are provided, then the employer’s ASC is: • increased by the amount of its deduction for providing the shares (new section CD 43(6E)(a)); • decreased by the amount of any income arising if it has income because the value of the shares is less than the amount received from the employee (new section CD 43(29)); and • decreased by the amount of any reimbursement paid to the share provider (new sectio n CD 43(6F) and (6H)). The adjustment is made to the employer’s share class most similar to the shares provided under the scheme. If the decrease due to reimbursement exceeds the increase arising due to a deduction, and the excess is greater than the ASC of the relevant share class, the reimbursement amount is to that extent taxed as a dividend (section CD 43(6I)). 26 ASC Example 4 Facts Parent Co, the one hundred percent owner of Employer Co, issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share. The scheme taxing date is the date of issue. The employee has $700 income and Employer Co has a $700 deduction. ASC result for Employer Co Employer Co’s ASC increases by the amount of its $700 expenditure. ASC Example 5 Facts Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus (grossed-up for PAYE) from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $5 each. If the employee remains employed, Employer Co will have a deduction of $2,100, being the difference between the market value of the shares at that time (700 × $5), and their cost to the employee (700 × $2). ASC result for Employer Co If the employee stays employed for the year, at the share scheme taxing date, Employer Co’s ASC will increase by $2,100 - the amount which is both taxable to the employee and expenditure for Employer Co under the employee share scheme rules. ASC Example 6 Facts As for ASC Example 5, Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by the Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus (grossed-up for PAYE) from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $5 each. However, unlike ASC Example 5, if the shares are not forfeited, Employer Co pays Parent Co $1 per share reimbursement. ASC result for Employer Co Employer Co’s ASC will increase by $1,400 if the employee remains employed, which is the difference between its $2,100 deduction and its $700 reimbursement to Parent Co. 27 If the shares are provided by the ultimate parent of the employer, the ASC of the parent company is: • increased by: – the amount paid by the employee for the shares (under existing section CD 43(2)(b)); and – the amount of the employer’s deduction for the provision of the shares (new section CD 43(6E)(b)); • decreased by the amount of any income arising to the employer if it has income because the value of the shares provided is less than the amount received from the employee (new section CD 43(29)); and • unaffected by any amount paid to it by the employer (new section CD 43(20B)). ASC Example 7: Parent Co Facts Parent Co, the one hundred percent owner of Employer Co, issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share. The scheme taxing date is the date of issue. The employee has $700 income and Employer Co has a $700 deduction. ASC result for Parent Co Parent Co’s ASC increases by the $1,400 received for the issue of its shares plus the $700 deductible to Employer Co (for a total ASC increase of $2,100). ASC Example 8: Parent Co Facts Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by the Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus (grossed-up for PAYE) from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $5 each. ASC result for Parent Co The initial issue of the shares gives rise to ASC of $1,400. If the shares are repurchased by Parent Co because the employee does not remain employed, that will usually give rise to an ASC reduction of $1,400. Otherwise, at the share scheme taxing date, Parent Co’s ASC will increase by a further $2,100, the amount which is both taxable to the employee and expenditure for Employer Co. 28 ASC Example 9: Parent Co Facts As for ASC Example 6, Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by the Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. If the shares are not forfeited, Employer Co pays Parent Co $1 per share reimbursement. The shares are worth $1 each after one year. ASC result Parent Co’s ASC will increase by $1,400 when the shares are issued. If the employee remains employed: • the reimbursement of $1 per share does not affect Parent Co’s ASC; and • Parent Co’s ASC decreases by $700 – the amount of the income arising to Employer Co as a result of the amount payable by the employee for the shares ($1,400) being in excess of the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date ($700). Treasury stock If an employee share scheme trustee acquires shares for the purposes of the scheme, those shares are treated as acquired by the share issuer (section CE 6). The amount paid to the selling shareholder for their acquisition is a dividend, unless one of the exceptions to dividend treatment applies. If the shares are held by the trustee, the treasury stock rules apply to them. Amendments have been made to the treasury stock rules so that they apply more clearly in such a case. New section CD 25(1)(a) makes it explicit that the treasury stock regime can apply to an acquisition by an employee share scheme trust, just as if the shares were acquired by the company and not cancelled. For shares allocated to an employee within one year of their acquisition by the company or a trustee, their acquisit io n and re-issue will be ignored by the share issuer (but not an employer who is not the share issuer) for ASC purposes. This will happen due to the operation of the usual treasury stock provisions (that is, section CD 25(19)) in relation to the amount received by the company on re-issue and the definition of “returns” in section CD 43(2)(c) in relation to the amount paid by the company to acquire the shares. Note that the shares would only have to be allocated to the employee under the scheme within 12 months of acquisition to qualify for treasury stock treatment – they do not have to be transferred to the employee. The only time any ASC adjustment is required is when shares are not allocated to an emplo yee wit hin one year of acquisition, issue or ceasing to be allocated to another employee, or when shares are issued for other than market value. Shares which are allocated to an employee within a year and then forfeited by the employee are treated as acquired by the company at that time for the amount the trustee paid for them when originally acquired (new section CD 25(7)). The shares will continue to be dealt with as treasury stock, but with a new acquisition date. 29 Shares which are not allocated within one year are treated as having been acquired on market and cancelled (amendments to section CD 25(2)(b)). ASC Example 10 Facts An employee share scheme trust for Employer Co acquires 700 Employer Co shares on market for $2.50 per share. Six months later, when they are worth $3 per share, it allocates them to an employee for $2 per share. The purchase price is funded by a loan from Employer Co. If the employee is still employed by Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus from Employer Co (grossed-up for PAYE), which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $5 each. ASC result for Employer Co The trustee’s acquisition of the shares is treated as an on-market acquisition of treasury stock by Employer Co. Because the shares are allocated to an employee within 12 months of acquisition, the acquisition is not treated as reverting to an on-market cancellation under section CD 25(2). Therefore the amount paid to acquire the shares does not reduce Employer Co’s ASC and the $1,400 paid by the employee to acquire the shares does not increase Employer Co’s ASC. If the employee does not stay for 12 months, Employer Co will be treated as acquiring the shares at that time for $2.50 per share, the amount for which they were initially acquired on market. This acquisition will not reduce Parent Co’s ASC if the shares are allocated to another employee within 12 months. Shares issued for market value The ASC rules applying to employee share scheme shares can be disregarded by a company if it issues employee share scheme shares for market value, or a reasonable estimate of market value, at the time of issue. In this case, the company’s ASC is not affected by the amount of any income or deduction arising due to any difference between the issue price and the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date. 30 ASC Example 11: Loan funded scheme Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire newly issued shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; and • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold. The employee remains employed for three years, and chooses to continue in the scheme, as the shares are worth $18,000 at that time. Result B Co’s ASC will increase by $10,000 when it issues the shares. Prima facie it will also increase by $8,000 at the end of year three, unless the company elects to the contrary. Analysis The $10,000 received by B Co is ASC under section CD 43(2), because it is within the definition of “subscriptions”. The $8,000 is also included in “subscriptions” under section CD 43(6E). However, B Co can elect out of section CD 43(6E), because it issued the shares for their market value (section CD 43(6EB). 31 EXEMPT EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES Sections CW 26B, CW 26C, CW 26D, CW 26E, CW 26F, CW 26G, DV 28, and section 63B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Income Tax Act 2007 provides a concessionary regime to employers who offer shares to employees under certain widely-offered “exempt employee share schemes”. The old rules governing such exempt schemes were out of date, complex and no longer fit for purpose. They also did not fit wit hin New Zealand’s broad base, low rate tax framework. The new rules: •m odernise and simplify the criteria for these schemes, including removing employers’ ten percent notional interest deduction; •increase the monetary threshold for the schemes (which has not been increased since 1980); and •address the current ability for employers to claim unintended deductions for the cost of providing the exempt share benefit to employees. B ackground Since the 1970s, the Income Tax Act has contained a concessionary regime to encourage employers to offer shares to employees under certain widely-offered employee share schemes. The concession is on the basis that the schemes are designed to increase employee engagement at all levels of the company and align employee and shareholder incentives. They may also assist employees to develop and improve financial literacy skills. There were previously two main tax benefits available under the regime: 1. Exemption for employee: The value of a benefit received by an employee under a concessionary scheme is not taxable to the employee. 2. Deemed interest deduction for employer: The employer is given a deemed deduction of ten percent notional interest on loans made to employees to buy shares. This is additional to any deduction for actual interest incurred on money borrowed to finance the scheme. Another benefit under the regime is that interest-free loans made under an exempt scheme are automatically exempt from Fringe Benefit Tax ( FBT). The FBT-exempt status of the loans is a limited benefit. In most cases such loans would be FBT-exempt in any event, as “employee share loans” (that is, any loan provided by an employer to an employee to purchase its shares under an employee share scheme). The only real benefit of the specific FBT exempt ion is that the interest-free loan can be FBT-exempt regardless of the company’s dividend paying policy. T here were various issues with the old regime: •t he regime was complex and inflexible; 32 •the tax benefits of the regime were uncertain and poorly targeted; •the regime did not explicitly limit the amount of tax-free benefit that can be conferred; •there were some minor drafting issues with the legislation; and •the maximum amount an employee could pay for shares ($2,340 over a three-year period) had not been adjusted since 1980, and this meant as a practical matter that the benefits available under the regime were very limited. Adjusted for wage inflation, the figure would now be around $13,000. Key features T he new rules simplify and clarify the legislation relating to exempt schemes, while retaining many of the key features of the original schemes and their tax treatment. In many cases, the requirements are relaxed. Where the original policy was no longer appropriate or unintended consequences arose, the amendments address this. Under the new rules, shares provided to employees under schemes that meet certain criteria (described below in the detailed analysis) are exempt income to the employees. Benefits provided under schemes that qualified for the old tax-exempt treatment simply continue to qualify under the new legislation, but such schemes are now entitled to provide the same level of exempt benefits as new schemes. For all exempt schemes, from 6 April 2017, employers are explicitly denied a deduction for the cost of providing the shares (other than scheme management and administration costs) and the ten percent notional interest deduction is repealed. The automatic exemption from FBT for loans provided under exempt schemes in section CX 10(2) continues. Application dates The amendments generally apply from 29 March 2018. However, new section DV 28, which denies employers a deduction for expenditure or loss in relation to an exempt employee share scheme (other than establishment or operational costs) applies on and after 6 April 2017 if shares under the exempt scheme were acquired other than in the ordinary course of the scheme. D etailed analysis I ncome tax exemption for shares provided under exempt schemes Sect ion CW 26B provides that amounts derived from exempt schemes are exempt income. Wh ile a tax exemption for employment income does not fit generally within New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate tax framework, given there is a limit on the amount of benefit that can be provided under the scheme ($2,000 per employee per annum) and the scheme has to be offered to almost all employees, it is appropriate to retain the tax exemption to minimise compliance costs. 33 Employer deduction for shares provided under exempt schemes There were several potential deductions associated with exempt schemes: 1. the ten percent notional interest deduction with respect to employee share loans; 2. costs associated with setting up and running the scheme; and 3. in some cases, the direct or indirect costs of acquiring shares for the scheme. T he ten percent notional interest deduction in item 1 above has been repealed. The original policy rationale for this benefit is unclear and it is inconsistent with our BBLR tax framework. New section DV 28 denies a deduction for any costs associated with exempt schemes, other than administrative and management fees associated with setting up and running the scheme. This is on the basis that when the rules were originally enacted (in the 1970s) it was not envisaged that employers would be eligible for a deduction (as there is no deduction for issuing shares). It has subsequently become apparent that employers can adopt structures that allow them to claim deduct ions. These deductions are unintended and should never have been available. Therefore, employers are not able to extend these unintended deductions by accelerating the purchase of a large parcel of shares through a trust, which are then allocated to employees over a number of years in the future. However, provided that the shares have been acquired in the ordinary course of the scheme, a later application date (29 March 2018) is appropriate. T his ensures that the unintended deductions identified in item 3 above are no longer available, but the deductions identified in item 2 are still available, subject to the usual limitations. This is consistent with the general deductibility provision for employee share scheme benefits in new section DV 27. Meaning of exempt scheme and criteria for qualifying for exemption The new rules have been designed to ensure existing schemes (that is, schemes in existence before the effective date of the new rules) that meet the criteria described below can continue to operate without unnecessary disruption. Therefore, to the extent possible the existing rules have been retained and simply clarified. E xisting exempt schemes approved by the Commissioner under previous legislation (for example, section DC 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007), continue to be “exempt employee share schemes” and are eligible for the tax exemption, provided they continue to meet the criteria under which they were approved as modified by the increase in the benefit level in section CW 26C(2). T he underlying policy of the criteria is to ensure: 1. the scheme is genuinely offered to the vast majority of employees on equal terms – for example, it cannot just be targeted towards executives; 2. related to 1, all employees have to be able to afford to participate in the scheme, not just the more highly paid employees. T his is achieved by limiting the cost of the shares that can be offered, requiring employers to provide financing for any cost or because the employee does not have to pay anything for the shares; 3. there is a limit on the benefit that can be provided; and 34 4. the scheme is genuinely a share scheme and not just a mechanism to provide tax-free cash to employees (this is why there is a restriction period). Criteria To achieve this policy, all the following proposed criteria must be met in order for a scheme to be exempt. •The cost to employees of shares made available for purchase must not exceed their market value at the date of purchase but may be less (section CW 26C(2)(a)). •The maximum value of shares provided under an exempt scheme is $5,000 per annum (section CW 26C(2)(b)). •The maximum discount an employer can provide to an employee is $2,000 per annum (section CW 26C(2)(c)). This means that the most an employee can spend buying shares per annum is $3,000 ($3,000 plus the $2,000 discount means a maximum value of $5,000 worth of shares). This equates to a maximum cost of $9,000 over three years. •Ninety percent or more of full-time permanent employees who are not subject to securit ies law o f other jurisdict ions must be eligible to participate in the scheme. If the scheme applies to part-time employees or to seasonal employees, the same threshold applies (section CW 26C(3)(a)-(c)). Previously, all full time emplo yees were required to be eligible to participate. •If the scheme has a minimum spend requirement, the amount can be no more than $1,000 per annum (section CW 26C(3)(d)). This is the updated equivalent of the old section DC 13(4) and increases the $624 per three year figure. •Any minimum period of service which may be required before an employee becomes eligible to participate must not exceed three years (or the equivalent of three years full- time service) (section CW 26C(3)(e)). •If the employee is required to pay any amount for the shares, then the employer must provide a loan for that amount or allow the employee to pay for the shares in instalments (section CW 26C(4)(a)). •Loans to employees for the purchase of shares must be free of all interest and other charges (section CW 26C(4)(b)). •Emplo yees will repay loans by regular equal instalments at intervals of not more than one month over a period between three and five years from the date of the loan (section CW 26C(4)(d)). This requirement can be satisfied by arrangements where shares are acquired regularly by the employee (for example, each payday) with the entire purchase price paid off each time, and also to arrangements where shares are acquired once and the purchase price is paid off in instalments. •Generally speaking, the shares must be held (either by the employee or by a trustee of a trust on behalf of the employee) for the longer of three years and when the loan is repaid –this is to ensure that the scheme is really a share purchase scheme, and not a mechanism for providing cash remuneration. However, the employee is not required to hold the shares beyond the date their employment ends. Also, if the employee has paid full market value for the shares, then they only have to hold them until they have fully repaid the loan (section CW 26C(7). 35 •The employee can choose to withdraw from the scheme by giving the employer one months’ notice and have their shares purchased back for the lesser of market value and cost (section CW 26C(6)). •If participation in the scheme is causing serious hardship for the employee, the terms of payment can be varied or employees can be allowed to withdraw from the scheme and receive the market value of their shares (section CW 26C(5)). •If the employee leaves employment before the three years is up, then: –if they leave because of death, accident, sickness, redundancy or retirement at normal retiring age they can keep the shares (subject to repayment of the loan) or have the shares bought back for the lesser of market value and cost; and –if they leave for any other reason, the shares are bought back at the lesser of cost and market value (section CW 26C(6) and (9)). •The exempt scheme does not require approval by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, however, the Commissioner must be notified of the scheme’s existence and the employer must advise the Commissioner of shares granted and contributions received under the scheme on an annual basis, in an annual return (section 63B of the Tax Administration Act 1994). •There is no requirement for a scheme to have a trustee – many schemes have trustees as a matter of convenience. Removing this requirement provides greater flexibility (especially for small employers who may not want the administrative expense o f operating a trust for a small scheme). 36 TECHNICAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL MATTERS Sections CE 2, CE 6, CZ 1, EX 38, GB 49B, HC 27, and section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 A number of transitional and consequential provisions are needed to support the core amendments. These provisio ns: •specify a cost base for shares acquired under an employee share scheme (new section CE 2(4)); •provide for the treatment of employee share scheme shares subject to the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules (amended section EX 38); •specify the treatment of employee share scheme trusts (new section CE 6 and repeal of previous section HC 27(3B)); •introduce a specific anti-avoidance rule to counteract tax avoidance transactions with respect to employee share schemes (new section GB 49B); •make an amendment so that shortfall penalties apply to employers who do not take reasonable care in reporting employee share scheme benefits (amendments to the definition of “tax shortfall” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994); •provide transitional rules for existing schemes to ensure taxpayers have sufficient time to amend schemes (if necessary) to take account of the new law following enactment of the Bill (new section CZ 1); and •replace the former terminology – share purchase agreement – with the new term – employee share scheme – throughout the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994. A pplication date T here are various application dates for each of the amendments, as specified below. K ey features C ost base I ncome from an employee share scheme benefit is added to the cost of the shares for tax purposes (new section CE 2(4)). Similarly, a deduction reduces the cost base. T his provision applies from 29 September 2018. F IF regime T he new rules effectively exclude from the FIF regime employee share scheme shares which are treated as owned by the employee for tax purposes but for which the share scheme taxing date has not arisen. Before that time, it is appropriate to tax the dividends on the shares, but 37 not appropriate to tax any change in value, since that will be taxed when the shares give rise to income under section CE 2. See amendments to section EX 38. This provision applies from 29 September 2018. Trusts As referred to above, an employee share scheme trustee is treated as the nominee of the employer and (if different) the share issuing company to the extent of is activities on their behalf (new section CE 6). This means that the activities of the trustee on behalf of those companies are treated as undertaken directly by the companies themselves. They will therefore have no effect on the trustee’s taxable income. Like any other nominee, the trustee will still have to file a tax return if it is remunerated for its services. Section HC 27(3B), which dealt with the situation where an employer has claimed a deduction for a settlement on an employee share scheme trustee, has been repealed, as such settlements will no longer be deductible. These provisions apply from 29 September 2018. Specific anti-avoidance provision A new specific anti-avoidance provision allows the Commissioner to counteract any tax advantage gained from an arrangement which attempts to circumvent the intent and application of the share scheme taxing date or employee share scheme definitions. T his provision applies from 29 September 2018. P enalties The definition of a “tax shortfall” has been amended so that an employer who is required to report the amount of an employee’s share scheme income in a tax return, and who fails to take reasonable care in determining the amount of that income, is liable for the same shortfall penalty whether or not the employer has elected to pay PAYE on the benefit. There is no basis for differentiating in this respect between employers who do and those who do not withho ld PAYE. This provision applies from 29 March 2018. T ransitional rules E mployee share schemes are often long-term arrangements, lasting three or more years. Additionally, new share schemes are set up fairly regularly by companies and it is important for companies and employee participants to have clarity around the tax laws when they enter into these arrangements. A ccordingly, it is important to provide sufficient transitional measures for existing and contemplated employee share schemes. It is not desirable to put employers and employees in a position where employees are being granted employee share scheme benefits without certainty as to their tax treatment. However, it would also not be appropriate for employers and employees to be able to unduly extend the application of the existing rules by artificially 38 qualifying for grandparenting grants of employee share scheme benefits which are not, in substance, intended to be conferred until a much later time. To balance these competing objectives, there are three types of transitional relief, pursuant to which the new rules will not apply to employee share benefits provided after enactment. The first is the general implementation rule in section 2(34), which provides that the new taxing provisions only take effect from 29 September 2018. This means the new rules will not apply to benefits where the share scheme taxing date is before 29 September 2018. The second and third cases of transitional relief apply where the share scheme taxing date is on or after 29 September 2018. The second case applies to shares granted or acquired (including by a trustee) before 12 March 2016, when the officials’ issues paper Taxation of employee share schemes was published. Such shares are never subject to tax under the new rules (see section CZ 1(b)). The third case applies to shares granted or acquired (including by a trustee) between 12 May 2016 and 29 September 2018. Such shares are not taxed under the new rules provided that: • they were not granted or acquired for a purpose of avoiding the application of the new rules; and • the share scheme taxing date under the new rules is before 1 April 2022. In this case, if the shares are taxable under both the old and new rules, the amount taxed under the old rules reduces the amount taxable under the new rules – see section CE 2(1). 39
May 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Employee share schemes Sections CD 25, CD 43, CE 1, CE 2, CE 6, CE 7, CE 7B, CE 7C, CE 7D, CV 20, CW 26B, CW 26C, CW 26D, CW 26E, CW 26F, CW 26G, CZ 1, DV 27, DV 28, EX 38, GB 49B, HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 3(1) and 63B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This special report provides early information on changes to employee share schemes in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018, enacted on 29 March 2018, and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the June 2018 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Employee share schemes are arrangements for companies to provide shares and share options to their emplo yees. They are an important form of employee remuneration in New Zealand and internationally. Although the design and the accounting treatment of these plans have evolved considerably over recent decades, the tax rules applying to them in New Zealand had not been comprehensively reviewed during that period and were out of date. Recently a number of problems with these rules emerged, primarily in three areas: • complex arrangements allow taxable labour income to be converted into tax-free capital gains; • there is no employer deduction for the provision of employee share scheme benefits in some circumstances; and • the rules and thresholds relating to tax-exempt widely-offered employee share schemes are outdated and need review. New core rules Changes have been made to the core rules for the taxation of employee share schemes following enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018. The objective of the proposals is neutral tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits. That is, to the extent possible, the tax position of both the employer and the employee should be the same whether remuneratio n for labour is paid in cash or shares. This will ensure that employee share schemes cannot be structured to reduce the tax payable in respect of these arrangements, as compared to an equivalent cash salary or other more straight-forward employee share schemes. Generally, these rules will apply to benefits where the taxing point under the previous law has not occurred before 29 September 2018. 1 This special report covers changes that: • determine the taxing point for employee share schemes as being when an employee is treated as having earned shares under an employee share scheme, and after which they hold the shares like any other shareholder; • provide a new deduction rule for employers providing employee share scheme benefits to employees, which aligns the tax treatment of providing employee share scheme benefits with the tax treatment of paying other types of employment income; • simplify the rules for certain exempt employee share schemes, with a greater level of exempt benefits able to be provided and more flexibility in the design of these schemes; and • make other consequential and technical amendments. 2 SCOPE OF THE NEW RULES Sections CE 1, CE 2, CE 6, CE 7, CE 7B, CE 7C, CE 7D, DV 27 The new income and deduction rules apply to arrangements where employees receive shares as part of their remuneration package. There are a number of qualifications and carve outs to the definition of “employee share scheme” so that the rules are appropriately targeted. Background The definition of “employee share scheme” is a key component of the rules. The core employee share scheme rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 previously applied to “share purchase agreements”. These are agreements to dispose of or issue shares to an employee, entered into in connection with the employee’s employment or service, whether or not an employment relationship exists when the employee receives a benefit under the agreement. Under the old rules there was some uncertainty as to whether this definition encompassed arrangements entered into before a person commenced a formal employment relationship and had received a PAYE income payment. This definition also excluded shareholder-employees to the extent to which they chose not to deduct PAYE. There is no policy rationale for excluding these classes of recipients of employee share scheme benefits. Key features The new rules apply to benefits provided under arrangements that involve issuing or transferring shares to past, present and future employees 1 or shareholder-emplo yees (or their associates) of the issuing company (or a group company). They do not apply to arrangements that involve issuing shares to other goods or service providers. The new rules do not apply to arrangements that require emplo yees to: • pay market value for the shares on the “share scheme taxing date” (described in more detail below, but generally the date on which the employee holds the shares like any other shareholder); or • put at risk shares they acquired for market value, where the scheme provides no protection to the person against a fall in the value of the shares. They also do not apply to exempt employee share schemes (which have their own specific rules, discussed below). 1 This includes any person receiving a PAYE income payment. A PAYE income payment includes a schedular payment – that is, a payment subject to withholding because it is of a class set out in Schedule 4 of the Act. 3 When the new rules do not apply, shares provided in exchange for goods and services will be taxable to the recipient under general principles applying to barter transactions. Application date The new rules apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules before 29 September 2018. There are further details on the application date in the section on technical, consequential and transit ional matters. Detailed analysis Under sections CE 1(1)(d), CE 2, and CE 6 – 7D, a benefit received under an employee share scheme is income of a person. Section DV 27 governs the corresponding deductions available to the employer offering the employee share scheme. “Employee share scheme” is defined in section CE 7 as an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder-employee) of that company or of another company in the same group, if that arrangement is connected to the person’s employment or service. It also includes the provision of shares to an associate of the employee or shareholder- employee (for example, a family trust), if the arrangement is connected with the emplo yee’s emplo yment or service. The use of the term “arrangement” covers all aspects of a scheme, for example, direct transfers of shares, loans to buy shares, bonuses, put and call options, and transfers to trusts, etc. The definition also covers past, present and future employees, and includes shareholder- emplo yees. However, an employee share scheme does not include an arrangement that requires an employee, shareholder-employee, or associate to: • pay market value for the shares on the “share scheme taxing date” (described in more detail below, but generally the date on which the employee holds the shares like any other shareholder); or • put at risk shares they acquired for market value where the scheme provides no protection to the person against a fall in the value of the shares. This exception does not apply if the person acquired the shares using funds which were required to be used for the acquisit io n. 4 Example 1 Jim is employed by ABC Co, a closely-held company. As part of his employment agreement, after he has worked for the company for three years, if the company’s other shareholders are happy with his performance, they will let him buy twenty five percent of the company’s shares for their current market value at that time. While this is an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder-employee), market value will be paid for the shares on the share scheme taxing date. Accordingly, this arrangement is not an employee share scheme for the purposes of the proposed new definition. Example 2 Casey, Hamish and Steve get together and incorporate a company to develop some technology-related intellectual property (IP). They are each employed by the company. When the shares are issued they are worth virtually nothing (on a balance sheet basis) and a nominal subscription price of $0.01 is paid by each shareholder-employee. The shareholders’ agreement states that to ensure they commit to developing the IP over three years, if they leave within three years they forfeit their shares. While this is an arrangement with a purpose or effect of issuing or transferring shares in a company to a person who will be, is, or has been an employee (or shareholder-employee), market value was paid for the shares, not using money provided to the employees for that purpose, and the employees have then chosen to put the shares at risk. Accordingly, this arrangement is not an employee share scheme for the purposes of the proposed new definition. Example 3 Melissa is hired as CEO by X Co, a closely-held company with exciting but uncertain prospects. She is paid a $120,000 per annum salary. Because she is an employee, she is also able to buy $50,000 worth of shares (which is the current market value – established by an independent valuation). If Melissa leaves employment within three years, X Co has the right to buy her shares back for the lesser of $50,000 and market value. After that date, it has the right to buy the shares back for full market value. This is because X Co does not want Melissa to hold its shares if she is not part of their team, but after three years they are prepared for Melissa to receive the upside in the shares. Before then, she bears the risk of loss but no chance of gain. If the shares fall to $10,000 and Melissa leaves X Co within three years, the company will buy her shares back for $10,000 and she will lose $40,000 of her $50,000 investment. If Melissa leaves the company within three years and the shares are worth $1 million, then the company will buy them back for $50,000 and Melissa will be denied the upside. This arrangement is not an employee share scheme as defined as Melissa has paid market value for her shares not using consideration provide to her for this purpose, and has then effectively put them at risk for three years. If X Co paid Melissa a signing bonus of $74,627 on the basis that the after tax amount of $50,000 would be used to acquire the shares, the arrangement would be an employee share scheme – see in particular section CE 7(b)(iii). 5 Example 4 Think Big Ltd is an engineering consultancy firm, in which the principal employees are also shareholders and directors. New principals are required to subscribe for shares pro rata with existing principals. The price is: 3 × the average of previous three year’s earnings ÷ number of principals The shares must be sold back to the company when the principal ceases employment. The same formula is used to determine the amount payable to a principal when they leave the company. However, if the principal leaves to go to another engineering consultancy in New Zealand, the principal gets back no more than the amount subscribed for their shares. Think Big Ltd has received advice that the formula is a reasonable approximation of how a third party purchaser would value the firm. The company is prepared to lend the share subscription amount to new principals. Over the following five years a portion of the dividends payable by the principal on their shares must be used to repay the loan. If the principal leaves the firm before the loan is repaid, they still have to repay the loan in full. In order to be an employee share scheme as defined in section CE 7, the arrangement must come within one of the limbs of paragraph (a) and not be excluded by any of the limbs of paragraph (b). The arrangement has a purpose of transferring shares in Think Big Ltd to the new principal, who is either an employee or a shareholder-employee (as defined) of the company. The arrangement is connected with the new principal’s employment or service. It therefore satisfies paragraph (a)(i) or (a)(ii). The arrangement is not an exempt employee share scheme, so is not excluded by paragraph (b)(i). If the three times average earnings formula is a reasonable way to determine market value consideration, the arrangement might be excluded from being an employee share scheme by paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition. However, because this amount is not payable if the employee leaves to go to a competitor, paragraph (ii) is not in fact satisfied. Neither is paragraph (b)(iii) satisfied. Assuming the amount paid for the shares is their market value: • The arrangement does require the person to put the shares at risk, because if the amount in the formula declines, the person will get less on the sale of their shares than they paid. • However, the consideration for the shares is provided by the company by way of a loan, on the basis that it is used for acquiring the shares. If a new principal uses their own funds to acquire the shares, paragraph (b)(iii) would be satisfied. The definition of employee share scheme also excludes exempt schemes (which have their own specific rules, discussed below). 6 TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEE’S INCOME Sections CE 1, CE 2, CE 6, CE 7, CE 7B, CE 7C, CE 7D, DV 27 The amendments ensure that the timing and amount of an employee’s inco me fro m an employee share scheme is consistent with other forms of employment income. Background Any reward for services is generally taxable as income, under the ordinary definition. However, the application of the common law of income tax to the provision of rewards in the form of property, for example shares or options, has sometimes been problematic. For that reason, since 1968, New Zealand tax law has contained special provisions relating to the taxation of employee share scheme benefits. Under the previous law, shares provided under an employee share scheme were taxable when the employee acquired the shares. The previous section CE 6(2) provided that: • shares acquired pursuant to an option were treated as acquired when the option was exercised. This meant that an employee was not taxed on the grant or vesting of an option, but on its exercise; and • shares acquired by a trustee for the benefit of an employee (that is, a specific employee) were treated as acquired by the employee, even if the employee might be required to forfeit the shares. The second of these rules led to outcomes that were neither tax-neutral nor consistent with the taxation of employee share options. Examples 5, 6, 7 and 8 reflect the previous rules. Example 5 Jim has a tax rate of 33%. If his employer offers him a $1,000 bonus if he is still working for the employer in a year’s time, he will receive (if he satisfies the condition) $1,000 of taxable income. If instead his employer decides to pay Jim the same bonus in shares, the tax neutral outcome would be for the employer to provide $1,000 of shares, and for Jim to pay $330 tax. In both cases Jim receives $1,000 of before-tax income and has paid $330 of tax. Tax will not be a factor in how Jim wants to be paid. 7 Example 6 Suppose that Jim’s employer offers him a cash bonus if he is still working for the employer in a year’s time. The amount of the bonus is the value of 1,000 shares in one year’s time. Suppose that 1,000 shares are worth $1,000 at the start of the year, when the offer is made, and $1,500 at the end of the year. Jim will not be taxed on $1,000. He will be taxed on $1,500 when he receives the cash bonus. Instead of offering a cash bonus dependent on the value of the shares, suppose Jim’s employer transfers 1,000 shares to a trustee, on the basis that the trustee will transfer them to Jim at the end of the year if he is still with the company, and not otherwise. The economic benefit to Jim is the same as in the first variation of this example. However, under prior law, Jim had income of $1,000 when the shares were transferred to the trustee. This was not consistent with the treatment of equivalent cash remuneration (that is, the first variation of this example), and therefore was not a neutral tax treatment. Example 7 Jane’s employer decides to provide her with options to buy 1,000 shares in the company. The shares are currently worth $1, and the options have a strike price of $1 (that is, they are issued “at the money”). The options can be exercised only if Jane is still employed in a year. Suppose there is an equal chance that the shares will be worth $600 or $1,600 in a year’s time. If they are worth $1,600, Jane exercises the options, and has $600 of taxable income. If they are worth $600, she does not exercise the options, and gets nothing. Example 8 Instead of providing options, suppose Jane’s employer sells her 1,000 shares for $1,000, and provides her with an interest-free loan to fund the purchase. The loan must be repaid after one year. The employer specifies that if the shares have fallen in value at the repayment date, Jane must sell the shares back to the employer for $1,000. Suppose the same share values and probabilities as in example 3. If the shares are worth $1,600 in one year, Jane will keep the shares and pay off the loan. If they are worth $600, she will sell them to the employer for $1,000 and use that money to pay off the loan. Under prior law, Jane had no taxable income from this arrangement, even though it produced outcomes identical with the option arrangement, under which Jane has $600 of income if she acquires the shares. The new rules prevent these inconsistent outcomes by deferring the time at which an employee recognises income from an employee share scheme in certain situations. In examples 2 and 5, under the new rules, both Jim and Jane will be taxed on the value of the shares once the employment condition is satisfied (in Jim’s case) or the employer’s right to acquire the shares for $1,000 no longer exists (in Jane’s case). Key features Section CE 7B provides that benefits provided under an employee share scheme (usually in the form of shares) are assessable income for an employee at the earlier of the date when: • the benefits are either transferred or cancelled; or • the employee share scheme beneficiary owns the shares in the same way as any other shareholder. They will not own the shares in the same way as any other shareholder if (for example) the employee is required to forfeit the shares if they choose to leave the 8 company, or the emplo yee is entit led to be compensated for a decline in the value of the shares. This time is referred to as the “share scheme taxing date”. There is no change to the share scheme taxing date for straight-forward employee share options, which already reflects this principle, in that the employee is not taxed until the option is exercised. The amount of the benefit is the amount received for the transfer or cancellation, or the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date. It is reduced by the amount paid (if any) for the benefit. The new rules require matching between the employee’s income and the employer’s deduction, so the rules outlined above also determine the amount and time of the deduction to the employer (the employer’s deduction is discussed further below). Application date The new share scheme taxing date and rules for calculating employee share scheme income will apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules on or before 29 September 2018. There is further detail on the transitional arrangements below. Timing of income The time when the employee is taxable is defined as the “share scheme taxing date”, and is defined in section CE 7B. Unless a share scheme beneficiary first transfers their share scheme benefits to a non- associate, or the company cancels them, the share scheme taxing date is when: • there is no material risk that beneficial ownership of the shares will change, or that the shares will be required to be transferred or cancelled; • the employee is not entitled to be compensated for a fall in the value of the shares; and • there is no material risk that there will be a change in the terms of the shares affecting their value. 9 Previous law All treated as tax-free capital gains N ew la w Em plo ym ent in com e Tax-free capital gains Entry into ESS (old taxing point) Shares owned by employee unrestricted Shares sold Em plo yee is no t the eco n om ic ow n er, and the shares are still being earned Employee has earned the shares, an d ho lds them like any other shareholder If the benefits are cancelled or transferred to a non-associate before these events occur, then the share scheme taxing date is at the time of the cancellation or transfer. In determining whether there is a risk of a change of ownership, transfer or cancellation, certain rights and requirements do not affect the employee’s status as the economic owner of the shares under the scheme (section CE 7B(2)) and are ignored. They are rights or requirements: • for transfer for market value; • not contemplated by the employee share scheme; • that have no material risk of occurring; • that are of no material commercial significance; or • that also apply to shares not subject to the employee share scheme. The following series of examples illustrate how the new rules will work in practice for commo n types of employee share schemes. Example 9: Simple vesting period Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee leaves the company for any reason during the next three years, the shares are forfeited for no consideration. After three years, the shares are transferred to the employee. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the three years is up and the employee is still employed. Analysis The risk of loss of the shares for the first three years means there is a material risk that the beneficial ownership of the share will change under the terms of the scheme. None of the exceptions apply. 10 Example 10: Vesting period with good leaver exception Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee leaves the company for any reason during the next three years, the shares are forfeited for no consideration. However, if the employee ceases employment because of death, illness, disability, redundancy or retirement within the three-year period they are entitled to the shares. After three years, the shares are transferred to the employee. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the end of the three-year period if the person is still employed, or when the person leaves for any of the above reasons. Analysis There is a material risk that the employee will leave employment for some other reason than those listed (for example, a better opportunity presents itself). The share scheme taxing date does not occur so long as that risk exists, because it means that there is a material risk that the beneficial ownership of the shares may change under the terms of the scheme. Example 11: Vesting subject to misconduct Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. The shares are transferred to the employee if they are still employed by the company after three years. Also, if the employee ceases employment for any reason other than being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment-related misconduct during the three-year period (that is, being a “bad leaver”) the employee is entitled to the shares at that time. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the shares are initially transferred to the trust, and the income will be their value at that time. Analysis The risk of the employee losing their job for these “bad” reasons during the three year period, and thus losing entitlement to the shares, is not sufficiently material to require deferral. 11 Example 12: Vesting subject to misconduct with accrual Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee is still employed by the company after three years, the shares will be transferred to the employee. If the employee ceases employment for any reason other than being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment-related misconduct during the three-year period (that is, being a “bad leaver”) the employee is entitled to a pro rata portion of the shares based on completed years’ service (for example, nothing for the first year, one third of the shares if the employee leaves between one and two years, etc.). Result There will be three share scheme taxing dates – at the end of years one, two and three respectively. The employee will be taxed at the end of each year on the value at that time of one third of the shares. Analysis Until the end of the first year, if the employee leaves for another job, they will not be entitled to any shares. Once the first year is completed, they will be entitled to one third of the shares, provided they are not a bad leaver during the next two years. The risk that the employee will leave for another job is sufficiently material that it defers the share scheme taxing date for two thirds of the shares. The risk that the employee will leave as a bad leaver is not material so it does not defer the share scheme taxing date for the other third. The fact that the shares are held by the trustee until the end of year three does not of itself defer the share scheme taxing date. Example 13: Complex vesting Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee ceases employment during the next three years due to being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment related misconduct, the employee forfeits all shares. If the employee ceases employment during the next three years due to death, illness, disability, redundancy or retirement, all shares are transferred to the employee. If the employee ceases employment during the next three years for any other reason, a pro rata portion of the shares is transferred to the employee, equal to the number of complete months since the transfer divided by 36 (months). After three years if the employee is still employed, all the shares are transferred to the employee. Result The employee has income at the end of each month equal to the value at that time of the additional number of shares to which the employee is entitled if the employee leaves “for any other reason”. Analysis The risk of the employee leaving voluntarily for another job is sufficiently high to be material. The risk of the employee leaving as a bad leaver is not. Accordingly the share scheme taxing date arises as the employee becomes entitled to retain the shares if she leaves the company other than as a bad leaver. 12 Example 14: Performance hurdles Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. The employee is not entitled to the shares unless a total shareholder return 2 hurdle (measured as an annual percentage) is also met. If the hurdle is met in year one, one third of the shares vest. If it is met in year two, a further one third of the shares vest. Also, if it was not met in year one, but is met on a combined basis over years one and two, a further one-third of the shares will vest. The same approach applies in year three. No shares vest once the employee leaves the company. Vested shares are not transferred to the employee, but held by the trustee until the three years is up. If the employee leaves during that period for any reason other than being a bad leaver, the vested shares will be transferred to the employee. Result There will be three possible share scheme taxing dates – at the end of years one, two and three respectively. The employee will be taxed at the end of each year on the value of the shares that vest at that time. Analysis Until the end of the first year, if the employee leaves for another job, they will not be entitled to any shares. Once the first year is completed, they will be entitled to retain one third of the shares, provided they are not a bad leaver during the next two years, and provided the year one performance hurdle is met. The risk that the employee will be a bad leaver is not material so it does not defer the share scheme taxing date. The fact that the shares are held by the trustee until the end of year three does not of itself defer the share scheme taxing date. Example 15: Vesting period, with compulsory sale for market value thereafter Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee leaves the company for any reason during the next three years, the shares are forfeited for no consideration. After three years, the trustee retains legal ownership of the shares, and the employee must transfer their rights back to the trustee or A Co when the employee leaves. However, once the three-year period is up, the employee will receive the market value of the shares when their beneficial ownership is transferred. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the three years is up and the employee is still employed. Analysis Once the three-year period has expired, the employer’s or trustee’s right to acquire the beneficial interest in the shares is for market value, and is therefore not taken into account in determining the share scheme taxing date (section CE 7B(2)(a)). 2 A nnual “ total sharehol der return” i s a combi nati on of di vi dends pai d and appreci ati on i n share pri ce during a year. 13 Example 16: Insubstantial put option Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. The shares will be transferred to the employee if she is still employed in three years’ time. Also, if the employee ceases employment during that time for any reason other than being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment-related misconduct during the three-year period (that is, being a “bad leaver”) the employee is entitled to the shares. Until the shares are transferred, the employee has the right to sell its beneficial interest in the shares back to the trustee for a total price of $1. Result The share scheme taxing date would be when the shares are provided to the trustee. Analysis The employee’s right to sell the shares for $1 is not, at the time it is granted, a right which has a material risk of being exercised, given that there is no liability attached to the shares and that they are then worth $10,000. This right would therefore not defer the share scheme taxing date. Example 17: Loan funded scheme A Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; and • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the earlier of when the employee leaves employment, or the expiry of the three years. Analysis Until the three years are up, if the employee leaves B Co for whatever reason, they lose their beneficial ownership of the shares for an amount that is not their market value. So the share scheme taxing date will, on the face of it, be the end of that three-year period. If the employee leaves within that period and is therefore required to transfer their rights, the sale price will be taxed. But since the sale price is the same as the amount contributed, there will be no gain or loss. Once the three-year period is up, the employee will either have no employee share scheme income (if they sell the shares back to the trustee for $10,000) or will pay tax on the difference between the value of the shares at that time and their $10,000 price (if they choose to keep the shares). 14 Example 18: Loan funded scheme B Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold; • the loan is limited recourse for the first three years (that is, during that period, the amount repayable is limited to the value of the shares at the time of repayment); and • if the employee leaves within three years, or chooses at the end of the three years to sell the shares to the trustee, they must be sold back to the trustee for market value. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the earlier of when the employee leaves employment, or the expiry of the three years. Analysis The requirement to sell the shares for their market value, if the employee leaves in the first three years, does not defer the share scheme taxing date. However, the limited recourse loan provides a benefit to the employee which compensates the employee for a fall in the value of the shares. Accordingly, the share scheme taxing date is the same as for example 17 – that is, the end of three years (when the loan ceases to be limited recourse) or when the shares are sold to the trustee. If the employee sells the shares for less than $10,000 (because that is their market value), the employee will have a deductible loss from the scheme under the employee share scheme rules, equal to the difference between the sale price and the $10,000 cost of the shares. They will have debt forgiveness income of an equal amount. If they retain the shares at the end of the three year period, they will have income equal to the difference between the shares’ value at that time and $10,000. 15 Example 19: Loan funded scheme C Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold; • if the employee leaves within three years, or chooses at the end of the three years to sell the shares to the trustee, they must be sold back to the trustee for market value; and • at the time of such a sale, the employer must pay the employee the amount of any decline in the value of the shares since the grant date. Result The share scheme taxing date will be the earlier of when the employee leaves employment, or the expiry of the three years. Analysis The employer’s promise to pay a bonus equal to the decline in the value of the shares is a benefit which compensates the employee for a decline in the value of the shares. The share scheme taxing date does not arise until that promise ceases to apply. If the employee sells the shares for less than $10,000 they will have a deductible loss from the scheme, which will be equal to the income they will recognise due to the payment from the employer. 16 Example 20: Loan funded scheme D Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, or chooses at the end of the three years to sell the shares to the trustee, they must be sold back to the trustee for market value; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; and • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold. Unlike in example 19, there is no arrangement for the employer to pay the employee the amount of any decline in value of the shares. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the agreement is entered into. Analysis From the time the agreement is entered into, the employee has the full risk and reward of share ownership. Although the funding for the purchase is provided by the employer, the funding is full recourse and the employee holds the shares in the same way as any other shareholder. Example 21: Vesting only in the event of a sale or IPO Facts C Co transfers 1,000 shares to a trustee for an employee. The shares remain held on trust until the employee leaves, more than fifty percent of C Co is sold, or C Co is listed (whichever happens first). If the employee leaves first, the shares are forfeited. If more than fifty percent of C Co is sold, the employee’s shares must also be sold and the employee will receive the proceeds. If C Co is listed, the shares are released to the employee. Result The share scheme taxing date is when the employee leaves, or C Co is sold or listed. Analysis Because the employee forfeits the shares for no consideration if they leave, the share scheme taxing date will be deferred until the employee leaves (in which case there will be no income), the shares are sold (in which case the sale price will be taxable), or the shares are released to the employee (the market value of the shares will be taxable). 17 Example 22: Blackout periods Facts Acme Limited (a listed company) agrees to issue 1,000 shares to Jason under an employee share scheme, if Jason remains employed for three years. Jason does so, and Acme Limited transfers 1,000 shares worth $10,000 to him on 31 December 2018. Under securities law, Jason is unable to sell the shares at that time, due to restrictions on insider trading. On 20 February 2019, the restrictions on selling the shares no longer apply and Jason sells half of his shares. The sale price is $4,200, or $8.40 per share. He sells the remaining shares six months later for $7,500. Result Jason’s share scheme taxing date is the date when the shares vested (31 December 2018), not the end of the blackout period (20 February 2019). Jason therefore has employment income of $10,000. The $800 loss on the first sale of fifty percent of his shares will generally be a capital loss. The profit of $2,500 on the sale of the remaining parcel will generally be a capital gain. Analysis The issue in this example is whether the insider trading restriction defers the share scheme taxing date. A prohibition on the sale of shares does not create a risk that beneficial ownership may change, and is a right or requirement in relation to the retention of shares, not the transfer of shares. The general principle illustrated by this example is that inability to sell employee share scheme shares does not mean that the employee has received no value or that they should not be taxed (the same principle applies to employees of unlisted companies who are prohibited from selling their shares by the company’s constitution or shareholder ag reement). Regardless of the transfer restriction, the employee will be entitled to dividends and any increase or decrease in the shares’ value over time. The same outcome would be produced if the trading restrictions were part of the terms of the scheme as opposed to being a statutory restriction. Example 23: Reclassifying shares Facts On 30 November 2018, Startup Co issued 10,000 special employee shares, which it calls E Class shares, to its CEO. The E class shares have no rights to a dividend, no voting rights, and a right to 0.1 cents per share on liquidation of the company. However, the terms of the E Class shares also provide that if Startup Co achieves certain performance hurdles by the third balance date post-issue, the terms of all or some of the E Class shares will change so that they have the same rights as ordinary shares in Startup Co. Shares whose rights to do not change, will be cancelled. At the time the E Class shares were issued, they were valued at $1,000. The performance of the company by 31 March 2021 means seventy five percent of them are reclassified into ordinary shares, valued at $12.50 per share, giving a total value of $93,750. Result The share scheme taxing date for the E Class shares will be the date when their rights change or they are cancelled. Analysis So long as there is a material possibility that the E class shares will become ordinary shares, there is a material risk that there will be a change in their terms affecting their value (section CE 7B(1)(a)(iii)). Accordingly the share scheme taxing date cannot occur until the possibility of that change no longer exists. 18 Amount of income The amount of income to the employee is the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date (or the transfer price if transferred to a non-associate, or the amount paid for cancellation, if cancelled by the employer), less the amount paid for them. Even where benefits are conferred on or transferred to an associate of an employee, it is always the employee who is taxed on the inco me. If the amount paid exceeds the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date, the difference is deductible to the employee (sections CE 2(3) and DV 27(3)). Apportionment for overseas service The new rules contain an expanded income apportionment formula (section CE 2(5) and (6)). The expanded formula applies to all employees (rather than only transitional residents as in the old section CE 2(9)). It excludes from taxable income employee share scheme benefits which accrue while a person is neither New Zealand resident nor deriving New Zealand source income. The extent of such accrual is determined by first establishing the entire period over which the benefit accrues, and then determining the proportion of that period during which the person is non-resident and not deriving New Zealand source income from their employment. The period of accrual ends once the rights vest, rather than when the income arises. So, for example, in the case of an option, the period of accrual ends once the options are exercisable rather than when they are actually exercised. The employee share scheme income is treated as non-residents’ foreign source income (which is not taxable income) to the extent of this proportion. 19 Example 24: Apportionment for overseas service – options Facts Nick is employed by Eagle Limited. On 1 June 2017 he was granted an option to buy 1,000 shares for $500. The option vests one year after it was granted (1 June 2018). He can exercise the option at any time between 1 June 2018 and 1 June 2020. Nick is sent on secondment to Eagle Limited’s Australian parent company, Philly Limited, on 30 June 2017 for two years. He does not return to New Zealand throughout his secondment and loses his New Zealand tax residence from the day he left New Zealand, as he has been away for more than 325 of 365 days, and does not have a permanent home in New Zealand. Nick returns to New Zealand at the end of his secondment (30 June 2020). On 1 December 2018, Eagle Limited shares are worth $2 per share. Nick decides to exercise his option for $500. He therefore earns income of $1,500 on 1 December 2018. Result Nick’s income of $1,500 is apportioned by reference to the date when the options vested (1 June 2018), not the share scheme taxing date (1 December 2018): $1,500 × 336 days (offshore period) ÷ 365 days (earning period) = $1,380.82 The earning period is from 1 June 2017 to 31 May 2018. The offshore period in this case would be from 30 June 2018 to 31 May 2018 – the number of days in the earning period when Nick was not resident in New Zealand. Therefore $1,380.82 is treated as non-residents’ foreign-sourced income and is not taxed in New Zealand. Nick will be taxable on the remaining $119.18 of his employee share scheme benefits. Analysis The earning period ends when the option vests, not when it is in fact exercised. However, that does not affect the principle that the amount of income that must be apportioned is determined by the value of the shares when the option is exercised. Transfers to associates There is no change to the treatment of transfers to associates. Such transfers do not trigger the share scheme taxing date (section CE 7B(1)(b)). Rollover relief for transfer to new scheme If a person’s employee share scheme rights are cancelled and replaced with rights in a different scheme, the value of the replacement rights is not included in the person’s income arising due to the cancellation of the original scheme (sections CE 2(2)(c) and CE 7D). In the usual case where an employee’s rights in an existing scheme are simply replaced by rights in a new scheme, no income will arise under section CE 2. The benefit provided by the replacement scheme is taxed appropriately by applying the new rules to that scheme. 20 TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYERS’ DEDUCTION Sections CV 20, DV 27 and DV 28 A deduction is available to employers providing employee share benefits, which matches the income to employees in timing and quantity. Deductions previously available for other payments are disallowed where those payments would otherwise lead to a double deduction. Background The principle of neutral tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits supports employers being entitled to a deduction for the value of the benefit provided. The fact that the issue of shares by a company does not involve an explicit cash cost does not affect this principle. There is a transfer of value to the employee from the other shareholders, which arises whether that value is transferred as cash or as shares in the company. Under the corporate tax system, where company expenses are deducted by the company as a separate taxpayer from its shareholders, this cost must be recognised in the calculation of income by the company, rather than the shareholders on whose behalf the income is earned and the cost incurred. Ways to create a deduction existed under the old rules. For example, the employer could claim a deduction for: • payment of a bonus to the employee which was used to fund a full value share acquisit ion; • contributions to an employee share trust, which would then acquire shares for the emplo yee; or • reimbursement to a parent company to compensate it for providing employee shares. However, the tax treatment of these transactions was uncertain, and structuring to achieve the deduction sometimes incurred unnecessary transaction costs. There was also the potential for the amount and timing of the deduction created by such transactions to not correctly reflect the economic cost to the company of providing the employee share scheme benefits. Key features The new rules allow a deduction to an employer equal in amount and timing to the income derived by an employee under the new rules, and deny a deduction for any other amount incurred to provide that benefit. They do not affect the deductibility of costs incurred in establishing or operating a scheme. They also allow an employee who pays more for shares than they are worth at the share scheme taxing date a deduction for that amount. 21 Application date The new share scheme taxing date and rules for calculating employee share scheme income will apply to benefits provided under employee share schemes which are not taxed under the existing rules on or before 29 September 2018. Detailed analysis An employer is denied a deduction for expenditure or loss incurred in providing employee share scheme benefits (section DV 27(2)), except for: • costs incurred in making a loan under the scheme or in establishing or managing the scheme (section DV 27(3)). Costs of establishing or managing include legal and accounting fees incurred in setting up the scheme, as well as on-going management fees. Deductibility of these costs is left to the usual capital/revenue tests. Costs incurred by an employee share scheme trust are treated as incurred by the employer or issuing company, as a result of the new provision treating the trustee of an employee share scheme trust as a nominee of the employer or issuing company (section CE 6); • an amount equal to the employee’s income, which is treated as a cost incurred at the same time as the employee recognises the income (section DV 27(6)-(8)). Deductibility of this cost depends on meeting the general permission and not being subject to any of the limitat ions. However, deductibility is not limited by the apportionment formula in new section CE 2(5) and (6); and • amounts which are taxable to the employee as employment income other than as employee share scheme benefits (section DV 27(5)). This is intended to preserve a deduction for the cost of paying a bonus where the payment of the bonus is part of the terms of an employee share scheme. Accordingly: • payments to fund an employee share scheme trust to acquire shares, or to reimburse a parent for providing shares, are not deductible; and • in order to correctly calculate their deduction, as a practical matter, employers need to either prohibit employees from transferring their rights to a non-associate before the share scheme taxing date, or place a requirement on employees to inform them of the time and amount paid in such a transfer. In order to prevent double deductions, when shares are provided to an employee and a deduction has been taken for that provision other than in accordance with to the new section, the deduction under the new section is reduced by the earlier deduction (section DV 27(8)(b)). However, it is only the amount of any deductions in respect of costs attributable to the particular share scheme benefits which have given rise to taxable income to the employee in question which are taken into account. Transitional arrangements As a transitional measure, the deduction rules provide for a mechanism to make adjustments to deductions incurred before 29 September 2018 (six months after the date of enactment) (section DV 27(8)(b)(ii)). 22 Example 25 Facts On 1 July 2016, a New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian multinational provided an employee with an option to acquire 5,000 shares in the Australian parent for $3 per share, exercisable on or after 1 July 2018, provided the employee was still employed by the group at that date. The employee remained employed, and exercises the option on 3 December 2018, when the shares are worth $3.50 each. Scenario 1 Suppose that the employer had to make a recharge payment to the parent when the options were issued, of $500, being their value at that time. The employer took a deduction for this payment. Result of scenario 1 The employer has income of $250. This is the result of the formula in section DV 27(7), being $250 − $500. The $250 is the employee’s income under section CE 2(1). The $500 is the previous deduction allowed to the employer. Subsection (9) states that a negative amount is income. Scenario 2 Suppose that the recharge payment is still $500, but it is made when the option is exercised. Result of scenario 2 The employer has a deduction of $250. The recharge is not deductible due to section DV 27(2). Subsection (7) gives a deduction for the $250 which is taxable to the employee. 23 EFFECT OF DEDUCTION AND PAYMENTS ON AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL Sections CD 25 and CD 43 The new rules tax any benefit conferred on an employee by the issuance of shares in an employee share scheme in the same way as an equivalent cash payment followed by an acquisition of shares in the issuing company. Consistent with this principle, the rules provide for an increase in the employer’s available subscribed capital (ASC) by the amount deemed to be paid (plus actually paid) for the shares. The rules also cater for the situation where the employer is not the company issuing the shares. This is a taxpayer-friendly measure to ensure employee share schemes are not disadvantaged as a form of remuneration compared with an equivalent cash transaction, which would generally give rise to an ASC increase. Background To ensure neutrality between provision of benefits under an employee share scheme and an equivalent cash transaction, as well as providing for the income and deduction consequences, the new rules provide for changes to a company’s ASC. To do this, the rules provide for an increase in the employer’s ASC by the amount deemed to be paid (plus actually paid) for the shares. The proposed rules also cater for the situation where the employer is not the company issuing the shares (this is common where the employer company is a subsidiary and the employee receives shares in the parent company). In order to cater for the common practice of acquiring employee share scheme shares fro m other shareholders rather than by a fresh issue of shares, it is also necessary to ensure that the treasury stock regime can apply sensibly to employee share schemes. Key features The ASC provisions deal with the effect of employee share scheme transactions on the employer and (if different) the company whose shares are provided to the employee (the share provider). The amount of the deduction to the employer will give rise to additional ASC for the employer and, if the shares issued are in the parent of the employer, the parent. In the latter case, any reimbursement paid to the parent reduces the subsidiary’s ASC but does not increase the parent’s ASC. If the employer has income from the issue of the shares, its ASC is reduced. The rules also ensure that the acquisition of shares from an employee as part of an employee share scheme can be treated for tax purposes as an acquisition of treasury stock provided the shares are re-allocated within a certain period of time. This rule applies regardless of whether the shares are acquired by the company itself and not cancelled, or they are acquired by a trustee who is treated for tax purposes as a nominee of the company. 24 A company can choose not to apply these new ASC rules if it issues employee share scheme shares for market value. Application date The ASC rules apply to the provision of shares which are taxed under the new rules. Detailed analysis Under section CD 43, if the employer is also the company whose shares are provided, then the employer’s ASC is: • increased by: – the amount received for the provision of the shares (under existing section CD 43(2)(b)); and – the amount of its deduction for the provision of the shares (under new section CD 43(6E)(a)); • decreased by the amount of any income arising if it has income because the value of the shares provided is less than the amount received from the employee (under new section CD 43(29)). ASC Example 1 Facts Employer Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee for $2 per share (that is, at a $1 per share discount). The scheme taxing date is the date of issue. The employee has $700 income and Employer Co has a $700 deduction. ASC Result Employer Co’s ASC increases by $2,100, being the total of the $1,400 received for the provision of the shares and its $700 expenditure incurred for providing the shares. 25 ASC Example 2 Facts Employer Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee for $2 per share, funded by a loan from the employer. If the employee is still employed by the company after one year, the employee will receive a bonus of $1,400 grossed-up for PAYE, the net amount of which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $4 each. ASC result Issuing the shares gives rise to ASC of $1,400. If the shares are repurchased because the employee does not remain employed, that will usually give rise to an ASC reduction of $1,400 (unless the shares are held by a trustee or as treasury stock). Otherwise, at the share scheme taxing date, Employer Co’s ASC will increase by a further $1,400. This is made up of the $1,400 that it received from the employee for the shares and $1,400 it incurred in providing the shares (the difference between the value of the shares on the vesting date and their cost to the employee). ASC Example 3 Facts Employer Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee for $2 per share, funded by a loan from the employer. If the employee is still employed by the company after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus (grossed-up for PAYE), which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $1 each. ASC result As for ASC Example 2, at the share scheme taxing date Employer Co’s ASC will first increase by $2,800 (made up of the amount received from the employee for the shares plus the expenditure incurred by the company to provide the shares). However, the ASC amount will then decrease by $700 because the value of the shares provided is less than the amount received from the employee (section CD 43(29)). If the employer is not the company whose shares are provided, then the employer’s ASC is: • increased by the amount of its deduction for providing the shares (new section CD 43(6E)(a)); • decreased by the amount of any income arising if it has income because the value of the shares is less than the amount received from the employee (new section CD 43(29)); and • decreased by the amount of any reimbursement paid to the share provider (new sectio n CD 43(6F) and (6H)). The adjustment is made to the employer’s share class most similar to the shares provided under the scheme. If the decrease due to reimbursement exceeds the increase arising due to a deduction, and the excess is greater than the ASC of the relevant share class, the reimbursement amount is to that extent taxed as a dividend (section CD 43(6I)). 26 ASC Example 4 Facts Parent Co, the one hundred percent owner of Employer Co, issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share. The scheme taxing date is the date of issue. The employee has $700 income and Employer Co has a $700 deduction. ASC result for Employer Co Employer Co’s ASC increases by the amount of its $700 expenditure. ASC Example 5 Facts Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus (grossed-up for PAYE) from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $5 each. If the employee remains employed, Employer Co will have a deduction of $2,100, being the difference between the market value of the shares at that time (700 × $5), and their cost to the employee (700 × $2). ASC result for Employer Co If the employee stays employed for the year, at the share scheme taxing date, Employer Co’s ASC will increase by $2,100 - the amount which is both taxable to the employee and expenditure for Employer Co under the employee share scheme rules. ASC Example 6 Facts As for ASC Example 5, Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by the Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus (grossed-up for PAYE) from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $5 each. However, unlike ASC Example 5, if the shares are not forfeited, Employer Co pays Parent Co $1 per share reimbursement. ASC result for Employer Co Employer Co’s ASC will increase by $1,400 if the employee remains employed, which is the difference between its $2,100 deduction and its $700 reimbursement to Parent Co. 27 If the shares are provided by the ultimate parent of the employer, the ASC of the parent company is: • increased by: – the amount paid by the employee for the shares (under existing section CD 43(2)(b)); and – the amount of the employer’s deduction for the provision of the shares (new section CD 43(6E)(b)); • decreased by the amount of any income arising to the employer if it has income because the value of the shares provided is less than the amount received from the emplo yee (new section CD 43(29)); and • unaffected by any amount paid to it by the employer (new section CD 43(20B)). ASC Example 7: Parent Co Facts Parent Co, the one hundred percent owner of Employer Co, issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share. The scheme taxing date is the date of issue. The employee has $700 income and Employer Co has a $700 deduction. ASC result for Parent Co Parent Co’s ASC increases by the $1,400 received for the issue of its shares plus the $700 deductible to Employer Co (for a total ASC increase of $2,100). ASC Example 8: Parent Co Facts Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by the Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus (grossed-up for PAYE) from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $5 each. ASC result for Parent Co The initial issue of the shares gives rise to ASC of $1,400. If the shares are repurchased by Parent Co because the employee does not remain employed, that will usually give rise to an ASC reduction of $1,400. Otherwise, at the share scheme taxing date, Parent Co’s ASC will increase by a further $2,100, the amount which is both taxable to the employee and expenditure for Employer Co. 28 ASC Example 9: Parent Co Facts As for ASC Example 6, Parent Co issues 700 shares worth $3 each to an employee of Employer Co for $2 per share, funded by a loan from Parent Co. If the employee is still employed by the Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus from Employer Co, which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. If the shares are not forfeited, Employer Co pays Parent Co $1 per share reimbursement. The shares are worth $1 each after one year. ASC result Parent Co’s ASC will increase by $1,400 when the shares are issued. If the employee remains employed: • the reimbursement of $1 per share does not affect Parent Co’s ASC; and • Parent Co’s ASC decreases by $700 – the amount of the income arising to Employer Co as a result of the amount payable by the employee for the shares ($1,400) being in excess of the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date ($700). Treasury stock If an employee share scheme trustee acquires shares for the purposes of the scheme, those shares are treated as acquired by the share issuer (section CE 6). The amount paid to the selling shareholder for their acquisition is a dividend, unless one of the exceptions to dividend treatment applies. If the shares are held by the trustee, the treasury stock rules apply to them. Amendments have been made to the treasury stock rules so that they apply more clearly in such a case. New section CD 25(1)(a) makes it explicit that the treasury stock regime can apply to an acquisition by an employee share scheme trust, just as if the shares were acquired by the company and not cancelled. For shares allocated to an employee within one year of their acquisit io n by the company or a trustee, their acquisit io n and re-issue will be ignored by the share issuer (but not an employer who is not the share issuer) for ASC purposes. This will happen due to the operation of the usual treasury stock provisio ns (that is, section CD 25(19)) in relation to the amount received by the company on re-issue and the definition of “returns” in section CD 43(2)(c) in relation to the amount paid by the company to acquire the shares. Note that the shares would only have to be allocated to the employee under the scheme within 12 months of acquisition to qualify for treasury stock treatment – they do not have to be transferred to the employee. The only time any ASC adjustment is required is when shares are not allocated to an employee within one year of acquisition, issue or ceasing to be allocated to another employee, or when shares are issued for other than market value. Shares which are allocated to an employee within a year and then forfeited by the employee are treated as acquired by the company at that time for the amount the trustee paid for them when originally acquired (new section CD 25(7)). The shares will continue to be dealt with as treasury stock, but with a new acquisition date. 29 Shares which are not allocated within one year are treated as having been acquired on market and cancelled (amendments to section CD 25(2)(b)). ASC Example 10 Facts An employee share scheme trust for Employer Co acquires 700 Employer Co shares on market for $2.50 per share. Six months later, when they are worth $3 per share, it allocates them to an employee for $2 per share. The purchase price is funded by a loan from Employer Co. If the employee is still employed by Employer Co after one year, the employee will receive a $1,400 bonus from Employer Co (grossed-up for PAYE), which must be used to repay the loan. Otherwise, the employee must return the shares to the employer in full repayment of the loan at the time she leaves employment. After one year, the shares are worth $5 each. ASC result for Employer Co The trustee’s acquisition of the shares is treated as an on-market acquisition of treasury stock by Employer Co. Because the shares are allocated to an employee within 12 months of acquisition, the acquisition is not treated as reverting to an on-market cancellation under section CD 25(2). Therefore the amount paid to acquire the shares does not reduce Employer Co’s ASC and the $1,400 paid by the employee to acquire the shares does not increase Employer Co’s ASC. If the employee does not stay for 12 months, Employer Co will be treated as acquiring the shares at that time for $2.50 per share, the amount for which they were initially acquired on market. This acquisition will not reduce Parent Co’s ASC if the shares are allocated to another employee within 12 months. Shares issued for market value The ASC rules applying to employee share scheme shares can be disregarded by a company if it issues employee share scheme shares for market value, or a reasonable estimate of market value, at the time of issue. In this case, the company’s ASC is not affected by the amount of any income or deduction arising due to any difference between the issue price and the value of the shares at the share scheme taxing date. 30 ASC Example 11: Loan funded scheme Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest-free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire newly issued shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; and • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold. The employee remains employed for three years, and chooses to continue in the scheme, as the shares are worth $18,000 at that time. Result B Co’s ASC will increase by $10,000 when it issues the shares. Prima facie it will also increase by $8,000 at the end of year three, unless the company elects to the contrary. Analysis The $10,000 received by B Co is ASC under section CD 43(2), because it is within the definition of “subscriptions”. The $8,000 is also included in “subscriptions” under section CD 43(6E). However, B Co can elect out of section CD 43(6E), because it issued the shares for their market value (section CD 43(6EB). 31 EXEMPT EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES Sections CW 26B, CW 26C, CW 26D, CW 26E, CW 26F, CW 26G, DV 28, and section 63B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Income Tax Act 2007 provides a concessionary regime to employers who offer shares to employees under certain widely-offered “exempt employee share schemes”. The old rules governing such exempt schemes were out of date, complex and no longer fit for purpose. They also did not fit wit hin New Zealand’s broad base, low rate tax framework. The new rules: • modernise and simplify the criteria for these schemes, including removing employers’ ten percent notional interest deduction; • increase the monetary threshold for the schemes (which has not been increased since 1980); and • address the current ability for employers to claim unintended deductions for the cost of providing the exempt share benefit to employees. Background Since the 1970s, the Income Tax Act has contained a concessionary regime to encourage employers to offer shares to employees under certain widely-offered employee share schemes. The concession is on the basis that the schemes are designed to increase employee engagement at all levels of the company and align employee and shareholder incentives. They may also assist employees to develop and improve financial literacy skills. There were previously two main tax benefits available under the regime: 1. Exemption for employee: The value of a benefit received by an employee under a concessionary scheme is not taxable to the employee. 2. Deemed interest deduction for employer: The employer is given a deemed deduction of ten percent notional interest on loans made to employees to buy shares. This is additional to any deduction for actual interest incurred on money borrowed to finance the scheme. Another benefit under the regime is that interest-free loans made under an exempt scheme are automatically exempt from Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT). The FBT-exempt status of the loans is a limited benefit. In most cases such loans would be FBT-exempt in any event, as “employee share loans” (that is, any loan provided by an employer to an employee to purchase its shares under an employee share scheme). The only real benefit of the specific FBT exemption is that the interest-free loan can be FBT-exempt regardless of the company’s dividend paying policy. There were various issues with the old regime: • the regime was complex and inflexible; 32 • the tax benefits of the regime were uncertain and poorly targeted; • the regime did not explicitly limit the amount of tax-free benefit that can be conferred; • there were some minor drafting issues with the legislation; and • the maximum amount an employee could pay for shares ($2,340 over a three-year period) had not been adjusted since 1980, and this meant as a practical matter that the benefits available under the regime were very limited. Adjusted for wage inflation, the figure would now be around $13,000. Key features The new rules simplify and clarify the legislation relating to exempt schemes, while retaining many of the key features of the original schemes and their tax treatment. In many cases, the requirements are relaxed. Where the original policy was no longer appropriate or unintended consequences arose, the amendments address this. Under the new rules, shares provided to employees under schemes that meet certain criteria (described below in the detailed analysis) are exempt income to the employees. Benefits provided under schemes that qualified for the old tax-exempt treatment simply continue to qualify under the new legislation, but such schemes are now entitled to provide the same level of exempt benefits as new schemes. For all exempt schemes, from 6 April 2017, employers are explicitly denied a deduction for the cost of providing the shares (other than scheme management and administration costs) and the ten percent notional interest deduction is repealed. The automatic exemption from FBT for loans provided under exempt schemes in section CX 10(2) continues. Application dates The amendments generally apply from 29 March 2018. However, new section DV 28, which denies employers a deduction for expenditure or loss in relation to an exempt employee share scheme (other than establishment or operational costs) applies on and after 6 April 2017 if shares under the exempt scheme were acquired other than in the ordinary course of the scheme. Detailed analysis Income tax exemption for shares provided under exempt schemes Section CW 26B provides that amounts derived from exempt schemes are exempt income. While a tax exemption for employment income does not fit generally within New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate tax framework, given there is a limit on the amount of benefit that can be provided under the scheme ($2,000 per employee per annum) and the scheme has to be offered to almost all employees, it is appropriate to retain the tax exemption to minimise compliance costs. 33 Employer deduction for shares provided under exempt schemes There were several potential deductions associated with exempt schemes: 1. the ten percent notional interest deduction with respect to employee share loans; 2. costs associated with setting up and running the scheme; and 3. in some cases, the direct or indirect costs of acquiring shares for the scheme. The ten percent notional interest deduction in item 1 above has been repealed. The original policy rationale for this benefit is unclear and it is inconsistent with our BBLR tax framework. New section DV 28 denies a deduction for any costs associated with exempt schemes, other than administrative and management fees associated with setting up and running the scheme. This is on the basis that when the rules were originally enacted (in the 1970s) it was not envisaged that employers would be eligible for a deduction (as there is no deduction for issuing shares). It has subsequently become apparent that employers can adopt structures that allow them to claim deduct ions. These deductions are unintended and should never have been available. Therefore, employers are not able to extend these unintended deductions by accelerating the purchase of a large parcel of shares through a trust, which are then allocated to employees over a number of years in the future. However, provided that the shares have been acquired in the ordinary course of the scheme, a later application date (29 March 2018) is appropriate. This ensures that the unintended deductions identified in item 3 above are no longer available, but the deductions identified in item 2 are still available, subject to the usual limitations. This is consistent with the general deductibility provision for employee share scheme benefits in new section DV 27. Meaning of exempt scheme and criteria for qualifying for exemption The new rules have been designed to ensure existing schemes (that is, schemes in existence before the effective date of the new rules) that meet the criteria described below can continue to operate without unnecessary disruption. Therefore, to the extent possible the existing rules have been retained and simply clarified. Existing exempt schemes approved by the Commissioner under previous legislation (for example, section DC 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007), continue to be “exempt employee share schemes” and are eligible for the tax exemption, provided they continue to meet the criteria under which they were approved as modified by the increase in the benefit level in section CW 26C(2). The underlying policy of the criteria is to ensure: 1. the scheme is genuinely offered to the vast majority of employees on equal terms – for example, it cannot just be targeted towards executives; 2. related to 1, all employees have to be able to afford to participate in the scheme, not just the more highly paid employees. This is achieved by limiting the cost of the shares that can be offered, requiring employers to provide financing for any cost or because the employee does not have to pay anything for the shares; 3. there is a limit on the benefit that can be provided; and 34 4. the scheme is genuinely a share scheme and not just a mechanism to provide tax-free cash to employees (this is why there is a restriction period). Criteria To achieve this policy, all the following proposed criteria must be met in order for a scheme to be exempt. • The cost to employees of shares made available for purchase must not exceed their market value at the date of purchase but may be less (section CW 26C(2)(a)). • The maximum value of shares provided under an exempt scheme is $5,000 per annum (section CW 26C(2)(b)). • The maximum discount an employer can provide to an employee is $2,000 per annum (section CW 26C(2)(c)). This means that the most an employee can spend buying shares per annum is $3,000 ($3,000 plus the $2,000 discount means a maximum value of $5,000 worth of shares). This equates to a maximum cost of $9,000 over three years. • Ninety percent or more of full-time permanent employees who are not subject to securit ies law o f other jurisdict ions must be eligible to participate in the scheme. If the scheme applies to part-time employees or to seasonal employees, the same threshold applies (section CW 26C(3)(a)-(c)). Previously, all full time emplo yees were required to be eligible to participate. • If the scheme has a minimum spend requirement, the amount can be no more than $1,000 per annum (section CW 26C(3)(d)). This is the updated equivalent of the old section DC 13(4) and increases the $624 per three year figure. • Any minimum period of service which may be required before an employee becomes eligible to participate must not exceed three years (or the equivalent of three years full- time service) (section CW 26C(3)(e)). • If the employee is required to pay any amount for the shares, then the employer must provide a loan for that amount or allow the employee to pay for the shares in instalments (section CW 26C(4)(a)). • Loans to employees for the purchase of shares must be free of all interest and other charges (section CW 26C(4)(b)). • Emplo yees will repay loans by regular equal instalments at intervals of not more than one month over a period between three and five years from the date of the loan (section CW 26C(4)(d)). This requirement can be satisfied by arrangements where shares are acquired regularly by the employee (for example, each payday) with the entire purchase price paid off each time, and also to arrangements where shares are acquired once and the purchase price is paid off in instalments. • Generally speaking, the shares must be held (either by the employee or by a trustee of a trust on behalf of the employee) for the longer of three years and when the loan is repaid – this is to ensure that the scheme is really a share purchase scheme, and not a mechanism for providing cash remuneration. However, the employee is not required to hold the shares beyond the date their employment ends. Also, if the employee has paid full market value for the shares, then they only have to hold them until they have fully repaid the loan (section CW 26C(7). 35 • The employee can choose to withdraw from the scheme by giving the employer one months’ notice and have their shares purchased back for the lesser of market value and cost (section CW 26C(6)). • If participation in the scheme is causing serious hardship for the employee, the terms of payment can be varied or employees can be allowed to withdraw from the scheme and receive the market value of their shares (section CW 26C(5)). • If the employee leaves employment before the three years is up, then: – if they leave because of death, accident, sickness, redundancy or retirement at normal retiring age they can keep the shares (subject to repayment of the loan) or have the shares bought back for the lesser of market value and cost; and – if they leave for any other reason, the shares are bought back at the lesser of cost and market value (section CW 26C(6) and (9)). • The exempt scheme does not require approval by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, however, the Commissioner must be notified of the scheme’s existence and the employer must advise the Commissioner of shares granted and contributions received under the scheme on an annual basis, in an annual return (section 63B of the Tax Administration Act 1994). • There is no requirement for a scheme to have a trustee – many schemes have trustees as a matter of convenience. Removing this requirement provides greater flexibility (especially for small employers who may not want the administrative expense o f operating a trust for a small scheme). 36 TECHNICAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL MATTERS Sections CE 2, CE 6, CZ 1, EX 38, GB 49B, HC 27, and section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 A number of transitional and consequential provisions are needed to support the core amendments. These provisio ns: • specify a cost base for shares acquired under an employee share scheme (new section CE 2(4)); • provide for the treatment of employee share scheme shares subject to the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules (amended section EX 38); • specify the treatment of employee share scheme trusts (new section CE 6 and repeal of previous section HC 27(3B)); • introduce a specific anti-avoidance rule to counteract tax avo idance transactions wit h respect to employee share schemes (new section GB 49B); • make an amendment so that shortfall penalties apply to employers who do not take reasonable care in reporting employee share scheme benefits (amendments to the definit ion o f “tax shortfall” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994); • provide transitional rules for existing schemes to ensure taxpayers have sufficient time to amend schemes (if necessary) to take account of the new law following enactment of the Bill (new section CZ 1); and • replace the former terminology – share purchase agreement – with the new term – employee share scheme – throughout the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994. Application date There are various application dates for each of the amendments, as specified below. Key features Cost base Income from an employee share scheme benefit is added to the cost of the shares for tax purposes (new section CE 2(4)). Similarly, a deduction reduces the cost base. This provision applies from 29 September 2018. FIF regime The new rules effectively exclude from the FIF regime employee share scheme shares which are treated as owned by the employee for tax purposes but for which the share scheme taxing date has not arisen. Before that time, it is appropriate to tax the dividends on the shares, but 37 not appropriate to tax any change in value, since that will be taxed when the shares give rise to income under section CE 2. See amendments to section EX 38. This provision applies from 29 September 2018. Trusts As referred to above, an employee share scheme trustee is treated as the nominee of the employer and (if different) the share issuing company to the extent of is activities on their behalf (new section CE 6). This means that the activities of the trustee on behalf of those companies are treated as undertaken directly by the companies themselves. They will therefore have no effect on the trustee’s taxable income. Like any other nominee, the trustee will still have to file a tax return if it is remunerated for its services. Section HC 27(3B), which dealt with the situation where an employer has claimed a deduction for a settlement on an employee share scheme trustee, has been repealed, as such settlements will no longer be deductible. These provisions apply from 29 September 2018. Specific anti-avoidance provision A new specific anti-avoidance provision allows the Commissioner to counteract any tax advantage gained from an arrangement which attempts to circumvent the intent and application of the share scheme taxing date or employee share scheme definitions. This provision applies from 29 September 2018. Penalties The definition of a “tax shortfall” has been amended so that an employer who is required to report the amount of an employee’s share scheme income in a tax return, and who fails to take reasonable care in determining the amount of that income, is liable for the same shortfall penalty whether or not the employer has elected to pay PAYE on the benefit. There is no basis for differentiating in this respect between employers who do and those who do not withho ld PAYE. This provision applies from 29 March 2018. Transitional rules Employee share schemes are often long-term arrangements, lasting three or more years. Additionally, new share schemes are set up fairly regularly by companies and it is important for companies and employee participants to have clarity around the tax laws when they enter into these arrangements. Accordingly, it is important to provide sufficient transitional measures for existing and contemplated employee share schemes. It is not desirable to put employers and employees in a position where employees are being granted employee share scheme benefits without certainty as to their tax treatment. However, it would also not be appropriate for employers and employees to be able to unduly extend the application of the existing rules by artificially 38 qualifying for grandparenting grants of employee share scheme benefits which are not, in substance, intended to be conferred until a much later time. To balance these competing objectives, there are three types of transitional relief, pursuant to which the new rules will not apply to employee share benefits provided after enactment. The first is the general implementation rule in section 2(34), which provides that the new taxing provisions only take effect from 29 September 2018. This means the new rules will not apply to benefits where the share scheme taxing date is before 29 September 2018. The second and third cases of transitional relief apply where the share scheme taxing date is on or after 29 September 2018. The second case applies to shares granted or acquired (including by a trustee) before 12 March 2016, when the officials’ issues paper Taxation of employee share schemes was published. Such shares are never subject to tax under the new rules (see section CZ 1(b)). The third case applies to shares granted or acquired (including by a trustee) between 12 May 2016 and 29 September 2018. Such shares are not taxed under the new rules provided that: • they were not granted or acquired for a purpose of avoiding the application of the new rules; and • the share scheme taxing date under the new rules is before 1 April 2022. In this case, if the shares are taxable under both the old and new rules, the amount taxed under the old rules reduces the amount taxable under the new rules – see section CE 2(1). 39
May 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Provision of IRD numbers to Portfolio Investment Entities Section 28B of the Tax Administration Act 199; sections HM 4 and HM 62 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 introduced changes to the administration of employment and investment income information. This special report provides early information on the provision of IRD numbers to Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs), and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the June 2018 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Amendments have been made to encourage taxpayers to provide their IRD numbers to their PIE. Background Inland Revenue has difficulty attributing income to a taxpayer if it does not have the taxpayer’s IRD number. The non-declaration rate, the rate which applies to taxpayers who have not provided their IRD number to their PIE, is too low (28% for PIE income) to encourage taxpayers on the top marginal tax rate to provide their IRD number to their PIE as it is the same rate as they would have even if they did provide their IRD number. Further, taxpayers with social policy entitlements or obligations who can have much higher effective tax rates (taking into account abatement of entitlements or additional obligations), benefited from not providing their IRD number as it made it unlikely Inland Revenue could verify that their investment income was taken into account when social policy entitlements/obligations were calculated. This meant they may have received more social assistance or paid less in child support and student loan repayments than they should have. Key features Investors opening new investments in multi-rate PIEs will be required to provide their IRD number to the PIE within six weeks of opening their account in order to remain a member of the PIE. This change should encourage people to provide their IRD numbers so that PIE income is allocated to the relevant taxpayer, ensuring the taxpayer is paying the right amount of tax, and 1 receives the correct amount in social policy entitlements, and pays the correct amount in social policy obligations. Application date The requirement for new investors in a PIE to provide their IRD numbers in order to stay invested in the PIE came into force on 1 April 2018. Detailed analysis PIE funds – IRD number requirement Six weeks to provide IRD number Section 28B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires an investor in a multi-rate PIE to notify the PIE of their tax file number within six weeks of becoming an investor. This doesn’t apply to a non-resident who does not have an IRD number but provides the equivalent tax identification number for their country of residence, or a declaration if they are unable to. Non-residents who subsequently become residents are required to provide their IRD number to their PIE within six weeks of notifying the PIE that they have become a resident. Consequence and treatment of not providing IRD number Section HM 62 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a PIE must close an investor’s account, pay the necessary tax and refund the remainder of the balance to the investor where the investor has not provided their IRD number by the date provided in section 28B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (that is, within six weeks of becoming an investor). Section HM 4 provides that an investor who has not provided their IRD number to the multi- rate PIE within six weeks of becoming a member is treated as reaching the exit level. This requires the PIE to calculate its tax liability in relation to the exiting investor, under sections HM 42 and HM 47 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Joint investors IRD numbers While PIEs are required to get an IRD number for each new investment and may only be collecting one IRD number for joint investments in some cases, they will be required to report the details (including the IRD number) of all of the joint investors from 1 April 2020. As the legislation requiring the reporting of joint investors details has been enacted it is expected that PIEs will hold those details for all joint investors that have made investments from 1 April 2018. PIEs should therefore ensure that they begin collecting these additional details in advance of 1 April 2020. 2
May 2018 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue PAYE reporting changes and changes to the payroll subsidy scheme The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 introduced changes to the administration of PAYE information and to the payroll subsidy scheme. This special report provides early information on the new rules, in particular on payday provision of PAYE information, and precedes full coverage of the new legislation in the June 2018 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. These items are covered in this special report: • payday provision of employment income information; • transit ional provisions; • consolidation of PAYE administrative requirements; and • the payroll subsidy. 1 PAYDAY PROVISION OF EMPLOYMENT INCOME INFORMATION Sections 3(1), 14G, Subpart 3C, sections 24J, 36A, 36B, 36CA, 36D, 36E, 46, 47, 48, 80D, 80KT, 125, 139A, 139AA(1), 139AA(3), 139AA(4), 139AA(7), 141AA, 141ED, 142G, 183A, 278B, 279, and schedules 4 to 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections 4, 17, 22, 23, 34, 42, 60, 73, 93, 97, 98, 98A and 99 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; sections CE 1(3B), CE 2(7) to (9), LD 4, LD 5, RD 6, RD 7B(3), RD 10(2C), RD 13(B), RD 22, RD 23, YA 1 and schedule 2, of the Income Tax Act 2007 – other changes to the Income Tax Act are included in the section on “Consolidation of the PAYE administrative requirements” Background PAYE is a withholding mechanism used by employers and PAYE intermediaries to deduct income tax and ACC earners’ levy from employees’ salary and wages, and as appropriate from schedular payments, and pay it directly to Inland Revenue. The PAYE system is also used to collect payments and information for many income-related social policies including student loan repayments, KiwiSaver contributions and some child support payments. The amendments introduce changes to the reporting of PAYE information. The current requirement for an employer monthly schedule (EMS) is replaced from 1 April 2019, with a requirement that an employer sends ‘employment income information’ to Inland Revenue within a few days of each payday. Employers can voluntarily adopt payday reporting from April 2018. The amendments take advantage of the capabilities of modern payroll software and are intended to reduce the compliance and administrative costs associated with the PAYE system. The changes will improve the timeliness of employment income informat ion. They will create opportunities to improve the accuracy of withholding from individual taxpayers and to improve the administration of social policy. No changes have been made to employers’ obligations to pay PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue. Payments will remain due on the 20 th and 5 th of the following month for large employers and the 20 th of the following month for all other employers. Some employers have indicated that they would like to pay their PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue at the same time as they pay their staff. Inland Revenue is managing the transfer of PAYE from its old computer system to the new one in several releases. Once this process is complete, which is not expected to be before 2020, it is intended that it will be easy for employers to choose to pay IRD at the same time as they pay their staff. Key features New subpart 3C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains the rules for employment inco me informat ion. Section 23C and schedule 4 set out what ‘employment income informat ion’ means. These sections provide that an employer 1 must provide the information in schedule 4 to the Commissioner on a payday basis. The due dates and filing requirements are set out in new 1 Except where an exception is noted references to an employer should be read as applying to a payroll intermediary. 2 sections 23D to 23K and differ depending on which employer group the employer belongs to. There are three employer groups, the non-electronic group, the new group of employers and the on-line group. Online group The online group is the default group. Employers are included in the online group unless they have an exemption or meet the criteria for the non-electronic group or the new group. Payroll intermediaries are included in the online group. Payday filing for this group generally means within two working days of payday. There is an exception, described below, for certain ‘special payments’. Non-electronic group An employer is included in the “non-electronic group” if: • they have a small payroll, withholding less than $50,000 of PAYE and employers superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) in the previous tax year, and they submit their employment income information on paper; or • they are in the new group and submit their employment income information on paper; or • they have an exemption from the online group and submit their information on paper. The threshold at which electronic reporting was required was previously $100,000 of PAYE and ESCT in the previous tax year. Section 23F(6) reduces the threshold to $50,000 of withholding in the previous year. This threshold may in future be changed by Order in Council following consultation. Employers in the “non-electronic group” are generally required to provide employment income information within 10 working days of payday. These employers also have an option of providing information about each payday but treating the 15 th and last day of the month as their paydays for the purpose of calculating the due dates. This option reduces the reporting requirement to twice a month and is intended to reduce compliance costs. New group of employers An employer is in the “new group of employers” for their first six months employing staff, regardless of how much PAYE and ESCT they withhold during that period. An emplo yer in the new group has the same obligations as an employer in the non-electronic group. This categorisation enables the new employer to submit their employment income information on paper. However, if they choose to submit electronically, the employer is immediately included in the online group. After the six month period the amount of PAYE and ESCT withheld determines which group a new employer is in. Employees providing information The requirements for employees who have an obligation to provide employment income information to the Inland Revenue are in new section 23I. These employees have ten working days after the end of the month to provide employment income information to Inland 3 Revenue. This group includes what are known as IR56 taxpayers such as private domestic workers and employees of foreign embassies. Rules for certain special payments New sections 23J and 23K recognise that payday reporting of certain categories of payments would be impractical or could impose undue compliance costs. Payments made by an employer to an employee outside of the regular payment cycle may be reported on a payday basis, or reported as if they were paid on the next regular payday. To avoid problems reconciling information and payments the information cannot be included with the next regular payday if that payday falls after the end of the employer’s ‘payment period’. The requirements for schedular payments, payments made to persons on shadow payrolls and employee share scheme benefit reporting allow the employer to choose between reporting these payments on a payday basis or twice monthly. In addition, further time is allowed for the value of payments made to persons on shadow payrolls and for share scheme benefits to be calculated. 2 New employees New section 23L and schedule 4, table 2 set out the requirements for information concerning new employees. The objective is to eliminate the need for new staff to fill out paper forms for Inland Revenue and to allow fully electronic onboarding of new employees with the relevant information being electronically transmitted to Inland Revenue. Employers are required to provide a new employee’s date of birth to Inland Revenue, if the employee has supplied it, and to provide address details. This information is required to help confirm the employee’s identity and to assist Inland Revenue to maintain up-to-date contact details. This information will only be required from new employees and employers are not required to provide it for existing employees. The Commissioner is currently considering whether to use her discretion under section 23Q to exempt payers of schedular payments from the obligation to provide this information return in respect of schedular payees. Error correction New section 23N provides that regulations can be made to specify how errors in employment income information can be corrected. Before such regulations are made there must be appropriate consultation. Penalties Amendments to sections 139A, 139AA, and 142 and142G update the penalty provisions for late filing or non-electronic filing of employment income information. These penalties remain monthly penalties. An employer with a weekly payroll who failed to meet the due date on more than one occasion during a calendar month would incur no greater penalty that one who runs a monthly payroll and was late providing their one return. In addition, a discretion is added enabling the Commissioner to adopt an educational approach during the early stages of payday filing. 2 These measures do not change the date on which the value of the payment or benefit is determined. 4 Application date The changes come into force on 1 April 2019. As outlined in the transit io nal provisio ns section, the tTransit ional provisio ns allow an employer to elect into payday filing before 1 April 2019. The transitional provisions are effective from 1 April 2018 and come into force for an employer when they elect to submit their information on a payday basis during the period 1 April 2018 to 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis Employment income information Payday (as defined in section 3) means the day on which an employer makes a PAYE income payment to an employee. For employers instructing a bank to transfer funds to an employee the payday is the date that the employer has instructed the bank to make the funds available, early transfer of the funds, for example on the preceding evening, does not change the payday. New section 23C defines “employment income information” as the items of information set out in schedule 4, tables 1−3. Table 1 information is required on a payday basis and includes: • the information currently on the employer monthly schedule (EMS); • the date of the payday; and • the amount of ESCT for each employee. This information is currently required on the PAYE income payment form (IR345 or EDF) at an aggregated level. 3 An amendment to section RD22(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 repeals the requirement for a separate form to accompany payment (the PAYE income payment form, commonly known as the ‘employer deduction form’ or IR345). To permit payments to be processed, new section 23O(2) authorises the Commissioner to require information to accompany payment. Until all PAYE information is processed in Inland Revenue’s new computer system, estimated as 2020, the existing requirement for the PAYE income payment form (IR345) will continue, and the due date for this information, will continue to be the date that the payment of PAYE and other deductions is paid. Employers, who have not paid PAYE income in a pay period, will not be required to file a nil payday return. The operational details to support this are still being developed and will be made known through the Inland Revenue website when they are finalised. 3 While this reporting requirement is listed in schedule 4, table 1, row 6 at an aggregated employer level, the Commissioner is seeking the amount of ESCT payable for every employee, as applicable, as Other particulars as the Commissioner requires under schedule 4, table 1, row 8. 5 Employment income information for new and departing employees New section 23L and schedule 4, tables 2 and 3 set out the requirements for information about new and departing employees. Table 2 brings together the requirements from the IR330 (Tax code declaration) and KS2 (KiwiSaver deduction form) in a way which supports “fully electronic onboarding” of new staff and allows for an electronic interchange of details between the employer and Inland Revenue before the new employee is first paid. Paper forms will still exist and those below the electronic filing threshold may communicate the information on paper. The objective of an early exchange of information is to ensure that the new employee is set up correctly from the beginning. While Inland Revenue will encourage employers to provide new employee information before the first payday the obligation is to provide it no later than the first time payday information is provided which relates to that employee. The items o f information in schedule 4, table 2 about new employees are: • the name of the employer; • the tax file number of the employer; • the contact address of the employer; • the full name of the employee; • the contact address of the employee; • the date of birth of the employee if supplied to the employer; • the tax file number of the employee if supplied to the employer; • the tax code supplied by the employee; and • the KiwiSaver status of the employee under section 22 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 (the information additional to the above, on the existing KS1 form concerning membership and a new “not eligible” status) In circumstances where an error has been made with the IRD number the provision of date of birth information will assist the department to resolve the problem without further contact with the emplo yer. The “if supplied” caveat on the requirement for date of birth information means that the employer must ask the new employee for it but if the employee does not supply it the employer is not obliged to take further action. Unlike an employee who does not elect a tax code, an employee who does not supply their date of birth should not automatically be placed on the non-notified tax code. The requirement for contact address details has been extended from applying to employees who are enrolled in KiwiSaver to all new emplo yees. The information required about a departing employee 4 in Table 3 is the date at which the employee stopped being an employee of the employer. This informat ion is required at the time of the last payment to the employee but it can be supplied in advance. 4 “Employee” is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 as a person who receives or is entitled to receive a PAYE income payment. 6 Example Carla is on a contract which includes a year-end bonus depending on company results. She resigns in December but under her contract retains an entitlement to a percentage of the bonus to be paid in April. The company’s practice is to leave departing employees on the payroll system until the bonuses have been paid. As Carla is still entitled to receive a PAYE income payment from the company she fits the definition of an ‘employee’ under the Income Tax Act 2007. Once bonuses have been paid out the company removes Carla from its payroll system and Inland Revenue is advised that she is no longer employed with them. Example Mathieu works for a company where staff are removed from the payroll as soon as their last substantive pay has been processed. Any subsequent “wash-up” pays for year-end bonuses or other issues are managed manually. The Company notifies Inland Revenue of a departing employee following the final substantive pay and could subsequently lodge the details of any subsequent wash up via an “error-correction” process rather than by adding the employee back into the payroll system. This optional approach does not change the due dates for information or payment but makes a lower cost channel available for the submission. The advantage for an employer in promptly reporting that an employee has ceased to be emplo yed is that it will end the relationship between the employer and employee in Inland Revenue’s system much more quickly than under the current system. Thereafter Inland Revenue will no longer contact the employer about that employee. Amendments to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 The KiwiSaver Act 2006 has been amended to update references and to repeal the definition of and references to, the KiwiSaver deduction notice. The information previously required on a KiwiSaver deduction notice will in future be required when an emplo yee informs their employer of their “KiwiSaver status” or updates their KiwiSaver status, for example by opting out or taking a contribution holiday. It is intended that these actions could be done electronically. Paper forms will continue to exist. A definition of KiwiSaver status is added to section 4(1)(c) of the KiwiSaver Act. Employer groups New sections 23D – 23H establish three employer groups, and specify the formats for employment income information and due dates. Due dates are expressed as a number of working days after payday. The new groups are graphically displayed on the next page. For the purposes of these sections a working day is defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. In addition to Saturday and Sunday the definition excludes the following fro m being working days: Good Friday, Easter Monday, Anzac Day, Labour Day, the Sovereign’s birthday and Waitangi Day, but not provincial holidays. If Waitangi Day or Anzac Day fall on a Saturday or Sunday the following Monday is excluded. There are no working days between 25 th December and 15 th January (both dates inclusive) in the following year. An employer in the online group who paid staff on 24 th December would therefore not be required to provide emplo yment inco me informatio n until the second working day after 15 th of January. 7 Figure 1: Employer groups and key requirements Online group Criteria for online group • All payroll intermediaries. • Em plo yer s w ho: – withheld $50,000 or more of PA Y E an d ES CT in pr io r tax year; or – submit their employment income information digitally (via payroll software or via Inland Revenue’s website). Requirements • D ue date tw o wo r kin g day s after payday except for certain special p aym ents. N on-electronic group Cri ter ia f or no n-electronic group • Em plo yer s w ho w ith held less than $50,000 o f PA YE an d ESCT in the previous tax year; and • Submit information on paper. Requirements • Due date – ten working days after payday, except for certain special p aym ents; or • Can provide information about each payday within the first half of the month by ten working days after the 15 th and each payday in second half of the month by ten working days after month end. Electronic exempt Despite withholding more than $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT the rules for the non-electr on ic gr ou p ap ply. New employer group • If they file on paper can use non-electronic rules for firs t six months. • For remainder of first year filing rules depend on amount withheld in that year. New section 23I sets out the requirements for employees who are required to provide emplo yment inco me informat ion. New section 23J establishes options which relax the payday rules due dates for certain special payments. New section 23D(3) allows an employer to provide employment income information before the due dates. Example Fiona owns a business and always does the payroll herself. If she goes on holiday and will be away during a pay week she instructs the bank before she leaves, to enable standard payments to her staff on the normal payda y. She follows the same approach over the Christmas closedown. Because she has the information she needs in relation to the payday at the time she instructs the bank, she can file the employment income information with Inland Revenue in advance. 8 The existing constraint in Inland Revenue’s system which prevents an employer from filing more than one EMS in a month will not apply. Under the payday regime an employer may submit information more than once on the same day. For example, if they run a weekly and a fortnightly payroll which coincide every second Tuesday. New section 23D(4) provides that despite the requirements around employer groups an employer may ask the Commissioner for approval to deliver employment inco me informatio n in another way. Online group of employers New section 23E establishes the online group. The online group is the default group and employers are included in the online group unless they have an exemption or meet the criteria for the non-electronic group or the new group. Payroll intermediaries are, by definition, included in the online group. Except where they are dealing with certain ‘special payments’ employers in the online group must provide their employment income information in an electronic format, using an electronic means of delivery, within two working days after payday. New section 23C(2) requires the Commissioner to prescribe electronic form(s) and means of communication. It is intended that acceptable electronic forms of communication for payday reporting will include: • completing an onscreen form; • uploading files through the Inland Revenue websit e; and • filing direct from payroll software. Most employers who use payroll software obtain it from a commercial provider of payroll software. However, a number of employers have developed their own ‘bespoke’ software packages. Inland Revenue is in contact with providers of payroll software to the New Zealand market and with the employers which it knows use bespoke software. Any providers of payroll software or employers using bespoke software that are not already in contact with the Department about payday reporting should contact their relationship manager at Inland Revenue or if they do not have one, make contact through PaydayReporting@ird.govt.nz. An employer who otherwise meets the criteria for the non-electronic group or the new group, or who has an exemption from electronic filing but who chooses to file electronically, is included in the online group and has two working days to submit their employment income information. Non-electronic group of employers The non-electronic group of employers is established by new section 23F. An employer is included in the non-electronic group if they withheld less than $50,000 of PAYE and employers superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) in the preceding tax year and they do not deliver their emplo yment inco me information electronically. Inland Revenue monitors the amounts withheld and will advise employers when they exceed the $50,000 threshold. A period is allowed for the customer to transition to electronic filing. An employer which has an exemption from the online group under new section 23G is also included in the non-electronic group. As set out below, new employers may also be included in the non-electronic group. 9 An employer in the non-electronic group is permitted to submit their information in a prescribed paper format and can choose to either: • deliver the information within 10 working days of each payday; or • to provide details for each payday but to deliver information relating to payments made or benefits provided between the 1 st and the 15 th of the month within 10 working days of the 15 th ; and for payments made and benefits provided between the 16 th of the month and month end within 10 working days of month end. Consistent with the requirements for the receipt of tax payments, for information to be received by the due date, it must actually be received on or before the due date, not simply be posted by that date. Example Leonie and her husband farm in partnership and employ one full time employee who they pay on a weekl y basis and at certain times of year they employ casual agricultural employees. They withheld less than $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT in the previous year and they have chosen to continue to file their employment income information on paper which places them in the ‘non-electronic group of employers’. Leonie has chosen to file their employment income information twice a month. When their only employee is their full timer the return identifies what was paid and withheld for each weekly payday within the half monthly period. When they employ casual staff, the half monthly return also includes the details for each payment made to casual workers. Their employment income information is due ten working days after the 15 th of the month and ten working days after month end. If an employer who has withheld less than $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT in the previous year files their employment income information electronically they are included in the online group. However, if they wish they can revert to filing on paper, in which case the non- electronic group filing rules will apply. Example Mark runs a small business which withheld less than $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT in the previous tax year. He does not use payroll software and he initially filed employment income information for his one part time and two full time employees on paper because that is how he always filed his employer monthly schedules. He pays his staff weekly and took advantage of the ability to send his employment income information twice a month. Mark uses myIR to file his GST return and would prefer to get the payday details off his desk when he sends the payment instructions to the bank rather than having to come back to the task on the 15 th and at month end. Mark starts filing his employment income information through myIR using the onscreen form. Because he files electronically he now belongs to the online group and the information is due within two working days of payda y. Mark knows that for as long as his business withholds less than the threshold of $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT in the previous tax year he could however elect to go back to paper filing if he wanted to. Inland Revenue asks to be notified in advance should customers wish to revert to paper filing. Notice will enable the ‘customer group’ indicator, which establishes the expectations for when employment income information will be received, to be changed. 10 Threshold may be amended by Order in Council The $50,000 threshold in new section 23F(6) may be amended as set out in new section 23F(8), by Order in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue following appropriate consultation. Exemption for certain employers in the online group New section 23G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt an employer in the online group from the requirement to deliver their employment income information electronically. The exemption can be time limited. Factors the Commissioner will take into account when considering whether to exempt an employer under the new provision are: • the nature and availability of digital services to the employer, in particular whether the services are reliable; • whether the employer is capable of using a computer; and • whether the cost the employer would incur in delivering employment income information electronically would be unreasonable in the employer’s circumstances. The Commissioner will consult and publish guidelines on how the exemption will apply. Example Jack’s company withholds around $60,000 of PAYE and ESCT annually. Because this is more than the threshold, the company will be in the online group. Jack has been advised by Inland Revenue that the company is required to start filing electronically. He has also been advised that if he believes he has grounds, he can apply for an exemption from electronic filing. The company is located in a rural area where Jack also lives. Jack, who does the payroll and filing of employment income information with Inland Revenue, uses an internet connection to sometimes send business emails. However, the connection is not reliable, the speed is always slow and drops out frequently, particularly during peak internet usage times. He writes to Inland Revenue explaining his issues seeking an exemption from filing employment income information electronically. Inland Revenue advises Jack that his company is exempt from the requirement to file employment income information electronically until the Commissioner notifies Jack that the exemption for his company is to be cancelled. The reason stated for the exemption is that the digital services available to Jack’s company are not reliable for the purpose of delivering employment income information on a payday basis electronically. New group of employers The rules for new employers are included in new section 23H and 23F(3) – (7). For their first six months employing employees an employer can choose to file employment income information using non-electronic means (on paper) regardless of how much PAYE and ESCT they have withheld. If they file on paper they are subject to the rules of the non-electronic group. If the employer choses to file electronically they are included in the online group. If the amount withheld reaches $50,000 during the first year the new employer may continue to file on paper for the remainder, if any, of the initial six month period. Thereafter, if the amount withheld exceeds $50,000 in the first tax year, the employer is in the online group and 11 must file electronically within two working days of payday. Inland Revenue will advise the employer when the accumulated amount reaches $50,000 for the year. Example Mel and Sefina have established a company and bought an existing business which employs 12 full time staff. Rather than take over the antiquated business systems which the previous owner used they intend to use a modern business software package which will look after invoicing and accounting as well as payroll. They know that there are packages which can be used to meet their obligations for GST, provisional tax and employment income information. At the time they take the business over they have not chosen their new software system and know that, regardless of how much PAYE and ESCT they withhold, they have a six month period during which they can file their employment income information on paper. Delivery of employment income information for certain special payments The definition of payday “the day on which an employer makes a PAYE income payment to an employee” includes “out-of-cycle” payments made to employees who are on a regular payroll as well as schedular payments and payments to employees on shadow payrolls. New section 23K(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows an employer to treat the 20 th day after the share scheme taxing date for an employee share scheme beneficiary as the payday. To reduce the compliance costs associated with reporting these payments, new sections 23J and 23K provide employers with a choice. The employer can report these payments on a payday basis as set out in new sections 23E to 23H, and new section 23K(1)(a) in the case of benefits under employee share schemes, or they can choose to report them as set out in: • schedular payments: new sections 23J(2) and 23C(4); • a payment made to a person on a shadow payroll: new sections 23J(3) and (6) and 23C(4); • benefits under employee share schemes: new sections 23K(1)(b) and 23C(4); or • out of cycle payments: new sections 23J(4) and (5). New section 23J(7) provides that the provisions in section 23J do not extend to employers who are delivering their information as set out in new section 23F(3)(b). This is because these employers are only required by section 23F(3)(b) to deliver their employment income information twice a month which will reduce compliance costs in a similar way to the provisions in section 23J. Schedular payments Schedular payments are defined in schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and include payments made to certain classes of contractors, company directors and commission sales people. Many businesses pay those entitled to receive schedular payments through their accounts payable rather than the payroll system. Payments may be made on a daily or irregular basis. Sections 23J(1) and (2) allow an employer to either report schedular pays on a payday basis or twice-mo nthly. Twice monthly filing is defined in new section 23C(4) and allows the employer to report payments made between the 1 st and 15 th of the month as if they had been 12 made on the 15 th of the month. For the second half of the month the payments can be reported as if they were made on the last day of the month. The due dates for twice monthly reporting of schedular payments depend on the employer group and are either two working days or ten working days after the 15 th of the month and two or ten working days after month end. Twice monthly reporting schedular payments Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 (month end) For any schedular payments made in the blue period (1 st – 15 th ) the reporting due date is as if the payments were made on the 15 th . Any payments made in the purple period can be reported as if they were paid on the 31 st (month end). Example Curran and Co is in the online employer group. It pays sales people on a commission basis and payments are made from the accounts payable system on an almost daily basis. They run reports on the schedular payments made and the amounts withheld, in the first half of the month, on the first working day after the 15 th and the on the payments made and the amounts withheld in the second half of the month, on first business day of the following month. Curran and Co’s employment income information relating to schedular payments is electronically reported within two working days of the 15 th of the month, and within two working days of month end. 13 Example Sacha and his wife farm in partnership. In addition to employing two staff who are paid fortnightly, they occasionally employ contractors who are paid schedular payments. They pay contractors at the end of their period of engagement. They do the payroll manually but the partnership files electronically, using the onscreen form, and is in the online group. If there is a regular payday between the date of the schedular payment and the end of the half monthly period for schedular payments Sacha reports the schedular payment at the same time as the next report for his employees. If the schedular payment falls after the last regular payday in the half month Sacha knows he could wait until the end of the half monthly period, but he generally files the information relating to the schedular payment on a payday basis, at the same time he calculates the payment. If he chose he could however wait until the end of the half monthly period to electronically file the information. A payment made to a person on a shadow payroll Employers of internationally mobile employees working in New Zealand may have PAYE reporting and payment obligations in New Zealand even though the employees have been paid in a foreign jurisdiction. New Zealand obligations are worked out on what is referred to as a shadow payroll. New section 23J(6) defines what is meant by a payment to a person on a shadow payroll. The process of determining the New Zealand taxable income includes obtaining employee payment information from offshore payroll providers and confirming the calculation of New Zealand taxable income of that employee. This takes time. New section 23J(3) provides that the employer (or their New Zealand based agent) has twenty days after an amount is paid to a person before the obligation to provide employment income information arises. The employer then has the option of reporting it on a payday basis or can report it twice-monthly with the 20 th day after payment being treated as the ‘relevant day’ (payday). Twice monthly delivery is defined in new section 23C(4) and operates as it does for schedular payments except it is the 20 th day after payment (the relevant day) that dictates the reporting obligation. For the purposes of this rule, which also applies to reporting benefits under employee share schemes under new section 23K(2)(b), the 20 th day is not calculated on a working day basis but in actual days. If the relevant day falls in the first half of the month it must be reported no later than two working days after the 15 th and if it falls in the second half of the month it must be reported no later than two working days after month end. Twice monthly delivery allows all payments, to employees on a shadow payroll, made by that employer in that half monthly period to be reported in the same return. An amendment to section CE 1(3B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that where an employer reports their employment income information under 23J(3) such a payment is treated as being derived by the person on the 20 th day after the payment. Under this provision, the 20 th day after the payment is made to the person is the date of the PAYE income payment for the purposes of section RD 4 which sets the requirements for when PAYE and other deductions must be paid to Inland Revenue. 14 Example Jones and Lowe provide professional services which include acting as a tax agent for offshore employers who employ staff working on projects in New Zealand. Jones and Lowe report this information electronically and are in the online employer group for the work they do for their clients. Jones and Lowe have established processes with their offshore clients so that they usually receive details of the amounts paid to the employees by the home country payroll, within a few days of the payment being made. An offshore employer paid an employee working in New Zealand on Thursday 12 April and Jones and Lowe received the information the following week. Jones and Lowe have twenty days after the original payday (12 April) to calculate the New Zealand taxable income. In this example, the twentieth day is Wednesday 2 May. Because the twentieth day falls on 2 May, in the first half of the month Jones and Lowe must report the information at the latest as if the payday was the 15 th . The information would be due two working days after the 15 th of the month. If the twentieth day falls in the second half of the month Jones and Lowe must report it at the latest as if the payday was the last day of the month. This information would be due two working days after month end. The second of May is date the payment is deemed to be derived which, because the employer withholds less than $500,000 of PAYE and ESCT a year, means that PAYE on the payment is due on 20 June. Benefits under employee share schemes Amendments have been made to section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which defer the date that an employee who receives a benefit under an employee share scheme is treated as deriving income in relation to the benefit by 20 days from the taxing point. The amendment names this 20 th day after the share scheme taxing date for the employee share scheme beneficiary as the “ESS deferral date”. This deferral applies for all employees who receive benefits under an employee share scheme that their employer is required to report to Inland Revenue about as part of employment income information. An amendment to section RD 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that an employee share scheme benefit from which an employer has chosen to withhold tax under the PAYE rules is treated as paid on the 20 th day after the taxing point for the benefit received by the employee. The date on which an employee share scheme benefit is treated as paid will be the end date of the four-week period referred to in the extra pay tax rate calculation in section RD 17, which employers will use to calculate the amount of tax they must withhold for the benefit. It also influences when the employer is required to pay the withheld tax to Inland Revenue by. An amendment to section RD 7B of the Income Tax Act 2007, which specifies how an employer makes an election to withhold tax for an employee share scheme benefit, replaces the requirement to report the value of the benefit to Inland Revenue on their employer monthly schedule by the relevant due date with a requirement to include the value of the benefit in their employment income information under new subpart 3C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Replacement section RD 22(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires employers to provide employment income information in relation to employee share scheme benefits to Inland Revenue under new sections 23E to 23H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as modified by new section 23K of that Act. 15 A new defined term “ESS deferral date” has been inserted into section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which refers to the definition of that term in new section CE 2(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007. New section 23K(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out the two options an employer has for reporting information about employee share scheme benefits. An emplo yer may report the information to Inland Revenue: • on a payday basis, treating the 20 th day after the taxing point for the benefit received by the employee as the payday; or • on a twice-monthly basis as described in new section 23C(4) of that Act, treating the 20 th day after the taxing point for the benefit received by the employee as the “relevant day” that dictates the reporting obligation. New section RD 22(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and new section 23K(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specify that employers are not required to provide Inland Revenue with information on: • employee share scheme benefits received by former employees if they have not chosen to withhold tax for the benefit; or • benefits arising under tax-exempt employee share schemes. New section 23K(2)(b) and new schedule 4, table 1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specify the particulars in relation to employee share scheme benefits that must be provided to Inland Revenue by employers who are subject to the reporting requirements. The employee share scheme benefit-specific information that employers who are required to report employee share scheme benefit information for current employees is: • the value of the benefit to the employee; and • the amount of tax withheld for the benefit, if any. Employers who are required to report employee share scheme benefit information for former employees because they have chosen under the PAYE rules to withhold tax from the benefit, must report: • the employee’s name; • the employee’s IRD number, if known by the employer; • the value of the benefit; and • the amount of tax withheld for the benefit. 16 Example Under the new rules, if an employee received a benefit under an employee share scheme on 5 July 2019 (that is, the share scheme taxing date for the employee share scheme beneficiary is 5 July 2019) they would be treated as deriving income in relation to the benefit on 25 July 2019. Their employer would have two options as to how they meet their obligation to provide information in relation to the benefit to Inland Revenue: Option 1: reporting on a payday basis If their employer chooses to report information in relation to the benefit on a payday basis, 25 July 2019 would also be the relevant payday. This would mean that their employer would be required to report information about the value of the benefit received by the employee and any tax withheld in relation to the benefit by the 2nd working day after 25 July 2019 if they are an employer in the online group, or by the 10th working day after 25 July 2019 if they are an employer in the non-electronic group (or an employer in the new group who provides their employment income information on paper). Option 2: reporting on a twice-monthly basis If their employer chooses to report information in relation to the benefit on a twice-monthly basis, 25 July 2019 would be treated as the “relevant day” for the purposes of new section 23C(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This would mean that their employer would be required to report information about the value of the benefit received by the employee and any tax withheld in relation to the benefit by the 2nd working day after 31 July 2019 if they are an employer in the online group, or by the 10th working day after 31 July 2019 if they are an employer in the non-electronic group (or an employer in the new group who provides their employment income information on paper). 25 July 2019 would also be the relevant date for determining the due date for the payment of tax withheld in relation to the benefit (assuming that the employer elected to withhold tax in relation to the benefit). In this example, the due date for paying the tax withheld to Inland Revenue would be 5 August 2019 if the employer was above the $500,000 per annum of PAYE and ESCT threshold, or 20 August 2019 if they are below the threshold. A payment to an employee made outside the employee’s regular payment cycle Many employers make out-of-cycle payments. These might be made to pay an employee’s final pay on their last day of employment, or to correct for the omission of a payment that was not included with the previous pay run because the information was received late. Some employers will process these payments through the payroll system and they can be reported on a payday basis. Other employers will not process the payments through the payroll system until the next regular payday. To reduce the compliance costs of out-of-cycle payments, new sections 23J(4) and (5) permit the employer to report such payments with the information for the next regular payday. An exception applies where the next regular payday falls after the employer’s “end date” for the payment of PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue. 5 Where the exception applies, the 5 Because they operate on a twice monthly basis as defined in new section 23C(4) the previously described rules for reporting employee share scheme benefits, schedular payments and shadow payrolls do not require this exception. Reporting the information on a twice monthly basis will ensure that the information can always be aligned with payments. 17 out-of-cycle payment must be reported to Inland Revenue as if it was made on the last day of the payment period, 6 at the latest. For example in the month illustrated below if information relating to any payments made between the 28 th and 31 st was held over beyond the end date of the 31 st into a report for the next month, the information provided for the illustrated month would not reconcile with the payment made. Under section RA 15(3)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 most employers have an end date for the payment of PAYE at the end of the month. All amounts withheld in the month up to month end, have to be paid to Inland Revenue by the 20 th of the following month. If an out of cycle payment was made after the last regular payday in the month but before month end the deductions would be paid to Inland Revenue with the other amounts deducted in the month. If the information was held over and included with the next regular payday it would appear as if it related to a payment made in that (subsequent) month. This would cause problems reconciling the amounts paid to Inland Revenue with the information provided. Under section RA15(3)(a) of the income tax Act 2007 the largest employers have two ‘end dates’ in a month; the 15 th of the month and month end and as illustrated in the Cork and Co example below, the exception could arise twice monthly for these emplo yers. In the Advantage All example illustrated below if information relating to any payments made between the 28 th and 31 st was held over beyond the end date of the 31 st into a report for the next month, the information provided for the illustrated month would not reconcile with the payment made. As noted earlier employers in the non-electronic and new employer groups, or who have an exemption from electronic filing and who are choosing to deliver their employment income informat ion twice a mo nth as set out in sections 23F(3)(b) and 23F(4) are not able to also take advantage of new section 23J(4). This exclusion, contained in new section 23J(7), reflects that these employers already have reduced reporting obligations and eliminates the need for these employers to apply the exception in section 23J(5). 6 The requirement that the out-of-cycle payment must be reported at the latest as if it was made on the last day of the payment period is intended to allow an employer to report all out-of-cycle payments made during the exception period in the same return. 18 Example Reporting out-of-cycle payments Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun Regular payday. Any out-of-cycle pays on the blue dates can be reported with next regular pay. Out of cycle pays on the orange dates cannot be included with the next regular pay and must be reported at the latest as if they were paid on the last day of the month. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 The calendar illustrates the obligations for Advantage All New Zealand, a charity which is above the electronic filing threshold and is in the online employer group. Advantage All has an “end date” for the payment of PAYE at the end of every month and must remit the amounts withheld during the month to Inland Revenue by the 20 th of the following month. Advantage All can report out-of-cycle payments made on any of the blue dates at the same time as the next regular payday return. If Advantage All makes an out-of-cycle payment between the last regular payday (27 th in the month illustrated above) and the end of its payment period, at month end, it must report the payments within two working days of month end. 19 Example Reporting out-of-cycle payments Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun Regular payday. Any out-of-cycle pays on the blue dates can be reported with next regular pay. Out of cycle pays on the orange dates cannot be included with the next regular pay and must be reported at the latest as if they were paid on the 15 th or last day of the month as appropriate. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Cork and Collins Ltd are a large business which pays the PAYE and other deductions they withhold to Inland Revenue twice a month. Cork and Collins have two payment periods in a month, with end dates of the 15 th and month end. Amounts withheld between 1 st and 15 th inclusive are paid to Inland Revenue by the 20 th and amounts withheld between the 16 th and month end must be paid by the 5 th of the following month. Cork and Collins are in the online employer group. The organisation runs a single fortnightly payroll and makes occasional out-of-cycle payments during other days in the month, most often to pay departing staff on their last day. In the month illustrated, payments made between the 1 st and 5 th (shown in blue) could be reported with the regular payday on the 6 th and payments made between the 16 th and 19 th could be included with the regular payday on the 20 th . If Cork and Collins made ad hoc payments between the last regular payday and the end of the payment period they must be separately reported no later than two working days after the end of the payment period. In the month illustrated above out-of-cycle payments made between the 7 th and 15 th need to be reported at the latest within two working days after the 15 th of the month. Similarly, any payments made during the period 21 st to 31 st must be reported at the latest by the second working day after month end. Payments on different days during the period that falls between the last regular payday and the end of the payment period can be reported in the same return. The need for the exception relating to out-of-cycle payments which occur after the last regular payday but before the end of the employer’s payment period will be reviewed after Inland Revenue has completed the transfer of PAYE from its old to its new computer systems after 2020. Employment income information when employment ends New section 23M requires an employer, who intends to permanently cease to employ, to notify Inland Revenue within 30 working days of the date on which they ceased to emplo y any staff. This notification will deregister the customer as an emplo yer. The previous obligation in RD 22(6) of the Income Tax Act 20017, to inform the Commissioner if the employer ceased business has been repealed. Correction of Errors New section 23N provides a regulation making power for matters relating to correcting errors in employment income information. The Governor-General may make regulations by Order 20 in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue following appropriate consultation. If regulations for the correction of errors are required during the transitional period (1 April 2018 to 1 April 2019) new section 46(8) provides a regulation making power on the same basis as described above in relation to 23N. Consultation was conducted through an officials’ issues paper PAYE error correction and adjustment released in August 2017 and officials are advising Ministers on the recommended content of regulations which it is anticipated will be made with effect from 1 April 2019. 7 Filing requirements, payroll software and variation of requirements New section 23O(1) requires the Commissioner to prescribe both electronic and non- electronic forms and modes of delivery and permits the Commissioner to set specifications for payroll software. To permit payments to be processed new section 23O(2) authorises the Commissioner to require information to accompany payment. Until all PAYE information is processed in Inland Revenue’s new computer system (estimated for 2020), this section will be used to require the continuation of the existing requirement for a PAYE income payment form (IR345). This form is due at the same time as the payment to which it relates. New section 23P defines payroll software as a commercially available payroll system or service or bespoke equivalent. This definition is not intended to capture those who use spreadsheets or electronic calculators to assist in the calculation of their payroll. New section 23Q allows the Commissioner to vary the requirements set out in the subpart 3C and schedule 4 for an employer or class of employers. Penalties Late payment penalties (shortfall penalty) Because there are no mandatory changes for the timing of PAYE and related deductions, there are no changes in the penalty provisions around non-payment of PAYE and related deductions, other than updating the references and terminology. Section 141ED, previously “Not paying an employer monthly schedule amount” becomes “Penalty for unpaid amounts of employers’ withholding payments”. Educational approach during co-existence New sections 139(9) and 139AA(7) provide that the Commissioner has a discretion not to impose late filing and non-electronic filing penalties if it is necessary because of resource constraints during the period of co-existence between Inland Revenue’s old and new software platforms, and the non-compliance is not serious or unreasonable. These provisions will allow the Commissioner to use her resources to support an educational approach during the early stages of payday filing. The capacity to impose late filing and non- 7 Note: one of the changes consulted on in the officials’ issues paper – accepting negative values in a return – would not be possible until after the end of the period of co-existence for PAYE on Inland Revenue’s old and new computer systems, which is not expected before 2020. 21 electronic filing penalties remains in cases where the employer is deliberately non-co mpliant or otherwise behaves unreasonably. The explanation of the late filing and non-electronic filing penalties as they will apply following the educational period, is set out below. Late filing penalties An amendment to section 139A provides that the late filing penalty will remain a monthly penalty of $250. The late filing penalty under section 139A will not be imposed for the first occasion of late filing in a twelve month period. This continues the current approach. After the first instance of late filing in a month, an employer will be advised that a penalty will be imposed if there is a further failure to file on time within 12 months. The monthly calculation of the penalty means that an employer who pays employees on a weekly basis and who fails to meet the due date for filing on more than one occasion during a month will incur the same penalty as an employer who runs a monthly payroll and is late providing their one submission. Example Matias and Carrie run a business which withholds more than $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT a year so they are in the online group. Matias manages the payroll which runs every week but he does not always meet his filing obligations with Inland Revenue. In February Matias missed two due dates for filing employment income information. Because it was not the first time in a twelve month period, a penalty of $250 was imposed. Three months later Matias again missed a filing obligation, for one payday return during the month, and was again penalised $250. The key date for determining whether there is a penalty is the month in which the information is due, not the month in which the payday fell. The examples below illustrate this point. Example Every Wednesday Jennie does the pay for her partner’s company which is in the online group. The company has already received a notice that if its employment income information is late again within a twelve month period it will receive a late filing penalty. The last Wednesday in February is the 27 th and the information is due on the 1 st of March. Jennie failed to provide the information by the 1 st of March and subsequently missed the due date for information for one payday in March. Because the due dates which were missed were both in March, a single late filing penalty of $250 is imposed. 22 Example After several months of on time filing Jennie failed to provide employment income information on time for the last three paydays in October which occurred on the 17 th , 24 th and 31 st of October. The due dates for information relating to the first two paydays are the 19 th and 26 th of October and a late filing penalty of $250 is imposed for information due in October. The due date for the last October payday is the 2 nd of November and the company also receives a late filing penalty of $250 for the late filing of information due in October. Non-electronic filing penalty Under an amendment to section 139AA the non-electronic filing penalt y remains a mo nthly penalty. An employer who failed to file electronically information relating to each of the four paydays in a month would face the same penalty as an employer with the same sized payroll, who failed to meet their obligation on one occasion during the month. The penalty is the greater of $250 or $1 for each employee whose information has not be returned electronically in the month. Example F Charm Ltd withholds more than the threshold amount of $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT. The company has been notified by Inland Revenue that from a specified future date, they will be in the “on-line group” and required to provide employment income information electronically and that the due date for the information will be two working days after payday. They are also advised that if they believe they have grounds, they can apply for an exemption from electronic filing. F Charm Ltd does not seek an exemption and has not changed their filing method by the time the notice period expires. They pay staff weekly and the number employed varies. In July the numbers reported each week varied from 70 to 90 but over the month 95 different employees were reported as being paid. The last payday in July was Thursday the 26 th and the information should have been received electronically on 30 th of July. The returns were submitted on paper and failed to meet the new due dates. The non-electronic filing penalty for the month is the greater of $250 or $1 for each employee whose information is not filed electronically which in this case was 95. F Charm Ltd is penalised $250 for not filing electronically in July. Because it was the first occasion (month) in a twelve month period on which they had failed to file on time, F Charm is notified that a further failure to file on time will incur a late filing penalty. Due dates for payment of late filing penalties New section 142(1A) provides that a late filing penalty is due 30 days after the end of the month in which the employer is required to deliver the employment income information in question. 23 Example R V Winkle Ltd is in the online group and run a fortnightly payroll. The company is occasionally late to file their employment income information. Information for May was due on the 5 th and 19 th of May but the second return was not received until the 26 th which was the fifth working day after payday. Because it is not the first time in twelve months that the company has filed late they have already received a letter advising that a penalty will be imposed for a further failure to file on time within twelve months. A late filing penalty is imposed on RV Winkle and Associates. It has a due date of 30 th of June which is 30 days after the end of the month (May) in which the information was due. Example S White and Associates is in the non-electronic employer group and runs a weekly payroll. They have elected to provide their employment income information twice a month (due dates ten working days after the 15 th and ten working days after month end). S White and Associates are sometimes late to provide their information. They have received notice that a penalty will be imposed for a further failure to provide information on time within twelve months. S White and Associates provide information on time in April and their first return in May is received on time. Because all the information expected in May (the information for the second April payment and for the first May payment) is received on time no penalty is imposed in April. However S White and Associates are late to provide their second return for May. It was due ten working days after the end of the month on the 14 th of June but was not received until the 22 nd , six working days late. A late filing penalty is imposed on A White and Associates. It has a due date of 30 July which is thirty days after the end of the month (June) in which the information was due. Due dates for payment of non-electronic filing penalties Amended section 142G provides that non-electronic filing penalties are due 30 days after the end of the month in which the employer was required to file in the prescribed electronic form or by way of the prescribed electronic communication. Example F Charm Ltd.’s penalty for non-electronic filing, for due dates in July, is due on 30 August. As illustrated above for the late filing penalty it is the date that the information should be received in electronic format that determines whether a penalty will be imposed for that mo nth, not the date of the payday. 24 Example F Charm Ltd continues to submit employment income information on paper through August. The information for the payda ys on 2 nd , 9 th , 16 th and 23 rd of August is due in August. F Charm Ltd’s failure to submit its employment income information electronically in August will give rise to a non-electronic filing penalty for August due on the 30 th September. The last payday in August is Thursday the 30 th , with the information due to be received in electronic format by Monday the 3 rd of September. For the failure to file electronically on the 3 rd of September a non-electronic filing penalty will be imposed with a due date of the 30 th of October. 25 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS Sections 227C and 227D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Background The transitional provisions allow an employer or payroll intermediary in the online group to adopt payday filing on a voluntary basis during the period April 2018 to March 2019. The opportunity for early adoption on a voluntary basis is restricted to those who submit their information electronically. The voluntary adoption period is intended to allow those who need to install upgrades to their payroll systems to choose a time that is convenient to them. The last employer monthly schedule, prior to commencing payday filing, is due on its normal timetable, the 5 th or 20 th of the following month as appropriate, during the first month of payday filing. Application date The transitional provisions come into force on 1 April 2018. However, section 227C(8)(a) provides that for an employer the provisions come into effect when the employer elects to submit their employment income information on a payday basis during the voluntary period. The election process for employers who chose to adopt payday filing during the voluntary period will vary depending on the filing method the employer chooses to use. If the employer chooses to payday file using the ‘onscreen form’ in myIR or through ‘file upload’ in myIR, they are asked to contact Inland Revenue on 0800 377 772 (small or medium business) or 0800 433 553 (significant enterprise customers). Depending on demand the telephone process may be replaced with an online process, if so details will be available on Inland Revenue’s website. Employers who choose to provide employment income information direct from their software will need to talk to their software provider to ensure that the functionality is available. Beginning to file payday information direct from software will constitute an election. Detailed analysis Payday provision of employment income information is required from 1 April 2019. Notwithstanding the new regime being effective from 1 April 2019, new section 227D(1) provides that the old rules apply to the employer monthly schedule and employer deductions form(s) for March 2019. These returns will be due in April 2019 on the 5 th or 20 th as appropriate. New section 227D(3) applies to employers who are required to remit PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue on a twice-monthly basis. These employers are required to apply the new rules in relation to the tax treatment and reporting of employee share scheme benefits received by their employees or former employees during the 16 March 2019 to 31 March 2019 period. This rule prevents an EMS relating to April 2019 being filed during May 2019. 26 New section 227C identifies a transitional period for the voluntary application of the emplo yment inco me informat ion provisio ns. The transitional period starts on 1 April 2018 and ends on 31 March 2019. An employer in the online group can choose to adopt the payday filing rules during the period fro m April 2018. The rules for the voluntary application of the employment income information provisions are set out in new section 227C. An employer can voluntarily adopt payday filing at the beginning of any month 8 during the transitional period. For an employer’s first month under the payday filing rules, new section 227D(2) provides that the old rules still apply to the employer monthly schedule and employer deduction form(s) relating to the previous month. Example R Stilt and Co are in the online group and have elected to opt in to payday filing from the beginning of September 2018. R Stilt and Co pay their staff fortnightly. The company withholds less than $500,000 of PAYE and ESCT so they pay PAYE and related deductions to Inland Revenue once a month − by the 20 th of the following month. In September 2018 their paydays are on the 12 th and 26 th of the month. R Stilt and Co’s employer monthly schedule, employer deduction form and payment for August 2018 is due on the 20 th of September 2018. R Stilt and Co’s first payday return is due two working days after payday, on the 14 th of September. The second return is due two working days after the second payday, on the 28 th of September. No changes have been made to the due dates for the payment of PAYE and other deductions so the employer deduction form and payment are still due for the September paydays, on the 20 th of October. If an employer chooses to provide employment income information on a payday basis during the transitional (voluntary) period, they must also apply the other relevant provisions including, for example, the requirements for employment income information for new and departing employees and the reporting of benefits under employee share schemes. New section 227C(4) requires that an employer who chooses to adopt payday filing o f employment income information during the transitional period applies the modifications to the rules relating to benefits under employee share schemes (otherwise effective from 1 April 2019) for all employee share scheme benefits received by their employees or former employees on or after the date that is 20 days before they made their election. New section 227C(9) provides that an employer who elects to provide employment income information on a payday basis during the transitional period may not opt out without the Commissioner’s agreement. This provision is intended to ensure that support is provided and that Inland Revenue is aware of the nature of any difficulties employers are having. Inland Revenue also needs to be aware of the employer’s intended method of submitting information. It is not intended to unreasonably prevent an employer opting out during the transit ional period. 8 Because an ‘employer monthly schedule’ relates to a month payday filing should begin from the beginning of a month. 27 CONSOLIDATION OF PAYE ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS Sections 22, 22AA, 23, 24B to 24IB and schedule 3, tables 1 and 5 of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections RD 4, RD 12, RD 21 and RD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 34 and 202 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011; and section 163 of the Child Support Act 1991 Key features This Act consolidates and simplifies the structure of the administrative requirements relating to PAYE in the Tax Administration Act 1994. This change sees much of the detail being placed in schedules to the Act. In addit ion to the changes already outlined, the provisions relating to record keeping and tax codes are restructured. The consolidation necessitates some changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and consequential changes to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and Child Support Act 1991. In addition, there are a small number of policy clarifications and changes. These include clarifying the circumstances in which the non-notified tax codes applies and providing that the threshold for twice monthly remittance of PAYE and other deductions can be changed by Order in Council following consultation. Application date The changes come into force on 1 April 2019. Detailed analysis Record keeping The Act brings together the sections that impose PAYE record-keeping requirements on emplo yers. New schedule 3 itemises the information that employers must record and keep. New section 22AA contains the PAYE record keeping obligations and also requires employers to keep the records required under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, the Student Loan Schemes Act 2011, and Child Support Act 1991. The new section places the detail of the specific records in new schedule 3 Table 1: Record-keeping requirements for employers and PAYE intermediaries. This table sets out the items for which records, certificates and notifications are required to be kept. An amendment to section 23(2) provides that where information has been transmitted electronically, an employer is not required to retain the employment income information that has been provided to the Commissioner. PAYE tax codes The Act consolidates the core requirements relating to tax codes in subpart 3D, placing the detail in schedule 5 parts A and B. The intent is to restructure the existing provisions to improve clarit y. 28 The amendments clarify the circumstances in which an employee must be taxed at the “no notification” rate. Section 24B(3B) previously provided that this rate (currently 45 cents in the dollar) applied when the employee had not provided their employer with a tax code notification and the Commissioner has not provided the employer with a tax code or special tax code for the employee. The prescribed form for a tax code notification requires the employee to provide their name and tax file number, in addition to their tax code. The employee’s name and tax file number are critical to establishing their identity. New section 24E now makes explicit that not providing a name, tax file number, or tax code, will result in the employee being placed on the “non-notified” tax code. The exceptions are where the Commissioner has provided the information to the employer or the employee is a non-resident seasonal worker in their first month of employment in New Zealand. The no notification tax code has now been renamed the “non-notified” tax code. The requirement that an employee must certify their entitlement to work in New Zealand when completing their tax code certificate is repealed on 1 April 2019. Under the Immigration Act 2009 employers have a positive obligation to determine that workers are legally able to work for them. Holding a copy of the employee’s tax code declaration, where an employee self-certifies their immigration status, does not discharge this obligation and the requirement has been repealed. Schedule 5 part A contains detailed provisions in relation to the application of general (not special) tax codes. As noted above, the intent is to improve clarity, not to amend the provisio ns. Part A contains provisions relating to: • combining tax codes; • changes to tax codes and when changes to tax codes apply; • the steps the Commissioner may take if she considers that an incorrect tax code is being used, and the consequential requirements on the employer; • when entitlement to use a tax code ends; and • a table of tax codes. Schedule 5 part B contains detailed provisions relating special and particular tax codes: • the Commissioner’s ability to provide a special tax code; • what a special tax code may apply to, what it may require and how the Commissioner is to calculate it; • the requirement on the Commissioner to notify the relevant department if the code is issued in relation to superannuation or veteran’s pension income; • the overriding nature of a special tax code; • the Commissioner’s ability to cancel a special tax code; • tax codes for private domestic workers; and • tax codes for non-resident seasonal workers. 29 New section 24IB allows the Commissioner to vary requirements relating to tax codes in a similar way as was previously set out in the now repealed section 24P. Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 With the exception of the change which enables the threshold for twice monthly remittance of PAYE and related deductions to be amended by Order in Council, the PAYE related changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 are largely consequential on consolidating the administrative requirements for PAYE into the Tax Administration Act 1994. New section RD 4(7) provides that the Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, make an Order in Council amending the threshold amount for twice monthly remittance of PAYE and related deductions. Before making a recommendation, the Minister must undertake appropriate consultation. Section RD 4 previously expressed the requirements for monthly or twice monthly remittance of amounts of tax withheld in terms of the information obligations set out in RD 22. Replacement section RD 4 now includes the criteria previously prescribed in RD 22 namely the $500,000 a year threshold for twice-monthly payment, the rules for new employers, and how the threshold is to be applied if the employer runs more than one business or is a person to whom control has become vested or passed. Section RD 22 as amended provides that obligations on employers to provide employment income information are as set out in the Tax Administration Act sections 23E − 23H. New subsection RD 22(2) clarifies that where an employee has a special tax code of zero, or is a recipient of schedular income that has a special tax rate of zero the employer or PAYE intermediary, despite not withholding PAYE, must nonetheless report employment income information to the Commissioner. The obligation on an employee to provide information to the Commissioner in certain circumstances was previously set out in both RD 4(2)(b) and RD 21(1)(a). The Act repeals RD 4(2)(b) and amends RD 21(1) (a) which now provides that the requirement on an employee to provide employment income information is as set out in new section 23I of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section RD 12 relating to multiple payments of salary or wages has been clarified so that the requirement to treat the amounts as one payment only applies where the employment situations are with the same employer. 30 CHANGES FOR THE PAYROLL SUBSIDY Sections 3 “tax” and “tax position”, 15C, 15G, 15H, 15I, 15J, 15M, 185, 185C and 185D of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections RD 2, RD 64, RP 2 − RP 5, RZ 14, YA 1 “listed PAYE intermediary” and “subsidy claim form” of the Income Tax Act 2007; Income Tax (Payroll Subsidy) Regulations 2006; Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (Class Exemptions) Notice 2014 The eligibility threshold for the payroll subsidy is lowered to $50,000 of PAYE and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) withheld annually by the employer, from 1 April 2019. The payroll subsidy will be repealed the following year with effect from 1 April 2020. Background Inland Revenue currently pays a payroll subsidy to listed PAYE intermediaries taking on the PAYE obligations of eligible employers. It is available for up to five employees of an employer per PAYE income payment. To reduce compliance and administrative costs the subsidy is paid by Inland Revenue directly to the listed PAYE intermediary on a monthly basis. The subsidy was introduced to encourage small employers to outsource their PAYE obligations to approved listed PAYE intermediaries to make compliance easier for them, give small employers more time to run their business, and improve the overall operation of the PAYE system. The changes to the payroll subsidy are included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Emplo yment and Invest ment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act, which contains a range of measures to modernise the administration of PAYE. Key features For the 2019−20 tax year from 1 April 2019, to better target assistance to small employers, the eligibility threshold for the payroll subsidy is lowered from currently $500,000 to $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT withheld by the employer for the preceding tax year. The new eligibilit y threshold is contained in section RP 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. New subsection RP 4(1D) of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows the Commissioner to continue to pay the payroll subsidy for an employer who would typically fall below the threshold of $50,000, but who is above the threshold because of a one-off event such as a redundancy payment or a payment on retirement. The payroll subsidy is repealed on 1 April 2020. New section RZ 14 contains a transitional provision to ensure that PAYE intermediaries can claim and receive the payroll subsidy for PAYE income payments made before 1 April 2020 within the then existing rules and timeframes. 31 Application dates The payroll subsidy threshold reduction from $500,000 to $50,000 applies from 1 April 2019. The payroll subsidy provisions are repealed in their entirety effective 1 April 2020. New transit ional provisio n section RZ 14 also applies from 1 April 2020. 32

Speech

### Speech to International Fiscal Association Conference, Heritage Hotel, Queenstown

#### Introduction

Thank you Casey and good morning everyone. I really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you again.

Today, I want to talk to you about the tax policy work programme

I’ll also share some thoughts on the progress of Inland Revenue’s business transformation.

But I expect you’re pretty keen to hear about the Government’s views on Tax Working Group’s final report, released just last week. So let’s start with that!

#### Tax Working Group’s final recommendations

I’m sure many have you have found some time to have a look at the Group’s final recommendations.

We appreciate the months of work the Working Group has put into examining our tax system and developing recommendations to improve it.

The report finds that the current broad-based low-rate system is clear and simple and does not need a major overhaul. However, it does point at some unfairness that could be addressed.

It deals with a number of complex issues in significant detail and we want to get our heads around it, and get some preliminary advice from officials, before we publish the Government’s response in early April.

We look forward to discussing the recommendations with our Coalition and Confidence and Supply partners as we work to find consensus on the best overall package.

So you’ll understand that I’m not able to use this forum to share any thoughts on the Group’s recommendations.

It’s important that Government takes due care when coming up with a considered response.

However, I can use this opportunity to remind you that at the time the Group released its interim report back in September, Minister Robertson and I wrote to the Group and asked that they consider an option that includes a revenue-neutral package.

In response, the TWG has presented some options so that any revenue from this would be offset by a tax reduction in another area, possibly by way of reducing income tax, as the Tax Working Group recommends.

I was pleased to see the Group take this on board and present some revenue neutral options for us to consider.

#### Tax Working Group – next steps

It’s important to note that the recommendations of the independent Tax Working Group are not binding on the Government.

The Government will need to review the report thoroughly and seek advice from Treasury and Inland Revenue before making any decisions.

But just be aware: there is a substantial process that includes Cabinet approval of any recommendations, let alone the legislative process framework before anything can be implemented.

The Government expects to release a full response in April 2019 following detailed discussions with officials and consultation between Government parties.

If the Government does decide to make changes to the tax system, these changes will be made by introducing legislation.

This means the changes will go through a full select committee process, where members of the public will have the opportunity to submit on and influence the shape of the Bill.

Any changes will not come into force before 1 April 2021, after the next election. This gives New Zealanders the chance to vote on any decisions made by the Government.

In a number of areas, the Government is already taking steps in the direction suggested by the Group, such as collecting GST on low value goods.

The Government will be listening to further feedback on the issues raised in the report.

#### The tax policy work programme

We’re staring down the barrel of another hefty work programme this year.

You will already be aware that fairness underpins this Government’s tax policy work programme, and we have in train a number of tools to achieve our desired fairness outcomes.

These include the Tax Working Group, the Welfare Expert Advisory Group, and a number of taxation bills currently in the House.

We also support the capability uplift Inland Revenue is driving through its business transformation programme which still has several years of changes to design and implement, which I’ll talk more about later. 

#### Measures already taken

The Government has already taken a number of steps to support families, increase the fairness of the tax and transfer system, and ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share of tax.

In late 2017, through the Families Package, the Government has provided targeted assistance for low and middle-income families with children through a suite of measures including Best Start, increased Paid parental leave and family tax credits.

In March last year we also extended the bright line test to five years in order to better ensure that speculators pay tax on the capital gains they make on their property investments.

Then in July, we enacted legislation to restrict the ability for multinationals to use base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tactics to reduce the tax they pay in New Zealand and globally.

#### Loss ring-fencing

In terms of what we’ve got on the boil, we’ve introduced legislation to ring-fence residential rental property losses. Currently, investors with loss-making rental properties can reduce tax on other income, which helps them outbid owner-occupiers for properties. Yet these investors often make tax-free capital gains when these properties are sold.

In conjunction with the extension to the bright-line test, ring-fencing losses from rental properties would level the playing field between property investors and home buyers.

#### The digital economy / international work

As announced recently, we’ll be putting more focus into international issues as the challenges facing the taxation of digital services ramp up at OECD. 

There has been a lot of concern lately with the under-taxation of the digital economy.  I share this concern.  

The main issue is that the international income tax framework has not kept up with modern business practices, particularly digitalisation. Fixing this framework requires some level of international consensus.

Countries are trying to reach this agreement at the OECD.  There are 2 measures being developed.

First, a measure to allocate more taxing rights to market countries.  This would apply regardless of whether a multinational has a physical presence in the country.  There are 3 options being considered for this:

*   First, a limited option for digital services only, which is supported by the UK and Europe.
*   Second, a broader option, focussing on “market intangibles” created in a country by multinationals, which is supported by the United States.
*   Third, a new option focussing on the concept of a significant economic presence, which is supported by the G24 developing countries.

The second measure is a minimum tax on profits earned in low tax jurisdictions, which is supported by France and Germany. 

The OECD is aiming for G20 approval of its preferred proposals in June 2019 and countries have committed to reaching a consensus by 2020. We are hopeful that this can be achieved, but there are no guarantees.  There are still some countries that do not think any changes are necessary or want one kind of solution over another.

An increasing number of countries have decided not to wait for an OECD solution. They have adopted separate digital services tax, or DSTs, to tax the digital economy. 

India moved first, with the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Korea and Austria also recently announcing or enacting them.  The EU Commission has also proposed a DST for Europe, but it has not been able to achieve the support of all EU members yet.  Australia also recently consulted on the possibility of introducing a DST.

A DST would be repealed when an international solution is found, and the countries adopting them are still committed to an international solution.

New Zealand wants to make sure digital companies pay a fair amount of tax here. We are participating in the OECD discussions, and we prefer an internationally agreed solution. However, we also need to consider the desirability of a DST if this cannot be achieved. 

The discussion document we’ll release later this year will canvass all these issues and – importantly – will suggest how a Digital Services Tax is designed, should we need it. This is consistent with the Tax Working Group’s recommendation in this area.

#### Environmental taxation

Another area where I expect there will be a growing need to apply policy thinking and potential legislative change is around the environment. 

In its report, the Tax working Group has noted that New Zealand makes relatively little use of environmental taxes relative to other countries, and  believes that taxation could be used further to enhance environmental outcomes.

The Group has developed a policy framework for assessing when environmental taxes could be usefully applied.

The Government welcomes the development of this framework as a tool for delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes for New Zealand.

The Government also welcomes the Group’s efforts to highlight specific areas where there is greater scope to use environmental taxes (subject to further design work).

#### Charities

The Tax Working group has also taken an interest into how charities are taxed.

I’ve always been hot on this. I my mind, ensuring the tax obligations of charities’ commercial interests are treated appropriately is really important to the overall integrity of the tax system.

Giving tax breaks to some commercial operators (who have a charitable owner) and not others potentially has a distortionary effect on the market that they operate in, in that privately-owned entities often compete in the same space.

The Tax Working Group also picked up on this in their report.  They also note, however, that the underlying issue is the extent to which charitable entities are accumulating surpluses rather than distributing or applying those surpluses for the benefit of their charitable activities. 

This is a nuanced issue that the Government will need to work through as it looks to ensure charities are treated appropriately.

You might have noted that the Department of Internal Affairs released a discussion document last week.

The document is looking to modernise the Charities Act to ensure it works effectively for charities and the public. The document can be found on the DIA website.

I encourage you to submit on this document before the closing date of 30 April 2019.

#### Research and Development tax credit

At the other end of the delivery spectrum for 2019 is the R&D tax credit, which is being discussed right now in select committee.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee is, as we speak, considering submissions made on the Government’s R&D proposal.

I won’t go into great lengths retelling the story of the R&D tax credit. You’ll already know that the Government considers boosting R&D to be critical to boosting productivity.

The details that we’ve landed on reflect extensive consultation with the business community.

I cannot thank enough those of you that have engaged with the government while these policy proposals have been developed.

Earlier and broader consultation with key stakeholders has resulted in better policy outcomes, and this is an approach we intend to refine and take forward with other new tax policy.

We’re well aware of the potential pitfalls of an R&D tax credit. We know there’s a risk of businesses pushing the boundaries of what expenditure can be claimed as R&D, so I’m expecting officials to develop robust rules about how it can be used.

When it comes to implementation of the R&D scheme, however, we can learn a lot from Australia’s experience.

The Australian R&D Tax Credit was reviewed in 2016 and found not to be performing well. This led, in their 2018 Budget, to a reduction in the generosity of the scheme plus increased audits from the Australian Tax Office, in order to reduce expenditure on the scheme.

The consequences of moving from an educative stance to more audits are now playing out and there has been a lot of high-profile media coverage. This has focused on some firms having to pay back millions of dollars of credits as a result of the ATO overturning up to 4 years of claims that have been paid out.

It has also emerged that some practitioners have had to abridge their R&D practice because the ATO consider its advice to clients has been too aggressive.

There are a couple of lessons for New Zealand from this:

*   Frequent fine-tuning of a scheme is preferable to major changes, as the latter are unsettling and undermine business confidence. Within the NZ scheme, we have allowed for this through regular review and the ability to adjust the scheme via an Order in Council.
*   Early decisions on whether a firm is undertaking R&D is better than audits and overturning previous decisions after credits have been paid out. Consequently, we have included the in-year approval process.
*   Software is a challenging sector for distinguishing genuine R&D from non-R&D. The Schedules within the R&D Bill of ineligible activities include several software-related activities to provide clarity about what is and isn’t eligible.
*   Most evident though, is the importance of getting the practical details right from the start. This is an opportunity NZ has as it learns from other countries’ experiences.

#### Stewardship of the tax system

I also recognise that stewardship of the tax system is critical and this includes ensuring sufficient maintenance and remedial work is carried out. While we have continued undertaking maintenance initiatives, I recognise that we have probably undertaken less in this space given the prioritisation of new government tax policy and social policy work. 

This is an area that I am keen to prioritise. Despite the business of the tax policy work programme, we need to leave space to do the much needed repairs and maintenance.   

As well as the usual remedial fixes that address anomalies in current tax legislation, there will be items of more significance.

These include improvements to the treatment of Fringe Benefit Tax, closing a loophole on GST paid by non-profits on the sale of assets, and extending the roll-over relief for revenue account property affected by the 2010–11 Canterbury earthquakes.

#### Business Transformation

Running in parallel with the tax policy work programme, is Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation.

This is a huge programme of work that the Government is investing heavily in. I’m expecting three major outcomes to be delivered by 2021:

*   Firstly, increasing voluntary compliance by having a simpler tax system, which I expect will in turn reduce compliance costs for customers, particularly businesses and employers.
*   Secondly, making it easier and more efficient for Government to introduce policy change.
*   And lastly, having a more versatile tax system that can adapt better to changing ways of working and different sources of revenue

As Minister for Small Business I am especially keen to see Inland Revenue’s tax processes align better with business practices, to minimise the effort involved of all parties in meeting their tax obligations.

This Government firmly believes that managing tax obligations should be a by-product of normal processes, and not a process in itself.

Within the tax and business communities there is some understandable nervousness around Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver on such a massive programme, without sustaining disruption to its core operations.

I share some of that concern. The releases to date have not been without their challenges.

I know Naomi and her team have learnt a lot from previous stages in the transformation and I’ve been impressed with how Inland Revenue has put these lessons into practice.

Naomi assures me that Inland Revenue is in a strong position to implement the upcoming changes and support its customers (New Zealand’s taxpayers) through the transition.

We need to be realistic though. Given the scale of the changes that are being introduced this year some disruption is to be expected

But rest assured, the transformation programme will deliver long-term benefits for all New Zealanders – individuals, business and intermediaries alike – and future-proof our tax system for generations to come.

#### Release 3 of IR’s Business Transformation

This year, Inland Revenue will implement the next phase of its improvements designed to make tax easier and more certain.

These improvements will build on recent changes for businesses and tax agents and will focus on simplifying income tax, particularly for individuals.

This phase is inarguably the biggest and most complex in Inland Revenue’s transformation to date. It will change the way that every New Zealander interacts with the tax system.

In preparation for this release, Parliament is considering or has already passed  legislation that will mean that from April this year:

*   approximately three million people will have a simplified end-of-year process for income tax;
*   all of New Zealand’s 200,000 employers will need to file PAYE information about their employees each payday; and
*   the filing of investment income information will become more regular – on a voluntary basis from April 2019, before becoming mandatory in April 2020.

Taxpayers and businesses will be able to see – and, where necessary, file – for all tax types online and see more information more clearly.

We acknowledge the level of change for corporate taxpayers – including the fact that some businesses will need to make changes to their own systems and processes – but are confident in the long-term benefits of the transformation more broadly.

The benefits to the economy are undeniable.

*   Firstly, Inland Revenue will receive more timely and accurate information, which they can then use to better calculate customers' tax and entitlements.
*   And secondly, businesses, tax agents and other intermediaries will benefit from a more integrated tax system that saves them time and relieves some of the compliance burden.

Let’s not understate this. Inland Revenue will be using more data in a smarter way, to ensure all New Zealanders meet their tax obligations as quick and painlessly as possible, whilst ensuring they receive the entitlements they’re eligible for.

I’ll be the first to say that the transformation journey is not an easy one – nor could it ever be given the scale of the changes we’re implementing.

Inland Revenue is about halfway through the transformation journey, and I’m pleased with what has been achieved so far, and have confidence in what will be achieved next.

The programme of transformation will continue through until 2021, at which point all New Zealanders – individuals, families, businesses and tax intermediaries alike – will see and experience a very different Inland Revenue.

And importantly for Government, we will be in a better position to introduce policy changes quickly and efficiently – allowing us to better respond to an ever-changing global environment and economy.

#### Conclusion

So 2019 is a year of delivery for this Government, and the tax space is very much at the forefront of that as we look to make the tax system fairer, and simpler for all businesses and taxpayers.

I look forward to working with you on these changes. Your input into all these changes is highly valued both in the policy development stage and at select committee. Your input makes the policies better. So thank you for all your efforts on all the policies.

Thank you.

Tax bill passes third reading
=============================

The [Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill](/bills/52-72)
 passed its third reading yesterday, and will come into effect on 1 April 2019.

Among a host of important improvements to the Tax Administration and Income Tax Acts, the Bill simplifies how tax is assessed for Individuals by issuing tax refunds automatically. Around 750,000 extra taxpayers will likely get a refund. These new processes, when implemented, will particularly benefit those who work extra jobs and have paid too much secondary tax during the year.

The new legislation also adds two new employee\* contribution thresholds to KiwiSaver (6% and 10%), and opens the scheme up to over 65s.

For more information see the Minister of Revenue's [media statement](/news/2019/2019-03-13-tax-bill-passes-third-reading#statement)

### An end to unnecessary secondary tax

Workers who are paying too much tax because of incorrect secondary tax codes are in line for relief with the passage of legislation through Parliament late last night.

The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill passed its third reading and will come into effect on 1 April.

“We promised to eliminate unnecessary secondary tax for workers with more than one job. We are delivering on that promise,” says Revenue Minister Stuart Nash. “I am disappointed that National and Act voted against this measure.

“The changes mean Inland Revenue will more closely monitor the tax paid by wage and salary earners through the year. If it appears the worker is being over taxed, Inland Revenue will suggest a more suitable PAYE tax code tailored to that worker.

“Till now the tax on the second job has often seemed too high. These changes ensure wage and salary earners are only paying the tax they should. Just under 600,000 secondary tax codes are used every year.

“Inland Revenue will also make it easier for individuals to apply for tailored tax codes that suit their earning circumstances, and provide an online process to apply for the codes.

“The legislation also enables automatic tax refunds for about 750,000 New Zealanders every year.

“The simplified tax rules remove the need for people who only earn employment or investment income to file a personal tax summary (PTS) to get a tax refund. Till now, the only way to get a refund was to file a PTS. However 750,000 people failed to do so and miss out on their money as a result. We want refunds to flow automatically.

In other changes, the legislation will:

*   add new KiwiSaver contribution rates of 6% and 10% and make the savings scheme accessible to those aged over 65;
*   allow depreciation roll-over relief for properties affected by the Canterbury earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. This extends the deadline for obtaining the replacement property from the end of the 2018–19 income year to the end of the 2023–24 income year;
*   allow new racehorse investors to claim tax deductions if they purchase a standout yearling;
*   grant overseas donee status to the New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust, Le Quesnoy, to raise awareness of New Zealand’s participation in and contribution to the First World War;
*   clarify how Inland Revenue can collect, use and disclose taxpayer information;
*   introduce a ‘short process ruling’ where small businesses can more easily apply for a binding ruling from Inland Revenue on any tax matter;
*   set the annual tax rates for the 2018-19 tax year, which remain unchanged from previous tax years.
*   address unintended gaps in the current law governing the tax treatment of non-for-profit-entities;
*   exempt directly funded disability support payments from income tax; and
*   ensure that the company demerger rules are effective in providing tax relief for New Zealanders who receive shares because of a demerger by an ASX listed Australian company.

“This Bill represents a significant step in the modernisation and simplification of New Zealand’s tax system, supporting much of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation work,” Mr Nash says.

### Govt responds to Tax Working Group report

The Coalition Government today released its response to the recommendations of the independent Tax Working Group report.

The report found that on the whole New Zealand’s tax system was working well, but made a number of recommendations to improve fairness, balance and structure.

The Government is not adopting any of the recommendations on capital gains taxation and has agreed no further work is necessary on that aspect of the report.

“The final report covered all aspects of the tax system, and a number of the recommendations will now be considered for inclusion in the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme,” Grant Robertson said.

“That includes exploring options for targeting land speculation and land banking.

“We intend to direct the Productivity Commission to include vacant land taxes within its inquiry into local government funding and financing,” Grant Robertson said.

“Officials have been directed to prioritise work on the TWG’s recommendations on ways to encourage investment in significant infrastructure projects and improve the integrity of the tax system to crack down on tax dodgers,” Stuart Nash said.

A refreshed tax policy work programme will be released mid-year.

The Coalition Government reiterated it will not introduce resource rentals for water or a fertiliser tax in this term of Parliament.

Other priorities for the Government this year include progressing legislation for research and development tax incentives; GST on low-value goods from offshore suppliers; a discussion document on a digital services tax, and further work to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax.

Grant Robertson and Stuart Nash thanked the Tax Working Group members for their work

A summary of the Government’s responses to the recommendations is attached.

| 45  | Recommendations on personal tax are dependent on the objectives of the Government:<br><br>a) If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low income households, the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers.<br><br>b) If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low to middle income earners, such as full-time workers on the minimum wage, then changes to personal income taxation may be a better option. | It is proposed to not adopt any of the recommendations on capital gains taxation. As a result there is no revenue to recycle. Consequently **it is agreed no further work is necessary**. |
| 46  | Consider increases in the bottom threshold of personal tax to increase the progressivity of the personal tax system. |
| 47  | Consider combining increases in the bottom threshold with an increase in the second marginal tax rate. |
| 48  | If (47) is adopted, consider a reduction of the abatement rate of Working for Families tax credits to offset the impact of the increase. |
| 49  | Prefer increasing the bottom threshold to introducing a tax-free threshold. |
| 50  | Consider an increase in net benefit payments to ensure beneficiaries receive the same post-tax increase as other people on the same income. |
| 51  | Consider changes to tax rates and thresholds alongside any recommendations made by WEAG. |
| 52  | Do not reduce the top marginal tax rate because it is already low by international standards and it would not increase progressivity of the tax system. | **Endorse the TWG recommendation** |
| 53  | The TWG notes that many submissions called for increasing tax personal tax rates to make a material reduction in income equality through the personal tax system. These increases are precluded by the TWG’s Terms of reference and the TWG did not undertake an analysis of the options (and their effectiveness). | **Endorse the TWG recommendation** |
| **Future of work** |     |     |
| 54  | Support Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed, particularly expanding the use of withholding tax as far as practicable, including to platform providers. | **Note work already underway** – additional operational funding for Inland Revenue is being put towards increasing investigations capability, public awareness campaigns, and new policy initiatives.<br><br>Inland Revenue officials are undertaking targeted consultation on a number of proposals to expand the scope of the Schedular Payments rules and address non-compliance of self-employed workers. An update on this work will be provided in the second half of 2019. |

| 62  | Further action in relation to the hidden economy, including:<br><br>a) An increase in the reporting of labour income (subject to not unreasonably increasing compliance costs on business).<br><br>b) A review of the measures recently adopted by Australia in relation to the hidden economy, with a view to applying them in New Zealand.<br><br>c) The removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. | **Note work already underway** – see recommendation 54. |

| 65  | The establishment of a single centralised Crown debt collection agency to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. | Objectives may be better achieved through greater alignment of agency policies on debt prevention and collection. **Cross-agency advice should be sought.** |

Rec # Tax Working Group Final Report recommendation Government’s response Capital gains taxation 1, 2 The majority of the TWG recommends a broad extension of the taxation of capital gains. If a broad extension of capital gains taxation was adopted, the TWG recommends that it have the characteristics detailed in Volume II of the TWG report. Agree no further work required on these recommendations. The Government intends to explore options for taxing vacant land including as recommended by the TWG, directing the Productivity Commission to include vacant land taxes within its inquiry into local government funding and financing and seek a review of the current rules of taxing land speculators as a high priority for the work programme (TPWP).

These are no plans in this term of Parliament to introduce input-based instruments, including on fertiliser (i.e., a fertiliser tax). 12-15 Solid waste a) Supports the Ministry for the Environment’s review of the rate and coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy. b) Expand the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy. c) Reassess the negative externalities associated with landfill disposal in New Zealand to ascertain if a higher levy is appropriate. d) Review hypothecation of the Waste Disposal Levy to ensure funds are being used in the most effective way to move towards a more circular economy. Note work already underway – The Ministry for the Environment is currently reviewing the scope and rate of the Waste Disposal Levy. 16 Transport Supports current reviews by the Government and Auckland Council into introducing congestion pricing.

Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) 34 Consider restoring depreciation deductions for buildings if there is an extension of the taxation of capital gains (subject to fiscal constraints). To manage the fiscal costs, the Government could reinstate building depreciation on a partial basis for: a) seismic strengthening only; b) multi-unit residential buildings; or c) industrial, commercial, and multi-unit residential buildings. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) Consider seismic strengthening work as a high priority for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) 35 Consider tax measures that encourage building to higher environmental standards. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP, MBIE, and Ministry for the Environment) 36 Consider developing a regime that encourages investment into nationally-significant infrastructure projects. Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) 37 Examine the following options to reduce compliance costs: For immediate action: a) Increase the threshold for provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000 of residual income tax. b) Increase the closing stock adjustment from $10,000 to $20,000 - $30,000. c) Increasing the $10,000 automatic deduction for legal fees, and a potential expansion of the automatic deduction to other types of professional fees. d) Reduce the number of depreciation rates, and simplifying the process for using default rates.

Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) The Government’s response to the recommendations of the Tax Working Group 5 Rec # Tax Working Group Final Report recommendation Government’s response The Government should also review and explore opportunities to: n) Adjust the thresholds for unexpired expenditure, and for the write-off of low value assets. o) Help small businesses reduce compliance costs through the use of cloud-based accounting software. p) Consider compensation for withholding agents if additional withholding tax obligations are imposed. q) Review the taxation of non-resident employees. r) Review whether the rules for hybrid mismatches should apply to small businesses or simple business transactions. 38 Give favourable consideration to exempting the New Zealand Superannuation Fund from New Zealand tax obligations. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) – noting the significant economic and fiscal implications associated with this proposal. International income taxation 39 New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions on the future of the international tax framework. Note work already underway – New Zealand is currently participating in discussions at the OECD on the future of the international tax framework 40 The Government should stand ready to implement a digital services tax if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction, and if it is reasonably certain that New Zealand’s export industries will not be materially impacted by any retaliatory measures. Note work already underway – Officials have been directed to draft a discussion document on the options for taxing the digital economy that will come to Cabinet in May. 41 New Zealand should actively monitor developments and collaborate with other countries with respect to equalisation taxes. Note work already underway – as above 42 Ensure, to the extent possible, that our double tax agreements and trade agreements do not restrict our taxation options in these matters. Note work already underway – as above The Government’s response to the recommendations of the Tax Working Group 6 Rec # Tax Working Group Final Report recommendation Government’s response Retirement savings 43 Consider encouraging the savings of low-income earners by carrying out one or more of the following: a) Refund the Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) for KiwiSaver members earning up to $48,000 per annum. This refund would be clawed back for KiwiSaver members earning more than $48,000 per annum, such that members earning over $70,000 would receive no benefit. b) Ensure that a KiwiSaver member on parental leave would receive the maximum member tax credit regardless of their level of contributions. c) Increase the member tax credit from $0.50 per $1 of contribution to $0.75 per $1 of contribution. The contribution cap should remain unchanged. d) Reduce the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds (10.5% and 17.5%) by five percentage points each. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) This work would sit alongside the Government’s broader work on KiwiSaver, which includes the default provider review and a consideration of options to increase KiwiSaver uptake and contributions. 44 Consider ways to simplify the determination of the PIE rates (which would apply to KiwiSaver). Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) Personal income tax 45 Recommendations on personal tax are dependent on the objectives of the Government: a) If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low income households, the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers. b) If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low to middle income earners, such as full-time workers on the minimum wage, then changes to personal income taxation may be a better option. It is proposed to not adopt any of the recommendations on capital gains taxation. As a result there is no revenue to recycle. Consequently it is agreed no further work is necessary. 46 Consider increases in the bottom threshold of personal tax to increase the progressivity of the personal tax system. 47 Consider combining increases in the bottom threshold with an increase in the second marginal tax rate. 48 If (47) is adopted, consider a reduction of the abatement rate of Working for Families tax credits to offset the impact of the increase. 49 Prefer increasing the bottom threshold to introducing a tax-free threshold. 50 Consider an increase in net benefit payments to ensure beneficiaries receive the same post-tax increase as other people on the same income. 51 Consider changes to tax rates and thresholds alongside any recommendations made by WEAG. The Government’s response to the recommendations of the Tax Working Group 7 Rec # Tax Working Group Final Report recommendation Government’s response 52 Do not reduce the top marginal tax rate because it is already low by international standards and it would not increase progressivity of the tax system. Endorse the TWG recommendation 53 The TWG notes that many submissions called for increasing tax personal tax rates to make a material reduction in income equality through the personal tax system. These increases are precluded by the TWG’s Terms of reference and the TWG did not undertake an analysis of the options (and their effectiveness). Endorse the TWG recommendation Future of work 54 Support Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed, particularly expanding the use of withholding tax as far as practicable, including to platform providers. Note work already underway – additional operational funding for Inland Revenue is being put towards increasing investigations capability, public awareness campaigns, and new policy initiatives. Inland Revenue officials are undertaking targeted consultation on a number of proposals to expand the scope of the Schedular Payments rules and address non-compliance of self-employed workers. An update on this work will be provided in the second half of 2019. 55 Support the facilitation of technology platforms to assist the self-employed meet their tax obligations through the use of ‘smart accounts’ or other technology based solutions. Note work already underway – as above 56 Continue (through Inland Revenue’s current work) to use data analytics and matching information for specific taxpayers to identify underreporting of income. Note work already underway – as above 57 Review the current GST requirements for contractors who are akin to employees. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) 58 Align the definition of employee and dependent contractor for tax and employment purposes.

Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) 62 Further action in relation to the hidden economy, including: a) An increase in the reporting of labour income (subject to not unreasonably increasing compliance costs on business). b) A review of the measures recently adopted by Australia in relation to the hidden economy, with a view to applying them in New Zealand. c) The removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. Note work already underway – see recommendation 54. 63 That Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff.

### Issues paper on GST integrity open for feedback

Inland Revenue has released an issues paper on how to align an aspect of GST with international best practice and principles. Revenue Minister Stuart Nash is encouraging interested parties to make submissions by 28 June.

“New Zealand’s tax rules are held up internationally as a model for a good way to levy and collect a Goods and Services Tax or a Value Added Tax”, Mr Nash says. Ideally a GST or VAT should be broad-based with few exceptions and flexible enough to respond to changing circumstances and business models and commercial practices.

“Our system of GST works because of its simplicity and coherence. But that simplicity requires a lot of ongoing maintenance to keep pace with changes. For example the previous government introduced GST on services purchased online such as music streaming.

“This work is continuing and later this year I will launch public consultation on a range of other important maintenance issues. A current example is the loophole which allows special rules for telecommunications services.

“These are now out of step with the OECD’s guidelines for GST and VAT and for establishing taxing rights. This raises the possibility of a person either being taxed twice or not at all for using global roaming overseas.

“Inland Revenue has therefore released a consultation document which presents details on implementing proposals to align the GST treatment of most telecommunications services with the treatment of other remote services like digital downloads.

“Under the OECD’s best practice guidelines, a consumer’s usual place of residence is used to determine which country has the right to tax the consumption of remote services. This means a remote service should generally be subject to New Zealand GST when it is supplied to a New Zealand-resident consumer.

“The OECD guidelines define remote services as services where it is not necessary for the supplier and the consumer to be in the same place (for example, a digital download). The OECD’s definition of remote services is broad and includes telecommunication services.

“Therefore under these guidelines supplies of telecommunications services for example on international roaming services should be subject to GST when consumed by a New Zealand resident regardless of the consumer’s location. It would ensure services rules are consistent with international best practice such as the United Kingdom and European Union.

“New Zealand has already adopted rules in 2016 consistent with the guidelines for most remote services other than telecommunications services. But the 2016 changes did not make that final step regarding telecommunications services. This proposal would close that loophole and protect the coherence of the system.

“To ensure that our GST rules remain fit for purpose, we need to conduct ongoing maintenance and keep pace with best practice,” Stuart Nash says.

Consultation on taxing the digital services industry
====================================================

The Government is seeking public feedback on proposals to more effectively tax the digital economy in New Zealand. These are:

\- Changing the current international income tax rules, to allow more taxation in market countries. This option is currently being discussed by the OECD and the G20 group of large economies.

\- Applying a separate digital services tax to certain revenues earned by highly digitalised multinationals operating in New Zealand. The discussion document seeks feedback on how a DST might work in practise.

### Ensuring multinationals pay their fair share of tax

New Zealand is pushing on with efforts to ensure multinational companies pay their fair share of tax, with the release of proposed options for a digital services tax (DST).

In February Cabinet agreed to consult the public on the problem of multinational digital companies which do substantial business in this country but pay no tax on income or revenues.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Revenue Minister Stuart Nash today proposed two broad options to ensure offshore digital companies no longer enjoy tax breaks which are not available to local businesses.

“Our number one preference remains an internationally agreed solution through the OECD,” says Mr Robertson. “However if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year we need an interim solution. Other nations have already taken this step.”

“The UK has announced it will introduce a two percent DST from April 2020. Austria, the Czech Republic, France, India, Italy and Spain have also enacted or announced DSTs.

“We need to protect our economy and the integrity of our tax system. Modern business practices, digitalisation in particular, mean that a company can be significantly involved in the economic life of a country without paying tax on income or turnover.

“Multinational companies like social media platforms and e-commerce sites generate income through cross-border digital services rather than face-to-face retail,” says Mr Robertson.

The DST outlined in a discussion document released today would apply to:

*   platforms which facilitate the sale of goods or services between people, such as Uber and Airbnb and eBay;
*   social media platforms like Facebook;
*   content sharing sites like YouTube and Instagram; and
*   companies which provide search engines and sell data about users.

“A DST would be narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised business models. It would not apply to sales of goods or services, but to digital platforms who depend on a base of users for income from advertising or data.

“The value of cross-border digital services in New Zealand is estimated to be around $2.7 billion. The estimated revenue of a DST is between $30 million and $80 million, depending on the design,” Grant Robertson said.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the Tax Working Group concluded New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions but also stand ready to implement a DST if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction.

“The OECD is seeking approval for its digital economy work programme from the G20 group of large economies at a meeting in late June. The progress made at the OECD to date has not been sufficient to allay the concerns of several countries, who have announced or introduced DSTs as unilateral interim measures.

“Any DST in New Zealand would be an interim measure. The Government would look to repeal it if and when the OECD’s international solution was implemented,” says Mr Nash.

The two options are:

*   Changing the current international income tax rules, to allow more taxation in market countries.  This option is currently being discussed by the OECD and the G20 group of large economies.
*   Applying a separate DST of three per cent to certain revenues earned by highly digitalised multinationals operating in New Zealand. The discussion document seeks feedback on how a DST might work in practice.

“The Government is committed to future-proofing the tax system to ensure it can handle changes to how people work and how business is done,” Mr Nash says.

“The significance of the digital economy is only going to grow over the coming decades. We need to keep adapting to ensure multinationals who do business here are paying their fair share of tax.

“We’ve passed legislation to collect GST on remote services, and to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax if they have a physical presence in New Zealand, and we have legislation before parliament to ensure we collect GST on low-value imported goods,” says Mr Nash.

The discussion document can be found at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. Consultation closes on 18 July 2019.

### Compliance strengthened for property speculation

Inland Revenue is to gain greater oversight of land transfer information to ensure those buying and selling properties are complying with tax rules on property speculation.

Cabinet has agreed to implement recommendation 99 of the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) final report. It will require most people who buy and sell properties to supply their IRD number on land transfer documentation.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the TWG made the recommendation after hearing submissions on ways to improve the fairness, balance and structure of the tax system.

“Most people already provide their IRD number to Land Information NZ (LINZ) when buying and selling property, but there are some exemptions which are open to manipulation,” says Mr Nash.

“Up to one-third of land transfers are made without a record of the IRD number of the buyer or seller.

“Inland Revenue needs a complete picture of property transactions to determine if tax rules are being manipulated. The requirement for nearly all land transfers to include an IRD number is a small change but improves the overall integrity of the system.

“If a home owner regularly buys and sells their properties in a short time frame it suggests they are engaged in property speculation and are flipping properties with the intention of creating income.

“When the previous government introduced the bright line test in 2015, it made it clear that owner-occupiers with a regular pattern of buying and selling residential properties had to comply with the bright line rule in certain circumstances.

“If an owner-occupier buys and sells properties twice or more in two years, under existing law they are generally considered to be trying to manipulate the bright line test.

“The requirement to provide an IRD number on nearly all land transfers makes the rules easier to understand for everyone. It removes uncertainty around what information people need to provide when buying or selling a property.

“Capturing the relevant tax information for property sales will also help us work with jurisdictions in other countries to combat global tax evasion,” says Mr Nash.

A Supplementary Order Paper will be tabled today to make the change to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill currently before Parliament. It will apply from 1 January 2020.

A small number of land transfers do not require the provision of an IRD number. Examples include land transfers under a Treaty settlement or by a local authority.

### Fairer tax measures pass into law

Reforms to tax rules designed to ensure greater fairness in child support, retail trade, and residential investment have now passed into law.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 has today \[Wednesday 26 June 2019\] received the Royal Assent.

“One of the biggest changes will require offshore businesses that supply low-value goods to New Zealand to collect GST,” Mr Nash says.

“From 1 December offshore businesses who supply more than $60,000 of services and low-value goods per year will pass on GST directly to Inland Revenue.

“GST has always been payable on purchases from overseas but administration and collection costs have been prohibitive for Customs. The GST on goods valued above $1000 will continue to be collected by Customs at the border.

“The legislation ensures offshore suppliers are on a level playing field with domestic retailers. There are 26,000 small businesses in the retail sector employing more than 62,000 people. They are required to collect GST on their sales. The same requirement now applies to offshore retail giants.

“It is estimated the tightening of the GST system will collect approximately $126 million in revenue per year by 2022/23.

“The second major change means residential property investors no longer get a tax break by using losses from rental properties to offset tax on other sources of income, such as salary and wages. Those losses will now be ring-fenced to the property portfolio.

“Before now, investors with loss-making rental properties could subsidise part of the cost of their mortgages with reduced tax on other income. This helped them to outbid other home buyers for properties. Yet they often make tax-free capital gains when these properties are sold.

“The new law also provides greater oversight of land transfers to ensure those buying and selling properties are complying with tax rules on property speculation. It will require most people who buy and sell properties to supply their IRD number on transfer documentation.

“Other changes right a wrong which meant some people who became a parent as a result of sexual assault were forced to pay child support if the baby was cared for by others. People required to make such payments in the past may now qualify to be exempted from those payments, backdated to September 2006. This could mean they are eligible for a refund of any payments made.

“The exemptions and possible refunds are decided by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on a case by case basis.

“As well as these significant initiatives, the new law will enshrine the right of taxpayers to keep their tax records in te reo Māori.

“Inland Revenue has allowed taxpayers to keep records in te reo Māori for more than 20 years but this has never been enshrined as standard practice through legislation. The right to use te reo Māori should be officially recognised in the law rather than at the discretion of a Government department.

“Our revenue system enables vital public services to be funded, but it also needs to be fair in the way it is administered. These changes achieve that,” Mr Nash says.

### KiwiSaver tax rates addressed in law change

Inland Revenue will gain greater powers to alert savings providers if a KiwiSaver investor is on the wrong tax rate, under new legislation introduced to Parliament.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the administration of the tax system has markedly improved as a result of the new information technology project known as Business Transformation (BT).

“Stage three of BT rolled out in April and has given Inland Revenue greater insight into the status of taxpayers, in real time, throughout the year,” Mr Nash says.

“We propose to use that technology to make the system fairer. We want to ensure taxpayers receive their correct entitlements. We also want to make it easier for people to meet their tax obligations in a timely way.

“Currently KiwiSaver investors and others with savings in Portfolio Investment Entities must notify savings providers of their appropriate PIR tax rate (Prescribed Investor Rate). But many don’t do this and go on the default rate of 28 per cent. The tax paid is final and any overpayment cannot be refunded.

“The proposed law allows Inland Revenue to notify the provider to correct the PIR from 1 April 2020. Inland Revenue has also announced that from mid-July it will begin contacting taxpayers who are on the wrong rate. This could be the default rate which is too high for their circumstances.

“An estimated 550,000 people are on rates that are too low, and are underpaying their tax by an average of $80-90 per year. An estimated 950,000 people are on a PIR that is too high, and have overpaid tax by an average of $44 per year.

“Our tax system relies heavily on self-assessment. However we clearly need to make it easier for people to do this and help with financial literacy where we can. We want to make the tax system fairer, and that includes the way we administer it.

Mr Nash says other proposed changes in the omnibus tax bill address a range of remedial issues relating to KiwiSaver and student loan arrangements.

“When KiwiSaver was introduced in 2006, Inland Revenue’s systems could not easily calculate interest on employee contributions from their payday. Options were available but they would have imposed considerable compliance costs on employers.

“However the recent introduction of payday filing overcomes this obstacle. We propose that interest on both employer and employee contributions begins to accrue from payday, until the contributions are forwarded to the KiwiSaver scheme provider,” Mr Nash says.

The Bill also addresses the problem where some employers take too long to pass on their required KiwiSaver contributions to the IRD, which means investors miss out on valuable investment returns.

The bill proposes to allow Inland Revenue to pay some employers’ KiwiSaver contributions to scheme providers before the amount must be paid. This would align with the current practice for KiwiSaver employee contributions.

The legislation also makes a number of remedial changes to the student loan scheme to ensure people receive the correct entitlements and find it easier to meet their obligations.

Overseas-based borrowers who sustain a serious illness or disability and are unable meet their repayment obligations will not be subject to interest on their loan.

“We don’t want to add further to their stress by having a loan hanging over their heads accruing interest, so we’re proposing that people in this situation are treated as New Zealand-based borrowers,” Mr Nash says.

It also limits the changes in a borrower’s repayment obligations prior to 1 April 2013. This seeks to reduce the complexity of administering the regime. Borrowers will not be adversely affected by the changes.

| Land<br>---- |
| The current land rules will be reviewed, particularly in relation to investment property and speculators, land banking, and vacant land. The objective would be to recommend ways to improve the efficient use of land, and ensure that the current tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourages and supports productive investment. The review will also look at whether we can do anything more around enforcement of the current rules. It is unlikely that any significant reforms relating to vacant land and property would be feasible in the short term. However, in the short-term the Government could consider a number of measures aimed at improving the fairness and balance of the tax rules for land.<br><br>### Possible items that could be included in a short-term package<br><br>Measures to support efficient land use:<br><br>*   clarifying and tightening the rules for the deductibility of holding costs (e.g. rates and insurance) for land that is taxable on sale; and<br>*   consider ways to encourage seismic strengthening of residential property.<br><br>Measures to improve the integrity of the rules:<br><br>*   review the exemptions in the land rules, in particular the exceptions for developers and habitual renovators; and<br>*   review whether the apportionment rules for GST are working appropriately for mixed use land.<br><br>Measures to improve collection:<br><br>*   consider whether applying withholding tax on transactions involving New Zealand resident vendors is a better approach to collecting this revenue; and<br>*   improving information flows (including from LINZ) to assist compliance with the current land tax rules.<br><br>### Possible items that could be considered in a longer-run review<br><br>*   the Productivity Commission’s advice on the use of vacant land and property taxes to discourage land banking;<br>*   review whether the land rules, in particular the “10-year” rules, negatively impact the supply of land or create inefficient “lock-in effects”;<br>*   consider whether other tax measures could reduce speculation and improve the supply of land. This could include reviewing the scope of existing rules such as the bright-line test and ring-fencing, as well as looking at potential new taxes to help improve the supply of available housing;<br>*   consider whether withholding taxes might be appropriate for other taxable land transactions;<br>*   consider whether allowing losses on building disposals might improve the fairness and efficiency of the current land tax rules. This option may remove a potential distortion discouraging transactions that may result in capital losses – for example, the acquisition of earthquake prone buildings; and<br>*   review the provisional tax rules in light of bright-line income from land sales. |

Business
--------

Enhancing economic performance and minimising the tax system’s impact on businesses are priorities for the Government. Reducing compliance costs directly impacts on productivity (particularly of smaller firms) leaving them more time to focus on running their business, as well as continue to innovate and develop new opportunities. Increasing neutrality will also be a focus, ensuring that commercial decisions are not driven by tax whilst protecting the integrity of the tax base.

This workstream will focus on:

*   increasing integrity, fairness and the neutrality of the system;
*   lifting the economic performance of all businesses, especially smaller firms; and
*   ensuring compliance at a low cost to businesses.

This includes working with other Government agencies to ensure that items in this workstream support wider Government work on business.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ### Examples of items that could be considered for inclusion relating to businesses<br><br>TWG recommendations including:<br><br>*   seismic strengthening (note this also includes consideration of residential property);<br>*   loss carry forwards and trading when ownership changes; and<br>*   tax treatment of innovative spending (feasibility and blackhole expenditure). | ### Examples of items that could be considered for inclusion relating to small businesses<br><br>TWG recommendations including:<br><br>*   closely-held company issues;<br>*   compliance and enforcement issues;<br>*   simplifying FBT; and<br>*   tax disputes for small taxpayers. |
| Items already underway such as:<br><br>*   R&D;<br>*   purchase price allocation;<br>*   cross-border employment;<br>*   financial arrangement issues; and<br>*   other integrity issues. | Items already underway such as:<br><br>*   tax compliance for self-employed (accounts payable reporting);<br>*   considering issues around the sharing economy/platforms;<br>*   options for assisting businesses to become more digital; and<br>*   AIM review. |

|     |
| --- |
| Infrastructure<br>-------------- |
| Infrastructure is a key area of interest for the Government. It contributes to economic performance, and the Government is focussed on achieving better outcomes for infrastructure investment in New Zealand. Many of the changes being looked at are outside of the tax system, but the tax system may have to adapt to new arrangements. This project will consider whether the tax system should have a role in driving infrastructure investment.<br><br>The infrastructure project will:<br><br>*   respond to the Tax Working Group’s recommendation to consider developing a regime that encourages investment into nationally-significant infrastructure projects;<br>*   ensure that the tax system treats new institutional arrangements for infrastructure appropriately; and<br>*   consider consistency of revenue collection for infrastructure across Government. |

|     |
| --- |
| Information collection and use<br>------------------------------ |
| The effective use of information by Government is critical to the efficient delivery of Government services. The efficient and effective collection and use of information helps to ensure the tax system minimises compliance and administration costs, while also supporting and contributing to wider Government priorities. Better information also contributes to the integrity and fairness of the tax system and helps to ensure that the tax system can respond well to future challenges.<br><br>This package will consider:<br><br>*   overall data strategy for the collection and use of information;<br>*   information sharing agreements and development of more efficient ways to allow the sharing of information;<br>*   automatic exchange of information and country-by-country reporting consequential matters;<br>*   repeat collection of large datasets – reporting, consultation and regulation making processes; and<br>*   the collection and public release of information to support policy advice, evaluation and public debate on policy issues. |

|     |
| --- |
| Business Transformation (BT)<br>---------------------------- |
| We will continue to support Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Over the next 18 months, Inland Revenue will implement Release 4 of its BT programme (Student Loans and KiwiSaver) and commence design on Release 5 (Child Support).<br><br>Further, we envisage the BT policy work stream as identifying and developing policy proposals that leverage off and support the new tax and social policy system. This would include work on:<br><br>*   potential review of the prescribed investor rate (PIR);<br>*   taxation of lump sum payments such as ACC weekly compensation; and<br>*   other possible changes to:<br>*   withholding tax such as PAYE and RWT to minimise where possible any over- or under-withholding, and ensure that the amount of tax is about right; and<br>*   the tax products that have been deployed into START such as WfFTC to improve administration. |

|     |
| --- |
| Reforms and remedials<br>--------------------- |
| Many of the specific provisions in the Taxation Acts need to be regularly maintained or updated in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence or other factors. In addition, as Inland Revenue and taxpayers begin to apply new tax legislation we may identify legislative errors or unintended consequences which require remedial amendments.<br><br>These issues can create high compliance costs or inadvertent non-compliance so need to be addressed promptly to maintain the certainty, efficiency and fairness of the tax system.<br><br>Some examples of items include:<br><br>*   a GST issues paper to consult on various changes to ensure GST aligns with business practices and modern technology and to maintain the GST Act more generally;<br>*   review of donee status applications under schedule 32 (charities with activities outside New Zealand);<br>*   BEPS remedials; and<br>*   general maintenance and remedial work as issues arise. This includes an important stewardship role, looking ahead to issues that might arise and working with other agencies on Government measures that have tax or social policy implications. |

|     |
| --- |
| Social policy including Government response to Welfare Overhaul<br>--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This work stream includes policy work on:<br><br>*   the Government’s welfare overhaul work programme including:<br>*   reform of Working for Families;<br>*   child support pass-on; and<br>*   debt;<br>*   student loan scheme (non-BT work);<br>*   KiwiSaver – enhancing Trans-Tasman superannuation portability; and<br>*   other agency initiatives that impact on the tax or social policy system.<br><br>On the Government response to the welfare overhaul, officials are working closely with MSD and other agencies to develop a welfare package. This will take a phased approach given the complexity of the welfare system and the need to balance fiscal prudence with improving wellbeing and other high priority government objectives. |

|     |
| --- |
| Environment/Sustainable economy<br>------------------------------- |
| The Tax Working Group noted a range of areas where greater environmental taxation could be used to change behaviour and raise revenue. In response, this project will consider the Group’s framework for taxing negative environmental externalities. The Government decided not to advance specific environmental proposals raised by the Group beyond what is already on its work programme. However, this leaves scope for tax reforms for greenhouse gases, solid waste, water pollution, and congestion.<br><br>Tax policy officials will work with other agencies on environmental issues to provide environmental tax analysis and advise on tax implications of environmental policy. Key areas are:<br><br>*   Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) reform – specific issues include:<br>*   auctioning of units and hypothecation of revenue from the ETS;<br>*   options for including agricultural emissions in the ETS;<br>*   changes to the way that the ETS will apply to new forests; and<br>*   the introduction of an international scheme for air travel similar to the ETS;<br>*   the Water Taskforce is working to improve water quality and nutrient run-off;<br>*   the Ministry for the Environment is reviewing the Waste Disposal Levy to see how it can be increased and its coverage extended; and<br>*   the Auckland Council is working on congestion charging for the use of key roads in Auckland.<br><br>This project will include two further areas of work:<br><br>*   As part of the work on the environmental tax framework, consider how specific tax regimes, such as FBT, might be used to achieve positive environment outcomes (for example, FBT treatment of employer-provided public transport).<br>*   Review of industry-specific tax provisions impacting on natural capital. Petroleum mining will be the initial focus-industry in a series of reviews. We are currently considering issues relating to the timing of deductions for petroleum development expenditure and have completed the legislative changes for the time-limited non-resident oil-rig exemption. |

|     |
| --- |
| Tax exemptions<br>-------------- |
| The income tax legislation contains various exemptions from income tax, including income earned by charities and businesses run for charitable purposes, Local Authorities, Government entities often as public authorities, and Crown-controlled companies (in certain circumstances). In contrast state enterprises are subject to income tax and local council-controlled companies are also taxable. The overall treatment of these different entities is not completely consistent. There are an increasing number of requests for income tax exemptions, and a need to adopt a coherent framework to consider these requests.<br><br>The review will consider entity tax exemptions with a view to providing more consistency. It will consider:<br><br>*   how different entities fit within the Government’s public policy purposes;<br>*   the compliance costs and benefits;<br>*   fiscal implications; and<br>*   the impact of particular exemptions on competitive neutrality with the private sector. |

The Government’s tax policy work programme: 2019–20 August 2019 1 Land The current land rules will be reviewed, particularly in relation to investment property and speculators, land banking, and vacant land. The objective would be to recommend ways to improve the efficient use of land, and ensure that the current tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourages and supports productive investment. The review will also look at whether we can do anything more around enforcement of the current rules. It is unlikely that any significant reforms relating to vacant land and property would be feasible in the short term. However, in the short-term the Government could consider a number of measures aimed at improving the fairness and balance of the tax rules for land. Possible items that could be included in a short-term package Measures to support efficient land use: • clarifying and tightening the rules for the deductibility of holding costs (e.g. rates and insurance) for land that is taxable on sale; and • consider ways to encourage seismic strengthening of residential property. Measures to improve the integrity of the rules: • review the exemptions in the land rules, in particular the exceptions for developers and habitual renovators; and • review whether the apportionment rules for GST are working appropriately for mixed use land. Measures to improve collection: • consider whether applying withholding tax on transactions involving New Zealand resident vendors is a better approach to collecting this revenue; and • improving information flows (including from LINZ) to assist compliance with the current land tax rules. Possible items that could be considered in a longer-run review • the Productivity Commission’s advice on the use of vacant land and property taxes to discourage land banking; • review whether the land rules, in particular the “10-year” rules, negatively impact the supply of land or create inefficient “lock-in effects”; • consider whether other tax measures could reduce speculation and improve the supply of land. This could include reviewing the scope of existing rules such as the bright-line test and ring-fencing, as well as looking at potential new taxes to help improve the supply of available housing; • consider whether withholding taxes might be appropriate for other taxable land transactions; • consider whether allowing losses on building disposals might improve the fairness and efficiency of the current land tax rules. This option may remove a potential distortion discouraging transactions that may result in capital losses – for example, the acquisition of earthquake prone buildings; and • review the provisional tax rules in light of bright-line inco me fro m land sales. Business Enhancing economic performance and minimising the tax system’s impact on businesses are priorities for the Government. Reducing compliance costs directly impacts on productivity (particularly of smaller firms) leaving them more time to focus on running their business, as well as continue to innovate and develop new opportunities. Increasing neutrality will also be a focus, ensuring that commercial decisions are not driven by tax whilst protecting the integrity of the tax base. This workstream will focus on: • increasing integrity, fairness and the neutrality of the system; • lifting the economic performance of all businesses, especially smaller firms; and • ensuring compliance at a low cost to businesses. This includes working with other Government agencies to ensure that items in this workstream support wider Government work on business. Examples of items that could be considered for inclusion relating to businesses TWG recommendations including: • seismic strengthening (note this also includes consideration of residential property); • loss carry forwards and trading when ownership changes; and • tax treatment of innovative spending (feasibility and blackhole expenditure). Examples of items that could be considered for inclusion relating to small businesses TWG recommendations including: • closely-held company issues; • compliance and enforcement issues; • simplifying FBT; and • tax disputes for small taxpayers. Items already underway such as: • R&D; • purchase price allocation; • cross-border emplo yment; • financial arrangement issues; and • other integrity issues. Items already underway such as: • tax compliance for self-emplo yed (accounts payable reporting); • considering issues around the sharing economy/platforms; • options for assisting businesses to become more digital; and • AIM review. The Government’s tax policy work programme: 2019–20 August 2019 2 Infrastructure Infrastructure is a key area of interest for the Government. It contributes to economic performance, and the Government is focussed on achieving better outcomes for infrastructure investment in New Zealand. Many of the changes being looked at are outside of the tax system, but the tax system may have to adapt to new arrangements. This project will consider whether the tax system should have a role in driving infrastructure investment. The infrastructure project will: • respond to the Tax Working Group’s recommendation to consider developing a regime that encourages investment into nationally- significant infrastructure projects; • ensure that the tax system treats new institutional arrangements for infrastructure appropriately; and • consider consistency of revenue collection for infrastructure across Government. Information collection and use The effective use of information by Government is critical to the efficient delivery of Government services. The efficient and effective collection and use of information helps to ensure the tax system minimises compliance and administration costs, while also supporting and contributing to wider Government priorities. Better information also contributes to the integrity and fairness of the tax system and helps to ensure that the tax system can respond well to future challenges. This package will consider: • overall data strategy for the collection and use of information; • information sharing agreements and development of more efficient ways to allow the sharing of information; • automatic exchange of information and country-by-country reporting consequential matters; • repeat collection of large datasets – reporting, consultation and regulation making processes; and • the collection and public release of information to support policy advice, evaluation and public debate on policy issues. Business Transformation (BT) We will continue to support Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Over the next 18 months, Inland Revenue will implement Release 4 of its BT programme (Student Loans and KiwiSaver) and commence design on Release 5 (Child Support). Further, we envisage the BT policy work stream as identifying and developing policy proposals that leverage off and support the new tax and social policy system. This would include work on: • potential review of the prescribed investor rate (PIR); • taxation of lump sum payments such as ACC weekly compensation; and • other possible changes to: – withholding tax such as PAYE and RWT to minimise where possible any over- or under-withholding, and ensure that the amount of tax is about right; and – the tax products that have been deployed into START such as WfFTC to improve administration. Reforms and remedials Many of the specific provisions in the Taxation Acts need to be regularly maintained or updated in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence or other factors. In addition, as Inland Revenue and taxpayers begin to apply new tax legislation we may identify legislative errors or unintended consequences which require remedial amendments. These issues can create high compliance costs or inadvertent non-compliance so need to be addressed promptly to maintain the certainty, efficiency and fairness of the tax system. Some examples of items include: • a GST issues paper to consult on various changes to ensure GST aligns with business practices and modern technology and to maintain the GST Act more generally; • review of donee status applications under schedule 32 (charities with activities outside New Zealand); • BEPS remedials; and • general maintenance and remedial work as issues arise. This includes an important stewardship role, looking ahead to issues that might arise and working with other agencies on Government measures that have tax or social policy implications. Social policy including Government response to Welfare Overhaul This work stream includes policy work on: • the Government’s welfare overhaul work programme including: – reform of Working for Families; – child support pass-on; and – debt; • student loan scheme (non-BT work); • KiwiSaver – enhancing Trans-Tasman superannuation portability; and • other agency initiatives that impact on the tax or social policy system. On the Government response to the welfare overhaul, officials are working closely with MSD and other agencies to develop a welfare package. This will take a phased approach given the complexity of the welfare system and the need to balance fiscal prudence with improving wellbeing and other high priority government objectives. The Government’s tax policy work programme: 2019–20 August 2019 3 Environment/Sustainable economy The Tax Working Group noted a range of areas where greater environmental taxation could be used to change behaviour and raise revenue. In response, this project will consider the Group’s framework for taxing negative environmental externalities. The Government decided not to advance specific environmental proposals raised by the Group beyond what is already on its work programme. However, this leaves scope for tax reforms for greenhouse gases, solid waste, water pollution, and congestion. Tax policy officials will work with other agencies on environmental issues to provide environmental tax analysis and advise on tax implications of environmental policy. Key areas are: • Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) reform – specific issues include: – auctioning of units and hypothecation of revenue from the ETS; – options for including agricultural emissions in the ETS; – changes to the way that the ETS will apply to new forests; and – the introduction of an international scheme for air travel similar to the ETS; • the Water Taskforce is working to improve water quality and nutrient run-off; • the Ministry for the Environment is reviewing the Waste Disposal Levy to see how it can be increased and its coverage extended; and • the Auckland Council is working on congestion charging for the use of key roads in Auckland. This project will include two further areas of work: • As part of the work on the environmental tax framework, consider how specific tax regimes, such as FBT, might be used to achieve positive environment outcomes (for example, FBT treatment of employer- provided public transport). • Review of industry-specific tax provisions impacting on natural capital. Petroleum mining will be the init ial focus-industry in a series of reviews. We are currently considering issues relating to the timing of deductions for petroleum development expenditure and have completed the legislative changes for the time-limited non-resident oil-rig exemption. Tax exemptions The income tax legislation contains various exemptions from income tax, including income earned by charities and businesses run for charitable purposes, Local Authorities, Government entities often as public authorities, and Crown-controlled companies (in certain circumstances). In contrast state enterprises are subject to income tax and local council-controlled companies are also taxable. The overall treatment of these different entities is not completely consistent. There are an increasing number of requests for income tax exemptions, and a need to adopt a coherent framework to consider these requests. The review will consider entity tax exemptions with a view to providing more consistency. It will consider: • how different entities fit within the Government’s public policy purposes; • the compliance costs and benefits; • fiscal implications; and • the impact of particular exemptions on competitive neutrality with the private sector. Charities Government periodically reviews the charitable sector's use of what would otherwise be tax revenue, to verify that intended social outcomes are being achieved. This project will include a report to Ministers before the end of 2019 to address recommendations of the TWG. It will take into account DIA’s modernisation review of the Charities Act. On current timeframes, it is anticipated that high level policy decisions arising from DIA’s review will be made by Cabinet before the end of 2019, with detailed policy decisions to follow in the first half of 2020. The specific tax policy issues are: • accumulation (will require coordination with DIA); • business activity for significant charities (coordination with DIA); • deregistration tax; and • GST and not-for-profits (NFP). A second report to Ministers will outline other sector tax matters that could potentially be subject to policy change and sector consultation. For example: • imputation credit refundability; • tax rules for mutuals/the $1,000 NFP deduction threshold; • rules for donating trading stock; • removing out-of-date concessions; and • resetting donee concessions and clarifying the approach to social enterprises. Inland Revenue has consulted with DIA on these proposals and will be working with DIA on any po licy or regulatory impacts associated with these initiatives. This work is on-going. NFP/charity concessions interact with both local government settings and the Māori sector. International There has been recent and growing concern from Governments and the public about the low levels of income tax paid by digital companies (that is, companies operating through highly digitalised business models). Pressure has been building on the long-standing international income tax framework; and the OECD (including New Zealand) have undertaken to review the framework. This workstream will include: • reporting back on the digital service tax discussion document; • double tax agreement negotiations and assisting with free trade agreements; • mult i-lateral work (including the OECD working parties); and • follow-on work to monitor and adjust the BEPS measures enacted last year.

### Work programme confirms economic and social focus

The Government’s updated tax policy work programme continues the focus on productivity, growth and wellbeing outlined in Budget 2019, Revenue Minister Stuart Nash announced today.

The tax policy work programme (TPWP) required an update following the release of the Tax Working Group (TWG) report in April. The TPWP was last produced in May 2018.

“We are committed to the fundamental principles of a broad-based, low-rate system,” Mr Nash says. “The TWG found that on the whole, New Zealand’s tax system is working well. But we need ongoing improvements to maintain its integrity, fairness and neutrality.”

“The refreshed TPWP reflects the need to encourage productive investment and ensure the tax system remains sound. It highlights our intention to deal with land speculation and land banking. It prioritises the need to address tax barriers to investment in infrastructure and to reduce compliance costs for business.

“Our goal is to build a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy. The Wellbeing Budget signalled our plans to balance fiscal sustainability with long-term infrastructure investments and improvements in living standards.

“Our tax policy has a big role to play to encourage productivity and growth. It has a direct impact on the lives of New Zealand families and businesses. It touches on priority areas like housing supply and affordability, nationally significant infrastructure, retirement savings, charities, and making life easier for small businesses,” says Mr Nash.

The tax policy work programme is grouped under a number of workstreams reflecting the government’s priorities.  Key workstreams include:

*   **Land**  
    Policy work will continue the review of current land rules, particularly affecting investment property and speculation, land banking, and vacant land. It will ensure that the current tax settings are fair and encourage investment where it is most productive. Enforcement of the current tax rules is also a priority.
*   **Business**  
    The government is focussed on ways to enhance economic performance and minimise the impact of the tax system on businesses. This includes the tax treatment of spending on innovation. It covers feasibility and blackhole expenditure, or capital spending that is not otherwise deductible.  
    Work will also focus on minimising compliance cost for businesses; and lifting the economic performance of all businesses, especially smaller firms and the self-employed. It also considers employment matters in the face of the changing nature of work.
*   **International**  
    This work stream considers options for the digital economy and reflects growing public and government concern at the tax treatment of multinationals who earn income here. The Government has not made any decisions on whether to adopt a digital services tax. Its preference remains a multilateral approach through the OECD.
*   **Infrastructure**  
    Infrastructure is a key area of interest for the coalition government. After nine years of neglect, the need to fix our public assets is a long-term challenge.  
    This project will consider whether the tax system has a role driving infrastructure investment. We are determined to reverse the current infrastructure deficit.  This work supports our drive for a more modern, sustainable and climate resilient economy. It also contributes to unlocking the potential of our regions.
*   **Exemptions and charities**  
    We are driving a focus on consistency and coherence of our tax frameworks. This includes entities such as charities and businesses run for charitable purposes, as well as institutions like local authorities and state owned enterprises. It is important that income tax exemptions and concessions are effectively targeted.  
    The work programme also includes a charities workstream. This work links to the charities project underway at Department of Internal Affairs.
*   **Social policy**  
    This workstream supports the welfare overhaul including reform of Working for Families, the student loan scheme and KiwiSaver.

Mr Nash also confirmed an update to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) as recommended by the Tax Working Group.

“The GTPP allows people to participate at the front end of tax policy development. It helps ensure policy proposals are practical and workable while minimising compliance costs. The changes allow a greater level of engagement, in particular with Maori interests. This will be good for our tax system, our economy and our communities,” Mr Nash says.

### Business tax changes back Kiwi companies to innovate and grow

*   Government removes key barrier to business innovation with new tax incentive
*   New rules backing start-ups to get off the ground and attract investment
*   Economic Plan focusses on a more productive, sustainable, inclusive economy

The Coalition Government is backing Kiwi companies to innovate and grow by making it easier to invest in new assets and business models, and giving start-ups a better shot at success.

As part of the release of the Government’s [Economic Plan](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/govt-plan-productive-sustainable-and-inclusive-economy)
, Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Minister for Small Business and Revenue Stuart Nash today announced the removal of two barriers to expansion faced by businesses.

“At present, the costs associated with exploring whether to invest in a new asset or business model are often not deductible for tax purposes. Business owners tell us this can deter them from spending money looking at better ways of doing things,” Grant Robertson says.

“We’re changing this so businesses can deduct ‘feasibility expenditure’ from their tax bills, including for projects that don’t end up going ahead.

“This is about creating an environment where businesses are encouraged to innovate and become more productive – even if some of these ideas don’t work out,” Grant Robertson says.

Stuart Nash says the current rules are particularly problematic for infrastructure companies, meaning this change will help unlock investment.

“To keep it simple and reduce compliance costs, particularly for small and medium businesses, we’re proposing that qualifying expenditure totalling less than $10,000 be deductible immediately. Deductions will be able to be spread over five years.

“Public consultation has already been held on this and feedback has been supportive, indicating the proposal could have great benefits to the economy.”

This measure will be included in a taxation bill to be introduced into Parliament early next year, meaning the change can kick in from the start of the next tax year.

The second proposal announced today will change New Zealand’s ‘loss continuity rules’ to make it easier for start-ups to attract investment and get off the ground.

As the rules currently stand, a firm that suffers a loss one year can use that loss to reduce its taxable income in the future, but the rules do not work well for start-ups who are trying to attract new investment.

As these start-ups attract new investment they often breach the threshold under which they can continue to use these losses.

“Business and tax experts will be consulted on the proposals later this year, along with a review of the existing R&D tax loss cash out rules. This is the normal process for tax policy changes,” Stuart Nash says.

The changes announced today as part of the Government’s Economic Plan build on initiatives already announced. These include a $1 billion investment for R&D tax incentives, record transport infrastructure investment, boosts to apprenticeships and trades training, and changes to immigration settings to make it easier for businesses to access the workers they need.
CIR v ROBERTS \[2019\] NZCA 654 \[17 December 2019\] IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW ZEALAND I TE KŌTI PĪRA O AOTEAROA CA560/2018 \[2019\] NZCA 654 BETWEEN COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE Appellant AND NANCY LOIS ROBERTS Respondent Hearing: 29 October 2019 Court: Clifford, Goddard and Stevens JJ Counsel: A B Goosen and C M Kern for Appellant J H Coleman for Respondent Judgment: 17 December 2019 at 3.30 pm JUDGMENT OF THE COURT A The appeal is dismissed. B The appellant must pay the respondent costs for a standard appeal on a band A basis and usual disbursements. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ REASONS OF THE COURT (Given by Stevens J) Introduction \[1\] The question in this appeal is whether forgiveness of a debt owed to the donor by a charity qualifies as a “charitable or other public benefit gift” under s LD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA 2007) with the consequence that the donor is entitled to a tax credit under the section. \[2\] The answer depends on the meaning of “charitable or other public benefit gift” in s LD 3 of the ITA 2007 as defined at the relevant times. In dispute are the 2011 to 2015 tax years, during which period the respondent, Mrs Roberts, made annual gifts to a charitable trust by mean of deeds of gift. \[3\] The wording in s LD 3(1)(a) of the ITA Act 2007 was amended for the 2014 and 2015 years with the result that we are required to interpret the meaning of the following words: (a) “a gift of $5 or more that is paid” (for the 2011 to 2013 years); and (b) “a monetary gift of $5 or more that is paid” (for the 2014 and 2015 years). 1 Factual background \[4\] The facts behind this disputed question of interpretation are not in issue. Mrs Roberts and her late husband had in 2007 established the Oasis Charitable Trust (the Trust) which was registered with the Charities Commission. Mr and Mrs Roberts lent $1,708,080.90 to the Trust in October 2008. \[5\] Mrs Roberts stated in her affidavit evidence in the High Court that she later forgave some of the debt due to her in the 2011 to 2015 income years as follows: Date Amount 30 March 2011 $38,400 30 March 2012 $45,270 28 March 2013 $65,272 28 March 2014 $60,418 31 March 2015 $65,372 Total $274,732 \[6\] By way of example, the forgiveness of debt for the tax year ended 31 March 2011 was implemented by Mrs Roberts executing a deed of gift, which 1 Section LD 3 was subsequently retrospectively amended on 18 March 2019 with effect from 1 April 2008, but the amendment does not apply to this case. provided that “the Donor \[does hereby\] freely give and release unto the Donee the sum of \[$38,400 and does reduce\] the liability of the Donee to the sum of \[$820,064.50\] as from the date hereof”. Subsequently, Mrs Roberts filed a charitable tax credit claim form in respect to the $38,400 gift to the Trust claiming a tax credit of $12,799.98. \[7\] Mrs Roberts stated in her evidence that the total tax credits for the amounts forgiven were claimed by her for the relevant income years as follows: Income year ended Amount 31 March 2011 $12,799.98 31 March 2012 $15,089.99 31 March 2013 $21,757.31 31 March 2014 $20,139.31 31 March 2015 $21,791.65 Total $91,577.24 \[8\] Mr Roberts died in September 2011 and Mrs Roberts received payment from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) of the donations tax credits for the forgiveness of debt (as well as for some other cash donations which are not in issue) in each of the five years by direct credit to her bank account. \[9\] Following an investigation, the Commissioner issued a notice on 4 May 2016 requiring repayment by Mrs Roberts of the previously paid tax credits relating to the forgiveness of debt. This amounted to a disputable decision that is not an assessment under s 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). This resulted in a disputes process under Part 4A of the TAA. Following completion of the disputes process, the Commissioner’s Disputes Review Unit confirmed the Commissioner’s disputable decision. Mrs Roberts successfully challenged that ruling in the High Court. 2 High Court judgment \[10\] In the High Court it was common ground between the parties that “monetary” is not a defined term for the purposes of s LD 3. 3 Counsel also accepted that “money” 2 Roberts v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2153 at \[76\]. 3 At \[16\]. “Money” is defined in s YA 1, but this definition is not applicable for the purposes of s LD 3. is an imprecise term, the meaning of which depends on the context in which it is used. 4 Counsel disagreed, however, on whether “monetary” was simply synonymous with “money” in a narrow sense (e.g. cash or the like, such as payments by cheque, electronic funds transfer, credit card or debit card), or whether it had a wider meaning. 5 \[11\] After considering the legislative history, Parliament’s purpose and the statutory context, Cull J preferred the submission on behalf of Mrs Roberts that “monetary” is a broader concept than “money” in the form of cash. 6 The Judge’s reasoning is conveniently summarised thus: \[43\] There is no discernible difference between the kind of debt and credit relationship that occurs when dealing with a bank account, whether by internet banking or by cheque, and the similar kind of debt and credit relationship between a debtor and creditor. In both cases, the content of the gift is denominated in terms of money. The value of the gift is the monetary figure that is credited to the recipient. No complicated valuation issues arise in the typical case. It is for this reason that I prefer the meaning of “monetary” advanced by Mr Coleman, namely, that “monetary” has a broader meaning than “money” in the form of cash. \[44\] To the extent there might be difficult questions to answer in cases where the charitable organisation has become insolvent, those are best left to be dealt with on the facts of a suitable case, if and when one arises. Certainly, this issue is not sufficiently concerning, to detract from the conclusion I have otherwise reached on the appropriate meaning of “monetary”. \[12\] The Judge held there was no question that the forgiveness of debt to the Trust met the definition of gift and that the gifts were for an amount of more than $5 in each year. 7 Moreover, the recipient of the gifts was a charitable trust as required by s LD 3. 8 Given those findings, the only question was whether the gifts, in the form of forgiveness of debts, were monetary gifts. 9 On this point, the Judge concluded: \[74\] I have reached the view that a monetary gift of “$5 or more” does not require a cash payment. Consistent with the policy approach to the legislative amendment, it must be a gift that is sum specific, not a chattel or property item of uncertain value. It must pertain to money, which includes not only actual cash, but a credit of a specified amount, such as a forgiveness of debt. I also 4 At \[16\]; relying on the dictum of Tipping J in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Thomas Cook (NZ) Ltd \[2003\] 2 NZLR 296 (CA) at \[62\]. 5 Roberts v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, above n 2, at \[19\]. 6 At \[40\]. 7 At \[72\]. 8 At \[72\]. 9 At \[73\]. accept that payment can be effected by the crediting and debiting of accounts that is involved in giving effect to a reduction of debt. \[13\] On that basis, the Judge upheld Mrs Roberts’ challenge and directed the Commissioner to alter the disputable decision to conform with the decision of the High Court upholding the tax credits. 10 \[14\] Before us, Mr Coleman for Mrs Roberts, in general terms supported the Judge’s reasoning. In his oral submissions he addressed a small number of the submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner. These submissions are reflected later in this judgment. Submissions on behalf of the Commissioner \[15\] For the Commissioner, Mr Goosen submitted that the High Court erred in holding that a forgiveness of debt is a charitable or other public benefit gift under s LD 3(1)(a). While a forgiveness of debt can undoubtedly be a gift at common law, it is not a gift that qualifies as a charitable or other public benefit gift under s LD 1. \[16\] Mr Goosen submitted such a conclusion followed for two main reasons. First, on a proper interpretation, s LD 1 read with s LD 3(1) requires the gift to be a gift of money in the form of cash, or the like. A release of an obligation to repay money is not a gift of money. Mr Goosen cited Mills v Dowdall, a decision of this Court said to be authority for the proposition that a forgiveness of a debt does not result in the acquisition of any property by the person forgiven. 11 Where there is a forgiveness of a debt, the gift is the extinguishment of a liability to repay money. \[17\] Second, there are compelling extrinsic interpretative aids that show it was Parliament’s purpose that the gift must involve a transfer of money from the donor to the donee, and a forgiveness of a debt was not intended to qualify. The purpose of Parliament’s policy was a desire to avoid: 10 At \[76\]–\[77\]. 11 Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA) at 156 per Cooke J. (a) the difficulty of valuing non-cash donations, which could result in tax avoidance; and (b) significant compliance and administrative costs. 12 \[18\] He submitted these difficulties would arise in relation to forgiveness of debt. For example, if a debt is owed to a taxpayer by an insolvent charity, that debt is worth less than its face value to the taxpayer: forgiveness of that debt does not cost the taxpayer the face value of the forgiven debt, so should not attract a tax rebate based on its face value. \[19\] Ms Kern submitted that initially gifts of “money” meant gifts of cash. The subsequent legislative history of ss LD 1 and LD 3, comprising three government discussion documents demonstrated, she submitted, that Parliament did not intend there to be a change when the word “money” was omitted from s LD 3(1)(a). Thus, the phrase “a gift of $5 or more” was intended by Parliament to have the same meaning as a gift “of money of $5 or more” (in s KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (the ITA 2004)), that is, cash or the like. \[20\] Moreover, when the phrase “a gift of $5 or more” was replaced from 27 February 2014 with the phrase “a monetary gift of $5 or more”, Parliament did not intend any change of meaning. Thus, at all times the statutory intention was that the gift must be a gift of money which Ms Kern submitted meant “cash transfers of money from a donor to a donee”. The statutory scheme \[21\] Section LD 1 of the ITA 2007 allows a person who makes a “charitable or other public benefit gift” to have a tax credit in the tax year in which the gift is made. 13 At all relevant times s LD 1 stated: 12 Citing Michael Cullen and Peter Dunne Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations: a government discussion document (Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, October 2006). 13 Section LD 1 is subject to some specified exclusions in s LD 2, but none apply in this case. LD 1 Tax credits for charitable or other public benefit gifts Amount of credit (1) A person who makes a charitable or other public benefit gift in a tax year and who meets the requirements of section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has a tax credit for the tax year equal to the amount calculated using the formula in subsection (2). Formula (2) The formula referred to in subsection (1) is— total gifts x 33⅓%. Definition of item in formula (3) In the formula, total gifts means the total amount of all charitable or other public benefit gifts made by the person in the tax year. Administrative requirements (4) Despite subsection (1), the requirements of section 41A are modified if a tax agent applies for a refund under that section on behalf of a person, and— (a) the tax agent sees the receipt for the person’s charitable or other public benefit gift; and (b) the person retains the receipt for 4 tax years after the tax year to which the claim relates. Refundable credits (5) A credit under this section is a refundable tax credit under section LA 7 (Remaining refundable credits: tax credits under social policy schemes) and is excluded from the application of sections LA 2 to LA 6 (which relate to a person’s income tax liability). \[22\] The relevant part of the definition of “charitable or other public benefit gift” is set out in s LD 3(1)(a). As noted the section was amended, as from 27 February 2014, by substituting “monetary gift” for “gift”. Prior to its amendment, and applicable to the 2011 to 2013 tax years, s LD 3(1)(a) stated: LD 3 Meaning of charitable or other public benefit gift Meaning (1) For the purposes of this subpart, a charitable or other public benefit gift— (a) means a gift of $5 or more that is paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, described in subsection (2) or listed in schedule 32 (Recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts): ... \[23\] In respect of donations made in the 2014 and 2015 income years, s LD 3(1)(a) stated: LD 3 Meaning of charitable or other public benefit gift Meaning (1) For the purposes of this subpart, a charitable or other public benefit gift— (a) means a monetary gift of $5 or more that is paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, described in subsection (2) or listed in schedule 32 (Recipients of charitable or other public benefit gifts): ... Our analysis \[24\] As the issue in this case involves a question of statutory interpretation, we apply s 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 which says the text of the statutory provision and its purpose will determine the correct interpretation. However, as the Supreme Court has said, even if the meaning of the text may appear plain in isolation of purpose, it is necessary to cross-check that meaning against its purpose to observe the dual requirements of s 5. 14 When considering purpose, in addition to legislative context, the social, commercial or other objectives of the enactment may be relevant. 15 Where the meaning of the provision is not clear, context and purpose will become essential guides to meaning. 16 The words used \[25\] Section LD 3(1)(a) uses the words “a gift of $5 or more that is paid” (for the 2011 to 2013 years), and, “a monetary gift of $5 or more that is paid” (for the 2014 and 2015 years). The words “gift” and “monetary” are not defined in the ITA 2007 for s LD 3. There is a broad definition of the word “money” in s YA 1, 14 Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767 at \[22\]. 15 At \[22\]. 16 At \[24\]. but the parties agree it does not apply to s LD 3. 17 The first step therefore is to consider the ordinary meaning of the words “monetary” and “money”. \[26\] First, we will deal with the meaning of the word “pay” because s LD 3 requires a gift to be “paid”. The word “paid” is not defined in the ITA 2007, but the word “pay” is defined in s YA 1, subject to the usual proviso that the definition applies “unless the context requires otherwise”. Under s 32 of the Interpretation Act, a different grammatical form of a word that is defined in an enactment has a corresponding meaning in the same enactment. \[27\] The word “pay” is defined in s YA 1 of the ITA 2007 as follows: pay,— (a) for an amount and a person, includes— (i) to distribute the amount to them: (ii) to credit them for the amount: (iii) to deal with the amount in their interest or on their behalf, in some other way: ... \[28\] The word “amount” (used in the definition of “pay”) is also defined in s YA 1 of the ITA 2007 and “includes an amount in money’s worth”. The term “money’s worth” is not defined in the ITA 2007. At common law it generally has a narrow meaning for income tax purposes: 18 \[Money’s worth\] had generally been defined \[by the courts in the context of income tax legislation\] to mean that which is convertible into cash so as to have a monetary equivalent ... \[29\] Mr Goosen accepted that if the forgiveness of a loan was money’s worth, then it is possible to interpret a forgiveness of debt as having been paid because, when Mrs Roberts executed the deeds of gift, the Trust was credited with the amount of 17 The definition of money in s YA 1 of the ITA 2007 includes “the right to money including the deferral or cancellation of some or all of an obligation to pay money”. This definition applies only to s GB 48 of the financial arrangements rules. 18 Susan Glazebrook and others The New Zealand Accrual Regime — a practical guide (2nd ed, CCH New Zealand Ltd, Auckland, 1999) at 25–26. the debt that was forgiven. However, he submitted the definition only applies if the context does not require otherwise. Thus, he accepted that whether the definition of the word “paid” in s YA 1 applies to s LD 3 turns on whether Parliament intended a forgiveness of debt to qualify as a gift under s LD 3. “Monetary” and “money” \[30\] Therefore the key words for present purposes are “monetary” and “money”. Counsel cited various dictionary definitions of both words. We start with “monetary”. \[31\] “Monetary” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as: 19 Monetary ... adj. relating to money or currency. Black’s Law Dictionary defines “monetary” as: 20 1. Of, relating to, or involving money ... 2. Financial ... \[32\] We consider that, for the purposes of s LD 3(1)(a), monetary is intended to carry the meaning “of or pertaining to money”. We agree with Mr Coleman that the reason Parliament inserted the qualifier “monetary” into the section for the 2014 year onwards, was to exclude a gift of, say, land or chattels (such as a car) or services. \[33\] The word “money” is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary as follows: 21 1. The medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a government as part of its currency; ... 2. Assets that can be easily converted to cash ... 3. Capital that is invested or traded as a commodity ... 4. Funds; sums of money ... \[34\] “Money” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as: 22 money ... n. a medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes. ... wealth or financial gain. 19 Angus Stevenson and Maurice Waite (eds) Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) at 923. 20 Bryan A Garner (ed) Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed, Thomson Reuters, St Paul, 2019) at 1204. 21 At 1204. 22 Stevenson and Waite, above n 19, at 923. \[35\] The Oxford English Dictionary defines “money” as: 23 1. Any generally accepted medium of exchange which enables a society to trade goods without the need for barter; any object or tokens regarded as a store of value and used as a medium of exchange. a. Coins and banknotes collectively as a medium of exchange. Later also more widely: any written, printed, or electronic record of ownership of the values represented by coins and notes which is generally accepted as equivalent to or exchangeable for these. ... b. Any other objects or materials which serve the same purpose as coins or banknotes. ... 2. a. Means of payment considered as representing value or purchasing power; the power of purchase or means of exchange represented by coins, banknotes, cheques, etc. Hence: property, possessions, resources, etc., viewed as having exchangeable value or a value expressible in terms of monetary units; liquid assets, funds. \[36\] The word “money” is defined in Laws of New Zealand as follows: 24 \[A\] The term “money” generally includes banknotes as well as coins. However, the amount of money that can be paid in the various small denomination bank notes and in coins is limited. \[B\] The term money is sometimes used to include not only actual cash but also a right to receive cash, such as sums standing to the credit of a bank account, or invested in securities. \[C\] The term may also be used in a popular sense to include all personal or even, exceptionally, all real and personal property. If the term “money” is used in relation to paying money into Court it is to be construed in its ordinary and natural meaning, as including money in foreign currency. \[37\] Like Cull J in the High Court, we are attracted to the wider definition set out at \[B\] in this context. We are satisfied that the words “monetary” and “money” in s LD 3(1)(a) mean more than just cash. Such a conclusion is consistent with the Commissioner’s long-standing practice of accepting that gifts made by way of electronic bank transfers, credit card payments or cheques qualify as monetary gifts under this provision. 25 23 The Oxford English Dictionary (eBook ed, 2016). 24 Laws of New Zealand Money (online ed) at \[3\] (footnotes omitted). The letters have been added for ease of reference. 25 As confirmed in the Commissioner’s Statement of Position dated 16 December 2016 at \[78\]. \[38\] We consider the definition at \[A\] is too narrow. Such definition is also inapt for the statutory context more generally because it is inconsistent with the definition of “paid” and “pay” discussed earlier. Parliament clearly intended that payment could be achieved by debiting and crediting accounts, thus excluding a meaning of just bank notes or coins. It was common ground that the provision was not confined to money in this narrow sense. \[39\] The wider meaning (described at \[C\]) does not fit the statutory context either. It would include gifts of services, personal property, goods and chattels and even land. We consider it is clear that Parliament did not intend to include such gifts within any of the formulations of s LD 3(1)(a). \[40\] We therefore reject the submission on behalf of the Commissioner that the words “monetary” and “money” used in s LD 3(1)(a) are limited only to cash payments and the like. We consider that the dictum of Cooke J in Mills v Dowdall, that a forgiveness of debt does not result in the acquisition of any property by the person forgiven, 26 is not determinative of the issue in this case. The statement was made in a different context where the focus was on the matrimonial property implications of a purchase of shares and of a house, followed by forgiveness of a portion of the purchase price. The point the Court was making was that subsequent forgiveness of the debt representing the purchase price of these assets did not result in the debtor acquiring a property interest in those assets. Moreover, we observe that Richardson J in the same case was of the view that the deed of forgiveness was properly analysed as a gift “of a monetary sum by way of forgiveness of that debt, not of the shares or the land”. 27 The legislative history \[41\] Counsel for the Commissioner placed considerable emphasis on the legislative history and other extrinsic aids to identify Parliament’s purpose for ss LD 1 and LD 3. 26 Mills v Dowdall, above n 11, at 156. 27 At 159. \[42\] The starting point is in 1962 when a tax benefit for a charitable gift was first introduced by s 84B of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. 28 This section provided for a special exemption from assessable income of a qualifying “gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money”. 29 The Minister of Finance is recorded in Hansard as saying: 30 Fourthly, the donations must be in money in amounts of £1 or more, and must be evidenced by a receipt to be sent in with the taxpayers’ income return each year. \[43\] From 1 April 1978, the special exemption from assessable income became a rebate of income tax. 31 However, the Income Tax Acts of 1976 and 1994 continued to refer to gifts of “money”. 32 \[44\] In 2001, the Government conducted a review of the tax treatment of charities which resulted in a discussion document in which it was recorded that donations of money needed to be in cash in order to qualify for the tax rebate: 33 At present, individuals can claim a tax rebate at a set 33 cents in the dollar up to a maximum of $1,500 of donations made ... Donations must be in cash in order to qualify. \[45\] At the same time, the Government decided not to pursue a change in policy to allow for the tax rebate to be extended to non-cash donations. 34 The discussion paper appears to proceed on the basis that “non-cash” donations are the same as donations of goods and services. Yet the discussion paper did not engage expressly with the question of where the boundary lies between these two categories. 28 Inserted into the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 by s 4 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1962. 29 Land and Income Tax Act, s 84B(2). 30 (23 November 1962) 333 NZPD 2894–2895. 31 The rebate was inserted into the Income Tax Act 1976 by s 9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1977, through repeal of s 58 and enactment of s 56A, with effect from 1 April 1978. 32 Section 56A of the Income Tax Act 1976, and s KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 33 Michael Cullen, Paul Swain and John Wright Tax and Charities: A government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non-profit bodies (Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, June 2001) at \[11.7\]. 34 At \[11.9\]. \[46\] Subsequently, s KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 was replaced by s KC 5 of the ITA 2004, which also provided that a taxpayer was allowed a rebate for a gift of money of $5 or more made by the taxpayer. \[47\] Another government discussion document in 2006 considered the possibility of extending the tax rebate for cash donations to include non-cash donations such as shares and other property. 35 Legislative changes in the United Kingdom and Australia were examined but a key concern for the government was that, if similar measures were adopted in New Zealand, there could be difficulties in valuing non-cash donations: 4.28 Adopting any of these measures in New Zealand would recognise the value of non-cash donations and could encourage more donations of this kind. However, a key concern for the government is the difficulty of valuing non-cash donations, which could result in tax avoidance as well as significant compliance and administrative costs. \[48\] In this paper also, the boundary between what counted as “cash” and “non-cash” donations was not addressed. No change in legislation occurred following the 2006 discussion document. \[49\] In 2007, s KC 5 of the ITA 2004 was amended, with effect from the 2008-2009 income year. The intention was to encourage a culture of charitable giving in New Zealand by, among other things, removing rebate thresholds for individuals and removing the deduction limit for charitable donations by companies. The Commentary on the Bill dealt with the amendments to the gift rebate provision as follows: 36 Under current law, individuals are entitled to a tax rebate at a set 33⅓ cents in the dollar up to a maximum of $1,890 for cash donations made to donee organisations. Companies and Māori authorities are entitled to a deduction for cash donations made to donee organisations but the deduction cannot exceed 5 percent of their net income before taking into account the donation deduction. 35 Cullen and Dunne, above n 12. 36 Peter Dunne Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, Kiwisaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill: Commentary on the Bill (Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, May 2007) at 102. \[50\] The reference in this commentary to “cash donations” differs from the statutory language used, referring to gifts of “money”. As the Commissioner accepts, the reference to cash cannot be taken literally in this context as various equivalents to cash also qualify as gifts of money. We do not consider that imprecise paraphrases of this kind provide any real assistance in interpreting the statutory language. \[51\] Subsequently, when s KC 5 of the ITA 2004 was included in the ITA 2007, 37 the phrase “any gift ... of money of $5 or more” changed in s LD 3(1)(a) to “a gift of $5 or more”. 38 Under s ZA 3(3) of the ITA 2007, it is clear that the provisions of the ITA 2007 are the provisions of the ITA 2004 in rewritten form and are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions in the ITA 2004. However, under s ZA 3(5) of the ITA 2007, s ZA 3(3) does not apply to a new law listed in sch 51, which contains identified changes in legislation. Neither ss LD 1 nor LD 3 appear in sch 51. \[52\] We agree with Mr Goosen’s submission that Parliament did not intend there to be a change in meaning when the word “money” was omitted from s LD 3(1)(a) of the ITA 2007. Thus, the phrase “a gift of $5 or more” (in s LD 3(1)(a) of the ITA 2007) was intended by Parliament to have the same meaning as “any gift of ... money of $5 or more” (in s KC 5(1) of the ITA 2004). And, as we have already described, the phrase “a gift of $5 or more” was subsequently replaced with the phrase “a monetary gift of $5 or more” in s LD 3(1)(a) of the ITA 2007. 39 \[53\] After the High Court decision in this case, s LD 3 was amended again to respond to the interpretation of s LD 3 adopted by the High Court. Such an amendment was sought by officials who reported to the Finance and Expenditure Committee as follows: 40 37 In effect from 1 April 2008 and applicable to tax on income derived in the 2008–2009 income year and later income years: s A 2(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 38 Section ZA 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that “Schedule 52 (Comparative tables of old and rewritten provisions) sets out corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004, ... and this Act at the commencement of this Act.” Schedule 52 shows that s KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 corresponds to ss LD 2 and LD 3 and sch 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 39 From 27 February 2014: Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014, s 103. 40 Inland Revenue Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill: Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill (November 2018) at 279–280. Issue: Debt forgiveness and gifts Submission ... A recent court decision in Roberts v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Roberts case) held that debt forgiveness qualifies as a gift under section LD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which in turn makes debt forgiveness eligible for donation tax credits and gift deductions. Currently, the section refers to a “monetary gift of $5 or more”. This decision is contrary to the policy intent, which is that only monetary gifts of cash, including payments made by way of electronic bank transfers, credit cards, and cheques, qualify as gifts. They do not include gifts in kind or debt forgiveness. From 1 April 2008, following the re-write of the Income Tax Act 2007, the language of the provision has undergone some changes for language simplification reasons, but at no time has there been an intention to change the policy intent. Officials consider that the judicial interpretation in the Roberts case is an unintended consequence arising from the rewrite of the donation tax credit rules. Officials therefore recommend that a remedial amendment be made to section LD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to replace the existing words “monetary gift of $5 or more” with the original wording “gift of money of $5 or more”. This will remove a significant risk to the tax base. Officials propose that the application date of the amendment be 1 April 2008, the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2007. This would be in conjunction with a savings provision for taxpayers who have already taken a position in reliance on the current wording, if they have filed a return or a donation tax credit claim. This retrospective application date in conjunction with a savings provision is consistent with the general approach to remedial rewrite amendments. \[54\] Section LD 3(1)(a) was subsequently amended on 18 March 2019 to have retrospective effect from 1 April 2008. 41 In s LD 3(1)(a), “monetary gift” was replaced with “gift of money”. However, due to an exception (or carve out) created by the amending legislation, the amendment to s LD 3(1)(a) does not apply to Mrs Roberts. 42 The Commissioner accepted this appeal must be determined on the wording of s LD 3(1)(a) prior to its amendment on 18 March 2019. But counsel for the Commissioner submitted that the subsequent amendment to s LD 3(1)(a) 41 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019, s 230. 42 Section 230: the amendment does not apply to a person who took a tax position in the period between 1 April 2008 and 15 January 2019. See also Finance and Expenditure Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill (16 January 2019). confirms it was not Parliament’s purpose for gifts of forgiveness of debt to qualify for donations tax credits before the amendment was made. 43 Policy factors \[55\] The Commissioner advanced two main policy reasons for requiring donations to be in cash and excluding the forgiveness of debt, namely: (a) avoiding significant compliance and administrative costs; and (b) the difficulty of valuing non-cash donations, which could result in tax avoidance. \[56\] Elaborating on these claims, Ms Kern submitted that if a forgiveness of debt qualified for donations tax credits, the Commissioner would, as a first step, need to be satisfied that a loan had in fact, at some time in the past, been made by the donor. Citing the present case as an example, she argued it can sometimes be difficult to verify transactions where record keeping is poor and the loan was made long before the debt is forgiven. 44 \[57\] On the second point of tax avoidance, Ms Kern submitted that to allow a forgiveness of debt to qualify as a charitable gift would provide opportunities for unscrupulous taxpayers to gain inappropriate tax refunds in a number of ways. First, taxpayers could manipulate books of account to reflect loans that have in substance not been made. They could potentially then claim rebates and receive cash refunds where no charitable donations have been made. This could pose a risk to the revenue base that would involve increased administration costs for the Commissioner. Second, taxpayers could sell assets (such as motor vehicles) to a charitable entity at sums above the market value of the goods, while leaving the sale price outstanding as vendor finance. If such loans are later forgiven there could be opportunities for taxpayers to claim rebates based on higher amounts than the true value of the gifts. 45 43 We see no merit in this argument and do not discuss it further. 44 Counsel relied on the complex factual situation which needed to be clarified during the disputes review process. 45 Counsel also argued that, even if a true cash loan is made, valuation issues can arise in respect of the forgiveness of such debts — for example, if the charity is insolvent as discussed at \[18\] above. The reality of the legislative history and policy factors \[58\] We consider there has for a number of years been somewhat of a disconnect between the actual wording of the legislation in question and the commentary or discussion generated by officials. As early as 2001 the government review spoke of the need for donations to “be in cash in order to qualify”. 46 Yet the legislation made no such requirement and the Income Tax Act 1994 spoke of “any gift ... of money” — not cash. As noted above, the review appeared to equate “non-cash” donations with donations of goods and services. It seems that the 2001 review did not analyse the statutory word “money” or address the legal meaning of “money” and where the boundaries of this term might lie. \[59\] The same might be said about the 2006 discussion document. The legislation continued to refer to “any gift... of money of $5 or more”, 47 whereas the discussion document spoke of “non-cash donations” and the difficulties that might arise from valuing such gifts. Again, no attempt was made to offer an analysis of the statutory wording and what might, or might not, fall within the statutory provisions as defined in the legislation. \[60\] Similar observations can be made of the officials’ commentary on the bill under consideration in 2007. The discussion was focused on “cash donations” with no attempt made to analyse the statutory terms “money” or “monetary”. \[61\] It is noteworthy that in the officials’ report following the High Court judgment (quoted at \[53\] above), officials spoke about the policy intent of the legislation. It was said that “only monetary gifts of cash, including payments made by way of electronic bank transfers, credit cards, and cheques qualify as gifts. They do not include gifts in kind or debt forgiveness.” This appears to be the first time the so-called policy intent had been expressed in this manner to include the issue of forgiveness of debt. \[62\] Having carefully considered the legislative history described above, we are satisfied it provides no support for the interpretation of “monetary” or “money” 46 Cullen, Swain and Wright, above n 33, at \[11.7\]. 47 Income Tax Act 2004, s KC 5(1). contended for by the Commissioner. Comments in reports by officials about “cash” do not assist the Commissioner when that is not the wording of the statute, and the term appears to have been used in a broad sense and by way of contrast with gifts of goods and services. The task of the Court is to interpret the words used in the statute, not paraphrases, and in particular imprecise paraphrases, used in discussion papers and officials’ reports. We should add that comments by officials, unless they form part of the parliamentary record, are not an especially reliable, or orthodox, form of legislative history. \[63\] We turn finally to the policy grounds advanced by the Commissioner as driving the interpretation she advances. None of these policy arguments are compelling. \[64\] The first contention is that excluding forgiveness of debt avoids significant compliance and administrative costs. We agree with Mr Coleman that the concerns advanced under this ground are exaggerated. If Parliament is concerned about such matters it would be able to address these concerns through more detailed and specific drafting of the statutory provisions. \[65\] Second, we are not persuaded that greater administration costs will arise with the inclusion of forgiveness of debts. Significant investigation and checking may be required for tax rebate claims in relation to gifts of cash, depending on the circumstances of the giving. 48 Concerns about tax avoidance are overstated. And there are now robust statutory mechanisms in place to deal with any instances of tax avoidance in this context. 49 \[66\] In summary, we do not find any of the policy grounds advanced by the Commissioner to be persuasive. Certainly, the arguments advanced under the policy head cannot succeed in carrying the day in circumstances where the words used in the statute do not support the Commissioner’s case and the legislative history is at best unhelpful. 48 As illustrated in Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints Trust Board v Commissioner Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 52. 49 Income Tax Act 2007, s GB 55, inserted in the Act with effect from 1 April 2019.

Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features The proposed amendments would allow Inland Revenue to pay KiwiSaver employer contributions (both compulsory and voluntary) to scheme providers, before the contribution amount has been received by Inland Revenue. Employer contributions would be paid to providers as soon as practicable after employment income information was filed with Inland Revenue indicating that an employer contribution had been made for a pay period. Along with the other KiwiSaver amendments in this Bill, this change would improve the administrative efficiency of KiwiSaver as it would facilitate the earlier transfer of employer contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers. This would result in a member’s employer contributions being invested by their scheme providers sooner. The proposal would also align with the existing treatment of KiwiSaver employee contributions. Background Under current KiwiSaver settings, Inland Revenue on-pays employee contributions to a member’s scheme provider as soon as practicable after receiving payday emplo yment income information that an employee contribution amount has been deducted from the member’s salary and wages. As employment income information is due with Inland Revenue prior to the due date for payment of these deductions, this means that employee contributions can be on-paid to scheme providers sooner than they otherwise would be. 1 The law currently provides no comparable arrangement for employer contributions. Instead, when Inland Revenue receives employment income information relating to an emplo yer contribution, the employer contribution is not on-paid to the KiwiSaver scheme provider until the contribution amount has been paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. This makes 1 Under the payday filing requirements, employment income information is due within 2 days or 10 days of a payday depending on the size of the employer. Payment is not due until the 20 th of the month and the 5 th of the following month for large employers. For other employers, payment is not due until the 20 th of the following month. 4 it difficult for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver account with the contribution amounts listed on their payslips. It also means that employer contributions are not invested by scheme providers as soon as employee contributions. Detailed analysis All section references are to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments to Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account rules (Part 3, subpart 2) Under existing section 72 Inland Revenue is required to establish a memorandum account – called the “Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account” – which all contributions made under the Act must be paid into in the first instance. The existing Act contains a provision which allows Inland Revenue to pay employee contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme provider based on employment income information, before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. Section 73(3) provides that after being paid into the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account, these contributions must be paid out of the Holding Account to a KiwiSaver scheme provider as soon as practicable. The proposed amendments to subsections 73(1) and (2) would allow Inland Revenue to on-pay employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme provider under section 73(3), in addition to employee contributions. Under amended section 73(1), before on-paying the contribution amount to the scheme provider Inland Revenue should be satisfied that the contribution has actually been deducted from salary and wage or for employer contributions that the employer is able to make the contribution at the time it was reported in the employment income information. However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, Inland Revenue can assume that if an amount has been reported on employment income information this is the case. Under the existing Act the entitlement for Inland Revenue to make this assumpt ion about employee contributions is included in section 73(6), but it is proposed this entitlement be moved to new section 221B and extended to employer contributions. Proposed new section 73(1) would also clarify that section 73 only applies to employee and employer contributions that are on-paid to a KiwiSaver scheme provider by Inland Revenue before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. Employee and employer contributions that are not on-paid to a scheme provider before the contribution is paid to Inland Revenue, would be captured by existing section 74 and treated as being held on trust under this section. Contributions received by Inland Revenue that are neither employee or employer contributions would also continue to be subject to section 74 (section 95 allows for a person who is not an employer to make contributions to a KiwiSaver account by paying them to Inland Revenue). The Act contains a provision to prevent the employee being disadvantaged by their employer failing to pay deductions to Inland Revenue. Existing section 78(a) provides that Inland Revenue must pay an amount of the unpaid employee contribution from a Crown Bank Account into the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account if the employer has not paid the contribution amount by its due date. Proposed new section 78 would extend this to allow Inland Revenue to also pay the amount of unpaid employer contributions. 5 It is also proposed to repeal section 76 which allows Inland Revenue to wait to on-pay an employer contribution until a member’s employee contribution is next on-paid to a KiwiSaver scheme provider. As the proposed amendments would allow employee and employer contributions to be on-paid to a KiwiSaver scheme provider at the same time, this provision is no longer necessary. Cross-referencing and nomenclature amendments are also proposed to sections 71 and 74(3). Amendments to employer contribution rules (Part 3, subpart 3) It is proposed to repeal sections 98 and 99 which set out rules for how part payments of employer contributions to Inland Revenue are treated. Part payment rules are no longer required as the proposed amendments above would allow employer contributions to always be on-paid in full to a scheme provider. In their place new section 95B is proposed. Proposed section 95B would specify when an employer contribution shown on employment income information would be treated as received by Inland Revenue for the purpose of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, where the contribution was not paid to Inland Revenue by or before its payment due date. This provision would be consistent with the existing rule for employee contributions in section 69. The amendments to section 73 requiring the on-payment of employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme provider as soon as practicable after they are paid into the Inland Revenue Holding Account would be subject to proposed new sections 95C and 95D. Where an employer has failed to provide particulars required by Inland Revenue about an employer contribution reported in employment income information, proposed new section 95C would allow Inland Revenue to wait to on-pay the contribution until it can be established which member it should be attributed to. Proposed new section 95D would provide that such a contribution would not be treated as being received by Inland Revenue until the date it was established who it was attributable to. These provisions would be consistent with the existing rules for employee contributions in sections 70 and 71. Proposed new section 101(1B) would provide that where an employee opts-out after an employer contribution has already been on-paid to their scheme provider the amount must be refunded to Inland Revenue. Proposed new section 101AA would provide that where this amount has been paid out of a Crown Bank Account and the amount has not subsequently been received from the employer, the employer contribution amount must be refunded to a Crown Bank Account. This would ensure that an employer was not refunded an amount they had not paid. Employee and employer contributions are required to be held by Inland Revenue for the duration of the standard opt-out period (an amendment also proposed in this Bill would reduce this holding period for initial contributions from 92 days to 62 days, while the opt- out period ends 55 days after a person has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver). Therefore, the proposed amendments to the opt-out refund rules would only have limited application in circumstances when the late opt-out rules have been applied. A similar amendment to the one proposed to the opt-out refund rules is not proposed for refunds resulting from a person being invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver, as existing section 59D(4) already allows refunds of contribution amounts (without reference to the specific contribution type) to the Crown where appropriate, in invalid enrolment situations. 6 Cross-referencing and nomenclature amendments are also proposed to sections 93(5), 96 and 98A. 7 OTHER KIWISAVER ADMINISTRATIVE REFINEMENTS (Clauses 4(2) and (4), 5, 6, 7(2) and (3), 8 to 15, 19, 22 to 25, 33 to 38 , and 132) Summary of proposed amendment A number of additional technical amendments are proposed to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 aimed at enhancing Inland Revenue’s administration of KiwiSaver. In particular, the amendments aim to ensure that KiwiSaver members receive the correct contribution amounts and to facilitate the faster transfer of contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features • Reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period (during which individuals who are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver are provisionally allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme) and init ial ho lding period fro m three months to two months. • Aligning the date KiwiSaver contributions are treated as received by Inland Revenue with a member’s payday. • Reducing the maximum period within which a scheme provider has to send information and funds to a new scheme provider when a member transfers schemes, fro m 35 days to 10 working days. • Allowing members to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, in addition to their employer. • Requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with information about an employee’s KiwiSaver income and ESCT rate. • Removing the three-month grace period for members who have been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence. Detailed analysis All section references are to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 unless otherwise stated. Reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period and initial holding period (sections 4, 18, 48, 51, 57, 59B, 64, 75, 81, 88, 104, 108, 112B and 226 amended) Where an individual has been automatically enrolled, opted-in via their employer or is no lo nger eligible to be a member of their existing KiwiSaver scheme, under section 50 the individual will be provisionally allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme. Section 51(4) provides that this provisio nal allocat ion will be made final three mo nths after being allocated to the scheme. The effect of this is that if the individual does not make an active choice to 8 join another KiwiSaver scheme before the end of the three-month period, they will be treated as having accepted the offer of membership to the scheme they were provisionally allocated to. The provisional period is distinct from the KiwiSaver opt-out period (which applies from day 13 until the end of day 55 after a person has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver). As a consequence of the provisional period being set at three months section 75 requires that a member’s initial contributions are also held by Inland Revenue for three months before being on-paid to the member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider. It is proposed that section 51(4)(a) and (b) be amended so that the provisional period be reduced from three months to two months. Section 75 would also be amended so that the initial holding period was also reduced from three months to two months. As they would be receiving a member’s initial contributions earlier, scheme providers would become aware they had been allocated a default member sooner and would be able to engage with the member about their investment options earlier. It would also mean a member’s initial contributions were invested by scheme providers sooner. Moreover, members would still have the opportunity to transfer between schemes after the provisional period ended if they wished to. As a result of reducing the initial holding period it is proposed that an amendment be made to section 81(1) so that in addition to being required to refund contributions to Inland Revenue that were more than was required to be paid under the Act, a scheme provider would also be required to refund contributions to Inland Revenue when a member opts out. This provision would apply where the KiwiSaver late opt out rules have been used, which can be up to three months after a person has been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver (previously such a rule was not necessary as the late opt-out period ended at the same time as the initial holding period). A similar amendment has been made to the employer contribution specific refund rules and is discussed in the section about on-payment of KiwiSaver employer contributions. Currently, section 4(3) of the Act defines “3 months” to mean 92 days. It is proposed that section 4(3) be repealed and where appropriate references in the Act to “3 months” are replaced with “92 days”. Instead of being expressed as “2 months”, section 51(4) would also refer to “62 days”. Consequential amendments to sections 48(1)(d), 56(4) and 226(1B) and (1C) are also proposed to align with the reduced provisional and holding periods. Aligning the date KiwiSaver contributions are received with member’s payday (proposed sections 95B and 221B and sections 4, 69, 78, 85 and schedule 1, clause 8 amended) Under existing section 85(1), employee contributions are treated as received by Inland Revenue on the 15 th of the month they were deducted from the member’s salary or wages, for the purpose of determining when interest calculations commence on employee contributions while they are held by Inland Revenue. Sections 69(2), 78(b) and schedule 1, clause 8 also contain a 15 th of the month timing rule for employee contributions – these provisio ns relate to when unpaid employee contributions are treated as received and when employee contributions are treated as received for the purpose of the KiwiSaver first home withdrawal rules. Section 85(3) provides that employer contributions are treated as received on the first of the month that Inland Revenue received payment for the contribution. The reason employer 9 contributions are treated as received on a different date from employee contributions, was a result of the fact employer contributions could not be on-paid to a scheme provider until the contribution amount had been paid to Inland Revenue. If interest was calculated from the 15 th of the month and there was a delay in the employer contribution amount being paid to Inland Revenue, this would create a risk that Inland Revenue would be required to pay interest on these contributions for an extended period of time. The proposed on-payment of employer contributions amendment outlined above means it would no longer be necessary to treat employee and employer contributions differently for timing purposes. The current timing rules reflect the fact that previously Inland Revenue did not have sufficient information to determine the date of an employee’s payday. This timing approach is unsatisfactory as it results in the under and over payment of interest on employee contributions and underpayment of interest on employer contributions. New employment income information requirements came into effect from 1 April 2019. Employers are now required to report the date of their employee’s payday to Inland Revenue. Therefore, it is proposed that sections 69, 78 and 85 are amended so that employee contributions would be treated as received by Inland Revenue on the date of the member’s payday as reported by the employer. Similarly, amended section 85 and new section 95B(2) (which relates to the date employer contributions are treated as received for the on-payment of employer contributions amendments above) would specify that employer contributions were also treated as received on the date of the member’s payday. All of the proposed amendments would include a carve out stating that where an employer has not provided information to Inland Revenue about an employee’s payday, both employee and employer contributions would be treated as received on the 15 th of the month that the employee contribution was deducted/employer contribution was made for. This would cover situations where Inland Revenue has granted an employer a variation for emplo yment income information requirements, which results in them not being required to report the date of their employee’s payday. Under existing sections 69 and 85 Inland Revenue should be satisfied that an employee contribution has actually been deducted from salary and wages for these sections to apply. Similarly, it is proposed that for employer contributions proposed section 85 and new section 95B would require Inland Revenue to be satisfied the employer is able to make the contribution at the time it was reported in the employment income information for these sections to apply. Proposed new section 221B would entitle Inland Revenue to assume that if an amount was included on employment income information these requirements were met for employee and employer contributions unless there was evidence to the contrary. An amendment is also proposed to section 4 to clarify that “payday” would have the same meaning as it does in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Transfer of member’s information and funds to a new scheme provider (sections 56 and 57 amended) Section 56(4) specifies that where an existing KiwiSaver member decides to transfer schemes, the old scheme provider must send the member’s funds and relevant information to the new scheme, within 35 days of receiving notice that the member has opted to transfer schemes. However, KiwiSaver default provider Instruments of Appointment require them to complete these transfer requirements within 10 working days of receiving notice that the member has transferred schemes. 10 It is proposed the above section be amended so that the legislatively mandated transfer time is reduced from 35 days to 10 working days. This would result in the transfer time being aligned across all KiwiSaver scheme providers. A consequential amendment is also proposed to section 57(5). Changing employee contribution rates (section 64 amended) Under section 64(2) an employee can choose what KiwiSaver contribution rate they wish to have contributions deducted from their salary or wages at by giving notice to their employer. It is proposed that this section be amended so that a member would be able to change their contribution rate by contacting Inland Revenue or their KiwiSaver scheme provider, in addit ion to their employer. This would reduce compliance costs for members who may be more likely to engage with Inland Revenue or their scheme provider in the first instance about contribution rate changes. Proposed new section 64(2B) to (2D) outline information that would need to be provided by a member or a scheme provider to Inland Revenue where a contribution rate change is made, and what information Inland Revenue would be required to subsequently provide a member’s employer to ensure the contribution rate change is given effect to. KiwiSaver income and ESCT rate information (proposed section 63B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, and 93 amended of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) As part of the KiwiSaver on-boarding process, employers are required to provide Inland Revenue with certain information about new enrolments to the scheme. To improve Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution amounts and that these amounts are taxed at the correct rate, it is proposed that employers should provide the following KiwiSaver information to Inland Revenue: • Proposed new section 63B: The amount of salary and wages a KiwiSaver deduction is made from for an employee, if there is a difference between amounts that an employer must treat as gross earnings for the purpose of calculating PAYE tax obligations and amounts they must treat as salary and wages for the purpose of calculating KiwiSaver employee and employer contribution amounts. If there is a difference between amounts that an employer must treat as gross earnings (for calculating PAYE deductions) and amounts they must treat as salary and wages (for calculating KiwiSaver employer and employee contributions), then the employer must report the latter. There are some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE that are exempt for KiwiSaver purposes. (Some examples of amounts included in gross income for PAYE that are not included within the definition of salary and wages for KiwiSaver are the value of accommodation, a benefit from an employee share scheme or a redundancy payment). • Proposed new section 93(7): Where the employer is reporting information to Inland Revenue on employer KiwiSaver contributions (that is all employers making KiwiSaver employer contributions) the employee’s employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate. 11 It is not proposed that employers would provide this information every payday. Instead, the employer would report to Inland Revenue about new emplo yees or exist ing emplo yees where the information has changed since the last KiwiSaver employee contribution was deducted or employer contribution was paid for that member. This would mean emplo yers would not have to provide this information about existing employees who are KiwiSaver members when the proposals came into effect. Consequential amendments are also proposed to schedule 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to clarify that the proposed new reporting requirements fall within the ambit of what is considered employment income information under that Act. KiwiSaver invalid enrolment residence grace period (sections 59B, 59C and 59D amended) Section 59A provides that when an individual does not meet the KiwiSaver residency requirement, the invalid enrolment rules will apply. However, under section 59B the member will be treated as meeting the KiwiSaver residence requirement for the first three months after the invalid enrolment is discovered. Section 59C then provides if the person becomes someone who meets the residence requirement within this three-month period, the enrolment will be retrospectively validated and their KiwiSaver account would remain open. In practice, the three-month residence grace period has not operated as intended, as non- residents who have been enrolled in KiwiSaver typically do not intend to become a resident in the short-term (for example, individuals on temporary work visas). Therefore, it is proposed that new section 59B(2)(ab) be inserted. Where an individual has been invalidly enrolled on the basis of not meeting the residence requirement, this provision would result in their membership ending as soon as their scheme provider discovers, or is notified about, the invalid enrolment. Proposed amendments to section 59C(1) would clarify that where a person who did not meet the residence requirement was invalidly enrolled this enrolment could not be retrospectively validated. While amendments to section 59D(1) would confirm that the refund process set out under this section, for contributions that a person had made while invalidly enrolled, would apply if an individual’s account had been closed on the basis of them not meeting the residence criteria when enrolled. The effect of these amendments would be to remove the three-month residence grace period and mean the member’s account would be closed immediately. The individual would then be able to open a new KiwiSaver account if they later became a resident. 13 Student loans 15 LIMITING ABILITY TO REOPEN REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO 1 APRIL 2013 (Clause 57 and Schedule) Summary of proposed amendments Several proposals are made to limit the situations where either the Commissioner or the borrower can reopen a borrower’s repayment obligation for tax years prior to 1 April 2013. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features The proposed amendments to the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 limit the situations where a borrower’s repayment obligations for tax years prior to 1 April 2013 can be amended. For these tax years a borrower’s repayment obligation would only be reopened where a borrower: • becomes overseas or New Zealand based; • has committed fraud; • has not filed information to the Commissioner when required to do so under the Act and it is cost effective for the Commissioner to reopen the repayment obligation. A savings provision is proposed to allow the Commissioner to correct the position of any borrower who might be unduly disadvantaged by these proposals. Background Inland Revenue is currently required to maintain the student loan scheme rules back to 1992 when the scheme was introduced in case either the Commissioner or the borrower seeks to review a borrower’s repayment obligation. Retaining rules back to 1992 has increased the complexity of the scheme over time as changes have been made to the scheme in 21 of the last 26 years. Compliance costs for borrowers are high, as understanding changes to their loan balance is difficult due to historical rules applying for prior years. Administration costs for Inland Revenue are also high, as are the costs of building the rules back to 1992 into new systems and processes, with litt le benefit. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, it is proposed that a simplified set of rules will apply for the period from 1992 to 1 April 2013. This will reduce compliance costs for borrowers, the administration costs for Inland Revenue, and the time and cost of implementing changes to the student loan scheme. 16 The 1 April 2013 date was chosen as nearly all adjustments to borrowers’ repayment obligations have occurred within this timeframe and the rules applying from that date onwards are largely the same as applies today. Detailed analysis Schedule 6 of the Act is amended by introducing a new part, Part 5. This part sets out the proposed new rules for tax years prior to 1 April 2013. A new definit io n of clo sed-off tax years is proposed relating to tax years from 1992 up to 1 April 2013. During this period both the Commissioner and the borrower are precluded from reopening any repayment obligation except where the borrower: has a change in residency status; has committed fraud; has not provided information (for example. an unfiled return) and it is cost effective for the Commissioner to reopen the obligation; or has been disadvantaged because of this proposal. If one of these exceptions apply, the borrower’s repayment obligation can be reopened. Residency changes If a change in a borrower’s residence status is identified after 1 April 2020 and the change relates to a closed-off tax year, a simplified set of rules will apply. Loan interest would be calculated on the borrower’s loan balance from the date the borrower went overseas, or loan interest would cease to apply from date they returned to New Zealand. Where a borrower goes from New Zealand-based to overseas-based during the closed-off period, no overseas-based borrower repayment obligation for the period will be imposed. Where a borrower goes from overseas-based to New Zealand-based during the period, overseas-based repayments would not be collected. Any payments already collected would go against the loan balance. However, changes to a borrower’s repayment obligations due to residency changes will apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. Example 1 Bob went overseas in April 2008 but did not advise Inland Revenue. Since 2008, Bob has been treated as a New Zealand-based borrower (so was not charged loan interest). Bob has not met his repayment obligations since 2008. In April 2021, Bob returns to New Zealand and Inland Revenue identifies that Bob has been overseas since April 2008. Bob’s obligations for the 2008–2013 tax years can be reopened only to the extent that Bob must pay loan interest from April 2008. His repayment obligations for the 2008–2013 tax years cannot otherwise be assessed or reassessed. Bob’s obligations for the 2014–2021 tax years can be reopened in full (because those tax years are not closed off). For the period from 1 April 2013 until he returned to New Zealand, Bob may be liable to an overseas-based borrowers’ repayment obligation and loan interest. From 1 April 2013 onwards, associated late payment interest charges can apply. 17 Example 2 Ngaire went overseas in April 2000 and advised Inland Revenue of her departure. Ngaire returned to New Zealand in July 2008 but did not advise Inland Revenue. Since April 2000, Ngaire has been treated as an overseas-based borrower (so was charged loan interest and assessed with an overseas-based repayment obligation). Ngaire has not met her repayment obligations since March 2000. In April 2021, Inland Revenue identifies that Ngaire returned to New Zealand in July 2008. Ngaire’s obligations for the 2008–2021 tax years can be reopened. For the period from July 2008 to 31 March 2013, the loan interest charge, and any overseas-based borrower repayment obligations, can be reversed but no New Zealand-based repayment obligation can be assessed in its place. For the 2013–2014 tax year and later tax years, Ngaire can be assessed with a New Zealand-based borrowers’ repayment obligation (because those tax years are not closed off). From 1 April 2013 onwards, associated late payment interest charges can apply. Example 3 Pip went overseas to work as a volunteer for a recognised charity in April 2008 and returned in April 2010. Pip could have applied under section 25 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to be treated as if still physically in New Zealand during the period of absence but did not. Pip’s obligations for the 2008– 2009 to 2009–2010 tax years can be reopened if she makes an application under section 25 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. For the period of absence, the loan interest charge, and any overseas-based borrower repayment obligations, can be reversed but no New Zealand-based repayment obligation can be assessed in its place. Fraud or unfiled returns or information Where fraud is involved, or the borrower has failed to provide a return or information to the Commissioner, the borrower’s repayment obligation may be reopened during the closed-off period. In these situations, a simplified calculation would be used to calculate the borrower’s repayment obligation, namely, 10 percent of the difference between the income of the borrower that should have been used to calculate the repayment obligation and the income that was used less any unused repayment threshold. Other rules that applied in that year would be disregarded. A one-off penalty may also apply to penalise the non-compliant action. Late payment interest will not be imposed for the closed-off period. However, late payment interest may apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. Imposing late payment interest on repayment obligations for the period 1992 to 2013 can disproportionately increase the debt owed to Inland Revenue to the point where the borrower cannot repay the debt and disengages with the Student Loan Scheme. Example 4 Chris fraudulently failed to declare a large source of income for the 2008–09 tax year. This has implications for both income tax and student loan obligations. The four-year (statute bar) period for making changes to an income tax obligation after a return is filed does not apply where fraud is involved. Therefore, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue amends Chris’s income tax liability for the 2008–2009 year and the student loan repayment obligation for that year is also amended. The reopened student loan repayment obligation is the difference between the previous income amount and the new income amount, less any unused repayment threshold, multiplied by the repayment percentage (which was 10% up to 1 April 2013). Chris could be considered for a shortfall or criminal penalty for not filing or for the fraudulent activity. 18 Borrowers adversely affected Where a borrower considers that they are worse off because of these changes, they can apply to the Commissioner and if the Commissioner agrees then their repayment obligation will be corrected. 19 OVERSEAS-BASED BORROWERS WITH SERIOUS ILLNESS OR DISABILITIES (Clauses 40 to 44, 53, and 56) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 will allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to treat borrowers who are unable to meet their overseas- based repayment obligation as a result of a serious illness or disability as being physically in New Zealand. This means they could be eligible for an interest-free loan and have repayment obligations based on their income. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features The Bill provides a new circumstance for when a borrower can be treated as being physically in New Zealand. Borrowers with a serious illness who are unable to meet their overseas-based repayment obligations will be able to be treated as physically in New Zealand for the purposes of determining whether they are New Zealand-based or overseas-based. The amendment will require the borrower to provide evidence of their medical and financial position as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue requires. Unlike for hardship relief, the borrower would not necessarily need to supply evidence annually. Instead they would need to do so as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue reasonably requires. This helps to recognise that some borrowers have long term medical conditions. The borrower will be required to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of their adjusted net income. This is required of all borrowers who have repayment obligations based on their inco me. Background Many borrowers with serious illnesses can work and can meet their repayment obligations. However, some overseas-based borrowers with serious illnesses can struggle to meet their overseas-based repayment obligation and over time their loan can increase in size because of loan interest being charged. New Zealand-based borrowers, as defined in section 22, do not pay loan interest and their repayment obligations are based on their income. Whereas overseas-based borrowers incur loan interest and their repayment obligations are based on their loan size. 20 The treatment will be available to borrowers who have an injury, illness, or disability that results in them being unable to engage in paid work, other than work for which the person is paid a token payment or a very low wage, or where that injury, illness or disability poses a serios and imminent risk of death. Example 5 Ben lives overseas and was seriously injured in a car accident. Ben after the accident had to quit his job and he is now financially unable to meet his overseas-based repayment obligation. Ben is now working at his local community gardens, as part of the country’s welfare programme. Ben, as part of this welfare programme, receives a payment for his work that is below the country’s minimum wage. Ben is eligible to apply to be treated as a New Zealand-based borrower, meaning he would have an interest free loan and repayment obligations based on his income. The proposed amendment will assist in aligning the repayment obligation of overseas-based borrowers in serious illness with their ability to make repayments. It also ensures the size of the borrower’s loan does not increase as a result of loan interest charges. The proposed amendment will not change borrowers’ abilities to receive hardship relief. 21 NOTIFYING EMPLOYERS WHEN STUDENT LOANS ARE CLOSE TO BEING REPAID (Clause 45) Summary of proposed amendment This proposed amendment will allow Inland Revenue to notify employers of a borrower’s remaining loan balance when the borrower’s loan is close to being fully repaid. Employers will be instructed to reduce the amount of the final deduction to an amount equal to the remaining loan balance. This will reduce the likelihood of overpayments being made. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features Employers will be notified of a borrower’s loan balance when Inland Revenue becomes aware that the borrower’s loan is close to being fully repaid. Where possible, borrowers will also be notified that their loan is close to being repaid. Employers will need to reduce the amount of the final deduction. Background Currently, employers make salary and wage deductions from their employee’s wages at the rate of 12 cents in the dollar for every dollar over the repayment threshold. This flat rate generally leads to employers deducting more than the remaining loan balance. These overpayments often require contact between Inland Revenue and the borrower to resolve. Inland Revenue currently contacts employers after loans are fully repaid to instruct them to cease making student loan deductions. This proposal is possible now because since 1 April 2019, employers have been required to provide informat ion on emplo yees’ income and deductions each payday giving Inland Revenue more timely and accurate information regarding an employee’s earnings. 22 RENAMING THE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT HOLIDAY (Clauses 46 to 52, and 54) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment changes the name of the Student Loan Repayment Holiday to Student Loan Temporary Repayment Suspension. Application date The proposed amendment would will apply from 1 April 2020. Background The repayment holiday reduces a borrower’s overseas-based repayment obligation to zero. Renaming the repayment holiday will send a better signal to borrowers that their repayment obligations are only on hold. In practice, there will be no change to the effect of the policy on borrowers. 23 WRITING OFF HISTORIC FRAUDULENT LOANS (Clause 57(4) and Schedule) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment allows Inland Revenue to write off loans taken out before 2000, where the Commissioner is satisfied that the borrower did not take out the loan, and the correct borrower cannot be identified. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features The proposed change will allow Inland Revenue to write off loans that were transferred before 1 April 2000 where the Commissioner is satisfied that the person who has been allocated the loan did not take it out, and the correct borrower cannot be identified. 2 This is intended to be used in a small number of cases that officials are aware of and suspect identity theft has occurred. If the correct borrower could be identified the loan would be transferred to them. 2 If Inland Revenue discovers a similar case for a loan taken out after 2000, the loan can be sent to Studylink, who are able to write off the loan. Loans taken out before 2000 were not issued by Studylink so cannot be sent back to them. 25 Research and development 27 REFUNDABILITY AND NEW TAX EXEMPT ENTITY EXCLUSION (Clauses 101, 106, 107 and 113(6), (9), (10) and (13)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to make refundable R&D tax credits available to more firms. It is proposed that the existing corporate eligibility criteria, wage intensity test, and $255,000 cap be removed and replaced with a payroll-tax based cap. It is also proposed that entities that derive tax exempt income (other than levy bodies, and claimants that only receive exempt income from certain intercompany and foreign dividends) be ineligible for the R&D tax credit. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from a business’s 2020–21 income year. The proposed amendment in clause 107 would apply from the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new refundability rules It is proposed that the existing limited refundability rules be replaced with new rules that make refundable R&D tax credits available to more firms from the 2020–21 income year (year two of the R&D tax credit regime). This means the new rules would apply from the start of each business’s 2020–21 income year, so would apply from 1 April 2020 for standard balance date taxpayers. These credits would be available for claimants in a tax loss position, or with insufficient income tax liability to utilise all of their R&D tax credits in the relevant income year. Table 1 compares the current limited refundability rules with the proposed new refundability rules. Table 1: Current and proposed refundability rules Area Existing rules 2019–20 income year Proposed new rules 2020–21 income year Eligibility criteria Must satisfy the corporate eligibility criteria (section MX 2) – this includes a requirement that claimants must be companies, cannot be listed, and cannot be considered a tax resident of another jurisdiction under a double tax agreement No corporate eligibility criteria. Must satisfy the wage intensity criteria (section MX 3) – this requires twenty percent of a firm’s labour costs to be on R&D labour No wage intensity criteria. 28 Area Existing rules 2019–20 income year Proposed new rules 2020–21 income year Exempt income exclusion Must not derive exempt income or be associated with a person who derives exempt income (unless the exempt income is from intercompany or foreign dividends under section CW 9 or 10). Must not derive exempt income (unless the exempt income is from intercompany or foreign dividends under section CW 9 or 10, or the claimant is a levy body researcher) – note that this is an exclusion from the R&D tax credit regime, not just from refundability. Cap $255,000. The total payroll taxes (PAYE, FBT, and ESCT) paid by the claimant (exceptions and grouping rules apply). Outstanding tax Must not have an outstanding tax liability. Must not have an outstanding tax liability. There would be two exceptions to the payroll tax-based cap. The cap would not apply to R&D tax credits: • derived from eligible R&D expenditure on approved research providers; or • claimed by levy body researchers (a levy body researcher is an industry organisation to which a levy is payable under New Zealand statute, such as the Commodity Levies Act 1990). Grouping rules would apply to allow certain companies to allocate their payroll taxes to other companies they control or that sit within the same wholly-owned group. Similar to the existing refundability rules, any non-refundable R&D tax credits may be carried forward to the next income year provided the shareholder continuity requirements in section LY 8 are met. Proposed new exclusion for tax exempt entities Tax exempt entities, other than firms that receive exempt income from dividends under section CW 9 or 10, (“excluded tax exempt entities”) are ineligible for year one refundability. Given that, the Government has decided these organisations should not be eligible for refunds of their tax credits in year two. It is proposed that these excluded tax-exempt entities will also be completely ineligible for the R&D tax credit regime from the 2020–21 income year (year two of the R&D tax credit regime), except where the claimant is a levy body researcher. Any R&D tax credits received by tax exempt entities in year one cannot be carried forward to year two. These credits will be extinguished from the beginning of year two. Background The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 introduced an R&D tax incentive regime from the 2019–20 income year. The R&D tax incentive was developed under tight timeframes, so there was insufficient time to resolve some associated issues before the legislation was enacted. These included the eligibility of tax-exempt entit ies, and 29 refundability for firms in loss or with insufficient income tax liability to use all of their R&D tax credits in the relevant income year. Eligibility for the credit A firm must first be eligible for the R&D tax credit more generally before it can be eligible for refundable R&D tax credits. Claimants have to satisfy a number of criteria to be eligible for the credit, which include having a core activity in New Zealand and carrying on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Excluding tax exempt entities from the R&D tax credit regime Tax exempt entities are currently eligible for non-refundable R&D tax credits in year one of the R&D tax credit regime. Since these entities do not pay any income tax and do not qualify for year one refundability, they are unable to benefit from any R&D tax credits they receive in year one. Broader refundability rules In year one of the incentive (that is, the 2019–20 income year), limited refundability rules applied to provide refundable credits for a small portion of eligible R&D tax credit claimants. The limited refundability rules built on the existing R&D tax loss cash-out regime. The Government committed to reviewing the refundability rules, so that broader, more accessible refundability would be available from year two of the incentive (the 2020–21 income year). Refundability is important, because it ensures all claimants doing R&D are able to immediately benefit from the tax credits they are eligible for under the incentive. Without refundability, some claimants may not be able to benefit from the incentive until a much later date (if at all, depending on the circumstances of each claimant). Removing the corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria (section LA 5(4B(a)(i) and (ii)) should make refundable tax credits available to more claimants. It is proposed that the existing $255,000 cap be replaced with a payroll tax-based cap. The payro ll tax-based cap would be based on the total PAYE (which includes withholding taxes paid on behalf of contractors), FBT, and ESCT paid by a claimant. This is in line with approaches taken in other jurisdictions and is intended to prevent refundable tax credits being paid out for fraudulent claims. Some exceptions are proposed to the payroll tax-based cap, so that the cap would not apply to credits resulting from eligible approved research provider expenditure and credits claimed by levy body researchers. There is a lower fraud risk associated with approved research provider expenditure and claims by levy bodies. This is because approved research providers have to be registered with Inland Revenue and have record-keeping obligations, and levy bodies are industry organisations empowered to collect levies under legislation (such as the Commodity Levies Act 1990). 30 Detailed analysis Tax exempt entity exclusion (sections LA 5(4B), LY 3(2)(f), LY 8(2B), CW 9, CW 10 and YA 1) It is proposed that from year two of the R&D tax credit regime, most tax-exempt ent ities will be ineligible for the R&D tax credit (so they will be unable to receive any R&D tax credits from year two). It is also proposed that any credits received by these entities in year one cannot be carried forward to year two but instead will be extinguished from the beginning of year two. The rationale behind this exclusion is that tax exempt entities sit outside the tax system, so should not benefit from incentives provided from within the tax system. Charit ies, which come within the tax-exempt entity exclusion, do not pay income tax, and receive additional Government support in the form of GST concessions, an exemption from FBT, and the donor tax credit regime. A carve-in is proposed for levy bodies and claimants whose only exempt income is fro m foreign or intercompany dividends under section CW 9 or 10. Claimants who receive exempt dividend income will typically be businesses who also derive assessable income and otherwise sit within the tax system. Levy bodies’ members are normally businesses, and these businesses fund R&D performed by the levy bodies for their benefit, so levy body R&D is fundamentally business R&D. Example 6: Charity’s year one credits extinguished In the year ended 31 March 2020, Charity X claims $100,000 of R&D tax credits. Charity X does not pay income tax, so it has no income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. It is not eligible for refundability, because Charity X receives exempt income. Charity X’s $100,000 of R&D tax credits are extinguished from 1 April 2020. Charity X ceases to be eligible for the R&D tax credit from this date. New payroll tax-based cap for refundability (sections LA 5(4B), LA 5(5B), LA 5(5C), YA 1) The proposed amendment to LA 5(4B) would replace the existing $255,000 cap with a payro ll tax-based cap. Under the payroll tax-based cap, a claimant that is unable to offset all of their R&D tax credits against their income tax liability would receive refundable R&D tax credits equal to or less than the amount of payroll taxes (PAYE, FBT, and ESCT) they have paid for the relevant income year. That is, the maximum amount of refundable R&D tax credits a person may claim in an income year is the lesser of: • The amount of payroll taxes paid by the person for the relevant income year; or • The amount of R&D tax credits claimed by the person. The proposed payroll tax-based cap would not apply to refundable R&D tax credits paid to levy body researchers or derived from eligible expenditure on approved research providers. 31 Example 7: Fully refundable credits (because payroll taxes paid exceed refundable credits claimed) In the year ended 31 March 2021, Edmonds Bros Ltd (EBL) has eligible R&D expenditure of $1,000,000, so is eligible for $150,000 of R&D tax credits. EBL has no income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. EBL has 10 full time employees and has paid payroll taxes of $200,000 for these employees. EBL is able to receive an R&D tax credit refund of $150,000, because its R&D tax credits are less than its total payroll taxes paid for the year. Edmonds Bros Ltd – 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure $1,000,000 x 15% R&D tax credits claimed $150,000 Income tax liability $0 Remaining R&D tax credits\* $150,000 Total payroll taxes paid $200,000 Remaining R&D tax credits\* $150,000 R&D tax credits refunded $150,000 \* after offsetting against income tax payable Example 8: Insufficient payroll taxes paid to refund all credits In the year ended 31 March 2021, Bags & Archie Ltd (BAL) has eligible R&D expenditure of $1,000,000, so is eligible for $150,000 of R&D tax credits. BAL has no income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. BAL has 5 full time employees and has paid payroll taxes of $100,000 for these employees. BAL is only able to receive an R&D tax credit refund of $100,000, because its R&D tax credits are more than its total payroll taxes paid for the year. Its remaining $50,000 of R&D tax credits must be carried forward to the 2021–22 income year. Bags & Archie Ltd – 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure $1,000,000 × 15% R&D tax credits claimed $150,000 Income tax liability $0 Remaining R&D tax credits\* $150,000 Total payroll taxes paid $100,000 Remaining R&D tax credits\* $150,000 R&D tax credits refunded $100,000 R&D tax credits carried forward to 2021–22 $50,000 \* after offsetting against income tax payable 32 Example 9: Credits paid to levy bodies are fully refundable Levy Body A (LBA) is an industry organisation to which levies are payable under the Commodity Levies Act 1990. LBA incurred $1,000,000 of eligible R&D expenditure in the year ended 31 March 2021. It has no income tax liability and pays $50,000 of payroll taxes for the year. LBA receives a full refund of its $150,000 R&D tax credits, because the payroll cap does not apply to levy body researchers. Levy Body A – 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure $1,000,000 × 15% R&D tax credits claimed $150,000 Income tax liability $0 R&D tax credits refunded $150,000 Allocating payroll taxes paid by other companies The proposed payroll tax-based cap would include payroll taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by other companies. This is through proposed new sections LA 5(5B) and (5C), which provide the formula for calculating the payroll tax-based cap: own payroll + other wholly-owned payroll + other controller payroll – double dip allocation Table 2: Definitions for the proposed formula Term Definition Own payroll The total payroll taxes paid by a claimant for the relevant tax year. Other wholly-owned payroll The amount of payroll taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by a member of the claimant’s wholly-owned group for the relevant tax year. Other controller payroll The amount of payroll taxes allocated to the claimant that have been paid by a company that controls the claimant for the relevant tax year. The “double-dip allocation” part of the formula strips out any amounts allocated to a claimant that have already been allocated to another person. This prevents the same payroll taxes going towards more than one claimant’s payroll tax-based cap. It is important that any given amount of payroll taxes is only allocated to one claimant. 33 Example 10: R&D company controlled by another company R&D Co is an R&D-intensive firm that is eligible for $300,000 of R&D tax credits in the 2020–21 income year. R&D Co is in a tax loss position, so does not have any income tax liability to offset its R&D tax credits against. R&D Co pays $50,000 of payroll taxes for the 2020–21 income year. The $50,000 is considered “own payroll” for the purposes of the formula. R&D Co is in the same wholly-owned group as B Co. B Co pays payroll taxes of $200,000 in the 2020–21 income year. B Co allocates $100,000 of its payroll taxes to R&D Co for the purposes of calculating R&D Co’s payroll tax-based cap. B Co does not allocate these payroll taxes to any other companies, and does not use the $100,000 for the purposes of calculating its own payroll tax- based cap. The $100,000 is considered “other wholly-owned payroll” for the purposes of the formula. R&D Co is controlled by A Co, which owns sixty five percent of the shares in R&D Co. A Co pays payroll taxes of $100,000 for the 2020–21 income year. A Co does not claim any R&D tax credits in the 2020–21 income year, so it decides to allocate all of its payroll taxes ($100,000) to R&D Co for the purposes of calculating R&D Co’s payroll tax-based cap. A Co does not allocate its payroll taxes to any other companies. The $100,000 is considered “other controller payroll” for the purposes of the formula. In summary, R&D Co’s payroll tax-based cap is made up of these amounts: • Own payroll: $50,000. • Other wholly-owned payroll: $100,000. • Other controller payroll: $100,000. • Double dip allocation: $0. Applying the formula: $50,000 + $100,000 + $100,000 − $0 = $250,000 Since R&D Co has a payroll-tax based cap of $250,000, it can obtain an R&D tax credit refund for $250,000 of its credits. Its remaining $50,000 of R&D tax credits are non-refundable in the 2020–21 income year. R&D Co can carry its non-refundable credits forward to the 2021–22 income year provided it satisfies the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity requirements. Ordering rules for R&D tax credits (section LA 5(4B)) The proposed amendment to section LA 5(4B) retains a reference to section LA 6(2), which relates to the treatment of refundable tax credits. It is proposed that any R&D tax credits claimed by a person must first be used to satisfy their income tax liability, if any, for the income year to which the credits relate (note that non-refundable R&D tax credits are applied to satisfy income tax liability before refundable R&D tax credits). Once a person has used their credits to satisfy their income tax liability for that year, different rules apply depending on whether any remaining R&D tax credits are refundable or non- refundable. 34 Table 3: Rules for treatment of remaining R&D tax credits Non-refundable credits Refundable tax credits Any remaining non-refundable tax credits can only be offset against income tax liabilities in the current year and must then be carried forward. Before any remaining refundable R&D tax credits can be refunded, the credits must first be applied to any other liabilities in this order: 1. An income tax liability for the current year; 2. An income tax liability for a previous year; 3. An income tax liability for a future tax year; 4. A current provisional tax liability for a future tax year; and 5. A different tax period or type (as requested by the claimant, or as applied by Inland Revenue if the claimant has any other tax outstanding). Example 11: Refundable credits from approved research provider expenditure and application of ordering rules In the year ended 31 March 2021, Kimmie’s Lab Ltd (KLL) incurred $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure. Of the $50,000 of eligible R&D expenditure, $30,000 was incurred on eligible R&D activities performed by an approved research provider. KLL had $2,000 of income tax payable for the year and did not pay any payroll taxes. KLL is eligible for $7,500 of R&D tax credits: • $4,500 of refundable R&D tax credits ($30,000 of approved research provider expenditure × 15%); and • $3,000 of non-refundable R&D tax credits ($20,000 of other eligible R&D expenditure). Before receiving an R&D tax credit refund, KLL’s R&D tax credits must first be offset against its income tax liability for the year. KLL offsets $2,000 of its non-refundable R&D credits against its income tax liability of $2,000. KLL receives an R&D tax credit refund of $4,500 for the income year. Its $1,000 of surplus non-refundable R&D tax credits can be carried forward to the 2021–22 income year provided KLL satisfies the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity requirements. Kimmie’s Lab Ltd – 31 March 2021 Eligible R&D expenditure on ARP $30,000 Other eligible R&D expenditure $20,000 Total eligible R&D expenditure $50,000 Eligible R&D expenditure not on ARP $20,000 × 15% Non-refundable R&D tax credits $3,000 Income tax liability $2,000 Less non-refundable R&D tax credits ($3,000) Non-refundable R&D tax credits carried forward to 2021–22 ($1,000) Eligible R&D expenditure on ARP $30,000 × 15% Refundable R&D tax credits $4,500 35 No corporate eligibility criteria for refundability (section LA 5(4B)) The proposed amendment to section LA 5(4B) would remove the corporate eligibility criteria (LA 5(4B)(a)(i)). The criteria currently restrict refundable tax credits to firms that: • are companies; • are New Zealand tax resident (both under domestic law and any applicable double tax agreements); • don’t have fifty percent or more of their shares held by a public or local authority, crown research institute, or state enterprise; • are not established by, or subject to, the Education Act 1989, the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, or the Crown Entities Act 2004; and • are not a listed company or otherwise listed on a recognised exchange. Removing the corporate eligibility criteria may bring the following claimants within the scope of refundability from year two: • all businesses regardless of their legal structure – including companies, partnerships, and trusts – provided they carry on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; • levy body researchers; • council controlled organisations and state enterprises; and • listed companies. No wage intensity criteria for refundability (section LA 5(4B)) The proposed amendment to section LA 5(4B) would also remove the wage intensity test (section LA 5(4B)(a)(ii)). Currently, the wage intensity test requires at least twenty percent of a firm’s labour costs to be R&D related. 36 TIMEFRAME FOR COMPLETING DISPUTES PROCESS (Clauses 122 and 123) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to allow the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards if the person has initiated the disputes process through issuing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) within four months of filing their income tax return or a year after their income tax return due date. Application date The proposed amendment would apply fro m a business’s 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that sections 108(1E) and 113E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended to allow the Commissioner to adjust a person’s R&D tax credit claim upwards if the person has initiated the disputes process through issuing a NOPA before the earlier of: • four months of filing their income tax return; or • a year after their income tax return due date. Background A person can only file a NOPA to increase their R&D tax credit claim once for each R&D tax credit claim they make (section 113E). The legislation currently requires the disputes process to be completed within a year of a person’s income tax return due date if the person seeks to increase their R&D tax credit claim. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is that a person must initiate the disputes process within a year of their income tax return date. The policy rationale for this rule is to prevent the retrospective reclassification of expenditure. The retrospective reclassification of expenditure includes where R&D activities or expenditure are identified after the end of an income year. If a person receives R&D tax credits for R&D they were unaware of at the time the R&D activities took place, the R&D tax credit regime has not provided any incentive to the person to undertake additional R&D. The retrospective reclassification of expenditure has been problematic in other jurisdictions. The proposed amendment will require a person to initiate the disputes process by filing a NOPA within a year of their income tax return due date but does not require the disputes process to be completed within this time frame. This time limit is intended to provide a person with enough time to prepare the required information to file a NOPA while nevertheless discouraging the retrospective reclassification of expenditure. 37 DECLINING R&D CERTIFIER APPLICATIONS (Clause 127(1) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to clarify the circumstances in which a person’s R&D certifier status will be declined. The amendment allows the Commissioner to decline a person’s application where approving the person as an accepted R&D certifier would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Application date The proposed amendment would apply fro m a business’s 2020–21 income year. Key features It is proposed that section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended so that the Commissioner can decline a person’s application to be an accepted R&D certifier, where approving the person’s application would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Background Accepted R&D certifiers are able to provide R&D certificates to claimants in the significant performer regime. From the 2020–21 income year, all claimants will be required to either obtain activity approval under the general approval regime or opt into the significant performer regime. Significant performers must provide R&D certificates to the Commissioner with their R&D supplementary returns (which are due within 30 days of a claimant’s income tax return due date). The proposed amendment provides the Commissioner with another ground for declining a person’s application to be an accepted R&D certifier. The amendment is consistent with the policy intent, which is that the Commissioner should be able to decline a person’s application where their status as an accepted R&D certifier would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. It is arguable that the Commissioner already has this ability because of section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the avoidance of doubt, however, this amendment clarifies that the Commissioner can decline a person’s application in these circumstances. 38 REVOKING R&D CERTIFIER APPROVALS (Clause 127(2) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to extend the circumstances in which the Commissioner can revoke a person’s accepted R&D certifier status. The amendment requires the Commissioner to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier where the accepted R&D certifier has provided an R&D certificate to another person in the last two years who has entered into a tax avoidance arrangement for R&D tax credits, or where allowing the accepted R&D certifier to retain their R&D certifier status would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Application date The proposed amendment would apply fro m a business’s 2020–21 income year. Key features It is proposed that section 124ZI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended so that in addition to the grounds under which the Commissioner can currently revoke a person’s approval, the Commissioner can also revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier where: • allowing the person to retain their approval would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system; or • the person has provided an R&D certificate to another person, and that other person has entered into a tax avoidance arrangement for R&D tax credits. Background Claimants in the significant performer regime must obtain an R&D certificate fro m an accepted R&D certifier. The proposed amendment to section 124ZI is consistent with the policy intent, which is not reflected in full by this provision as currently enacted. It provides the Commissioner with additional grounds to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier. Revoking approvals with adverse effect on tax system integrity As with the other remedial amendment to section 124ZI regarding declining a person’s application to be an accepted R&D certifier, the policy intent is that a person would have their approval revoked if their retaining it would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. It is arguable that the Commissioner already has this ability because of section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the avoidance of doubt, however, this amendment 39 clarifies that the Commissioner can revoke a person’s accepted R&D certifier status in these circumstances. Providing certificates to participants of tax avoidance arrangements The legislation currently allows the Commissioner to revoke a person’s approval as an accepted R&D certifier if they have provided an R&D certificate in the last two years to a person who received shortfall penalties arising from tax evasion and taking an abusive tax posit ion (this is through the references in section 124ZI(7)(b) to sections 141D and 141E). Tax avoidance may not always involve taking an abusive tax position, however, so this amendment is proposed so that providing an R&D certificate to a person who enters into a tax avoidance arrangement is another ground on which the Commissioner must revoke a person’s approval. 40 CHALLENGING THE COMMISSIONER’S DECISIONS (Clauses 128 and 145) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to prevent a person from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions made for the pilot approval scheme and exceeding the $120 million cap. Application date The proposed amendment would apply fro m a business’s 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that section 138E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended so that a person cannot challenge the Commissioner’s decisions made for the pilot approval scheme (see sections 68CB and 68CC) and exceeding the $120 million cap (section 68CD). Background Pilot approval scheme In year one of the R&D tax credit regime (the 2019–20 income year), a pilot approval regime will be in place. The pilot is aimed at enabling the Commissioner to test and refine the in- year approval regimes before they are rolled out more broadly in year two (the 2020–21 income year). To be a part of the pilot, both the Commissioner and a person must agree that the person will take part in the pilot. The person will be required to submit an approval application by a prescribed date, which the Commissioner will then approve or decline. There is a legislative requirement that the Commissioner notify the person of her intent to decline their application before declining it. This is to provide the person with an opportunity to provide additional information in support of their application where appropriate. It is proposed that taxpayers will not be able to challenge the Commissioner’s decisions made for the pilot approval scheme, other than through judicial review. Exceeding the $120 million cap There is a cap of $120 million on the amount of eligible R&D expenditure for which a person can claim R&D tax credits. This equates to a cap of $18 million R&D tax credits. A person can apply to exceed the $120 million cap by applying for an approved R&D cap. The Commissioner can approve an application for an approved R&D cap if she is: • satisfied the relevant R&D activities give rise to substantial net benefit for New Zealand; and 41 • she has consulted with the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Emplo yment. It is proposed that taxpayers will not be able to challenge the Commissioner’s decisions made about approved R&D caps. This is through adding section 68CD to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) from year one of the R&D tax credit regime. No right to challenge in other parts of R&D tax credit regime Section 138E currently prevents a person from challenging the Commissioner’s decisions made about: • approved research providers (sections 124ZH and 138E(1)(e)(iv)); • R&D certificates and certifiers 3 (sections 124ZI and 138E(1)(e)(iv)); • general approval 4 (sections 68CB and 138(1)(e)(iv)); and • the significant performer regime 5 (sections 68CC and 138E(1)(e)(iv)). Adding sections 68CB, 68CC and 68CD to section 138E(1)(e)(iv) from year one of the regime is consistent with the approach taken in the rest of the regime regarding decisions made by the Commissioner. It is also consistent with the policy intent, which is for decisions made by the Commissioner regarding the R&D tax credit to be final and not subject to challenge other than through judicial review. 3 These sections come into force in year two. 4 These sections come into force in year two. 5 These sections come into force in year two. 42 ALLOCATING CREDITS TO JOINT VENTURE MEMBERS (Clause 105) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to correct the allocation of R&D tax credits claimed for R&D activities performed by joint ventures, so that these credits are allocated in accordance with members’ interests in the joint venture rather than the members’ interest in the income of the joint venture. Application date The proposed amendment would apply fro m the 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that section LY 1(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 be amended so that credits are allocated in accordance with each member’s interest in the joint venture. This is to ensure the provision operates as intended for joint ventures regardless of whether they derive income. The onus will be on joint venture members to use an appropriate methodology to determine their interests in the joint venture for the relevant income year. Section LY 1(4) currently requires credits claimed for R&D act ivit ies performed by unincorporated joint ventures to be allocated in accordance with each member’s interest in the income of the joint venture. 43 INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE (Clause 113(5)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to broaden the definition of internal software development expenditure subject to the $25 million cap, so that it includes all software development expenditure that isn’t external software development or software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration. Application date The proposed amendment would apply fro m the 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that the definition of “internal software development expenditure” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 be amended because the current definition may not cover expenditure on all activities that would be normally considered internal software development (such as operational internal software development). The expanded definition would cover any software development expenditure that isn’t: • software development undertaken for the purpose of internal administration of a person’s business or their associate’s business (this comes within the existing definit ion o f “ineligible internal software development” in YA 1); or • external software development expenditure. Background “Internal software development expenditure” is currently defined in section YA 1 to: • include expenditure/loss incurred on developing software to provide services, if the main reason recipients of the software use the software is not to use the software or technology but rather the services themselves; and • exclude external software development expenditure (which is expenditure/loss incurred on developing software if the software is developed mainly for the purpose of sale/disposal to third parties, either in its own right or as an integral part of goods disposed of in the ordinary course of business). Without the proposed amendment, it is likely that contrary to the policy intent, some internal software development expenditure (such as operational internal software development expenditure) would either be completely excluded through the definition of ineligible internal software development or be completely uncapped. 45 Other policy and remedial changes 47 EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE (Clauses 69 and 71) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment expands the definition of “market value” in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) for the purposes of the employee share scheme (ESS) rules to include a 5-day “volume weighted average price” or an equivalent, and other methods accepted by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This will make it easier for companies to value their shares, reducing compliance costs and improving accuracy of valuations. Application date The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively from 29 September 2018 for the purposes of the general ESS rules, the date from which the reforms to the general ESS rules came into effect. For the purposes of the exempt ESS rules, the proposed amendment would apply from 29 March 2018, being the date the amendments to those rules came into effect. Key features Currently, the definition of “market value” in the ITA is the “middle market quotation”. For the purposes of valuing a share benefit received by an employee under the ESS rules, the definition will be expanded to include: • the 5-day volume weighted average price or a comparable measure; or • any other measure accepted by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (for example, one of the methods set out in the Commissioner’s statement Valuation of employee share schemes (CS 17/01)). Background For the purposes of valuing listed shares, “market value” is currently defined in section YA 1 of the ITA as being the “middle market quotation”. This is the average of the best buying and selling prices quoted by market makers, taken at the close of the market each day. Obtaining this middle market quotation is reported to be difficult in practice, and a much more common and practical measure is a “volume weighted average price”. This is equal to the total value of the shares traded divided by the number of shares traded over a particular time period. In her operational statement CS 17/01, the Commissioner accepts a 5-day volume weighted average price (among other methods) for valuing shares obtained under an ESS. Expanding the definition of “market value” for the purposes of the ESS rules to include these methods will make it easier for companies to value their shares and reduce compliance costs. 48 TAKEOVERS AND SIMILAR REORGANISATIONS UNDER EXEMPT EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES (Clause 70) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment adds an exception to the “restricted period” in the exempt employee share scheme (ESS) rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) for takeovers and similar reorganisations. Application date The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively from 29 March 2018, being the date the exempt ESS rules came into effect. Key features Section CW 26C(7) of the ITA is amended to add an exception to the restricted period for the case of takeovers or other similar share reorganisations that are outside the control of the employee and apply equally to all shares. Background In order for an exempt ESS to qualify as such, the terms of the scheme must provide that shares are held by the employer (or a trustee) for a period of time – generally three years – before they can be released to employees. Exempt ESS trust deeds and similar constituting documents often provide for takeovers and other corporate reorganisations. There is concern that if an exception to the restricted period for takeovers or similar share reorganisations is included in the constituting document, the scheme may fail to meet the exempt ESS criteria. There is also a concern that if a takeover does occur, which can include the shares of minority interests being compulsorily acquired, this could breach the restricted period and mean the scheme fails to meet the statutory criteria; the shares may then become taxable at that time. This is despite these events being outside the control of the employee. Adding an exception for takeovers and similar reorganisations to section CW 26C(7) of the ITA will ensure that companies and participating employees are not penalised for such uncontrollable events. 49 EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES – FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO KEEP SHARES IF THEY LEAVE EMPLOYMENT (Clause 70) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the exempt employee share scheme (ESS) rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) will allow companies to choose whether employees who leave the company voluntarily are permitted to keep their shares, or whether they must have their shares purchased back by the company for the lesser of cost or market value. This amendment broadly aligns the treatment of these so-called “bad leavers” under the New Zealand exempt scheme rules with Australian exempt scheme rules, which will make it easier for trans-Tasman companies to offer the same scheme in both countries. Application date The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively from 29 March 2018, being the date the exempt ESS rules came into effect. Key features It is proposed that section CW 26C(8) of the ITA be amended to allow companies to choose, in the case of bad leavers, whether their trust deed or similar constituting documentation provides that either: • employees can choose whether to keep the shares or have them bought back for the lesser of cost or market value; or • the trustee/company must buy the shares back for the lesser of cost or market value. Background Currently, upon expiry of the “restricted period” in section CW 26C(7), “good leavers” – employees whose employment ends due to their death, accident, sickness, redundancy, or retirement at normal ret iring age – or their estate, can choose whether to keep their shares in the company or have the trustee buy them back for the lesser of cost or market value. “Bad leavers” – employees who leave for other reasons (for example, going to work for a compet itor) – must have their shares bought back for the lesser of cost or market value. There is no option for the company to allow bad leavers to keep their shares. Therefore, there is less flexibility in the case of bad leavers. One objective of the 2018 amendments to the ESS rules was to allow trans-Tasman companies to offer Australian exempt schemes to their New Zealand employees. However, the Australian exempt scheme requires that bad leavers must be able to keep their shares. Since this conflicts with New Zealand’s rule for bad leavers, it is difficult for trans-Tasman companies to offer the same scheme in both countries. 50 While Australian schemes can be amended for New Zealand employees, so as to comply with the New Zealand rules, this carries compliance costs and means New Zealand employees have a commercially less favourable ESS than their Australian counterparts. Aligning New Zealand’s exempt scheme rules with Australia’s rules by allowing companies to choose whether bad leavers can keep their shares will make it significantly easier for trans- Tasman companies to offer their schemes in both countries. 51 SCHEDULE 32 OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS (Clause 114) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 by adding four charities to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2019. Key features It is proposed to add four charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donors to these charities will be eligible for tax benefits on their donations. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33⅓% of the monetary amount donated, up to the amount of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. Detailed analysis The four charitable organisations being added to schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities: Little Brothers and Sisters International Little Brothers and Sisters International has been set up to support and work in partnership with Alongsiders International, the latter has a mentorship programme in 15 Asian and African countries which is directed at keeping potentially at-risk children in established education programmes. Partners Relief and Development – New Zealand Partners Relief and Development – New Zealand was established in 2017 and works in association with a wider Partners Relief and Development network carrying out emergency relief and community development work in the developing world. It is active in South East Asia (Myanmar and Thailand) and the Middle East (Yemen and Syria). 52 Project Moroto Project Moroto was established in 2011 with the purpose of providing safe housing, upbringing, education and advancement of life to vulnerable or orphaned children in Uganda or other impoverished regions of Africa. UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated The UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand supports the work of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women through contributing funds raised in New Zealand for UN Women projects in developing countries worldwide, but particularly those in the Pacific region. 53 WIDENING THE COMMISSIONER’S POWER TO PUT INVESTORS ON THE CORRECT PRESCRIBED INVESTOR RATE (Clause 99) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would enable Inland Revenue to notify a multi-rate portfolio investment entity (PIE) of a tax rate to apply for an investor in that PIE, irrespective of whether the investor has advised the PIE of their notified investor rate or been defaulted on to the top 28% rate. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2020. Key features An amendment is proposed to the PIE rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow Inland Revenue to notify a multi-rate PIE where it is using an incorrect prescribed investor rate (PIR) for an investor and provide an alternative rate that the PIE must then use. Such an amendment would widen the existing power in section HM 60(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 which allows Inland Revenue to advise a PIE of an alternative tax rate to apply where an investor’s notified investor rate is different from their PIR (this provision currently does not cover investors who have been defaulted onto the top 28% PIE tax rate). Background The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 enacted changes meaning Inland Revenue is starting to receive more frequent employment and investment income information. One of the benefits of the timelier collection of income information is that Inland Revenue is better able to identify where an individual appears to be using an incorrect tax rate. This would include identifying instances where an investor’s PIE income is being taxed at an incorrect rate. Section HM 60(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows Inland Revenue to use the improved income information to provide an alternative tax rate to a multi-rate PIE that it must apply for an investor, where an investor has provided the PIE with a notified investor rate that is different from the investor’s actual PIR. However, Inland Revenue is currently unable to put an investor on their correct PIR where the investor has not notified the PIE of a tax rate to use in the first place and has been defaulted onto the top 28% rate. This means in many instances Inland Revenue would not be able to notify a PIE where an investor is being over- taxed. The PIE tax rules apply to collective investment vehicles, including KiwiSaver funds. Under the PIE rules an investor’s PIR is based on the lower amount of taxable income (plus PIE 54 income) that they derived in either of the previous two tax years. Investors are able to elect a tax rate for a PIE to apply (referred to as a “notified investor rate”). Where an investor has not notified the PIE of a tax rate, then the top 28% PIE tax rate will apply by default. Tax is paid by a multi-rate PIE based on the rates of its investors. Unless the investor has nominated a lower PIE tax rate than they should have, PIE tax is a final tax. Therefore, an investor will not get a refund for any overpayments – this includes situations where the investor is defaulted onto the top 28% rate and that rate is too high. Detailed analysis Proposed new section HM 60(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would allow Inland Revenue to notify a mult i-rate PIE where it is using an incorrect PIR for an investor, either where the investor has provided a notified investor rate to the PIE or the investor has been defaulted onto the top 28% rate and that rate is too high. Where Inland Revenue had notified a PIE that an investor was on an incorrect PIR, Inland Revenue would advise the PIE of an alt ernative tax rate that the PIE must use for the investor. These amendments would ensure Inland Revenue had the power to correct an investor’s tax rate, in all situations where an investor was on a tax rate that was different from their actual PIR. Proposed new section HM 60(7) clarifies that where subsequent to Inland Revenue advising the PIE of the tax rate, the investor advises the PIE that a different PIR should apply, the PIE should apply the rate subsequently advised by the investor. As a consequence of the proposed amendments, existing section HM 60(6) – relating to when an investor is defaulted onto the 28% PIE rate – will be re-ordered to become section HM 60(5). When PIE income treated as excluded income Under existing section CX 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007 PIE income derived by an individual investor in a multi-rate PIE will generally be treated as excluded income of the investor (as tax will have already been paid on this income at the investor’s tax rate by the PIE). An exception to this rule is where an investor has provided a notified investor rate to a PIE that is lower than the investor’s actual PIR. Section HM 60(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that in this situation the PIE income will not be treated as excluded income to the investor under section CX 56 and the investor will be required to include it in their individual income tax return. They would then be required to pay tax on the PIE income at their marginal tax rate (although they would receive a credit for tax on this income that had already been paid by the PIE). If Inland Revenue were to notify a PIE to apply a tax rate to an investor that was lower than their actual PIR the rule in section HM 60(4) would not apply, meaning that the PIE income would remain excluded income to the investor. 55 Clarifications and remedials 57 ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT TO ESTIMATE AT THE FINAL INSTALMENT DATE FOR PROVISIONAL TAX (Clauses 110 and 125(4)) Summary of proposed amendment This proposed amendment removes the requirement for taxpayers to switch to the estimate method at the final instalment of provisional tax when they believe their residual income tax for the year will be less than the standard instalments and retain the interest concession contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxpayers will continue to be able to pay what they consider is the amount remaining at the final instalment date without changing from the standard “uplift” method. This will reduce compliance costs to the taxpayer. Taxpayers who do estimate at any time during the income year will be subject to the standard use of money interest (UOMI) rules in section 120KB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and will potentially be subject to UOMI from the date of their first provisional tax instalment. In practical terms, this will not affect any taxpayers as they will continue to do what they always have, however, the method in which they do that will alter. Furthermore, the compliance costs of having to make an estimate will be removed. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2019–20 income year. Key features These changes will allow provisional taxpayers who use the standard method to pay provisional tax to pay an amount lower than the standard method obligation on the final instalment date without having to switch to the estimation method. Background The interest concession rules are contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, these rules essentially allow those taxpayers who use the standard method and make the required payments to have no exposure to UOMI until the day after the final provisional tax instalment is due for the year. This rule also applies to taxpayers who make the first two instalments using the standard method and make their final instalment under the estimation method. This rule was included in the final amending act due to a number of submissions made at the finance and expenditure committee which stated that if a person anticipated that their residual income tax (RIT) for the year in question was less than their uplifted provisional tax amount there was no legal ability for them to make a payment less than the standard instalment amount. This was 58 notwithstanding the UOMI calculation would have calculated UOMI correctly and no late payment penalty would have been charged. Example 12 Cookie Monsters Limited (Cookie) is a provisional taxpayer on a 31 March balance date who uses the standard uplift method. For the 2020–21 income year their standard instalments are based on 105% of their CY 6 -1 RIT which was $200,000. This gives them 3 instalments of $70,000. They pay both the first and second instalments on time on that basis but by the time the third instalment is due Cookie has calculated that due to the ongoing pressure from anti-obesity campaigns the market for their high sugar and fat content signature biscuit, “The Clogger”, has dramatically reduced. Cookie’s estimate of their 2020–21 RIT is $23,000 for the year. Cookie decides to estimate their final instalment of provisional tax and make no payment. Cookie will still be able to use the interest concession rules even though they estimated at their final instalment date. UOMI will apply from the date of the final instalment where its tax liability is more than payments made. This creates a compliance cost on taxpayers who then must switch provisional tax methods at their final instalment date and file an estimate. It also potentially exposes them to penalties for lack of reasonable care in making a reasonable estimate. Detailed analysis The proposed changes will allow taxpayers who make provisional tax payments under the standard method to vary their final instalment payment from the standard instalment to whatever they consider is owing at that date without having to switch provisional tax methods. As UOMI will apply to any shortfall from the final instalment date taxpayers are always incentivised to pay their “actual” liability at that date and given the final instalment is some time after their balance date taxpayers should be able to reasonably accurately approximate the final amount payable. The ability to use the estimation method will be removed from the interest concession rules in section 120KBB and therefore if a taxpayer estimates at any point during the year they will be under the estimation method for the entire year and potentially subject to UOMI from the date of the first instalment. Practically, this will make no difference to taxpayers as they will continue to do the same as they always have but the compliance cost of switching provisional tax methods will be removed. 6 CY = Current year. 59 CLARIFYING THE “LESSER OF” CALCULATION OF INTEREST FOR STANDARD “UPLIFT” TAXPAYERS (Clause 109(2) and (3)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies the legislation to reflect the application of the “lesser of” calculation for standard “uplift” taxpayers to ensure this aligns with the way in which UOMI is calculated in Inland Revenue’s technology platforms. 7 Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2018–19 income year as the amendment aligns the legislation with the treatment within Inland Revenue’s systems. The proposed amendment is concessionary compared to the current legislation. Key features The proposed amendment aligns the application of the “lesser of” calculation of UOMI for standard “uplift” taxpayers with the way that Inland Revenue’s technology platforms have been calculating UOMI for those taxpayers. The proposed amendment provides that less UOMI is calculated than under the current legislation. Background For taxpayers who qualify to be able to use the interest concession rules contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, UOMI is calculated on a different basis than for other taxpayers. Generally, a taxpayer will be exposed to UOMI on the difference between their actual liability for the year divided by the number of instalments and what they paid. For example, a taxpayer who has residual income tax 8 (RIT) of $90,000 and has paid nothing will be charged interest on $30,000 at each instalment date (that is, $90,000 ÷ 3). The interest concession rules operate differently and calculate UOMI (and late payment penalties) based on a “lesser of” rule contained in section 120KBB(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This calculates UOMI on the difference between the lesser of the amount of the standard method instalment and the actual liability divided by the number of instalments. For example, if a taxpayer has an actual RIT of $40,000 at each instalment and their standard uplift instalments were $30,000 at each instalment date. UOMI for interest concession taxpayers will be charged on the $30,000 amounts less the amount paid at each instalment date (except for the final instalment which will have UOMI charged on the outstanding balance of RIT less payments made to date). 7 Inland Revenue’s technology platforms are FIRST (Future Inland Revenue Systems and Technology), the heritage platform, and START (Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology), the new platform. 8 Residual Income Tax is the amount of tax liability after tax credits such as PAYE and RWT have been deducted. 60 Detailed analysis The standard “uplift” provisional tax method allows taxpayers to base their provisional tax instalments for the year on 105% of the prior year’s (CY 9 -1) RIT or 110% of the year previous to the prior year (CY-2) dependent on when they have filed their CY-1 tax return. Up until the taxpayer files their CY-1 return a taxpayer will use 110% of the CY-2 RIT (init ial uplift). When they file their CY-1 return and 105% of that RIT (the final uplift) is more than the initial uplift the system leaves the previous instalments at the initial uplift. The reason for this is that at that time the taxpayer made that payment, the only information they had to base the payment on was the initial uplift. However, if the taxpayer files their CY-1 return and the final uplift is less than the initial uplift the system overwrites the initial uplift amount and replaces it with the lower final uplift amount. This is on the basis that once the taxpayer has filed their CY-1 return there is no ability to use the initial uplift and the final uplift effectively replaces that. Logically these two rules make sense. If the initial uplift is lower than the final uplift, it should be used as it would be unfair to require a taxpayer to make a payment based on figures they had not yet calculated. Alternatively, if the final uplift is lower than the initial uplift that should replace the initial uplift as, firstly the taxpayer would have used that amount if they had known it at the time and, secondly, once that final uplift is known the initial uplift technically is no longer available. This rule will apply to instalments prior to the date the taxpayer files their CY-1 return (that is, the return with the final uplift). Prior to the introduction of the interest concession rules this rule generally only mattered for the calculation of late payment penalties. Since the interest concession rule was introduced this distinction is more important as it affects the calculation of UOMI. As the lower of the two amounts is taken into account this treatment is taxpayer friendly, however, the distinction does matter when taxpayers transfer funds from a tax pool as they want to ensure they are making the correct transfer to avoid the payment of UOMI. Inland Revenue’s legal team has determined that the legislation is not clear on this rule. The proposed amendment will clarify the legislation to ensure that the lowest amount of the initial or final uplift is used for the purposes of calculating UOMI and late payment penalties for instalments made prior to the date the taxpayer files the CY-1 tax return. This rule does not change the obligation to pay either the initial or final uplift amounts in that if the taxpayers final uplift is less than their initial uplift they were still required to pay the initial uplift amount notwithstanding UOMI may not be charged on that basis. This will be important in determining if a taxpayer is an interest concession taxpayer if they are subsequently subject to a reassessment. Both the FIRST and START systems apply this rule and thus the amendment will not affect taxpayers, but it will align the legislation with the system and policy intent. 9 CY= Current year. 61 CLARIFYING THE APPLICATION OF LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES APPLICABLE FROM THE FINAL PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENT DATE (Clauses 124 and 130) Summary of proposed amendment An inadvertent legislative change meant that late payment penalties are applied to a taxpayer’s total provisional tax liability for the year rather than an instalment amount on the final instalment date. This proposed amendment aligns the legislation with administrative practice and with policy intention. As such, it will have no effect on taxpayers. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2017–18 income year to provide certainty to taxpayers. Key features This change will align the legislation with Inland Revenue’s systems to ensure that late payment penalties are only calculated on an instalment amount at the date of the final instalment of provisional tax for the year rather than on the total outstanding tax liability at that date. UOMI will continue to accrue on the total tax liability outstanding. This change will align the legislation with the policy intent and the system configuration of Inland Revenue’s technology platforms. Detailed analysis The interest concession rules are contained in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994, these rules essentially allow those taxpayers who use the standard method and make the required payments to have no exposure to UOMI until the day after the final provisional tax instalment is due for the year. When the interest concession rules were introduced it was seen as desirable to align the basis for the calculation of UOMI and late payment penalties. This was done in the legislation and for the instalments other than the final one this is working as intended as both UOMI and late payment penalties are calculated using the lower of the standard instalment (105% of CY-1 or 110% of CY-2) or one third of their current year RIT. However, on the final instalment the legislation currently requires the same formula to be used to calculate UOMI and the late payment penalty amount. 10 For the calculation of UOMI all of the taxpayer’s remaining tax liability is deemed to be due at the date of the third instalment as UOMI applies to that amount from the day after that date. 10 Note that for the final instalment taxpayers cannot use 110% of the year previous to the prior year as they must have filed their prior year return before the date of this payment. 62 However, for late payment penalties this basis is inappropriate as charging a taxpayer for their entire RIT at that final instalment date is particularly unfair where they do not necessarily know the exact amount due. The basis for the penalty should be the lower of the instalment amount or one third of the taxpayer’s RIT. The legislation currently does not support this. Late payment penalties should only apply to an instalment amount rather than the total tax liability at that point although UOMI should apply on the full shortfall. Inland Revenue’s systems have not been configured to reflect the legislation but have been configured to reflect the policy intent to charge a penalty based on the lower of the instalment amount or one third of the taxpayers RIT – the same basis as the other instalments. It is desirable to align the legislation with the system in this case and change the legal basis for the calculation of the penalty on the final instalment to be the lower of the standard instalment due or one third of the taxpayer’s RIT. In addition, the definit io n of RIT for the purposes of calculating UOMI will be clarified to ensure it more clearly refers to the taxpayer’s current year RIT. 63 REMOVING THE ABILITY FOR TAXPAYERS TO CHOOSE THE PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENT TO WHICH A PARTICULAR PAYMENT IS APPLIED (Clause 126) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a provision that permits a taxpayer to direct the application of a provisional tax payment made to a particular instalment. Inland Revenue’s legal team has recently reviewed the application of this provision. Prior to the introduction of the interest concession rules in section 120KBB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the removal of incremental penalties from income tax it was always beneficial for taxpayers to apply payments to the oldest debt first. Since the introduction of the interest concession rules and removal of incremental penalties this is no longer true. A taxpayer might now inappropriately apply the payment to more recent debt in order to avoid late payment penalties. Removing the ability of taxpayers to choose the particular instalment to allocate a provisional tax payment will eliminate this issue. It is also proposed that the section be clarified to specifically require the Commissioner to allocate the particular payment to the oldest debt first. Inland Revenue’s systems do not allow the allocation of a payment to particular payment dates when there is debt on a prior provisional tax date. This proposed amendment will have no impact on most taxpayers but will prohibit non- compliant taxpayers from reducing their exposure to late payment penalties. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2018–19 income year for integrity reasons. In the unlikely event of a taxpayer having previously requested and obtained a payment direction a savings provision will preserve this treatment. 11 Key features The ability for taxpayers to allocate their provisional tax payment to particular instalments will be removed and the Commissioner will be required to allocate payments to the oldest outstanding provisional tax instalment. 11 This is an unlikely event as the FIRST system does not support this type of payment allocation. 64 Detailed analysis The payment allocation rules for provisional tax payments are contained in section 120L of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These provide that if a taxpayer makes a provisional tax payment and does not specify which instalment it should be directed to, the Commissioner must apply the payment where she thinks the taxpayer would have applied it. 12 Or if the taxpayer does specify which instalment, the Commissioner must apply the payment to that particular instalment. 13 Prior to the inclusion of the interest concession rules and removal of incremental late payment penalties 14 from income tax it was always beneficial to apply payments to the oldest debt first as this would reduce the taxpayer’s liability to both incremental penalties and UOMI. Since the interest concession rules were introduced it can be more advantageous for taxpayers to allocate their payments to specific provisional tax instalments to reduce their liability to late payment penalties on later instalments. Example 13 Grouchy Limited is owned by Oscar and is a provisional taxpayer for the 2020–21 year. Its instalments are $25,000 at each provisional tax instalment. Oscar is a bit cash strapped and fails to pay the first instalment of provisional tax for Grouchy. Grouchy is charged a late payment penalty on the $25,000 debt of $1,250 as well as UOMI for that debt. At the second instalment date Grouchy has a spare $25,000 and decides to make a payment as provisional tax. Prior to the removal of incremental penalties and the interest concession rules it would be more beneficial for Oscar to allocate that payment of $25,000 to the first instalment of provisional tax to reduce both incremental penalties and UOMI on that outstanding debt. Subsequent to the changes Oscar now considers it more advantageous to allocate that payment to the second instalment. This will avoid any late payment penalties or UOMI arising on that payment. Given that there are no further late payment penalties on the debt from the first instalment and only UOMI is accruing on that, he will be $1,250 better off by allocating the payment to the second instalment. This example is not appropriate. It gives a benefit to taxpayers who have outstanding debt. In addition, both the FIRST system and the configuration of the START system cannot allocate payments in this manner. The proposed amendments remove the ability for taxpayers to request which provisional instalment their payment is allocated to. This will remove the ability for non-co mpliant taxpayers to reduce their exposure to late payment penalties and UOMI. In addition, it is recommended that a provision be added to the legislation to require the Commissioner to apply payments to the oldest unpaid instalment first. 12 Section 120L(2)(b). 13 Section 120L(2)(a). 14 Incremental late payment penalties applied at 1% for each month the debt was outstanding. These were removed from income tax from 1 April 2018. Thus, the only late payment penalties that apply to income tax are the initial penalty of 1% the day after the due date and 4% seven days after the due date. 65 CLARIFYING THE WAY IN WHICH PROVISIONAL TAX IS TRUNCATED TO WHOLE DOLLARS (Clause 110) Summary of proposed amendment It is Inland Revenue’s operational practice to truncate provisional tax amounts to whole numbers and its technology platforms have been designed in keeping with that practice. However, Inland Revenue’s legal team has concluded that the way in which its technology platforms truncates instalments to whole numbers is not consistent with the legislation. Inland Revenue’s systems have been configured to apply these rules on truncated whole dollars and will not prevent taxpayers receiving a concession when partial dollars are truncated. The proposed amendment confirms that configuration. In practical terms, this amendment will not affect any taxpayers. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2019–20 income year. Key features The proposed amendment would confirm that where Inland Revenue systems truncate provisional tax amounts to whole numbers, payment of those whole dollar amounts rather than the amount including cents will be considered to meet the requirements to take advantage of concessionary regimes such as the safe harbour. Detailed analysis Truncating to whole dollars for any instalment is beneficial to taxpayers both through simplicity and marginally financially. However, it can have negative consequences when assessing whether taxpayers meet certain requirements, such as the safe harbour 15 from UOMI. If cents are included and taxpayers pay the truncated whole dollar amount which the system has told them to pay, technically, they do not meet the requirements of the safe harbour. Inland Revenues legal team has recently reviewed the legislation that deals with the calculation of provisional tax instalments and the application of UOMI to any shortfalls. One of their conclusions is that the legislation and the system do not align for the way in which amounts are truncated. When provisional tax instalments are calculated under the standard method the legislation requires the uplifted amount to be divided into three equal 15 The safe harbour includes taxpayers with RIT of less than $60,000 who have made the required standard instalments. In this case UOMI will not start until the terminal tax date (usually 7 February the following year). 66 instalments. For simplicity to taxpayers the system ignores, or truncates, any cents in that calculation. For example, assume that Grover Limited is a provisional taxpayer who uses the standard uplift method. Their RIT for the 2020–21 income year was $124,567. This will make their standard method uplift amount for the following year $130,795.35. Grover’s three instalments will be calculated as follows: Table 4: Truncation calculation example Instalment Calculation Amount of instalment Truncated amount 1 $130,795.35 ÷ 3 $43,598.45 $43,598 2 ($130,795.35 × (2 ÷ 3)) − $43,598.45 $43,598.45 $43,598 3 ($130,795.35 − $43,598.45 - $43,598.45) $43,598.45 $43,599 Total $130,795.35 $130,795 However, to determine whether a taxpayer has met the criteria for the interest concession rules, for example, technically the taxpayer should have paid the instalment outlined in the amount of instalment column in table 4, which is $43,598.45. The system does not use this amount and assesses the ability to use concessions based on the truncated whole number. This is a taxpayer friendly treatment and is much simpler. This proposed amendment would align the legislation with the system to ensure that taxpayers are not prohibited from using a concession because they have not paid the cents for an instalment. 67 NON-STANDARD PROVISIONAL TAX INSTALMENTS (Clause 129) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment was made to section 139B(6)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 when the interest concession rules in section 120KBB were inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure the definitions worked with the new rules. A taxpayer that has more or less than three instalments of provisional tax, were not correctly dealt with and this should be corrected for clarity. Application date The proposed amendment would apply fro m the 2019–20 income year. Key features This proposed amendment alters section 139B(6)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to account for taxpayers who have a non-standard number of instalments of provisional tax. Detailed analysis When the interest concession rules were introduced in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 a late change was made to the legislation to deal with taxpayers who had more or less than three instalments of provisional tax. A number of references were correctly altered in the final Act to account for this change, however, one appears to have been missed. A definition in section 139B(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was not updated for the inclusion of these taxpayers and still refers to three instalments of provisional tax. While this has not adversely affected any taxpayers as Inland Revenue has applied that section as it was intended officials suggest this now be corrected to account for taxpayers who have more or less than three provisional tax instalments from the 2019–20 income year. 68 TAXATION OF TRUSTS (Clauses 59, 87 to 97, and 113(16) to (20)) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments arise from an administrative review of the taxation of trusts which identified several areas in the current law that are unclear or do not appropriately reflect the policy intent. The proposed amendments are: • remedial in nature; and • clarify the trust rules so that they work as intended, as described in IS 18/01. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from the date of enactment unless otherwise stated in this commentary item. Detailed analysis The Commissioner’s application of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) relating to the taxation of trustees and beneficiaries (the trust rules) is set out in Interpretation statement IS 18/01 Taxation of trusts – income tax 16 (IS 18/01). Clause 59: Clarifying the relationship between section BB 2 and BF 1 The core provisions of the ITA (the core provisions) impose: • income tax on taxable income, withholding taxes on some classes of income and other forms of tax (termed ancillary tax); and • provide the method for calculating a person’s income tax liability links to parts of the Act that set out detailed mechanisms for calculating withholding tax and ancillary taxes. The proposed amendment ensures that the wording in section BB 2(5) refers to both income tax and ancillary tax, to provide consistency in terminology between sections BB 2(5) and BF 1 (ITA 2007). Clause 87: Residence of a trustee treated as a notional single person In the ITA 2007, the term trustee is defined to include all co-trustees for the time being. Under section HC 2 of the ITA, co-trustees are treated as a notional single person for satisfying the income tax obligations for trustee income of that trust. 16 https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/resources/2/9/2999de34-26c3-4ac3-bdb3-cad3e97c3cd6/is18-01.pdf 69 Under the core provisions, the source of the income and the residence of the trustee are important for determining the income tax obligations for trustee income. These obligations are determined by either: • the residence of the trustee (a New Zealand resident trustee is taxable on world-wide trustee income); • the source of the income (New Zealand taxes income sourced in New Zealand); • the residence of the settlor, if the trust derives foreign sourced income (New Zealand taxes foreign sourced income only if the settlor of the trust is a New Zealand resident). Under IS 18/01 and Interpretation statement 16/03: Tax residence 17 (IS 16/03), the Commissioner considers that the current law treats co-trustees as resident in New Zealand as follows: • at any point in time, or for a period, the trustee (as a notional single person) is a New Zealand resident if at least one of the co-trustees is resident in New Zealand at that time or for that period; and • correspondingly, the trustee (as a notional single person) is a non-resident only if all the co-trustees are non-resident at that time or for that period. The proposed amendments to section HC 2 align the law with how the Commissioner applies the law. As a result, the residence of co-trustees is determined (as described above) for: • calculating the trust’s taxable income for an income year; • providing a joint return of income for the trust for each income year; • assessing the trust’s taxable income and income tax liability for each income year; • satisfying the income tax liability on trustee income of the trust for each income year; and • satisfying the trustee’s obligations as an agent under section HC 32 for a distribution of beneficiary income and a taxable distribution. Application date The proposed amendment would apply for income years beginning after enactment date. Clause 88: Corpus of a trust What is not included in corpus The proposed amendment to section HC 4(1) clarifies that if a settlement is not capable of being distributed as income to beneficiaries, it cannot be included in the corpus of the trust, that is, the assets such as property, bank accounts, stocks, etc. 17 https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/resources/9/2/9227e1f5-aaac-4bab-8bf1-5ef527fd4441/IS+1603.pdf 70 For example, the value of free legal services provided to a trustee for the benefit of the trust is a transfer of value (unless those services are incidental to the operation of the trust). Under current law, the value of those free services: • the person providing the legal services is a settlor of the trust (the residence of the settlor is important for determining whether a trust is a foreign trust); • constitute a settlement; and • is not capable of being distributed. Consistency with section HC 3 (ITA) Under trust law, each settlement creates a separate trust. For income tax purposes, this is modified to permit trustees to elect to treat multiple property settlements on the terms of a trust deed as being additions to corpus of the same trust (section HC 3 of the ITA). The value of each settlement is equal to the market value at settlement. The proposed amendment (new section HC 4(1B)) clarifies that, when a trustee treats multiple property settlements as being on one trust, the total value of corpus is the market value of all those property settlements. This clarification: • is consistent with practice; and • ensures that the ordering rules for distributions (section HC 16 of the ITA) can be applied in a manner consistent with the ability of trustees to elect for multiple settlements to be treated as being on one trust for income tax purposes. Clause 89: Exclusions from corpus that are treated as trustee income The policy purpose for excluding property settlements from corpus under section HC 7(3) is to mitigate against a deferral of tax. The proposed amendment clarifies that when a settlement excluded from corpus it is included in trustee income for the income year in which the settlement occurred unless the income is distributed in the same income year to a beneficiary. The amendment is proposed to apply from 1 April 2008 to validate tax parties taken on this basis. If the trustee distributes this income as beneficiary income or a taxable distribution in the same income year (which is taxed to the beneficiary), the amount of trustee income for a settlement excluded from corpus is reduced by the amount of that distribution. The proposed amendment applies to the following types of resettlements so that the beneficiary and not the trustee is taxed if that re-settlement is distributed to a beneficiary in the same year: • A re-settlement by a trustee on a sub-trust that could otherwise have been distributed as income that would be taxable to a New Zealand resident beneficiary. • A settlement that is an allowable deduction for the settlor (for example, an employer’s contribution to a trust that provides non-retirement benefits for employees). • A settlement that would otherwise be income of the settlor and assessable for income tax in New Zealand. 71 Clause 90: Election to be a complying trust The proposed amendment to section HC 10(1)(ab) clarifies the point in time from when a trust may be treated as a complying trust if an election has been made to pay New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income. The main clarification is that a trust will be a complying trust for a distribution of trustee income earned after the application date of election. Under the proposed amendments to section HC 33 in clause 97, a trust may elect to alter its status from a foreign trust or a non-complying trust to become a complying trust, but only from the date from which the election applies. The proposed amendment confirms that a complying trust is eit her: • a trust that has always had a New Zealand resident settlor and has always satisfied its New Zealand tax obligations on its taxable income; or • a trust that has elected (or is deemed to have elected) to pay New Zealand tax at the trustee rate on world-wide trustee income and from the date the election applies, the trust has always satisfied its New Zealand tax obligations for its taxable income. This proposed clarification, together with the proposed amendments to section HC 33 (clause 97 refers), ensures that the taxation of distributions from a trust operates as intended for tax- paid trustee income and capital gains. Clause 91: Taxable distributions from foreign trusts and non-complying trusts Clause 91(1): Source of a capital gain included in a taxable distribution A distribution (other than beneficiary income) from a trust that is not a complying trust is subject to tax because it may consist of income and gains derived by the trustee that have never been subject to New Zealand tax. This rule ensures that New Zealand tax cannot be avoided by sheltering income and capital gains in a foreign trust or in a trust that is non-compliant with New Zealand’s tax laws. Instead, when this sheltered income or gain is distributed to a beneficiary, the distribution is taxable to the beneficiary and the trustee is liable as agent to pay this tax. Such a distribution is termed a taxable distribution. A taxable distribution may consist of tax-paid trustee income and certain capital gains arising in a year before the distribution is made. Ordering rules in section HC 16 determine the composition of a taxable distribution. Some clarifications for these ordering rules are discussed in the commentary item for clause 92. A taxable distribution is treated as: • income of the beneficiary, if it is distributed from a foreign trust and included in the calculation of the beneficiary’s assessable income and taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal rate of tax; 72 • excluded income of the beneficiary, if it is distributed from a non-complying trust. This amount is not included in the beneficiary’s assessable income but is instead subject to a special income tax at the rate of 45%; and • for both cases, a non-resident beneficiary is not taxable on a foreign-sourced amount included in that taxable distribution. Proposed new section HC 15(5C) of the ITA clarifies that the source of a capital gain included in a taxable distribution is determined by applying the source rules in section YD 4 of the ITA that apply to income. This clarifies that a non-resident beneficiary will not be taxed on a capital gain included in a taxable distribution if that capital gain is not sourced in New Zealand. This is because New Zealand taxes non-resident beneficiaries only on their income and gains sourced from New Zealand. Clause 91(2): Taxable distribution not subject to the ordering rule The proposed amendment to subsection HC 15(6) removes redundant wording relating to the tax consequences of distribution, transmission and gifts of property. These rules treat distributions of property from a trust as being made at market value and the omitted words are no longer necessary. However, the provision of financial assistance or any services by the trust to beneficiaries at less than market value continues to be a taxable distribution in the year of the distribution (for example, rent-free house accommodation provided to a beneficiary of the trust). Such a distribution is not subject to the ordering rules in section HC 16. Clause 92: Ordering rules Clause 92(1) to (5): Order of distributions The current ordering rules in section HC 16 of the ITA determine the amounts of tax-paid trustee income, capital gains and corpus that are included in a distribution to a beneficiary fro m eit her a foreign trust or a non-complying trust. The ordering rules do not apply to a distribution from a complying trust. The current ordering rule is unclear on how a distribution of beneficiary income from a prior year is to be treated. This is because the ITA gives a trustee a period after the end of the income year to determine the amount of beneficiary income and provide for the distribution of that income. The proposed amendments to section HC 16(2) of the ITA ensure that distributions of beneficiary income in the preceding and current years are treated as intended. Clause 92(6), (7): Manipulating the nature of a distribution Section HC 16(5) of the ITA is intended to prevent trustees using the ordering rule to manipulate the nature of a distribution for New Zealand tax purposes to stream income and capital to different classes of beneficiary (for example, resident and non-resident beneficiaries). The rule ignores the tax effect of an earlier distribution in determining whether a subsequent distribution would not be treated as either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. 73 The proposed amendments address a question raised about whether the rule should apply to genuine transactions that result in a distribution of beneficiary income that is not placed beyond the control of the trustee. A normal practice for trustees is to credit a beneficiary’s current account for an amount of beneficiary income. However, this practice does not necessarily result in that amount of beneficiary income being placed beyond the control of the trustee, even though the amount of income that has been vested in the beneficiary. The proposed amendments to section HC 16(5) clarify that the provision: • applies to a second distribution that is not treated as either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution; and • removes the requirement that the distribution be placed beyond the control of the trustee to ensure that commercial practices for vested distributions are not disturbed. Clause 93: Foreign sourced income, resident trustees The proposed amendment to section HC 26 of the ITA addresses a question raised about the scope of the exemption for foreign sourced income derived by a resident trustee during an income year for a trust that does not have a New Zealand resident settlor at any time during that year. The proposed amendment clarifies that foreign sourced income derived by such a trustee will be exempt income only if it is retained as trustee income. Therefore, the exemption will not extend to either: • foreign sourced income that is distributed as beneficiary income; or • minor beneficiary income that is attributed back to the trustee and taxed as if it were trustee income (33% tax rate applies). Clause 94: Who is a settlor – direct or indirect settlements The administrative review of the taxation of trusts identified uncertainty about the scope of section HC 27 that deems a person to be a settlor of a trust for a series of transactions that result in a transfer of value to a trust. The proposed amendment clarifies that for a person to be a settlor for an indirect transfer of value to a trust, that person must have some influence or control over the transactions involved so that it can be said that the person causes the transfer or provision to occur. IS 18/01 indicates at paragraph 2.62 a causative factor is more likely to occur where associated parties are involved. Clause 95: Activities treated as those of a settlor The proposed amendments to section HC 28 clarify when a shareholder of a controlled foreign co mpany (CFC) is treated as a settlor. If a CFC has settled a trust, it is intended that a shareholder in the CFC is also treated as a settlor of that trust if the shareholder has a control interest of at least ten percent in the CFC either: • at the time of the settlement; or • for the accounting period of the CFC in which the settlement occurs. 74 The proposed amendment aligns the law with the policy intent and is consistent with the Commissioner’s practice set out in IS 18/01. Clause 96: Valuation for transfer of values by deferral or non-exercise of right to demand payment The proposed amendment (which inserts a new section HC 31B) addresses a question raised during the administrative review of the taxation of trusts relating to the valuation of financial assistance provided if there is: • an obligation to repay interest or principal on demand; • and the right to demand repayment is not exercised or is deferred. The proposed new section provides a formula for calculating the value of either a settlement under section HC 27(2)(b) or a distribution arising from a transfer of value, in either case arising fro m: • the provision of financial assistance (including a guarantee) by one person (the creditor) for the benefit of another person; and • the right of the creditor to demand the debt amount, or a guarantee, is not exercised or is deferred. The proposed formula is like the calculation of the value of a fringe benefit for on-demand shareholder current accounts and is consistent with the recent law change proposed for section HC 27(5) (see clause 56 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The formula is based on the nominal value of the financial assistance given (the debt amount) and the prescribed interest rate. The value of the distribution or settlement for any period (for example, an income year) is the amount by which the prescribed rate of interest (currently 5.77%) exceeds the actual rate of interest payable for the financial assistance. If a trustee owes an amount to a beneficiary of the trust, the beneficiary will not be a settlor of the trust if either of the following applies: • the trustee pays interest at a rate equal to or greater than the prescribed rate of interest; or • the amount owing at the end of the income year is not more than $25,000. Clause 97: Elections to pay New Zealand tax on worldwide trustee income Redundant wording omitted Clause 97(1) proposes the removal of redundant wording from section HC 33(1B), consequential to other proposed amendments in this clause. 75 Notification requirements Clause 97(2) proposes a clarification to section HC 33(1B) that treats a notification of complying trust status in a return of income as an election to pay New Zealand tax on the trust’s worldwide trustee income. This deemed election applies to a trust that derives income that would either not be taxed in New Zealand or not be taxed at the trustee rate (33%) on any of the following classes of income: • non-resident passive income (for example, dividends and interest derived by a non- resident trustee from a New Zealand source); • non-resident’s foreign sourced income (for example, rents derived by a non-resident trustee from a foreign source); or • foreign sourced income that is exempt income of a resident trustee under section CW 54 (the exemption applies to trustee income if the trust does not have a settlor resident in New Zealand). The deemed election applies in any year in which the classes of income described above are not fully taxed in New Zealand. An example of such a trust is one that does not have a resident settlor because the settlor has migrated from New Zealand and the trust was a complying trust up to the migration. Because this trust no longer has a New Zealand resident settlor, it might not satisfy the requirements of section HC 10(1)(a) to be a complying trust because for example: • if the trust has a non-resident trustee, foreign sourced income would not automatically be taxable in New Zealand under the rule in section HC 25 (a trust with a resident settlor is taxable on its world-wide trustee income); • if the trust has a resident trustee, foreign sourced income may become exempt under section CW 54 (a trust with a non-resident settlor is taxable only on income sourced from New Zealand). Under current law, this deemed election ensures that when a New Zealand resident settlor of a complying trust migrates out of New Zealand, the trust’s complying trust status is not disturbed provided the return of income from the year of migration indicates the trust is a complying trust and the trustee continues to pay New Zealand tax on the worldwide trustee income. The proposed amendment clarifies that the deemed election can also apply to a registered foreign charitable trust, as such a trust is required to file an annual return of income for periods ending after 1 April 2019. A trust that has previously elected to pay New Zealand tax on its world-wide trustee income may become an inactive trust. An inactive trust is a trust that derives no income, has no deductions, and makes not distributions to beneficiaries that are income of the beneficiary. An inactive trust may wish to retain this complying trust status after the trust notifies the Commissioner it has non-active status. The proposed amendment clarifies that such a trust must notify the Commissioner on an annual basis that the election to pay New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income is to 76 continue. This requirement is to draw the trustee’s attention to the requirements for being a non-active trust, and to assist the Commissioner in identifying whether any distribution from such a trust is from a complying trust. It is expected that this requirement will be satisfied by notifying the commissioner through the trustee’s MyIR account. Election requires taxable income to be calculated on world-wide trustee income at the trustee rate Clauses 97(3) and (4) propose a clarification in new section HC 33(1C) to ensure that if an election is made for a trust to pay tax on its world-wide trustee income, it must calculate its taxable income: • as if it had both a New Zealand resident trustee and a New Zealand resident settlor; and • the obligations for New Zealand income tax on world-wide trustee income must be satisfied on that basis. The interaction between the proposed amendments in HC 10 (clause 90), HC 33(1C) and HC 33(2)(a) mean that a trust electing to pay tax on world-wide trustee income can only be a complying trust if: • New Zealand has full taxing rights to that world-wide trustee income; • the New Zealand tax obligations for that trustee income are satisfied for each income year from the application date of the election (N.B. this requirement considers that foreign tax credits may be allowed to the trustee for foreign tax paid on trustee income not sourced in New Zealand). Application date of elections Clause 97(5) proposes to clarify in section HC 33(3) the date from which an election to pay New Zealand tax at the trustee rate applies: • From the date of the election for a settlor who has migrated to New Zealand and who makes the election within either one year of the migration or one year of transitional residence ceasing. • From the date chosen by the person making the election in other cases (this is either the date of the election or the beginning of the income year in which the election is made). • For a deemed election (for example, for a trustee company that wasn’t aware the settlor of their client trust had migrated out of New Zealand), from the beginning of the first income year the return of income indicates the trust is a complying trust. In addition, the proposed amendment in section HC 33(3B) clarifies that if the trust’s New Zealand tax obligations are not satisfied, the complying trust status is lost from the beginning of the income year in which those obligations are not satisfied. 77 Taxation of distributions from a trust that has elected to become a complying trust Clause 97(6) proposes an amendment to insert a new subsection HC 33(5). This would apply for all trusts that have elected (or deemed to have elected) to pay New Zealand tax at the trustee rate on world-wide trustee income. The proposed amendment clarifies that the tax treatment of a distribution of tax-paid trustee income or a capital gain from a trust that has elected to become a complying trust is dependent on: • the compliance status of the trust at the time when the trustee derives the income or capital gain being distributed; • the ordering rules that apply to determine the composition of distributions from a foreign trust or non-complying trust. The proposed amendment ensures that distributions from tax-paid trustee income are treated as being made from a complying trust only if the distribution is made from trustee income is derived after the date from which the election applies. The ordering rules in section HC 16 are applied to determine the composition of a distribution. For example, a non-complying trust elects to be a complying trust in March 2021, for the year beginning 1 April 2020 and the tax obligations for that trustee income are fully complied with from 1 April 2020. However, all distributions from trustee income and capital gains earned before 1 April 2020 would continue being treated as a distribution from a non- complying trust and included in a taxable distribution. The amendment also proposes that, when all income and capital gains from the trust during the period it was a non-complying trust have been fully distributed, only then would distributions be treated as being made from a complying trust. Clause 113(16) to (18): Definition of transfer of value Clearer distinction in terminology The amendment proposed in clause 113(16) and (17) provide a clearer distinction in the definition of “transfer of value” in section YA 1 of the ITA. A distinction is drawn between a transfer of value relating to dividends paid by a company and a transfer of value relating to the meaning of the definitions of settlor and distribution. Clauses 63 to 68, 76, 77, 79, 82 and 86 propose consequential effects for this clarification. Unintended legislative change corrected In clause 113(18), it is proposed to clarify the definition of “transfer of value” to correct an unintended legislative change in the rewrite relating to the scope of the meaning of settlor, settlement and distribution. This proposed amendment restores the law to its pre-rewrite effect to ensure that a transfer of value by providing money’s worth occurs whether or not that money’s worth is convertible into money. 78 Clause 113(19) and (20): Definition of trust rules The proposed amendments ensure that the defined term “trust rules” in section YA 1 of the ITA refers to provisions that were inadvertently omitted from this definition during the rewrite of the trust rules. The proposed amendment would apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. This reflects the Commissioner’s practice. 79 TAX CREDITS FOR BENEFICIARIES OF TRUSTS (Clause 104) Summary The proposed amendment: • corrects an unintended legislative change in the rewrite of the provision; and • restores the law to its Income Tax Act 2007 pre-rewrite position to ensure that tax credits attached to distributions from trusts are pro-rated by reference to the amount of all distributions made to beneficiaries. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. A savings provision is proposed to protect taxpayers who have taken a tax position in a manner consistent with the pre-rewrite legislation. Key features Māori authority tax credits attached to a distribution from a trust are intended to be apportioned by reference to all distributions and all tax credits distributed from that trust. An unintended legislative change in the rewrite of this provision resulted in the formula working incorrectly. The proposed amendment restores this aspect of the law so that it works as intended. 80 INCOME ATTRIBUTION RULE AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS (Clauses 84 and 103) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment addresses two issues raised about the income attribution rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). If an associated entity of a working person under the rules pays tax overseas, a foreign tax credit (FTC) does not appear to be available to either the entity or the person for the foreign tax paid. The term “net income” is clarified to reflect the policy intent and how the Commissioner is applying the law. Application date The proposed amendments would apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008, being the date from which an FTC is intended to be allowed. Key features • Section GB 29 is amended to clarify how the calculation of the associated entity’s “net inco me”, which is attributed to the working person, interacts with the definition of “net inco me” in the ITA. • Section LJ 2 is amended to ensure the working person receives an FTC for foreign income tax paid by an associated entity on an amount attributed to the working person. Background The income attribution rules apply when an individual (“the working person”) earns income from providing their own services to a buyer (“personal services income”) through an interposed entity (“the associated entity”) 18 that has one main source of such income. The rules disregard the entity and seek to tax the working person directly to ensure that the personal services income is taxed at the working person’s marginal rate, rather than at the company tax rate. Under the attribution rule: • an amount attributed from the associated entity to the working person is income of the working person; and • the associated entity is allowed a deduction for the amount attributed to the working person so that the personal services income derived by the entity is not subject to double taxation. The proposed amendments to sections GB 29 and LJ 2 ensure that if the associated entity pays foreign income tax on its personal services income, the working person can obtain an FTC for that foreign tax. 18 “Working person”, “associated entity” and “personal services” income are technical terms used in the legislative provisions for the income attribution rules. They are replicated in this commentary for precision. 81 Detailed analysis The proposed amendments seek to address: • the clarity of the calculation in the income attribution rule; and • the inability of the working person (who is a New Zealand resident) to obtain a foreign tax credit for foreign income tax paid on personal services income attributed to them from the associated entity. Income attribution rule An issue has been identified concerning the use of the term “net income” in section GB 29, which provides the calculation for the amount of income to be attributed from the associated entity to the working person. Officials consider that the use of “net income” in this calculation is confusing. The Commissioner interprets this “net income” amount as ignoring the deduction allowed to the associated entity for the attribution of the net income amount, otherwise the provision is circular and therefore unclear. The proposed amendment aligns the law with both the policy intent and how the Commissioner applies the law. Foreign tax credit A person resident in New Zealand is allowed an FTC for foreign tax paid on an amount of foreign sourced income. The amount allowed as an FTC is the lower of: • the NZ tax payable on that foreign sourced income; and • the foreign income tax paid on that foreign sourced income. Under the current law, it is not possible to treat foreign sourced personal services income derived by the associated entity as also being foreign sourced income of the working person. This prevents the working person (being a New Zealand resident) from receiving an FTC for foreign tax paid by the associated entity on that attributed income. The proposed amendments ensure that: • the working person receives an FTC for foreign tax paid by the associated entity on income attributed to the working person, provided they are a resident of New Zealand when the income is derived; and • the associated entity does not receive a FTC for the foreign income tax paid on income attributed to the working person. 82 INCOME ATTRIBUTION RULE AND TREATMENT OF DIVIDENDS (Clause 83) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment resolves an issue regarding one of the income attribution provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). The amendment ensures that a dividend paid by a company (“associated entity”) that has previously attributed income to a shareholder (“working person”) will be exempt only if the company can show that the dividend has been paid out of income that has already been attributed to and taxed in the hands of the working person. Application date The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008, when section GB 27(4) came into force, with a savings provision (to apply from 1 April 2008 until the date of introduction of the Bill) to protect tax positions taken based on the existing law. Key features Subsection GB 27(4) is amended to ensure that a dividend is exempt only if it is paid: • by the associated entity to the working person no earlier than the end of six months after the end of the income year; and • it is paid from personal services income that has been previously attributed to the working person under the income attribution rules. There is an addit ional criterio n that the entity must keep sufficient records to enable the Commissioner to verify the source of the dividend. Background The income attribution rules apply when an individual (“the working person”) earns income from providing their own services to a buyer (“personal services income”) through an interposed entity (“the associated entity”) 19 that has one main source of such income. The rules disregard the entity and tax the working person directly to prevent tax on income from the individual’s personal services being paid at the company rate of 28%, instead of at the working person’s marginal rate of tax. The income attribution rules effectively distinguish between two types of dividend paid by an associated entity to the working person: 19 “Working person”, “associated entity” and “personal services” income are technical terms used in the legislative provisions for the income attribution rules. They are replicated in this commentary for precision. 83 • a dividend paid during the income year in which the income was derived and is to be attributed, or before the end of six months after the end of that income year (“in-year dividend”); • a dividend paid later than six months from the end of the income year in which the income was derived and attributed (“post-year dividend”). The distinction between the two types of dividend is intended to ensure that: • when calculating the amount of income to attribute to the working person, the associated entity can recognise in that calculation the amount of an in-year dividend paid out of personal services income derived by the associated entity; • a dividend sourced from personal services income derived by the associated entity, and which has already been taxed to the working person, is not taxed a second time when it is paid to the person (post-year). This is achieved by exempting the post-year dividend in the hands of the working person. The current wording in subsection GB 27(4), which treats post-year dividends as exempt from tax, is not sufficiently clear that its application is limited to dividends paid out of income that has already been attributed. Therefore, the proposed amendment more clearly limits the exemption to post-year dividends. 84 DATE WITHDRAWAL TAKES EFFECT FOR BINDING RULINGS ON MATTERS NOT INVOLVING ARRANGEMENTS (Clauses 119 to 121) Summary of proposed amendment The amendments clarify that where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued a private, short-process, or product ruling for an issue that does not involve an arrangement, and the ruling is withdrawn, taxpayers can continue to apply the ruling for the period specified in the ruling. Application date The proposed amendments would apply for: • private and product rulings from 18 March 2019; and • short-process rulings from 1 October 2019. Key features The key feature of the proposal is to make it clear that taxpayers can continue to rely on a private, short-process, or product ruling for the period specified in the ruling, if the ruling is on a matter not involving an arrangement. Background The binding rulings regime is contained in Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The provisions within Part 5A enable the Commissioner to issue binding rulings, which provide certainty to taxpayers about how the Commissioner will apply tax laws in relation to a person’s circumstances. Until recently, the Commissioner was only able to issue binding rulings for an arrangement. Amendments included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 extended the scope of matters for which the Commissioner could issue binding rulings (without the need for an arrangement) to allow rulings on: • a person’s status (for example, on their New Zealand tax residency); • whether an item of property meets the definition of “trading stock” or “revenue account property” as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and • whether an amount derived by a person is income under certain provisions in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 2007 relating to land transactions. 85 The Commissioner has an existing ability to withdraw binding rulings under various provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Where a ruling is withdrawn, if it relates to an arrangement, taxpayers can continue to rely on the ruling for the period specified in the ruling if they have already entered into the arrangement prior to receiving notification that the ruling has been withdrawn. The existing rules do not cater for circumstances where a binding ruling is issued for a matter that does not involve an arrangement. An amendment is therefore proposed to allow taxpayers to continue to rely on a ruling for the period specified in the ruling where the ruling is for a matter not involving an arrangement. Detailed analysis The Bill proposes to amend existing sections 91EI and 91FJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These provisions contain the rules for withdrawing private and product rulings. The amendments provide that where a private or product ruling is issued for an issue that does not involve an arrangement, if that ruling is subsequently withdrawn, taxpayers can continue to rely on the ruling for the remainder of the period or tax year specified in the ruling. It is proposed that these amendments apply from 18 March 2019 as this is the date from which the Commissioner can issue binding rulings on a broader range of matters without the need for an arrangement. A corresponding amendment is also proposed to be included in proposed section 91ESB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which would provide the Commissioner with the ability to withdraw short-process rulings. This amendment would apply for short-process rulings issued on or after 1 October 2019, which is the date from which the Commissioner can issue short-process rulings. 86 ABILITY TO WITHDRAW SHORT-PROCESS RULINGS (Clause 120) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment provides the Commissioner with the ability to withdraw short- process rulings. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force from the date of enactment and includes an application provision to ensure that the Commissioner is not precluded from withdrawing short-process rulings that are issued before the passing of this Bill. Key features The key feature of the proposal is to provide the Commissioner with the ability to withdraw short-process rulings. The proposed amendment mirrors the existing rule which allows the Commissioner to withdraw private rulings. Background The short-process binding rulings regime was introduced as a cheaper, more straightforward binding rulings service targeted at small-to-medium sized taxpayers as part of changes made to modernise core components of the Tax Administration Act 1994 by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. The provisions within the Tax Administration Act 1994 that provide the rules for short- process rulings are modelled on the existing rules for private rulings. Section 91EI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the Commissioner with the ability to withdraw private rulings, which may occur where there is a change in the interpretation of the law, or where the ruling needs to be withdrawn and reissued with a variation. A similar provision was inadvertently omitted from the rules for short-process rulings. Detailed analysis Proposed section 91ESB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to withdraw a short-process binding ruling. The new section is modelled on the provision that allows the Commissioner to withdraw private rulings (section 91EI of the Tax Administration Act 1994). A short-process ruling may be withdrawn (as in the case of a private ruling) where there is a change in the interpretation of the law (either by the courts or by the Commissioner) or where the ruling needs to be replaced with a variation. 87 Proposed section 91ESB(2) provides that where the Commissioner withdraws a short- process ruling, the withdrawal takes effect from the date of withdrawal which is included in the notice of withdrawal. The date cannot be earlier than the date on which the person could reasonably be expected to receive the notice of withdrawal. Proposed section 91ESB(3) replicates the rule that allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to withdraw private binding rulings and provides that where a short-process ruling is withdrawn for an arrangement, the ruling no longer applies if the arrangement had not been entered into after the date of withdrawal. However, the ruling continues to apply for the period specified in the ruling, if the arrangement was entered into before the date of withdrawal. Proposed section 91ESB(4) is included to make it clear that where the Commissioner issues a short-process binding ruling on a matter that does not involve an arrangement (such as on a person’s New Zealand tax residence status) and that ruling is subsequently withdrawn, the person can continue to apply the ruling for the period specified in the ruling. It is proposed that new section 91ESB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 comes into force on the date of enactment. An application provision has been included to make it clear that the Commissioner is not precluded from withdrawing short-process rulings that were issued on or after 1 October 2019 (which is when the short-process rulings regime comes into force) but before the passing of the Bill. 88 BRIGHT-LINE MAIN HOME EXCLUSION (Clause 60) Summary of proposed amendment The main home exclusion for the bright-line test requires that a person use the land as their main home for most of the time they own the land. The proposed amendment aligns the period of ownership for the main home exclusion for the bright-line test with the period in the bright-line test itself. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment clarifies that, for the purpose of the main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A, the period a person owns the land is the same as the period that the bright-line test applies for. It is consistent with the policy intent for the periods to be aligned. Background The main home exclusion for the bright-line test in section CB 16A applies where land has been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owns the land, for a dwelling that was the main home for the person. “Own” is defined in section YA 1 for land as having an estate or interest land. “Estate or interest” is defined as including all estates and interests in land whether legal or equitable. Under these definitions, a person will typically own land from the date a binding contract to purchase the land is formed until the date of registration of the transfer on sale. However, this period can be different from the period that is counted for the purpose of the bright-line test. Under section CB 6A(1), a person generally acquires land for the purposes of the bright-line test on the date the instrument to transfer the land to the person was registered. The bright-line test period ends on the “bright-line date”, which is defined in section CB 6A (7) as the earliest of the date the person enters into an agreement for the disposal of the land, or the date on which the land is disposed of (including by way of gift, compulsory acquisition or mortgagee sale). Because the period that a person “owns” land for the purposes of the main home exclusion can be different from the period that the bright-line test applies for, it is possible that taxpayers may not be eligible for the main home exclusion because, although they have used land as their main home for most of the period the bright-line test applies to, they have not used it as their main home for most of the time they owned the land. The opposite could also occur. 89 CONSIDERATION FOR GRANT OF AN EASEMENT (Clauses 61 and 62) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments address the tax treatment of a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement. The proposals aim to ensure that periodic payments for a permanent easement and any payment for the grant of a non-permanent easement (whether one-off or periodic), should be taxable, but one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement should not be taxable. Type of payment Permanent easement Non-permanent easement Periodic payment Taxable Taxable One-off payment Currently taxable, but should be non- taxable Taxable Application date The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively from 1 April 2015, being the date from which the current provision that was intended to make one-off payments for a permanent easement non-taxable had effect. Key features • Repealing section CC 1(2C). • Introducing an exception for one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement in section CC 1B. Background There is currently an exclusion for one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement in section CC 1(2C). However, in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Vector Limited \[2016\] NZCA 396, the Court found, contrary to the policy intention, that a lump sum payment for the grant of an easement could not be taxable under section CC 1. This is because a one-off payment is a capital receipt and could not fall under “other revenues” in subsection CC 1(2)(g), and none of the other amounts listed in section CC 1(2) was applicable. Therefore, a one-off payment for the grant of a permanent easement is not captured by section CC 1, and consequently section CC 1(2C), the specific exception for that type of amount, is redundant and needs to be repealed. One-off payments for the grant of an easement, permanent or non-permanent, are subject to tax under s CC 1B (this section was enacted after the years at issue in the Vector case). However, section CC 1B requires an amendment to ensure it does not tax one-off payments for the grant of a permanent easement, consistent with the policy intent. 90 MĀORI AUTHORITY TAX CREDITS ATTACHED TO DISTRIBUTIONS (Clause 108) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment corrects an unintended legislative change relating to the ability to retrospectively attach a Māori Authority Tax Credit (MATC) to a distribution from a Māori authority. The unintended change occurred during the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. A savings provision is also proposed to protect a taxpayer who has taken a tax position based on the existing legislation. Key features Imputation credits and MATCs may be attached retrospectively to a distribution only if the Commissioner has made an assessment under the transfer pricing rules to change the effect of a transaction. The rewrite of this provision incorrectly resulted in Māori authorities being able to retrospectively attach a MATC to a distribution for any reason. The proposed amendment restores the law to its pre-rewrite position so that it works as intended. 91 RECIPROCAL EXEMPTION FOR INCOME FROM INBOUND INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION (Clauses 75, 113(2), 137, 139, 143, and 144) Summary of proposed amendment As a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), New Zealand is obligated to reciprocally grant a full income tax exemption to non-resident aircraft operators. New Zealand gives effect to this obligation in section CW 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007, first introduced in 1985 as section 64A of the Income Tax Act 1976. Application date The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively from 1 April 1984 for section 64A of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the application date of the original legislation). The application date of the proposed amendments to equivalent provisions in subsequent Acts (the Income Tax Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007) would be the original date of enactment of each of those Acts. Retrospective application ensures that any full exemption previously granted by the Commissioner under any Act has been granted correctly. Key features The proposed amendment corrects a deficiency in section CW 56. As currently worded, the provision only permits an exemption to be granted for income from outbound air transport when it should also apply to inbound air transport. Extending the scope of the provision to cover inbound transportation will ensure that New Zealand has given full effect to its international obligations. To meet the ICAO obligation to grant an income tax exemption to the fullest possible extent, section CW 56 should also expressly apply to inbound air transportation. The proposed amendments achieve this by providing that, to the extent there is reciprocity, both air transport from New Zealand and air transport to New Zealand is exempt income. Background ICAO member jurisdictions are obligated to reciprocally grant an exemption from income tax to international aircraft operators “to the fullest possible extent”. Members are primarily required to give effect to this obligation by including a reciprocal exemption mechanism in their double tax agreements (DTAs). As a backup, members are also required to include a domestic legislation provision that enables reciprocal exemptions to be granted in the absence of a DTA. As an ICAO member, New Zealand introduced a domestic legislative provision to give effect to the backup exemption mechanism in 1985. The provision is currently located at section CW 56 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 92 Section CW 56 is not an automatic exemption. Rather, to ensure reciprocit y, the provisio n authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt income of a non-resident aircraft operator from New Zealand tax if the Commissioner is satisfied that in reciprocal circumstances the other jurisdiction will exempt the income of a New Zealand aircraft operator. The exemption is typically exercised by means of an exchange of letters, in which each side’s tax administration confirms that it will exempt the other side’s international airlines. The exemption mechanism only needs to be exercised on rare occasions, as most international air services to and from New Zealand are with jurisdictions with which New Zealand has a DTA. On the few occasions that it has been exercised, the Commissioner has granted full exemption (that is, for both inbound and outbound transportation). However, section CW 56 only expressly refers to income that is attributable to “carriage outside New Zealand by an aircraft of cargo, mail or passengers emplaned or embarked on the aircraft at an airport in New Zealand” (outbound transportation). The provision is silent about income from the carriage of cargo, mail or passengers into New Zealand (inbound air transportation). Income derived by an international airline from inbound transportation has a New Zealand source under section YD 4(2) or (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to the extent that it is attributable to business carried out in New Zealand or a contract made or performed in New Zealand. This means that at least some inbound air transportation is potentially taxable in New Zealand. 93 AMEND THE DATE A GOODS AND SERVICES TAX CREDIT BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR A TAXPAYER TO USE (Clause 131) Summary of proposed amendment This proposed amendment moves the day a GST credit is available from the day after the return was filed, to the day the credit arises. As this amendment is minor and is taxpayer favourable this change has already been operationalised within the system and thus will not practically affect any taxpayers. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date the original change was made, for taxable periods on or after 1 April 2018, as practically this will have no impact on any taxpayer and it will protect those taxpayers who have already received credits at the earlier date. Key features This amendment alters the date that a GST credit becomes available to a taxpayer when they file their GST return other than on the due date for the return. It moves the date the credit is available to be used from the day after the return is filed to the day the return is filed. Detailed analysis The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 made a change to the day on which a GST refund was available to a taxpayer. This more closely aligned the availability of a GST refund to when the taxpayer filed the return in which the credit arose. Credits are currently available on: • the earlier of either the day after the taxpayer filed their return or the day after the GST period which the credit relates to if the taxpayer filed early, or • the day after the end of the GST period to which the refund relates if they filed on the due date, or • the day after they filed their return if they filed their return late. Having the credit available the day after it arises (that is, the day the return is processed, and the refund established) is problematic for administrative purposes. It is generally good practice to have the credit available on the same date that it arises within the system. As a consequence, it is prudent to change the date in the legislation to the date the GST refund arises. 94 As this change is taxpayer friendly and the issues that arose from treating the credit available the day after it was assessed were problematic this change has already been operationalised within the START environment and will have no practical effect on taxpayers. It is proposed that this amendment would apply from the date the original change was made (taxable periods ending after 1 April 2018) to provide certainty to taxpayers who may have received credits earlier than specified in the legislation. 95 INBOUND THIN CAPITALISATION DE MINIMIS (Clause 81) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to restrict access to the de minimis in the inbound thin capitalisation rules (no adjustments when interest is up to $1 million and reduced adjustments up to $2 million), so it is not available when the borrower has related party debt from a non-resident. This is consistent with the original intent of the inbound thin capitalisation de minimis. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2018 to align with the original application of this de minimis to inbound thin capitalisation. Key features The “adjust” term in the thin capitalisation formula to apportion interest by an excess debt entity, which is defined in section FE 6(3)(ac), is zero when the de minimis does not apply. Section FE 6(3)(ac)(i) is proposed to be extended so that “adjust” will be zero if a borrower subject to inbound thin capitalisation has related party debt from a non-resident. Background There is a de minimis in the thin capitalisation rules in section FE 6(3)(ac) of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that certain excess debt entities do not need to make adjustments upon breaching the thin capitalisation threshold. This applies when these entities have a group finance cost of up to $1 million and abates up to a group finance cost of $2 million. Changes in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 extended this de minimis from the outbound thin capitalisation rules to also apply to the inbound thin capitalisation rules provided the borrower does not have any owner-linked debt. However, owner-linked debt, which is described in section FE 18(3B) of the Income Tax Act 2007, exists only where the borrowing is, directly or indirectly, from an owner who is not a member of the group. It was always intended that the de minimis should not be available where there was borrowing from a non-resident member of the same group. This is because a group with related party lending that does not have to apply thin capitalisation could have very high levels of debt in New Zealand and derive a return on their total investment without making any taxable profits due to high interest deductions. This is not appropriate, even where the interest expense is less than $1 million or $2 million. 96 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT REPRESENTATIVES (Clause 134) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment extends the coverage of an existing rule which permits the Commissioner to disclose information about tax agents to associations or groups that represent them to also permit the Commissioner to disclose information about representatives (including bookkeepers) to associations or groups that represent them. Application date The proposed amendment would apply fro m the date of enactment. Key features The key feature of the proposal would allow Inland Revenue to provide information about representatives (as defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994) to associations or groups that represent them. The proposal mirrors an existing rule that allows Inland Revenue to disclose such information about tax agents to associations and groups that represent them in certain circumstances. Background As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme it has extended its online service offerings to a broader range of intermediaries. This was facilitated, in part, by changes made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 in the recent Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 which introduced a new category of intermediary referred to as “representatives”. This includes intermediaries such as bookkeepers, who typically represent their clients for GST and PAYE (but not income tax). Inland Revenue has an existing ability to, in defined circumstances, disclose information about tax agents to associations and groups that represent them. This applies where: • the person is, or purports to be, a member of the association or group as a person who is in the business of preparing tax returns for other people; and • the members of the association or group are subject to a professional code of conduct and a disciplinary process that enforces compliance with the code of conduct; and • the information being disclosed is relevant to a decision of the Commissioner to remove the person from the list of tax agents, refuse to list the person as a tax agent, or in the Commissioner’s opinion, would be relevant to such a decision. This exception to the general rule of confidentiality contained in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is confined to tax agents and consequently does not permit Inland 97 Revenue to disclose information in the same circumstances about representatives. From a policy perspective, there is no reason why representatives should be treated differently from tax agents in these circumstances. Detailed analysis Section 18D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows Inland Revenue to, despite the confidentiality rules in section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, make disclosures for the purposes of carrying into effect revenue laws as set out in schedule 7, part A. Schedule 7, Part A, clause 3 is the provision under which Inland Revenue can disclose information about tax advisors or persons acting as tax agents. Proposed subclause (3) would permit Inland Revenue to disclose information about a person to an association or group if: • the person is, or purports to be, a member of the association or group as a person who is in the business of preparing tax returns for other people as a representative meeting the criteria of section 124D(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • the members of the association or group are subject to a professional code of conduct and a disciplinary process that enforces compliance with that code of conduct; and • the information being disclosed is relevant to a decision of the Commissioner disallowing the person’s approval as a representative, or refusing to approve the person as a representative, or would, in the Commissioner’s opinion, be relevant to such a decisio n. Without the amendment Inland Revenue may not be able to disclose such information to associations or groups that represent representatives (such as the Institute of Certified New Zealand Bookkeepers). This could inhibit the representative from being subjected to the association or group’s disciplinary processes. 99 Maintenance items 101 MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes.

This means it is important for everyone to pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand. 1.2 There has been significant international concern over the under-taxation of the digital econo my, and digital mult inat ionals in particular. This under-taxatio n is mostly caused by deficiencies in the current international tax rules, which have not kept up with digitalisation and other modern business developments. 1.3 The “digital economy” is a term used to refer to economic activity that is significantly reliant on information and communication technology. It broadly encompasses e-commerce, including the sale of both digital and physical products and services over the internet or via apps, online advertising, social networks, and intermediation platforms (such as Airbnb and Uber). 1.4 The digital economy provides many benefits to New Zealanders, and it is an important source of future growth for the country. However, its under-taxation impacts the sustainability of Government revenues and the fairness of the tax system. It also distorts invest ment in favour of digital mult inat ionals, which pay lower worldwide income tax compared with other industries. 1.5 The Government is committed to ensuring everyone pays their fair share of tax, including digital multinationals. Achieving this will require changes to the current tax rules. There are two options for this: • The first option is to apply a separate digital services tax (DST) to certain digital transactions. A DST taxes at a low rate (for example, 2% to 3%) the gross turnover of certain highly digitalised businesses that are attributable to the country. • The other option is to change the current international income tax rules, which have been agreed to by countries (usually referred to as “the international tax framework”). Countries have been discussing different ways of achieving this at the OECD. 1.6 The Government supports an internationally agreed solution at the OECD, but it will seriously consider a DST if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year. 1.7 This discussion document seeks feedback on two options for taxing the digital economy. The Government will take this feedback into account when it decides how to tax the digital economy. 1.8 Appendix 1 sets out some background information on what the digital economy is, along with its importance and size in New Zealand and globally. Appendix 2 sets out New Zealand’s policy for taxing multinationals, some 2 recent tax measures aimed at multinationals, and explains how the measures in this document fit in with our economic framework for international tax. Summary of options Digital services tax 1. The DST would be a flat tax charged at a low rate (2–3%) on gross turnover from certain digital platforms (to the extent they are attributable to the users in the relevant country). A DST applies to digital platforms whose value is dependent on the size and active contribution of their user base. Specifically, the DST proposed in this document would apply to: • intermediation platforms, which facilitate the sale of goods or services between people (like Uber and eBay); • social media platforms like Facebook; • content sharing sites like YouTube and Instagram; and • search engines and the sale of user data. 2. This means the DST is narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised business models. It would not apply to sales of goods or services (other than advertising or data) over the internet, such as accounting services delivered via the cloud. 3. The DST will likely need to also apply to some New Zealand companies, in order to comply with our international obligations. We expect the impact of this to be limited in practice, because of the kinds of activities to which a DST applies. 4. The DST is an interim measure for taxing the digital economy. The Government would look to repeal it if and when the OECD’s international solution was implemented. OECD proposals 5. There are two broad measures being considered at the OECD: • A measure to allocate greater taxing rights over a multinational’s profits to market countries. The measure would not require the mult inat ional to have a physical presence in the country. Three proposals have been considered for this purpose (only one of which would be adopted): – A limited proposal for digital services only, focusing on social media, digital advertising, intermediation platforms (also known as mult i-sided platforms) and data. – A broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries (such as New Zealand) based on certain marketing intangibles created there by multinationals. This would apply beyond the digital economy. 3 – A proposal which provides for apportionment of a multinational’s profit from ecommerce to market countries in which it has a significant economic presence. The apportionment would be based on an agreed formula and would depend on certain factors such as sales, assets and user participation. It is possible that the OECD may adopt an option that incorporates elements of more than one of the three proposals, or an alternate proposal not yet considered. • A minimum tax measure. This proposal would apply beyond the digital econo my and would ensure that mult inat ionals pay a minimu m level of tax on profits earned in low tax countries. This measure could be adopted in addition to one of the three proposals above. Submissions 1.9 The Government seeks submissions on the proposals set out in this discussio n document. 1.10 Submissions should include a brief summary of the major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.11 Submissions should be made by Friday 18 July 2019 and can be emailed to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Options for taxing the digital economy” in the subject line. 1.12 Alternatively, submissio ns may posted to: Options for taxing the digital economy C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.13 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 1.14 In addition to seeking written submissions, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials intend to discuss the issues raised in this discussion document with key interested parties. 4 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 This chapter sets out some important background information about the taxation of the digital economy. It explains New Zealand’s current taxation of multinationals and outlines the recent measures the Government has taken to improve this taxation. It explains the current problems with taxing the digital economy, and sets out the previous international response to them. New Zealand’s current taxation of multinationals – the international tax framework 2.2 New Zealand’s ability to tax multinationals on their New Zealand income is determined by both our domestic tax rules and by the double tax agreements (DTAs) we have entered into with other countries. 2.3 The rules imposed by our DTAs, together with the related OCED guidance, form the international tax framework which countries have agreed to follow. Under our DTAs New Zealand can only tax a multinational on its business income if: • the multinational has a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand; and • some of the multinational’s profit is attributable to that taxable presence. 2.4 For a multinational to have a taxable presence, it must operate in New Zealand either though a New Zealand resident subsidiary (in which case the subsidiary is taxable on its income) or through a permanent establishment (PE) of a non- resident group member. For a PE to exist, the multinational must have some kind of physical presence in New Zealand – either a fixed place of business, or a dependant agent which enters into contracts for it. 1 This is generally referred to as the nexus requirement. 2.5 If a non-resident does have a PE in New Zealand, then under our DTAs New Zealand can only tax the income that is attributable to that PE. The OECD has published detailed guidelines on how to attribute income to a PE, to which countries have agreed. The guidelines aim to attribute income to a PE by reference to the value generated by the non-resident at that PE, compared to the value it generates overseas. To do this, the guidelines look at the assets of the PE and the activities carried on through the PE by its personnel. 2.6 The effect of this is that a non-resident’s business income is only taxable in New Zealand under our DTAs to the extent the non-resident has assets or personnel here. If the non-resident has no assets or personnel here, they are not taxable on their New Zealand income. 1 The latest OECD model treaty only requires that the dependant agent play a principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts by the non-resident, provided they are routinely entered into without material modification. However, this provision does not appear in most of our DTAs. In addition, section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also contains an anti-avoidance provision, which can deem a non-resident to have a permanent establishment in New Zealand in certain circumstances. 5 2.7 These are referred to as the profit allocation rules. While the rules limit New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents that do business here, they also benefit New Zealand by limiting the rights of other countries to tax New Zealanders who do business there. 2.8 Since these nexus and profit allocation rules are contained in New Zealand’s DTAs, we cannot change them unilaterally – it would require the consent of the other countries. In addition, the nexus and profit allocation rules in most DTAs are based on a common standard published by the OECD or the UN, which in turn reflect a consensus on international taxation established nearly a century ago. It would be difficult to fundamentally diverge from these nexus or profit allocation standards in our DTAs (although most DTAs diverge in some less significant respects). 2.9 Appendix 2 sets out New Zealand’s policy for taxing multinationals, some recent tax measures aimed at multinationals, and our economic framework for international tax. The problem 2.10 The main problem is that the international tax framework was established nearly a century ago and has not kept up with modern business practices. These modern business practices, and digitalisation in particular, mean that a company can be significantly involved in the economic life of a country without being subject to income tax there. The OECD has identified that this is caused by three main factors: 2 • Scale without mass. Digital companies can transact with customers over the internet without having the physical presence (a PE) required by DTAs for income tax to be charged in the customers’ country. This is a problem for both the nexus and the profit allocation rules – even if the digital company was deemed to have a PE in the country, the lack of activities carried out in the country by the multinational means there would be no profit to attribute to that PE. • User value creation. Even where a digital company does have a PE, the profit allocation rules do not recognise the new kinds of value that digital companies can generate in their market countries. Digital companies can derive significant value from the active participation of their users, from data generated by the users, and from network effects. None of this value is recognised by the current profit allocation rules. • Intangible assets. Much of the value of digital companies can be attributed to intangible assets, such as trademarks and other intellectual property. These intangibles are hard to value. They are also mobile, meaning the income attributable to them can be easily moved to low tax countries. 3 2 For example, see OECD’s Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Interim Report 2018, Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris, 2018, paragraphs 3.83– 3.86. 3 The use of intangibles for this purpose was considered as part of BEPS Actions 8–10, which attempted to align taxation more with the economic substance of a multinational’s activity. However, many countries are concerned Actions 8–10 did not prevent a multinational from allocating significant profits to intangibles located in low tax countries. 6 2.11 These factors are not all unique to digital companies – for example, many non- digital co mpanies have valuable intangible assets. For this reason, some countries consider that the current problems with the international tax framework are not limited to the digital economy. However, all the above factors have been exacerbated by digitalisation, with the result that the problems with the international tax framework are particularly acute for digital companies. 2.12 As a result of these problems, mult inat ional digital co mpanies generally p ay significantly less tax than ordinary companies. In Europe, the traditional international business model has an average tax rate of 23.2%, whereas the average tax rate for a digital company is only 9.5%. 4 2.13 This under-taxation of the digital economy impacts the sustainability of Government revenues and public perceptions of the fairness of the tax system. It also provides a competitive advantage to overseas digital companies compared to local businesses, which are subject to full income tax. 2.14 New Zealand’s previous measures to tax multinationals do not address these problems with the international tax framework. This is because those measures only prevent multinationals from avoiding the current international tax framework. However, taxing the digital economy requires a fundamental change to that framework. 2.15 For the same reason a diverted profits tax, of the kind adopted by Australia and the United Kingdom would not solve the current problems with taxing the digital economy. This is because a diverted profits tax also just prevents multinationals from avoiding the current international tax framework (similar to the changes in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018). 2.16 It is important to note that the digital economy is generally subject to GST in New Zealand. The problems with taxing it are specific to income tax. In particular, New Zealand introduced GST on remote services in 2016 (which applies to most online purchases of services by New Zealand consumers from offshore) and has announced plans to impose GST on low value imports (which should apply to most online purchases of goods by New Zealand consumers from offshore). The international response 2.17 The taxation of the digital economy was first widely addressed at a 1998 OECD Ministerial Conference on electronic commerce in Ottawa. The OECD Secretariat presented a report for the conference, Electronic Commerce: Taxation Framework Conditions. 5 The report basically concluded that the existing international tax framework was sufficient to address the digital economy. This conclusion was repeated in 2005 by the OECD’s Business Profits Technical Advisory Group. 4 See the European Commission’s Impact Assessment for its digital services tax (SWD(2018) 81 Final), page 18, https://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/sites/taxation/files/fair\_taxation\_digital\_economy\_ia\_21032018.pdf 5 Available at https://www.oecd.org/tax/consumption/1923256.pdf 7 2.18 However, concerns with the taxation of the digital economy have grown with the digital economy’s increasing size. The OECD considered the taxation of the digital economy again as part of its BEPS project. The OECD’s 2015 BEPS report noted the current problems with taxing the digital economy 6 and considered three possible solutions: • Widening the definition of a PE to include a non-physical significant economic presence. • A withholding tax on payments to internet companies. • A DST (referred to as an equalisation tax in the report). 2.19 The OECD did not recommend adopting any of these solutions at the time. This was due to a lack of consensus and because the OECD wanted to see whether the other BEPS measures would mitigate the issues. 7 Accordingly the OECD initially stated it would reconsider the taxation of the digital economy in 2020, but countries could adopt any of the solutions provided they respected existing treaty obligations. 8 2.20 However, pressure to find a solution increased following the issue of the OECD’s 2015 report. Several countries began considering unilateral measures. In particular, the European Commission proposed a DST for the European Unio n on 21 March 2018 and the United Kingdom also issued a position paper supporting a DST in November 2017. 2.21 In response to this pressure, the OECD accelerated its further consideration of the digital economy and released an interim report on the taxation of the digital economy in March 2018 9 (Interim Report). 2.22 The Interim Report noted that countries had different views on the digital economy. One group considered that the digital economy created unique problems for the international tax framework, which should be addressed by targeted changes to the nexus and profit allocation rules. Another group considered that the problems with the international tax framework went beyond the digital economy, and so required a broader solution. Finally, a third group considered that the current rules were working well following the OECD’s BEPS project and so no changes were required. 2.23 As a result of this disagreement, the Interim Report does not make any recommendations or reach any firm conclusions on taxing the digital economy. There was agreement, however, that a consensus solution was preferable to countries adopting unilateral measures. Accordingly, countries committed to achieving a consensus based long-term solution by 2020. This solution will involve changes to both the nexus and the profit allocation rules. 6 OECD, Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy, Action 1 - 2015 Final Report, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris, 2015, https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264241046-en 7 The 2015 OECD report also considered the application of VAT (or GST) to the digital economy and made several recommendations. These recommendations have since been widely adopted, meaning the 2015 report was a success in terms of VAT. 8 Although the first two proposed solutions were inconsistent with most DTAs. 9 OCED, Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Interim Report 2018: Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, OECD Publishing, Paris, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264293083-en 8 2.24 The Interim Report did not recommend that countries adopt DSTs. However, it did recognise that some countries may want to introduce them as interim measures before a consensus solution was reached. The report set out some least harm type guidelines that countries should fo llow (discussed in chapter 3 of this discussion document). 2.25 The OECD has continued working on an international solution following the interim report and has developed two measures. One measure would reallocate more taxing rights to market countries, while the other measure would ensure that multinationals paid a minimum level of tax on its profits from low tax countries. These measures are discussed in chapter 4 of this document. 2.26 The measures have been developed on a without prejudice basis, meaning that, while the participating countries have agreed to them being further developed and discussed, they have not committed to ultimately supporting them. The OECD is aiming to obtain approval of the G20 group of large economies for its preferred measures at the G20’s meeting from 28–29 June 2019. 2.27 The progress made at the OECD has not been sufficient to allay the concerns of several countries, who have announced or introduced DSTs as unilateral interim measures to tax the digital economy. The United Kingdom recently announced it would introduce a 2% DST from April 2020. Austria, the Czech Republic, France, India, Italy and Spain have also enacted or announced DSTs. The European Commission introduced a proposal for a DST in March 2018, but it has not been able to achieve the support of all European Union members yet. 10 2.28 The DSTs announced so far are not intended as alternatives to the OECD’s international solution. Instead they are intended to be an interim measure, which would cease to apply when an OECD solution was achieved. This reflects the fact that the countries which support DSTs still consider an international agreement at the OECD to be the best long-term so lut ion to the issue. They are just sceptical of the OECD’s ability to achieve this solution in a reasonable timeframe. To reinforce this preference, all the countries which have announced a DST (other than India) have stated that they will repeal them if and when an international solution is achieved. The Australian approach 2.29 The Australian Government released a discussion document on the taxation of the digital economy on 2 October 2018. The document set out the Australian Government’s views on the digital economy, explored new options for taxing it (being the introduction of a DST and the proposals being considered at the OECD), and invited public feedback on those options. 2.30 The Australian discussion document observed that digitalised businesses provide significant benefits to Australia. However, under the current internat ional tax rules, digitalised companies can have a significant economic presence in Australia but pay little tax. This is particularly an issue with ride- 10 The European Commission DST has recently been narrowed to apply only to digital advertising, in an attempt to reach consensus. 9 sharing and accommodation platforms, multi-sided platforms (like eBay), and digital advertising. 2.31 On 20 March 2019 Australia announced that it would not adopt a DST at this time. Instead it will focus on achieving a multilateral solution at the OECD. The announcement noted that: • the Australian Government firmly believes that digital firms, like all firms, must pay their fair share of tax; • the submitters overwhelming supported Australia continuing to engage in the ongoing multilateral process at the OECD; and • many submitters raised significant concerns about the potential impact of an Australian DST across a wide range of Australian businesses and consumers, including discouraging innovation and competition, adversely affecting start-ups and low margin businesses and consumers, and the potential for double taxation. Other measures for taxing the digital economy 2.32 Some other countries also widened their domestic income tax framework in order to capture some of the profits earned there by highly digitalised companies (including Chile, Colombia, India, Israel, Italy, Slovakia and Uruguay). However, such domestic law changes will not be effective unless there is no applicable DTA. Questions for submitters • Do you agree that there are problems with taxing the digital economy or with the current international income tax framework? If so, are the problems with the current international tax framework limited to the digital economy, or do they apply more broadly? • Are there any other measures New Zealand should consider to address these problems? 10 CHAPTER 3 Should New Zealand adopt a digital services tax as an interim measure? 3.1 This chapter sets out the international context of a DST and an overview of how it works, followed by the OECD’s and Tax Working Group’s views on DSTs. Next, it sets out some general design principles for a DST and describes a potential DST for New Zealand. Finally, it sets out how a DST complies with New Zealand’s international obligations, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of a DST. International context 3.2 A proposal to adopt a DST needs to be evaluated in the context of international developments – particularly at the OECD. 3.3 As things stand, New Zealand’s current options for taxing the digital econo my are: • continue to participate in the OECD discussion, with the aim of supporting an internationally agreed multilateral solution but do nothing in the interim; or • introduce a DST as an interim measure in 2020–21 if an OECD consensus is taking longer to emerge. 3.4 The Government supports an internationally agreed solution at the OECD. The advantages of an OECD solution are that it would: • address the problems with the international income tax framework directly (rather than indirectly, via a separate tax); • require a tax credit to be given for any additional tax payable in market countries and avoid double taxation; and • involve a single set of rules that would be applied by all participating countries. 3.5 We canvass the options currently being considered and progressed at the OECD in chapter 5. The Government wants to understand the effect of the measures being considered at the OECD on New Zealanders. This will help the Government develop its view on these options, which it can then take into account in its contribution to the OECD discussions. 3.6 However, there is a risk in simply waiting to see whether the OECD can achieve an international solution that receives broad international support from members of the inclusive framework. Doing so would significantly delay consideration of a DST, if no international solution could be found. In addit ion, any international solution achieved by the OECD may not take effect until 2025, even if it was achieved in 2020. 11 3.7 DSTs have recently been adopted by other countries as unilateral interim measures to tax the digital economy. The Government needs to now decide whether to join these other countries in adopting a DST as an interim measure while discussions continue at the OECD. 3.8 The Government will seriously consider a DST if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year. We explore the design of a DST and the implications for New Zealand in this chapter. The expectation is that any DST adopted would be temporary, and the Government would look to repeal it once an international solution was achieved and implemented. Overview of the digital services tax 3.9 A DST is charged at a low rate on the gross turnover attributable to a country from certain highly digitalised business activities. A DST is not an income tax for DTA purposes. Consequently, countries can introduce a DST unilaterally, without the need for international agreement. 3.10 The United Kingdom recently announced it would introduce a 2% DST on the profits of certain digital companies that would apply from April 2020. Austria, the Czech Republic, France, India, Italy and Spain have also enacted or announced DSTs. The European Commission has proposed a 3% DST for Europe, however it has not been able to achieve the support of all European Unio n members. Australia consulted on a DST as an option for taxing the digital economy, but subsequently decided in March 2019 not to proceed with one at this time (deciding to instead focus on an OECD solution). OECD’s view on a digital service tax 3.11 The OECD Interim Report noted that there was no consensus on the desirability of a DST among countries. It noted that many countries are opposed to DSTs due to their risks and adverse consequences. 11 Other countries acknowledge these issues but consider that they do not outweigh the need to adopt DSTs as interim measures. These latter countries also consider that the downsides of a DST can be at least partially mitigated through careful design. Because of this lack of consensus, the OECD report did not recommend for or against a DST. 3.12 The OECD Interim Report did however set out several guidelines that countries in favour of DSTs consider should be taken into account by countries wishing to adopt a DST. These guidelines are intended to limit the adverse consequences of a DST and provide a degree of uniformity to the DSTs adopted. 3.13 The guidelines state that any DST should: • Be compliant with a country’s international obligations. This means the DST could not be an income tax (or creditable against an income tax), but it could be an excise tax. The DST would also need to comply with 11 The OECD report included an overview of these risks and adverse consequences. We have incorporated this into our discussion of the downside of a DST. 12 any obligations of a country under its free trade agreements or the World Trade Organisation. • Be temporary – it should be repealed once an international tax solution is implemented. • Be targeted at business models which pose the greatest challenge to the current international income tax framework, namely those with scale without mass and which rely heavily on user participation and network effects (for example, social media, search and intermediation platforms). The DST should not apply to the sale of ordinary goods or services over the internet. • Minimise over-taxation (for example, be charged at a low rate). • Minimise its impact on start-ups, business creation and small business more generally. Any DST should have de minimis thresholds so it only applies to large businesses (for example, over €750 million consolidated annual global turnover) with a sufficient level of revenue from the relevant country. • Minimise cost and complexity, which could be by having meaningful de minimis thresholds and using existing GST collection mechanisms. Tax Working Group’s view on a digital services tax 3.14 The Tax Working Group (TWG) also considered the current issues with taxing the digital economy. In its final report, the TWG concluded that New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions on changing the international income tax framework but should also stand ready to implement a DST if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction, and it is reasonably certain the New Zealand’s export industries will not be materially impacted by any retaliatory measures. Design considerations for a potential digital services tax 3.15 In designing a DST for New Zealand, we would aim to comply with the OECD guidelines discussed above, and our international obligations in particular. 3.16 There would also be real benefits to aligning our DST with the DSTs adopted by other countries. This would have several advantages. It would: • reduce the risk of the same amount of revenue being subject to multiple DSTs; • make it easier for multinationals to comply with our DST if it applies on the same basis as those adopted by other countries; • allow us to benefit from the design and implementation work done by other countries on their DSTs; and • reduce the risk of any reputational damage of New Zealand adopting a DST. 13 New Zealand’s proposed digital service tax 3.17 New Zealand’s DST would be a flat tax charged at 3% on the gross turnover attributable to New Zealand of certain digital businesses. It would be applied on a consolidated group basis. That is, it will be applied by treating a multinational group as a single entity, ignoring the legal separation of the various group members. Intra-group transactions would be ignored. 3.18 The application of New Zealand’s DST to a multinational group would involve these steps: • Determine if the DST applies to the group. The DST would apply if both: 1. the group’s business includes any of the activities defined to be in- scope; and 2. the group exceeds both the two de minimis thresholds for the DST. • If the DST applies, the group would calculate and pay its DST liability. This would involve these further steps: 3. the group determines the annual gross global revenue attributable to its in-scope business activities; 4. the group determines the proportion of those revenues attributable to New Zealand; 5. the group calculates the DST payable on those attributable revenues at the 3% DST rate; and 6. the group returns and pay the DST to Inland Revenue by the due date. 3.19 We explain each of these steps in the next section. Does the digital services tax apply? Step 1 – Are the group’s activities within scope? 3.20 New Zealand’s DST would apply to the services provided by business activities whose value is dependent on the size and active contribution of their user base. Specifically, the DST would apply to supplies made through: • intermediation platforms, which facilitate the sale of goods or services between people (like Uber and eBay); • social media platforms like Facebook; • content sharing sites like YouTube and Instagram; and • search engines and the sale of user data. 3.21 This means the DST would be narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised supplies. It would not apply to: • The sales of ordinary goods or services (other than advertising or data) over the internet. It would not apply to goods sold online (for example, by Amazon itself). • The provision of online content, such as music, games, TV shows and newspapers. This means it would not apply to Netflix for example. The 14 DST would apply to a platform which facilitated the sale of goods, services or content between buyers and sellers, such as Apple music. In this case, the DST would apply to the platform owner, but not to the people who made or supplied the good, services or content over the plat form. • Services delivered directly through the internet, such as accounting services delivered via the cloud. • Information and communications technology (ICT) providers, such as telecommunication companies and internet service providers. • Standard financial services, such as credit cards and EFTPOS providers. • Television and radio broadcasting. 3.22 The above services do not derive as much of their value from active user participat ion, so it is not appropriate to include them within the scope of a DST. 3.23 The DST will likely need to apply to both New Zealand residents and non- residents. This is for reasons of consistency with New Zealand’s obligations under our World Trade Organisation (WTO) and free trade agreements (FTA) to not provide less favourable treatment to non-New Zealand service suppliers as compared to like New Zealand service suppliers. This is the same approach taken by most other countries that have recently announced or adopted DSTs. Step 2 – Are both de minimis thresholds exceeded? 3.24 The DST would have meaningful de minimis thresholds, below which it would not apply. The OECD Interim Report notes the importance of de minimis thresholds to reduce compliance and administrative costs, increase the chance of the DST applying to profitable businesses, and reduce its impact on start- ups and small businesses. The OECD Interim Report recommends two separate de minimis thresholds (both of which would need to be exceeded in the previous tax year in order for the DST to apply): • A threshold based on the size of the group. For this purpose, the OECD Interim Report recommends the current threshold for country by country reporting, which is €750 million of consolidated annual turnover. 12 The European Commission’s original DST also used this threshold and the DSTs proposed by Austria, France, Italy and Spain all use this €750 million global turnover threshold. The United Kingdom DST has a similar threshold of £500 million of consolidated annual global turnover. • A threshold based on the amount of the digital group’s global revenue that is attributable to NZ users. 13 The European Commission’s original DST had a €50 million local threshold, while the United Kingdom has an effective threshold of £50 million. For their respective DSTs, Austria has a €10 million local threshold, France has a €25 million local threshold, Italy has a €50 million local threshold and Spain has a €3 millio n local thresho ld. 12 Paragraph 450 and following. 13 This would be determined the same way as in steps 3 and 4. 15 3.25 For New Zealand, we propose the following: • Also using the Country-by-Country reporting threshold of €750 million of consolidated annual turnover. This threshold is already used in the Income Tax Act 2007 for provisions targeted at large multinationals (such as the permanent establishment anti-avoidance rule in section GB 54) and it would make sense to apply it here as well. All of the DSTs announced so far also use a €750 million consolidated annual turnover threshold (other than India’s and the United Kingdom’s – and the United Kingdom uses a comparable figure). • Including a New Zealand specific threshold of $3.5 million a year – which would produce approximately $100,000 of DST. All of the DSTs announced so far also include a local country threshold, which varies with the size of the countries. 3.26 Both these thresholds would need to be exceeded in the previous income year for a DST to apply in the current income year. 3.27 The setting of these thresholds also needs to consider New Zealand’s international obligations under FTAs and the WTO. As these thresholds would apply to both New Zealand and foreign companies they do not explicit ly discriminate against non-New Zealanders. However, they could still contravene our obligations if in practice they modify the conditions of competition in favour of New Zealand companies as compared to like non- New Zealand companies. Accordingly, we may need to change the size of the thresholds. Calculate and pay the digital services tax Step 3 – Determine the in-scope global revenue 3.28 The next step is to determine the global revenue for the group’s in-scope business activities. 3.29 The DST would apply to any revenue from in-scope business activities. For example, it would apply to: • revenue from advertising provided through social media platforms and search engines; and • commissions charged on transactions carried out through intermediation platforms. 3.30 If the group carries on both in-scope and out of scope business activities, then only the revenue from in-scope business activities would be included. Accordingly, the group would need to apportion its total revenues between in- scope and out of scope activities. 3.31 The revenue is the gross amount received, without any deduction for expenses. This reflects the fact that a DST is charged on the supply of the relevant services. It is not charged on the profit made by the supplier for those services. 3.32 To simplify this step, the DST could allow a group to use the revenues from its financial accounts. 16 Step 4 – Determine the amount attributable to New Zealand 3.33 A group’s in-scope global gross turnover would be apportioned to New Zealand. This could be done based on the proportion of global users in New Zealand. 3.34 For example, suppose a digital group had $10 billion of total gross global revenue and one percent of its total global users in New Zealand. The revenue attributable to New Zealand would be $10 billion × 1% = $100 million. 3.35 In attributing the global revenue, it is only the location of the users that is relevant, not the location of the customers paying the digital group for its services. Therefore the $100 million of revenue in the example above would still be attributed to New Zealand under the DST even if no actual payments were made to the digital group from New Zealand. 3.36 One issue with this global attribution method is that different users might be worth different amounts in different countries. For example, a user in highly developed Country X might be worth $1.00 to the digital company, while a user in developing Country Y might be worth only $0.50. 3.37 Another option for addressing this would be to use the actual contribution of users in a particular country to a digital company’s gross turnover. We understand that some digital companies already calculate this, however it may be more difficult for others to do. 3.38 An important consideration for New Zealand will be the consistency of our attribution method with those adopted by other countries. At this stage the original European Commission DST proposed formulary apportionment and the DSTs proposed by European countries also seem to adopt this approach. On the other hand, the current United Kingdom proposal uses the actual revenues attributable to United Kingdom users (although the United Kingdom Government is consulting on this point). It is not clear if there will be a consistent method adopted by countries. 3.39 Regardless of the method used, attribution of turnover to New Zealand users will require a definition of a “user”, and a way of determining the location of that user. 3.40 The definition of a user would primarily be anyone who used the platform or service, however the exact definition would vary depending on the type o f platform and revenue. For example, for advertising revenue, a user would be anyone who views or clicks on the advertisement (with the same person possibly counting as multiple users if they view or click on it multiple times). For intermediation platforms, a user could be a person who enters into a transaction using the platform (to either buy or sell), with each transaction counting as a separate user. In any case the definition of a “user” for each typ e will need to be something that the relevant digital business can easily determine. 3.41 In order to determine the location of the user, we propose using the same method as currently used for the supply of cross border online services under the Goods and Services Act 1985. Section 8B(2) of that Act provides this list 17 of indicators that can be used to determine whether a recipient of a supply should be treated as a New Zealand resident: • the person’s billing address; • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the person or another geolocation method; • the person’s bank details, including the account the person uses for payment or the billing address held by the bank; • the mobile country code (MCC) of the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the person; • the location of the person’s fixed landline through which the service is supplied to them; or • other commercially relevant information. 3.42 These indicators aim to identify whether the recipient of a supply is a resident of New Zealand, rather than whether the recipient is in New Zealand at the time of supply. Accordingly, the indicators would apply to New Zealand residents that use a platform while they were out of the country, and they would not apply to non-residents who used a platform while they visited New Zealand. However, this is an area where the Government considers certainty may be more important than absolute precision. It would also simplify the application of the DST for non-residents that are also subject to GST on their online supplies to New Zealanders. The Government welcomes feedback on this point. Step 5 – Calculate the DST payable 3.43 The DST would be paid on the revenues attributable to New Zealand at 3%. For example, if an in-scope business had $100 million of revenue attributable to New Zealand users, New Zealand would charge 3% tax on that $100 million of revenue, for total tax of $3 million. 3.44 The proposed United Kingdom DST includes an alternative safe harbour DST calculation method. Under this method, a group can elect to pay DST at a higher rate on its profit (rather than its gross turnover). This method is intended to ensure a DST does not place a disproportionate burden on taxpayers with losses or low profit margin. 3.45 The safe harbour method uses this formula: 14 Profit margin × Attributable revenues × Rate Where: • Profit margin is the profit margin made on transactions with United Kingdom users. Since this method allows costs to be deducted in order to determine the profit, it would require an agreed approach to determine which costs were deductible, and how to apportion global or regional 14 We have simplified this by removing the allowance component, which functions as part of the United Kingdom’s de minimis threshold. 18 overheads to United Kingdom users. It would also need to exclude extraordinary items. Alternately the global consolidated accounting profit margin could be used, although this would be less accurate. • Attributable revenue means the revenue attributable to United Kingdom users. This would be the same as for the standard United Kingdom approach. • Rate is the rate at which the DST would be charged under this method. The United Kingdom have proposed a rate of 80%, to ensure the method is only attractive where there are very low profit margins. However, it is consulting on this. 3.46 At this stage the Government does not propose including a similar safe harbour in New Zealand’s proposed DST. We consider that such a safe harbour would significantly complicate the DST. However, the Government welcomes feedback on this point. Step 6 – Return and pay the DST 3.47 Finally, the DST would need to be paid to Inland Revenue. This raises some questions about how a DST would be administered. 3.48 At this stage we propose using an online supplier registration model, similar to that used for GST on remote sales. This would require a group to register with Inland Revenue and file a short return with their DST liabilit y. 3.49 We would also need to determine the period over which a DST is assessed and the frequency of payments. We currently allow non-residents to pay GST on their online supplies on a quarterly basis. It may make sense to align the DST and GST reporting and payment requirements, so that companies paying GST could incorporate the satisfaction of their DST obligations into their existing GST return and payment process. Quarterly filing also aligns with common commercial practices for foreign businesses to produce quarterly accounts and with VAT/GST filing periods for several overseas jurisdictions. 3.50 Alternately we could make DST payable on an annual process, aligned with a group’s financial reporting balance date. This would make it easier for a group to use its financial reporting information to determine its DST liability. 3.51 We note that the United Kingdom has proposed that its DST payment and reporting be aligned with its income tax. This means the DST reporting period would be the tax year, and the DST would be payable in four quarterly instalments (as with income tax for large companies). 3.52 The Government does not propose to follow the United Kingdom’s approach at this stage – it seems to us that a DST is more closely aligned wit h GST than income tax, so it would make more sense to align a DST’s calculation and payment requirements with GST. However, we would welcome feedback on this point. 3.53 The digital group will need to nominate a member to return and pay the DST. All group members will be jointly and severally liable for the DST until it is paid. 19 Interaction with income tax – creditability and deductions 3.54 New Zealand’s DST would not be an income tax. This means the DST could not be credited against our income tax either. The DST would however be considered a business expense, and so would be deductible in accordance with the ordinary income tax deduction rules. Example 1: Application of the proposed New Zealand digital services tax SocMed is a multinational group that operates a popular social media platform. It derives its income from providing targeted advertisements on this platform. SocMed’s total global annual revenue is €20 billion dollars according to its financial statements. It has 0.5% of its global user base in New Zealand. Application of the proposed New Zealand DST to SocMed would involve these steps. 15 Determine if the DST applies to the group Step 1: Does the group’s business includes any of the activities defined to be in-scope? In this case SocMed’s only activity is operating its social media platform, which is an in-scope business activity. Step 2: Does the group exceed both the de minimis thresholds for the DST? In this case the de minimis thresholds are: • €750m consolidated global annual turnover – SocMed exceeds this as it has €20 billion in annual turnover. • NZ$3.5 million in turnover attributable to New Zealand users. In this case SocMed has €20 billion turnover × 0.5% global users in New Zealand = €100m turnover attributable to New Zealand users. €100 million = NZ$167 million (converted at a 0.6 NZD/EUR spot-rate). Therefore, SocMed will exceed this threshold. • Therefore, the DST will apply to SocMed. Calculate and pay the amount of the DST Step 3: Determine the annual gross global revenue attributable to in-scope business activities. In this case, SocMed’s only business activities are in-scope. Therefore, its in-scope revenue will be its total gross turnover of €20 billion, as shown in its financial statements. Step 4: Determine the proportion of those revenues attributable to New Zealand. This is determined by reference to the proportion of the Group’s total global users that are located in New Zealand. In this case 0.5% of the Group’s total users are in New Zealand, so 0.5% of its global gross turnover is also attributable to New Zealand. This means that the revenue attributable to New Zealand is €20 billion × 0.5% = €100 million. This is then converted into NZD at the applicable spot rate (0.6 NZ/EUR) to give total NZD attributable revenues of €100 million ÷ 0.6 = NZ$167 million. Step 5: Calculate the DST payable. This is determined by multiplying the total revenues attributable to New Zealand (in New Zealand dollars) by the 3% DST. This gives $167 million × 3% = $5 million DST payable. Step 6: Return and pay the DST by the due date. SocMed would need to return and pay the DST via an annual return, 16 which would be due on a date following the publication of its annual financial statements. 15 These steps assume that DST will be payable on annual basis rather than a quarterly basis (which has not yet been decided). 16 The Government is also considering whether DST should be payable quarterly, like GST on remote sales. 20 Compliance with our international obligations 3.55 The DST would be designed to comply with our international obligations. These consist of our obligations under our DTAs, and our obligations under the WTO and our FTAs. Compliance with double tax agreements 3.56 The DST would be payable by a non-resident even if it did not have a physical presence in New Zealand. New Zealand’s DTAs require a non-resident to have a physical presence before we can impose income tax on their sales income. However, Article 2 of our DTAs state that they only apply to income taxes or taxes substantially similar to an income tax. 17 This means that a DST would not conflict with New Zealand’s DTAs, provided the DST is not an income tax or substantially similar to an income tax. 3.57 The starting point here is that Article 2 of our DTAs is clearly not intended to cover all taxes. For example, it is clear that our DTAs do not apply to GST. The question then is whether the New Zealand DST is substantially similar to an income tax, or whether it is more like other types of tax, such as excise taxes and GST. 3.58 The OECD’s Interim Report 18 notes that taxes on income focus on the recipient of the income, rather than on the consumer of a supply of specific goods or services, and usually look at the characteristics and economic situation of the recipient of the income (for example, profitability). This reflects the fact that an income tax is generally a tax on profits, rather than gross turnover. Consequently, if a DST was imposed on the supply itself (rather than the supplier) and focussed on the expenditure side of the payment (that is, the nature and value of the supply) it would more likely not be considered an income tax. 3.59 However, as the Interim Report notes, tax on gross turnover can still be an income tax in some circumstances. For example, a gross withholding tax that is creditable against the income tax liability of the recipient. We consider the key factor here to be that a tax levied on gross turnover must affect the person’s income tax liability in some way (other than by deduction) in order to be an income tax, for example by being creditable against the income tax liability, or by being charged in lieu of income tax. 3.60 Bearing this in mind, the Interim Report considers that a DST would be less likely to be an income tax where it is: • levied on the supply of a certain defined category or categories of e- services and imposed on the parties to the supply without reference to the particular economic or tax position of the supplier; • charged at a fixed rate, calculated by reference to the consideration paid for those services (without reference to the net income of the supplier or the income from the supply); and 17 The non-discrimination articles in our DTAs with Australia, Mexico and Japan apply to all taxes, and so would potentially be within the scope of a DST. We discuss the impact of these articles in the next section, as they are similar to our WTO and FTA obligations. 18 Paragraph 6.3.1. 21 • not creditable or eligible for any other type of relief against income tax. 3.61 Based on this guidance, we consider that our proposed DST would not be an income tax. It would be levied on the supply of narrowly defined services (being those provided by in-scope business activities), it would be charged at a fixed rate by reference to the consideration paid (that is, the gross turnover attributable to the in-scope business activities) and not the net profit of the recipient, and it would not be creditable against New Zealand income tax. In particular the DST would be paid in addition to our income tax, so it is not in any way in lieu of income tax. 3.62 This conclusion is consistent with the United Kingdom’s view on their proposed DST. In its November 2018 consultation paper, 19 the Unit ed Kingdom Treasury argued that, as their proposed DST was not a listed tax under their DTAs, nor identical or substantially similar to any listed taxes, the question of whether the DST was an income tax had to be resolved with reference to the ordinary concept of income. 20 3.63 In this regard, the United Kingdom paper considers the concept of income to be a measure of the net accretion to a taxpayer’s wealth between two points in time, calculated by measuring the taxpayer’s gross receipts and deducting the relevant costs and expenses incurring in generating those receipts. 21 On this basis, the United Kingdom DST would not be a tax on income, as it would be a tax on gross receipts from certain digital business activities rather than net income. 3.64 The United Kingdom paper also notes that, although there are examples of taxes applied to gross receipts which meet the definition of an income tax, these typically arose where the taxation of gross receipts was in lieu of income tax. The United Kingdom paper does not consider that its proposed DST meets these criteria, as its DST will apply separately to, rather than in lieu of, its income tax. 22 Furthermore, the United Kingdom DST will not be creditable against United Kingdom income tax. 3.65 We consider the United Kingdom paper’s views on their DST apply equally to our own proposed DST, given their very similar design features. 3.66 Finally, we note that the United States has criticised the DSTs proposed by the United Kingdom and the European Union, but they have not alleged that the DSTs were income taxes charged in contravention of DTAs. Compliance with WTO and FTA obligations. 3.67 New Zealand has international obligations under the World Trade Organisation and free trade agreements that require us to accord equivalent treatment to overseas service suppliers as we accord to like New Zealand service suppliers. New Zealand also has similar obligations under the non- discrimination articles of our DTAs with Australia, Mexico and Japan. These 19 HM Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs, Digital Services Tax: Consultation, November 2018, https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/digital-services-tax-consultation 20 Page 32. 21 Page 32. 22 Page 33. 22 will need to be taken into account in the design and structure of any DST as well as the setting of relevant thresholds. Should New Zealand adopt a digital services tax? Benefits of adopting a DST 3.68 As discussed above, there is a problem with the current international tax framework. A DST would be a way of collecting some tax from those types of businesses that present the greatest challenge to this framework, and which have been paying little tax either in New Zealand or overseas. Further, a DST should be relatively simple to calculate and administer compared to income tax. In addition, the size of the digital economy is growing as a proportion of the total economy. Consequently, it will become increasingly important for New Zealand to ensure that the digital economy is taxed appropriately. 3.69 A DST is unlikely to be a significant revenue earner in New Zealand. As a rough estimate, we expect a 3% DST would raise between $30 million and $80 million of tax, 23 depending in part on how it is designed. 3.70 While the revenue raised would not be large, a DST could have other benefits. Much of the recent public concern about the under-taxation of multinationals has focussed on high-profile digital companies that do not have a physical presence in New Zealand (and so are not subject to income tax). By taxing these companies, a DST could improve public confidence in the fairness of the tax system, which is an important factor underlying voluntary compliance. 3.71 In addition, there is a risk in simply waiting to see whether the OECD can achieve an international solution. Doing so would significantly delay consideration of a DST, if no international solution could be found. Further, any international solution achieved by the OECD may not take effect until 2025, even if it was achieved in 2020. In the meantime, digital multinationals would continue to be unfairly taxed. 3.72 In addition, there are some upsides to adopting DSTs in terms of the OECD’s solution. DSTs incentivise countries to agree to an international solution that would otherwise make their residents worse off, as the international solution would result in the repeal of a DST. 3.73 There is also an issue as to the adoption of any internationally agreed solution. This solution will require amendments to DTAs, which will ultimately need to be optional (as there is no way to force a country to change its DTAs). Accordingly, New Zealand might still want to introduce a DST even if an international solution is found, in order to tax digital companies operating out of countries that do not implement that solution. Issues and potential drawbacks of a digital services tax 3.74 There are potential issues with a DST. 23 This is based on a rough bottom-up estimate of what we think a DST would raise in New Zealand, combined with top down estimates based on what the European Union and United Kingdom have forecast their DSTs to raise, adjusted for differences in GDP and exchange rates. 23 Double taxation and over-taxation 3.75 The DST would need to apply in addition to income tax. This could result in both DST and income tax applying to the same income of some firms (including possibly some domestic firms). We consider that this is mainly an issue for any New Zealand businesses, as they are already taxed here on all their inco me. Non-resident digital businesses pay low rates of income tax generally and are not currently subject to New Zealand income tax on any income attributable to users in New Zealand. 3.76 Another issue is that, as a tax on gross turnover, the DST would apply to firms in loss, or with low margins. This is something that can be partially mitigated with high de minimis thresholds, as the larger firms tend to be more profitable. A lower DST rate also helps to mitigate this issue. However, these features cannot eliminate the issue altogether. Impact on investment, innovation and growth 3.77 As with any tax on the supply of particular services, a DST will increase the cost of capital, reducing the incentive to invest with a resulting negative effect on growth. As a measure that only applies to digitalised sectors, a DST risk s slowing down investment in innovation for those businesses that are subject to the tax or indirectly affected by it. Although the effect will also depend on the financing of the investment, without proper constraints, like an exemption for SMEs, a gross basis tax could effectively penalise start-ups and other growing firms with losses or limited profitability and provide a competitive advantage to mature profitable incumbents, helping to create a barrier to entry that cements the dominance of established firms. 3.78 The digital sector has important benefits for New Zealand, and the Government is committed to supporting it. Accordingly, it is important that any DST does not reduce the growth of the digital sector in New Zealand, particularly start-ups and SMEs. For this reason, any DST would need robust de minimis thresholds, to ensure it only targets established and profitable digital businesses. Impact on welfare 3.79 The OECD Interim Report notes that an additional hurdle with a tax on a gross basis is that it is equivalent to a tax on inputs. This implies that it is likely to distort firms’ choices of inputs thus distorting production itself. In other words, when such a tax is introduced, either production could decline or more resources will need to be employed to reach the same level of production. Consequently, according to the OECD Interim Report, there is likely to be a negative impact on the overall welfare of an economy and on its output. The size of the effect will depend on elasticities of substitution and will be smaller the more targeted the measure is. 3.80 In response to this issue, we note that the current international tax rules favour investment in the digital sector. This unequal tax treatment compared with more traditional businesses is inefficient, as it incentivises investment into certain digital firms (which can most benefit from the flaws with the current rules). As a DST is intended to reduce the unfair tax advantages enjoyed by 24 such digital businesses, we would expect a DST overall to improve economic efficiency, and thus welfare. The economic incidence of the tax 3.81 The issue here is whether a DST would just be passed on to New Zealand customers. Given the importance of this issue, we consider it in some detail below. 3.82 Some digital multinationals provide a free service to end-users, which they mo net ise through payments from other parties, for example, for online advertising. To the extent the cost of a DST was passed on, we would expect it to be passed on to the parties currently paying the digital multinational for its services. We would not expect a DST to result in a digital mult inat ional charging consumers for a service that is currently free. For example, consider a social media platform that is currently free to end-users and which raises revenue through online advertising. We would expect any costs from the DST to be passed on to the persons buying advertising from the multinational, and not the end-users of the platform (who should continue to enjoy a free service). 3.83 There are arguments each way on the extent to which a DST would be passed on to consumers. On the one hand, digital companies might be expected to have very low marginal costs. In that case a DST is similar to a tax on profits. If the digital company is earning infra-marginal returns (economic rents that is, the amount above the return that the investor needs in order to make the investment), then a tax on those profits might be very efficient and not be passed on to New Zealand customers. On the other hand, if some services are more competitively supplied and there is low substitutability of the services, the tax might be expected to be mostly passed on. 24 3.84 The European Commission’s Impact Assessment for its proposed DST briefly considered the economic incidence issue and considered that there was no single answer for the variety of digital services such a tax would apply to. The Impact Assessment notes that: 25 There is scarce evidence on the pass-on effect of a new tax on turnover, but economic theory and experiences with VAT indicate that there is no uniform answer for the variety of digital services considered. As a proxy, one could look into the effect of an increase in the VAT rate on consumer prices. Economic theory suggests that the pass-through of a VAT increase on consumer prices is influenced by several factors: competition setting, the elasticity of demand and other factors (for example, country-specific ones). The higher the price elasticity of demand, the lower the degree to which a VAT rate increase can be shifted into final consumer prices. An increase in the VAT rate would thus translate to different degrees in higher consumer prices or reductions in suppliers’ profit margins, depending on the market conditions. On average, for a rather broad range of goods and services, Benedick et al. (2015) found that only around one-third of a VAT change is passed on to consumer prices. 26 In the case of paper-based books and e-books, a 24 This is less of a concern with the proposals to change the international tax framework, as those proposals involve broadening the application of income tax to the digital economy. Accordingly, the economic incidence of any tax raised by those proposals should be the same as for income tax generally. 25 SWD(2018) 81 Final, page 75. 26 See Benedek et al., 2015, page 16, https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15214.pdf 25 Commission-ordered study documented a pass-on rate of one-half, which was however considered imprecise. 27 For online retail, there is some evidence that consumers purchasing online are price sensitive and react strongly to price increases – this would limit the possibility for companies to pass additional tax onto consumer prices. Existing work on internet tax sensitivity dates back to the influential work of Goolsby (2000). Sales taxes that are directly passed onto prices of products sold online have been shown to strongly reduce demand. More recently, Einar et al (2014), using data from eBay which accounts for 11–13 percent of Internet retail commerce in the U.S., estimate that on average, the application of a 10 percent sales tax reduces purchases by 15 percent among buyers who have clicked on an item. 3.85 The Impact Assessment to refers an IMF study on the pass through of VAT increases (Benedek et al). This study looked at the VAT reforms in the Eurozone from 1999–2013 (which involved 1,231 VAT changes – 1,009 VAT increases and 222 decreases) and their effect on consumer prices. The study found: • changes in standard VAT rates which affect most goods and services, have a one hundred percent pass through rate or more; • changes in reduced VAT rates, which only affect a few types of goods or services, have only a thirty percent pass through rate (meaning only thirty percent of the extra cost or saving was passed on to consumers); and • reclassification of goods (that is, moving a particular good from a reduced rate to standard rate and vice versa), which had the narrowest application, had pass through rate of close to zero. 3.86 This shows a strong association between the share of consumption affected by a VAT reform, and total pass-through. Pass through is relatively small for VAT reforms that affect a small consumption share and is highest (close to full) for VAT reforms affecting around half of all consumption. 28 In particular, pass through is not significantly different from zero when the VAT applies to a consumption share less than ten percent. 3.87 A DST would only affect a small share of consumption. If the results above holds, the pass-through rate for a DST (which, as a tax on gross turnover, has a similar economic impact to a VAT) would be similar to the pass through rate for a VAT reclassification or reduced rate – that is thirty percent (or lower). 3.88 In addit ion, the pricing structure of some digital services mean the cost of a DST could not be passed on. For example, where online advertising is priced under a bid system, it might be difficult to increase the final price by the amount of DST charged. 27 See European Commission, Economic Study on Publications on all Physical Means of Support and Electronic Publications in the context of VAT, 2012, page 98, https://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/sites/taxation/files/docs/body/economic\_study\_vat\_on\_publications\_finalrep ort.pdf. The pass-on rates vary also country-wise – see pages 95–96. 28 The study also found that pass through is again smaller for VAT reforms affecting more than a fifty percent share of consumption, although there were not enough data points for such VAT reforms to be confident of this conclusion. 26 3.89 Based on the above, we would roughly expect between thirty and fifty percent of the cost of a DST to be passed on to New Zealand consumers. The effect on New Zealand’s reputation as a good place to do business 3.90 New Zealand is a small open economy and we compete for capital with the rest of the world. That means we want New Zealand to be an attractive place for non-residents to do business. Imposing a DST may create a negative impression of New Zealand in this regard. 3.91 We consider that this risk would be reduced to the extent other countries adopt or announce DSTs (which some have already done). The potential effect on our export sector 3.92 The implications of adopting a DST for our export sector would also need to be considered. Some trading partners, particularly the United States, would likely express continued opposition to any unilateral approach to digital taxation. Members of the United States Congress and United States tech industry players have previously claimed that DST proposals by the United Kingdom and the European Commission would amount to double taxation, and that proposed turnover thresholds would result in discrimination against United States companies in breach of World Trade Organization (WTO) nat ional treatment provisio ns. The United States preference is likely to be to continue efforts to tackle the issue within the OECD. The period of time for which a DST would be applicable 3.93 The OECD expects that any DSTs would be repealed once a multilateral solution is achieved. Other countries that have recently proposed DSTs have also said they will do this. Accordingly, if agreement was reached quickly at the OECD, then it may not be worth designing a DST that would only apply for a short period of time. The administration and compliance costs of introducing a new tax 3.94 This is particularly an issue given that a DST is not expected to raise significant revenue. In addition, given a DST would be expected to (at least predominantly) apply to companies outside of New Zealand, there are fewer tools available to Inland Revenue to enforce the tax. 3.95 On the other hand, a DST is simpler than an income tax, and so would be easier to administer and comply with. The Government would also aim to make the DST as simple to comply with as possible. There would be real benefits here of aligning New Zealand’s proposed DST with those adopted by other countries so that multinationals did not have an additional set of DST rules to comply with. 3.96 In terms of enforcement, this could be addressed in part by making any wholly owned group member of the multinational in New Zealand jointly and severally liable for the DST. In addit ion, we have found multinationals generally willing to comply with local laws (where they minimise tax, they do so by structuring their affairs to reduce the tax legally payable, rather than by ignoring our tax laws altogether). For example, there has been high compliance 27 with the recent GST on remote services, which applied to many non-residents with no physical presence in New Zealand. Repeal of a digital services tax 3.97 The DST is intended to be an interim measure. Accordingly, the Government would repeal the DST if an international solution at the OECD was achieved. In terms of timing, the DST would be repealed when the international solution took effect for tax purposes, which could be four to five years after it is first agreed. 3.98 However, it may be the case that not all countries adopt the OECD’s international solution. If this was the case, then the Government would consider retaining the DST for residents of those countries that have not adopted the international solution. Questions for submitters • What do you think of the proposed DST? • To what extent do you expect it would be passed through to New Zealand consumers? • Do you think it would comply with New Zealand’s international obligations? • What impact do you expect it would have on New Zealand’s international relationships (particularly in light of other countries already moving in this direct ion)? • Do you agree with the advantages and disadvantages set out above? • How do you think it would affect New Zealand businesses and consumers? • How would the proposal affect the development of the digital economy in New Zealand and globally? • Do you agree with the scope of the proposed DST? • How easy would it be to comply with? • What technical and administrative issues do you see arising from the proposed DST? • What other design features should it incorporate? • Is there anything else we should consider? 28 CHAPTER 4 The OECD’s measures 4.1 This chapter sets out the measures being considered at the OECD, so the public can understand them and submit their feedback. 4.2 The OECD measures at this stage are high level proposals that have not been developed in detail. Accordingly, there is still uncertainty as to how they would apply in practice. Summary of OECD measures 4.3 There are two broad measures currently being considered at the OECD: • A measure to allocate greater taxing rights over a multinational’s profits to market countries. The measure would not require the multinational to have a physical presence in the country. There are three proposals being considered for this purpose (only one of which would be adopted): – A limited proposal for digital services only, focussing on social media, digital advertising, mult i-sided platforms and data. – A broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries (such as New Zealand) based on certain marketing intangibles created there by multinationals. This would apply beyond the digital economy. – A proposal which provides for apportionment of a digital multinational’s profit to market countries in which it has a significant economic presence. The apportionment would be based on an agreed formula and would depend on certain factors such as sales, assets and user participation. It is possible that the OECD may adopt an option that incorporates elements of more than one of the three proposals, or an alternative proposal. • A minimum tax measure. This proposal would apply beyond the digital economy and would ensure that multinationals pay a minimum level o f tax on profits earned in low tax countries. This proposal addresses some remaining base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) issues and is not specifically directed at the digital economy (although it would also apply to digital companies). 4.4 Most of the proposals are not specifically targeted at the digital econo my. Wit h the exception of the first profit allocation proposal, they all apply more broadly, which reflects the views of many countries that the problems with the international framework are not limited to the digital economy. Accordingly, while these proposals arose out of the OECD’s work on the digital economy, they represent a wider reform of the international tax framework. For this 29 reason, the OECD’s proposed measures have also been referred to as BEPS 2.0. 4.5 We describe these proposals in more detail in the next sections. The OECD’s February 2019 consultation paper, Addressing the tax challenges of the digitalisation of the economy, 29 contains further explanation and details of the measures. Consultation closed on this paper in March 2019 with over 200 submissions received. Measure 1 – Reallocation of taxing rights 4.6 This measure seeks to address the ability of multinationals to be significantly involved in the economic life of a country without being subject to income tax there. It involves fundamental changes to the existing nexus and profit allocation rules, in order to expand the taxing rights of market countries over such mult inat ionals. 4.7 There are three proposals being discussed at the OECD for this measure, each supported by a different group of countries. The proposals have significant differences, including in their scope and rationale. However, they all have the same objective – to allow the taxation of value created in a market country that is not recognised under the current framework. Some of the proposals also share similarities, such as the use of a simplified residual profit split method to allocate profits in the user participation and marketing intangibles methods. Therefore, the proposals could be combined or more closely aligned by the OECD going forward. Proposal 1 – User participation approach 4.8 This is the narrowest of the proposals. It considers that the main problem with the international tax framework is that it does not recognise the value generated in a country by the active participation of certain digital companies’ users. This active user participation contributes to the value of the company’s brand, the generation of valuable data and the establishment of a critical mass of users which increases the value of the company for other users. However, this value creation is not recognised under the current profit allocation rules, as those rules only consider the activities of the taxpayer (and not those of its customers) in determining where value is created. 4.9 Examples of valuable active user contribution include user generated data and user generated content – such as videos posted on YouTube and pictures posted on Instagram. In addit ion, some plat forms derive much of their value from the size of the user base. That is, the more people that use the platform, the more useful and valuable it becomes. For example, a social media platform with a single user would be worth very little, while another social media plat form, with identical functionalit y but with one billion users, would be very useful and valuable. This increase in value of the digital platform in proportion to the size of its user base is referred to as a network effect. 29 Available at http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/public-consultation-document-addressing-the-tax-challenges-of-the- digitalisation-of-the-economy.pdf 30 4.10 The proposal would only apply to those types of business activities for whom user participation is a significant source of value. These are: • social media platforms; • search engines; and • online market places. 4.11 Accordingly, the proposal would only apply to a narrow subset of digital companies. 4.12 The proposal would work by: • deeming some of the profits from these in-scope business activities to be attributable to their users in a particular country; and • giving that country the right to tax those profits, regardless of whether the company had a permanent establishment or other physical presence there. 4.13 The user participation proposal considers that the value contributed to a company by its users is generated in the market countries where those users reside. Therefore, the market countries should be able to tax the company on the value generated by those users. 4.14 Mechanically, the proposal would involve these simplified steps: 1. The residual profit of the group from its in-scope business activities needs to be calculated. The residual profit is a transfer pricing term, and it refers to the profit of a company that remains after all of the routine activities of the company (or group) have been compensated on an arm’s length basis. It can be thought of as the entrepreneurial profits of the company. The proposal acknowledges the existing challenges with determining residual profit under the current transfer pricing principles. Accordingly, the calculation of the residual profit under this proposal may require the use of simplified formulas. 2. A portion of this residual profit would need to be attributed to active user participation. This allocation could be determined by looking closely at the relevant business and considering the value contributed by users in that particular case. Alternatively, it could be determined under simple pre-determined percentages, which could vary by the particular type of business. 3. The residual profit attributable to users’ participation would be allocated between the various countries where the users were located. This would be determined according to an agreed metric or metrics, such as the numbers of users in each country and the revenue derived by the mult inat ional fro m the country. 4. The countries would be given the right to tax those profits, regardless of the degree to which the multinational was physically present in that country. 4.15 The residual profit attributable to the market countries would be determined by treating a multinational as a single entity – that is, it would look through the separate legal identity of the various subsidiaries and try to allocate the 31 total profit of the entire group, rather than the profit of each separate company. However, mechanically the proposal would need to reallocate some of the residual profit currently earned by specific companies in the group to market countries (as the current income tax framework does not apply to groups on a consolidated basis). A tax credit would be given by the home country of the company earning those residual profits. 4.16 This proposal would not affect the allocation or taxation of the routine profit earned by members of the group. It would only affect the companies earning residual profits under the current transfer pricing rules. 4.17 The proposal could incorporate a range of additional restrictions based on the size of the business to further reduce the administrative burden for tax administrations and taxpayers. 4.18 Further information on the proposal and its background are set out in the OECD’s public consultation paper, and in a United Kingdom position paper on corporate tax and the digital economy. 30 Example 2: User participation proposal In this example a digital group (Sales Co, Digital Co and Marketing Co) are all outside New Zealand. They collectively earn $5 billion of global profits. Principal Co operates the platform and retains the group’s residual profit. Sales Co and Marketing Co carry out routine activities, the arm’s length remuneration for which is $500 million each. New Zealand has one percent of Principal Co’s global users. The process for determining the amount of income to be allocated to New Zealand in these circumstances would involve these mechanical steps: 31 Step 1: Determine the global profit of the group on a consolidated basis. In this case the global profit of Sales Co, Principal Co and Marketing Co is $5 billion. Step 2: Determine the profit allocable to the routine activities of the group. In this case Sales Co and Marketing Co are allocated $500 million of profit each to reward them for their routine activities. Step 3: Determine the residual profit by subtracting the routine profit from the total profit. In this case $5 billion total profit less $1 billion routine profit equals $4 billion residual profit. Step 4: Determine the share of residual profits attributable to global user participation. In this case, the share is twenty five percent, meaning $1 billion of residual profits need to be allocated to global user participation (25% × $4 billion = $1 billion). Step 5: Determine New Zealand’s share of the residual profits allocated to global user participation. This is determined in accordance with the proportion of the group’s global users that are in New Zealand. In this case one percent of the group’s global users are in New Zealand, so $10 million of profit is allocated to New Zealand (1% of $1 billion). Step 6: New Zealand taxes its share of the profit. New Zealand is given the right to tax its $10 million share of the group’s profits at New Zealand’s standard corporate tax rate, regardless of whether Principal Co has a PE or other physical presence in New Zealand. Country B gives Principal Co a tax credit for the New Zealand tax paid. 30 HM Treasury, Corporate tax and the digital economy: position paper update, March 2018 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/689240/corporate\_tax\_and\_the\_digi tal\_economy\_update\_web.pdf 31 We have broken down some of the steps from paragraph 4.14 into multiple steps to make the example easier to follow. 32 Comments 4.19 The user participation proposal has some benefits. The notion that users create value for particular businesses is plausible. In allowing countries to tax this value, the proposal is consistent with a fundamental principle of the current international framework – aligning taxing rights with value creation. 4.20 The narrow scope of the proposal has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand the proposal is narrowly targeted at those business types which create the most difficulties for the current tax framework. This narrow focus means most businesses would not be affected by the changes. In addition, we would expect the proposal to benefit New Zealand overall, given we import more highly digitalised services than we export. 4.21 However, the narrow scope of the proposal means that it does not fully address the wider tax challenges of digitalisation. It does not apply to the sale of goods or ordinary services over the internet for example, meaning non-residents could continue to supply goods to New Zealanders online without income tax being payable, while our own retailers are fully taxable on their profits. 4.22 The proposal also involves ring-fencing the digital economy, which the OECD recommended against. This is on the basis that, given increasing digitalisation, the digital economy is rapidly becoming the economy. 32 Arguably therefore any so lut ion to the tax challenges of digitalisation needs to apply more broadly. In addition, a tax measure targeted at a small part of the digital economy may be less fair or efficient than a broader proposal. This is because a narrow measure may disincentivise involvement in that part of the economy compared to the other parts, which may equally be able to benefit from the current problems with the international tax framework. 4.23 There is also the question of how other advancing technologies will affect the international tax framework in the future, such as artificial intelligence, robotics and 3D printing. A solution narrowly targeted at user participation does not seem capable of addressing the potential future challenges posed by these technologies. 4.24 There are also technical issues with the proposal that would need to be addressed (as with all the proposals). Even determining the profit of a multinational is not straightforward, given the different countries in which it operates. Determining both the residual profit and the allocation of that residual profit to user participation is also inherently complex and subjective. If transfer pricing type principles were used, then the proposal would be difficult to administer (particularly for developing countries) and subject to dispute. For this reason, we consider that the proposal may need to use fairly simple formulas. However, these formulas would necessarily be inaccurate to some degree, as they would not reflect the particular circumstances of individual businesses. 32 This was also the conclusion of the Australian and New Zealand Productivity Commissions, as discussed in chapter 2. 33 Questions for submitters • What do you think of this proposal? • Is it too narrowly targeted? • Is user value creation an appropriate basis on which to allocate profit to a country? • How do you think it would affect New Zealand businesses and consumers? • What kind of de minimis thresholds and restrictions do you think should apply to the proposal? • What do you think of the method for determining and allocating income? • Would simpler formulas to calculate this be better? • What kind of technical issues do you see arising if the proposal was implemented? • How would the proposal affect the development of the digital economy in New Zealand and globally? • What kinds of additional details would you like to see included in further development? Proposal 2 – Marketing intangibles 4.25 This proposal has some similarities to the user participation approach, but it would not be limited to a subset of highly digitalised businesses. 4.26 The supporters of this proposal view the main challenges to the international tax framework as being scale without mass, and the importance of mobile intangibles. While these features are exacerbated by digitalisation, they are not limited to the digital econo my. 4.27 These features mean that a multinational can essentially reach into a country, either remotely or through a limited presence, and develop a customer base and other marketing intangibles. These marketing intangibles represent a significant source of value creation in the market country, but this value is not currently taxable in the market country. 4.28 For example, a well-known online retailer with no physical presence in a country can develop a large customer base in that country and know more about those customers’ shopping preferences than the local bookshop. The same is true for many branded consumer goods companies that can directly and digitally engage with their customers. Whereas previously a company would need a local presence to develop a market, high value sales and marketing activities can now be carried out online, from another country. 4.29 To address this issue, the proposal would change the international tax framework to require marketing intangibles and their corresponding risks to be allocated to the market country. This allocation would occur independently of the current transfer pricing rules, and so it would not depend on the current transfer pricing factors used to allocate income from intangibles. The market country would also be given the right to tax the allocated income, regardless of whether the multinational had a physical presence there. The market country would also be able to tax the profit allocated under the proposal if the 34 multinational had a subsidiary in the country carrying out only low value activities (for example, a limited risk distributor). 4.30 The proposal would directly not tax marketing intangibles themselves (or their transfer). Instead it would require a portion of the mult inat ionals profit to be apportioned to the market country by reference to the value of the marketing intangibles located there. 4.31 The marketing intangibles covered by this proposal would include intangibles that relate to marketing activities in the country, or which aid in the commercial exploitation of a product or service or have an important promotional value (such as brands and trade names used in a country, customer data, customer relationships and customer lists). 4.32 The proposal would treat these kinds of intangibles as linked to the market country. This is because the positive attitudes in the mind of its customers are created by, and the customer informat ion and data are acquired through, the active intervention of the multinational in the market. Accordingly, the proposal is presented as being consistent with the existing principle of aligning taxing rights with value creation. 4.33 In this regard, the proposal differentiates marketing intangibles from favourable demand conditions in the market country that exist independently of the actions of the mult inat ional. 33 Marketing intangibles are also differentiated from trade intangibles, such as patents and other technology related intangibles generated by research and development. This is because trade intangibles are not seen as having an intrinsic link with market countries. 4.34 This proposal is expected to apply to highly digitalised businesses, given their reliance on marketing intangibles. In this context, marketing intangibles could include those generated by free search services, free email, free data storage and the like. Accordingly, the marketing intangible proposal could produce a similar result in practice for highly digitalised firms as the user participation proposal. 4.35 However, the proposal would also apply to non-digital co mpanies wit h significant marketing intangibles in a country, unlike the user participation proposal. For example, it could apply to a fast-moving consumer goods company whose ability to set prices and shift products is significantly dependant on its brand value and consumer regard. Mechanics 4.36 The mechanics of the proposal have not been developed in any detail. In general however, this proposal would function similarly to the user participation proposal, in that it would ignore existing transfer pricing rules and involve a simplified residual profit spilt. The proposal would likely involve these simplified steps: 33 There are some countries that think such demand conditions should entitle the market country to taxing rights. An important subtext of the marketing intangibles approach is that it seeks to expand a market country’s taxing rights, without supporting the right of countries to tax a multinational simply by virtue of providing the market for its products. 35 1. The residual profit of the multinational group would be determined by deducting the profit attributable to the group’s routine activities from its total profits (as with the user participation proposal). 2. Part of that profit would then be allocated to marketing intangibles. This allocation would not include any profit attributable to trade intangibles. This allocation could be done under traditional transfer pricing principles, or it could be based on a simplified residual profit split method, which would use mechanical approximations. 3. The profit allocated to marketing intangibles would be allocated between the various markets countries in which the multinational operates. This would be based on agreed metrics, such as sales or revenues. This would occur regardless of which entity in the multinational group held legal title to the marketing intangibles, regardless of which entity carried out the functions related to those intangibles, and regardless of how the current transfer pricing rules would ordinarily allocate the income fro m the intangibles. 4. The market countries would be given the right to tax their share of those profits, regardless of the degree to which the multinational was physically present in that country. 4.37 Double tax is intended to be prevented (or at least minimised) by means of a tax credit granted by the countries where the residual profit was returned under standard transfer pricing principles. 4.38 The OECD consultation paper acknowledges that the scope of this proposal would need to be subject to some restrictions and limitations. The idea is that the proposal should only apply to businesses where the contribution o f marketing intangibles to profits is substantial. These limits could include materialit y thresholds (for example, cost ratios, size of customer base), de minimis exclusions, exclusion of certain industry sectors, exclusion of commodities, and so on. However, there is no detail on any of these yet. 36 Example 3: Marketing intangibles proposal This example indicates how the proposal could work if it used simple formulas. The particular formulas are indicative only. SM Group is a multinational which operates a social media platform with users around the world. The group provides free access to the platform and raises revenue by selling advertising on it. The head office in Country A developed and owns all of the platform’s technology. According to its financial statements, SM Group has $27 billion of consolidated group revenue for the year, $15 billion in expenses and $12 billion in total profits. The Group’s expenses comprise $4 billion in cost of goods sold, $4 billion marketing and sales costs, $6 billion research and development costs, and $1 billion in overheads and administration. The SM Group generates ten percent of its revenue from Country B. It has a subsidiary in Country B which provides marketing services and sales support. All of SM Group’s residual profit is returned in Country A under the current transfer pricing rules. The application of the marketing intangibles proposal would involve these mechanical steps: 34 Step 1: Determine the total amount of SM Group’s profit. The SM Group’s financial statements would be used for this purpose. These show a total profit of $12 billion. Step 2: Determine the profit attributable to routine activities (that is, the routine return): The routine return is assumed to be ten percent of all expenses, other than cost of goods sold. This means the routine return is calculated as $11 billion expenses (excluding cost of goods sold) × 10% = $1.1 billion. Step 3: Determine the residual profit, by subtracting the routine return from total profits. The total profits are $12 billion and the routine return is $1.1 billion. This means SM Group’s residual profit is $10.9 billion. Step 4: Determine the proportion of residual profit attributable to marketing intangibles. A formula is used to do this. The formula divides the residual profit between the marketing intangibles and the trade intangibles. It does this by comparing the costs incurred by SM Group for each type of intangible – that is, it compares SM Group’s marketing and sales (M&S) costs with its research and development (R&D) costs. In addition, the formula assumes that expenditure on R&D contributes twice as much value as expenditure on M&S for social media groups like SM Group. Based on this, the residual profit allocated to marketing intangibles is calculated as follows: $4 billion M&S cost × $10.9 billion residual profit $4 billion M&S cost + (2 × $6 billion R&D cost) = 0.25 × $10.9 billion = $2.725 billion residual profit allocated to marketing intangibles Step 5: Allocate the marketing intangibles profit to market countries. SM Group’s marketing intangibles profit is allocated between its market countries in proportion to SM Group’s revenue from each country. Country B contributes ten percent of SM Group’s total revenue, so Country B will be allocated ten percent of SM Group’s marketing intangibles profit. This means that country B will be allocated 10% × $2.725 billion = $272.5 million profit. Step 6: Market countries tax the profit allocated to them. Country B will tax SM Group on $272.5 million at its ordinary corporate tax rate, regardless of whether SM Group has a physical presence in Country B. Country A will give SM Group a credit for this tax. 34 We have broken down some of the steps in paragraph 4.36 into multiple steps to make the example easier to follow. 37 Comments 4.39 The proposal has the advantage of addressing the problems posed by scale without mass and reliance on intangibles, without trying to ring-fence the digital economy. Its broader scope means that it could be a solution to the wider tax problems proposed by digitalisation. 4.40 On the other hand, the proposal’s expanded scope means that it would apply to a much wider group of companies, and therefore the impact of any compliance costs or technical problems would also be magnified. For this reason, the proposal should arguably include strong limitations and exclusions to ensure it is targeted at large companies that derive significant value from their intangibles. However, these limitations and exclusions have not been developed yet. 4.41 One issue is that is still unclear how the proposal would apply to highly digitalised (and non-digitalised) companies in practice. These would also need to be appropriately taxed by the proposal in practice for it to be an effective solut ion. 4.42 This proposal would also affect more New Zealand companies than the user participation model. The Government would be concerned if the proposal had a serious adverse effect on our export sector. This possibility of this adverse impact is a real downside of the proposal (in its current form) from a New Zealand welfare perspective. Another concern is the potential increase in compliance and administration from the proposal (although this is something the OECD will try to mitigate in its design of the proposal). The Government is currently doing some work to ascertain the likely economic impact of the proposal on New Zealand, including our export sector. However, we will need to wait until the proposal is more detailed before we can come to any firm conclusio ns about this. Questions for submitters • What do you think of this proposal? • Is it too broadly targeted? • Are marketing intangibles an appropriate basis on which to allocate profit to a country? • Do you think marketing intangibles are sufficiently linked to a country to permit local profit allocation? • How do you think it would affect New Zealand businesses and consumers? • How would it affect New Zealand’s export sector? • What kind of de minimis thresholds and restrictions do you think should apply to the proposal? • What do you think of the method for determining and allocating profits? • Would simpler formulas to calculate this be better? • What kind of technical issues do you see arising if the proposal was implemented? 38 • How would the proposal affect the development of the digital economy in New Zealand and globally? • What kinds of additional details would you like to see included in further development? • Should the proposal be combined with the user participation proposal, and if so, how? Proposal 3 – Significant economic presence 4.43 The final proposal was submitted more recently by the OECD. For this reason, it has less detail. 4.44 The rationale for this proposal is that the digitalisation of the economy and other technological advances have enabled business enterprises to be heavily involved in the economic life of a country without needing a significant physical presence. This has rendered the existing nexus and profit allocat io n rules ineffective. 4.45 The proposal would apply to any multinational that developed a significant economic presence in a country through technology or other automated means. This means the proposal would apply to the digital economy in the broadest sense of the word – but it would not apply beyond the digital economy. Accordingly, the proposal is broader than the user participation proposal, but narrower (in principle) than the marketing intangibles proposal. 4.46 Whether a multinational had a significant economic presence would depend on a variety of factors. At a minimum, the multinational would need to generate revenue from a country on a sustained basis. One or more digital factors would then also need to be present. The other factors could include things like the existence of a user base, a minimum volume of digital content, billing in the local currency, a website in the local language, the presence of delivery or support services in the country, marketing activity, and so on. 4.47 Once a significant economic presence was established, profit would be allocated to that presence using a fractional apportionment method. This method involves four simplified steps: 1. The definition of the tax base to be divided. For example, the tax base could be determined by using the total group profits for accounting purposes. 2. The determination of the allocation factors for dividing that tax base between countries. These factors could include sales, assets, employees and users (where relevant). 3. The weighting of these allocation factors – that is, the factors could all be treated as equally important, or some factors may be given a higher weighting than others. 4. The allocation of the tax base between the market countries, using the weighted allocation factors. 39 Example 4: Significant economic presence proposal This example illustrates general fractional apportionment methods. The actual method used under this proposal will likely differ in some details. Ship Group operates an online platform selling various goods around the world. Customers order goods on Ship Group’s website or app. The goods are then shipped by Ship Group from the nearest regional warehouse to the customer. Ship Group is headquartered in Country A, which is also where all of its R&D is carried out. Ship Group’s residual profit under existing transfer pricing rules is returned in Country A (50%) and Country Z (50%). Ship Group’s consolidated financial statements show that it has total worldwide assets of $30 billion, total worldwide employees of 15,000, total revenue of $20 billion and total profits of $12 billion. Ship Group has no assets or employees in Country B. Ship Group derives $500 million of revenue from Country B. The amount of Ship Group’s profit allocated to Country B is determined through these mechanical steps: Step 1: Determine Ship Group’s tax base. In this case Ship Group’s tax base is its consolidated group profits for accounting purposes, which is $12 billion. Step 2: Determine the allocation factors. In this case, the allocation factors, which will be used to divide Ship Group’s profit between its market countries, are assets, employees and sales. Step 3: Weigh the allocation factors. Each factor has an equal weighting. Step 4: Allocate Country A a share of Ship Group’s tax base using the allocation factors. The OECD consultation paper does not discuss this step. However, it could involve dividing Ship Group’s tax base between the allocation factors, and then further dividing its tax base between countries by reference to each allocation factor. This could be calculated as follows: • Divide Ship Group’s tax base between the allocation factors. Ship Group’s tax base is its $12 billion profit, and the three allocation factors have equal weighting, meaning that each factor is allocated $4 billion of Ship Group’s profit. • Allocate the profit attributable to each factor to Country B. This would be done by reference to Country B’s share of each allocation factor, that is, its share of Ship Group’s total assets, employees and revenues. This would be calculated as follows: – Ship Group does not have any assets or employees in Country B, so Country B is not allocated any of the $8 billion (in total) of Ship Group’s tax base that is allocated to these factors. – For the $4 billion allocated to revenue, Country B’s share would be: $0.5 billion revenue from Country B × $4 billion $20 billion total revenue = 0.025 × $4 billion = $100 million • Add Country B’s share of the tax base allocated to each of the three factors together – so $0 million (assets) + $0 million (employees) + $100 million (revenue) = $100 million. Country B would tax Ship Group on $100 million at Country B’s ordinary corporate rate, regardless of whether Ship Group had a physical presence in Country B. Country A would give Ship Group a foreign tax credit for fifty percent of the tax payable in Country B and Country Z would give Ship Group a foreign tax credit for the remaining fifty percent. 4.48 This proposal may also involve consideration of other simplified methods for allocating profit, such as the deemed profits measures. Deemed profit measures deem certain types of business to have a predetermined profit margin. The taxpayer’s gross turnover is then multiplied by this profit margin, 40 to give its net taxable income. For example, if a profit margin of ten percent was deemed for an industry and a non-resident made $10 million of revenue from that industry type in Country A, then the non-resident would have net taxable income in Country A of $10 million × 10% = $1 million. 35 4.49 Finally, withholding taxes could be used under the proposal as a collection mechanism and enforcement tool. One possibility would be to have a gross withholding tax at a low rate, with the multinational able to elect to file a tax return and claim a refund for any excess tax withheld. Comments 4.50 This proposal would apply to the digital economy in the broadest sense of the word, so it would be a comprehensive solution to the problems posed by digitalisation (unlike the user participation approach). On the other hand, it also involves ring-fencing the digital economy, which would be contrary to the views of the OECD and the New Zealand and Australian Productivity Commissions. 4.51 The proposal also involves the most radical departure from the current profit allocat ion rules. A fractional apportionment method would not allocate taxing rights strictly on the basis of value creation. Instead it would move closer to a destination-based tax, where countries are entitled to tax the profits of a company based on the amount of goods sold there. 4.52 In this regard, consumption in a country is already taxed by goods and services taxes. Income tax on the other hand has traditionally taxed the factors of production (that is, the assets and activities of the taxpayer which produce, sell and deliver the goods or services). This implies that income taxing rights should be allocated by reference to where the factors of production are located, rather than where consumption occurs. 4.53 On the other hand, the inclusion of other allocation factors, such as emplo yees or assets would offset this destination bias to some degree (although these other factors also give rise to avoidance opportunities, which suggests they may need to be given a lower weighting). 36 4.54 Further, it could be argued that the country providing the market is making a real contribution to the value of the multinationals which sell their goods there. This is on the basis that both supply and demand are required for a company to ultimately create value, and therefore both supply side and demand side locations should be allocated part of a multinational’s profits. 4.55 In addition, in selling into a market, a multinational is benefiting from the public infrastructure and legal system which effectively creates and supports that market. Supporters of the proposal argue that the Government that provides this infrastructure should therefore have the right to tax some of the profit of the mult inat ionals that benefit fro m it. 35 New Zealand currently uses the deemed profit method to tax non-resident general insurers, who are deemed to derive income equal to ten percent of their New Zealand sourced premiums (section CR 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 36 For a discussion of the issues with these apportionment factors, and with formulary apportionment methods in general, see J Andrus and P Oosterhuis, Transfer Pricing After BEPS: Where Are We and Where Should We Be Going, Taxes: The Tax Magazine, March 2017. 41 4.56 In addition, this method would be much simpler to administer than the current rules. It would also largely remove the current strategies multinationals can use to avoid tax (although care would need to be taken that new avoidance opportunities were not created). 4.57 The proposal would in principle affect most New Zealand businesses that export goods or services online (although we would expect the proposal to provide an exemption for smaller businesses as it is developed). It would also allow New Zealand to tax most multinationals that sell goods or services to New Zealanders online. 4.58 One concern is that the more radical nature of the proposal may prevent it from gaining sufficient support from other countries. However, the proposal would have a better chance of acceptance if it was supported by businesses. Questions for submitters • What do you think of the proposal? • Is it too wide? • Are the proposed allocation factors of sales, assets, users and employees sufficient? • How would it affect New Zealand consumers and businesses? • Would it be beneficial or harmful to New Zealand? • What technical issues can you see arising from it? • What further details (such as de minimis thresholds) would you like to see if the proposal was developed? Other proposals 4.59 The OECD may also consider other proposals for reallocating profit. For example, the pharmaceutical and healthcare company Johnson & Johnson submitted an alternative proposal at the recent OECD public consultation on 13 and 14 March 2019. This provided for a fixed benchmark return to market countries (for example, 3% of sales), which could be increased or decreased depending on certain factors such as overall group profitability and marketing expense. 4.60 Participants were impressed by this alternative method, including businesses and the OECD Secretariat. Given the enthusiasm expressed for this approach there is a chance this method will also be considered by the OECD, alongside the existing three proposals. Johnson & Johnson’s proposal is available online along with all of the other OECD public submissions. 37 37 Available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/hou6dvuckmahoft/OECD-Comments-Received-Digital-March- 2019.zip?dl=0 42 Measure 2 – Minimum tax measure 4.61 The other measure being discussed at the OECD would ensure that multinationals pay a minimum amount of tax on their profits from low tax countries. This measure could be adopted in addition to one of the three proposals for measure 1 discussed previously. This measure could apply much wider than digitalised multinationals. 4.62 The rationale for the measure is that, while the OECD’s BEPS measures closed many of the gaps in the international tax framework, they did not provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of shifting profits into low tax countries. In particular: • BEPS Actions 8–10 (Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation) sought to align taxing rights with value creation, and so prevent the use of artificial structures to shift profit. While this prevented the use of aggressive tax avoidance structures, it is still possible to shift profits to low tax countries, provided a minimum level of economic activity is carried out there. • BEPS Action 2 (Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements) sought to prevent multinationals from exploiting differences in countries’ domestic tax regimes to generate double deductions or avoid paying tax. While these rules are effective against hybrid arrangements between two normal tax countries, it is still possible to generate the same overall result by inserting a low tax jurisdiction between the two countries. 38 4.63 These issues are particularly acute for intangibles, which are prevalent in the digital economy, but they also apply in a broader context. For example, a group finance company can be located in a low tax country. This finance company could then generate un-taxed profits from providing internal loans to other group members. Those loans would in turn reduce the tax payable by the other group members in their home countries (though a deduction for the interest payments). 4.64 Furthermore, the current system facilitates a race to the bottom, where countries lower their corporate tax rates in order to be more attractive to foreign investors than other countries. This risks shifting the taxes needed to fund public goods onto less mobile sources, such as labour and consumption. 4.65 For these reasons, while the minimum tax measure would be effective in addressing the profit shifting strategies which digital companies are ideally placed to use, the measure would not be limited to the digital economy. 4.66 The measure comprises two rules: • An income inclusion rule. This would allow a country to tax its residents on income earned by their foreign branches or subsidiaries if insufficient foreign tax was paid on that income. 38 Although the anti-avoidance rules of some countries may prevent this in some cases. 43 • A base eroding payments rule. This would deny a deduction and/or treaty benefits for certain payments to foreign companies if the payment was not subject to a minimum effective rate of foreign tax. Income inclusion rule 4.67 This would apply to a resident taxpayer with a direct or indirect interest in a foreign company over a specified percentage (for example, twenty five percent). It would require the taxpayer to return its share of the net income of the foreign company or branch if that net income was not subject to a minimum rate of tax. For example, if the taxpayer held fifty percent of a foreign company with net income taxed at below the minimum rate, the taxpayer would return fifty percent of the foreign company’s net income. 4.68 The minimum tax would a be a single, fixed rate that would apply across all countries (and would be lower than most countries’ domestic tax rates). If a multinational’s effective tax rate was below the minimum rate, then it would pay top up tax to that minimum rate (and not its domestic rate). For example, suppose a company was attributed with $100,000 of income under the rule, on which $5,000 (5%) of foreign tax was paid. The company’s domestic tax rate was 20% and the minimum effective tax rate under the rule was 10%. In this case, as the $100,000 of income was taxed at 5%, the company would need to pay additional top up tax of $5,000 under the rule, which would bring its total tax payable up to the 10% minimum rate. The company would not need to pay a further $10,000 to bring its tax up to its 20% domestic rate. 4.69 The amount of net income used to calculate a group’s effective tax rate would in principle be calculated under the parent company’s controlled foreign company rules or their domestic tax rules and would include a credit for any tax paid in the foreign country. However, to simplify the rules the OECD will also consider using a group’s financial accounts to calculate its net income. 4.70 For taxpayers with a foreign branch, the rule would achieve the same effect as for a taxpayer with a wholly owned foreign subsidiary. The rule would make the branch net income taxable in the taxpayer’s home country, with a credit for the foreign tax paid in the country where the branch is located. 4.71 There is little detail available yet about the rule, and a number of design features still need to be considered, including the minimum effective tax rate that would apply. Further important details are: • How the effective tax rate paid on the income in the foreign country would be calculated – for example, how would loss offsets (if any) be taken into account? • Whether the minimum tax rate should be calculated on a global basis (which would allow the blending of tax rates paid in low-tax and high- tax countries in calculating the multinational’s global effective tax rate), a country basis (so it would allow the tax rates of different group members in a country to be blended to calculate the effective tax rate paid by the multinational in that country) or a single entity basis? • The scope of the rule – the rule could be limited to only certain kinds of entities and payments. 44 • The role of economic substance in applying the test. While the OECD paper states it would apply regardless of economic substance, this proposition has not been agreed yet and several countries have already signalled their opposit ion to it. • Safe harbours and de minimis thresholds. 4.72 The minimum tax measure is similar to the current United States global intangible low taxed income (GILTI) rule, and the measure will likely draw on elements of the GILTI rule as it is developed further. 4.73 The GILTI was enacted by the United States in its recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (December 2017). The GILTI taxes United States shareholders on the inco me o f their foreign companies to the extent that income exceeds a certain threshold (ten percent of the value of the company’s tangible assets). The United States shareholder pays tax on this excess income at the rate of 10.5%, which is half the United States 21% corporate tax rate. Tax credits are allowed for eighty percent of the foreign tax paid, meaning the GILTI applies where a United States multinational pays tax of less than 13.125% on its overseas profits. Example 5: The income inclusion rule This example is indicative of how the income inclusion rule could work. It assumes some important details, such as a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5%, and that any income attributed under the rule will be taxed at the shareholder’s ordinary corporate tax rate. Shareholder is resident in New Zealand. Shareholder owns fifty percent of ForeignCo, which is resident in Country B. ForeignCo earns $200 million of income, which it only pays a 1% effective tax rate on in Country B. This 1% tax rate is below the income inclusion rule’s 12.5% minimum effective tax rate. Therefore, Shareholder is attributed with its share of ForeignCo’s income. Since Shareholder owns fifty percent of ForeignCo, Shareholder is attributed with fifty percent of ForeignCo’s $200 million income, or $100 million. Shareholder then returns this $100 million of income in New Zealand and pays tax on it at 28% (New Zealand’s ordinary corporate rate). Shareholder can claim a foreign tax credit in New Zealand for the 1% tax paid by Foreign Co in country B. Base eroding payments rule 4.74 The rule would apply to a broad range of payments. This rule would deny a deduction for payments to a related party (for example, twenty five percent common ownership) unless the payment was subject to a minimum level of tax. Tax for this purpose would include both tax paid in the related party’s country and also any withholding tax paid in the resident’s home country. 4.75 The rule could alternately deny treaty benefits to payments unless the payment was subject to a minimum tax rate. For example, the rule could deny the benefit of Article 7 of a DTA, which prevents a country from taxing the business profits of a non-resident except to the extent they are attributable to a permanent establishment in the country. This would mean that, if a payment from one country was not subject to a minimum effective rate of tax in the other country, the first country would still be able to tax the payment even if it was not attributable to a permanent establishment. 45 4.76 Again, there is little detail available yet about this rule, and similar design issues arise as for the income inclusion rule. In addition, the rule would need to be modified in its application to dividends, to ensure that these were not double taxed. There would also need to be ordering rules to stop the base eroding payments rule and the income inclusion rule from both applying to the same income. Example 6: Base eroding payments rule This example indicates how the base eroding payments rule could work. It assumes some important details, such as a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5%. SubCo is resident in New Zealand. SubCo makes a $100 million interest payment to its parent, ParentCo. ParentCo is resident in Country B, and pays no tax on the interest payment in Country B. New Zealand charges withholding tax of 15% under its domestic law, but this is limited to withholding tax of 5% under the DTA between New Zealand and Country B. Total tax is payable at the rate of 5% on SubCo’s interest payment to ParentCo (5% withholding tax charged in New Zealand + 0% income tax charged in Country B). This is lower than the rule’s 12.5% minimum effective tax rate, so New Zealand denies SubCo a deduction for its interest payment to ParentCo. 39 Comments 4.77 A minimum tax measure seems to be a promising solution to the problem of tax avoidance by multinationals. It would significantly reduce the ability and incentive for multinationals to engage in global tax avoidance. A multinational will have less incentive to avoid local taxes if it must pay a minimum level of tax on those profits elsewhere. It would also remove the competitive benefits of countries lowering their tax rates (or providing preferential tax regimes), as tax forgone by a multinational in one country would still be payable in another. 4.78 Global minimum taxes have also been supported by some economists, such as Joseph Stiglitz, 40 as a way of solving the current problems with global tax avoidance. The United States’ adoption of a minimum tax with its GILTI is also a significant endorsement. 4.79 The effectiveness of the OECD’s measure would depend on several factors, most importantly the rate at which it was set. There are also several technical issues that would also need to be addressed, not least of which is how to determine the effective foreign tax rate. 4.80 There is also a question of compliance and administrative costs. The OECD’s minimum tax would need to be significantly easier to administer than the United States GILTI for example, particularly if it is to be applied by developing countries. 39 It is not clear at this stage whether the base eroding payment rule would deny both a deduction and DTA benefits to the same payment – however it seems unlikely they would do both where the result of denying DTA benefits was to tax the payment at above the minimum effective tax rate. 40 For example, see https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/corporate-tax-avoidance-end-transfer-pricing- by-joseph-e-stiglitz-2019-02 46 4.81 Therefore, while the OECD’s proposed minimum tax has potential, it needs to be developed in more detail. Questions for submitters • What do you think of the proposed minimum tax rate? • What should be the minimum effective tax rate? • Should application of the rules be subject to some kind of substance or avoidance test? • Should the rules be limited to certain kinds of payments (for example, interest) or ent it ies? • How do you think the rules would affect New Zealand businesses and consumers? • What details and design features would you like to see included in the rules going forward? Likelihood and timing of an OECD solution 4.82 The Government is hopeful that there will be an OECD solution in a reasonable timeframe, but this will be challenging. While countries have agreed to reach a consensus solution by 2020, they still disagree on what should be done. The OECD is making progress on developing a potential solution, but this is currently being done on a without prejudice basis. This means that countries are not committing to ultimately support the technical solutions being developed. On the other hand, the increasing adoption of unilateral measures is making a strong case for a multilateral solution, while incentivising countries that benefit from the current framework to agree to changes. 4.83 The OECD is aiming to get G20 approval of its preferred measures in June 2019. If approval is given, then an OECD solution is more likely. On the other hand, failure to receive G20 approval would be a serious, perhaps fatal blow to an OECD solution (in a reasonable timeframe at least). Therefore, we should have a better idea of the chances of an OECD solution after the June G20 meeting. 4.84 If an OECD solution was achieved in 2020, it may be at a fairly high level and require further development. In addition, any agreed solution would still need to be implemented. This would require changes to DTAs, with a multilateral instrument needing to be agreed and drafted for countries to sign. 4.85 If we look at what happened previously in the BEPS project, the OECD made its final recommendations in October 2015, and the DTA related BEPS changes have just started coming into effect from 2019 (with the changes for many DTAs not applying until 2020). 4.86 Based on this, we consider that any OECD solution for the digital econo my would not take effect for another three to five years after that solution was agreed. This means that if a solution is reached at the OECD in 2020, it may not be effective until 2025. 47 Revenue impacts of the OECD measures 4.87 It is not possible to estimate the revenue impact of the OECD proposals. This is because they lack critical details, such as their precise scope and de minimis thresholds. 4.88 The revenue impact is only one factor that the Government will consider it evaluating the proposals. Other important factors include the effect of the proposals on compliance costs, and their impact on New Zealand’s economic efficiency and wellbeing. 48 CHAPTER 5 Conclusion 5.1 The Government supports an OECD led internat ional so lution to the problems of taxing the digital econo my. This would integrate the taxation of the digital economy into the income tax system, and so avoid the need for a separate DST with all its related issues. An internat ional so lutio n would also allow any income tax payable in New Zealand to be credited overseas, thus avoiding double taxation. Finally, it would provide a common international basis for the taxation of the digital economy, rather than a patchwork of separate taxes. 5.2 Therefore, the Government proposes continuing to participate in the OECD discussions with a view to supporting an international solution (bearing in mind its effect on our export sector). 5.3 However, the Government will seriously consider adopting a DST if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year. Factors to be considered in making this decision are: • whether the OECD can make sufficient progress on an international solut ion this year; • whether a critical mass of other countries also adopts DSTs (to reduce the reputational risks of adopting a DST); • whether New Zealand companies would be unduly affected by a DST; and • whether a DST would all be passed on to New Zealand consumers. Next steps and timing 5.4 The Government will use the feedback received on this discussion document to make its final policy decisions. At this stage, we anticipate a decision on the adoption of a DST in the second half of 2019. 5.5 If the Government does decide to adopt a DST, then its introduction would go through the generic tax policy process. This means the public would have a further opportunity to submit on the design of the DST (either at the Select Committee stage, or earlier). The legislation for any DST would probably be introduced in 2020. Question for submitters • Do you agree with the Government’s assessment of the best ways to address the current problems with taxing the digital economy? 49 APPENDIX 1 Size and importance of the digital economy This appendix sets out background information on what the digital economy is, along with its importance and size in New Zealand and globally. What is the digital economy? The digital economy is a term used to refer to economic activity that relies significantly on information and communication technology. The term does not refer to the provision of the information and communications infrastructure itself, but to the economic activities carried on over the top of that infrastructure (and so is sometimes referred to as over the top activities). The term broadly encompasses e-commerce, including the sale of both digital and physical products and services over the internet or via apps, online advertising, social networks, and intermediation platforms (such as Airbnb and Uber). The OECD has noted that most business models are becoming digitalised to some extent. Consequently, it would be difficult to completely ring-fence the digital economy from the rest of the economy for tax purposes. Following this, some of the analysis and potential solutions have focussed on highly digitalised business models. These business models are typified by the factors that create the most problems for the current international tax framework: • cross jurisdictional scale without mass; • heavy reliance on intangible assets; and • the importance of data and active user participation to value creation. A DST would only apply to these kinds of business models. However, the OECD is considering proposals that would apply more broadly, including beyond the digital economy altogether. The importance of the digital economy in New Zealand The digital economy provides many benefits to New Zealanders. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Emplo yment (MBIE) estimates that people who shop and bank online can save nearly $1,000 each year. MBIE’s initial calculations suggest achieving universal digital inclusion in New Zealand could deliver economic benefits of over $1 billion a year. 41 The digital economy also increases the productivity of New Zealand businesses. New Zealand businesses with high intensity information and communications technology use are six percent more likely to improve productivity. 42 Nearly a third of overall industrial output growth in Europe is attributable to the uptake of digital technologies. 43 41 See the report Digital New Zealanders: The Pulse of our Nation, Digital inclusion research group, 2017. 42 See MBIE’s report Information and Communications Technology, 2017. 43 See the European Commission’s Impact Assessment on a DST – SWD(2018) 81 final, page 10, https://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/sites/taxation/files/fair\_taxation\_digital\_economy\_ia\_21032018.pdf 50 Recently the Australian and New Zealand Productivity Commissions issued a report on the digital econo my. 44 The report notes that digital technologies have transformed many aspects of daily life, bringing benefits to consumers (more choice, lower prices, better information and greater convenience) and disrupting a number of industries and business models. In fact, given the ubiquitous nature of digital in everyday life, the report notes that there is little to differentiate the digital economy from the broader economy; in other words, the digital economy is the economy. However, digital innovation is putting many regulatory regimes under pressure – including tax. The report broadly recommends that the Australian and New Zealand Governments create an environment that can enable the growth of the digital economy by: • designing regulatory regimes to enable innovation while controlling harms; • using data and digital technologies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government services to firms; and • working together to develop and promote regional and global standards that enable greater use and diffusion of digital technologies. The Government is committed to developing the digital economy in New Zealand and ensuring access to it for all New Zealanders. The Government’s cross-agency Digital Economy Work Programme aims to support all New Zealanders to fully participate in the fast moving digital economy. However, it is also important that the digital economy is fairly taxed. The size of the digital economy Internet usage Internet usage worldwide is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, as figure 1 fro m Hootsuite and we are social shows. 45 Figure 1: Internet usage worldwide 44 Australian Productivity Commission and New Zealand Productivity Commission, Growing the digital economy in Australia and New Zealand. Maximising opportunities for SMEs, 2019. 45 https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018 51 Internet use is also widespread in New Zealand. Currently 93.8% of New Zealanders use the internet, including 97% of New Zealanders under 65. Of these only 9% are classified as being low level users. 46 In addit ion, two-thirds of New Zealand internet users visit social media every day, 47 with the average time spent per day being 1 hour 53 minutes. 48 MBIE estimates that, of New Zealand’s economically significant firms: 49 • 100% use the internet; • 98% have a website; • 53% use it to make internet sales; • 44% have internet sales of more than 10% of total sales; • 62% have sales outside New Zealand; • 96% use the internet for online ordering; and • 97% use the internet for finance. Overall size of the digital economy The total global ecommerce market was estimated to be worth US$7.7 trillion in 2018 50 (including both the retail and business to business market). The retail ecommerce market (which excludes the business to business transactions) was estimated to be worth US$2.3 trillion in 2017, with a projected rise to nearly US$4.5 trillion by 2021. Figure 2 sets out the anticipated size of the retail ecommerce market, together with its growth rate and share of total retail revenue. Figure 2: Anticipated size of the retail e-commerce market 46 Diaz Andrade, A., M.R., Karimikia, H. & Techatassanasoontorn, A., World Internet Project: The Internet in New Zealand 2017. New Zealand Work Research Institute, Auckland, 2018. 47 World Internet Project New Zealand. 48 Hootsuite, we are social, 2018, https://www.slideshare.net/wearesocial/digital-in -2018-in -oceania-part-2- east 49 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Information and Communications Technology, 2017. 50 https://www.statista.com/study/44442/statista-report-b2b-e-commerce/ 52 Business to business ecommerce sales are estimated to be worth 2.3 times the total retail sales. 51 This would produce a total estimated ecommerce market of nearly US$10.5 trillion in 2021. Some figures for Europe show that: • In 2006 only one tech company was in the top 20, accounting for 7% of market capitalisation. In 2017, nine out of the top 20 were tech companies, accounting for 54% of market capitalisation (out of the top 20). • Between 2008 and 2016 the revenue of the top five e-commerce retailers grew by 32% a year on average. During the same period, revenue in the entire EU retail sector grew on average by only 1% a year. • In the last seven years, the average annual revenue growth for the top digital firms was around 14%, compared to 3% for information technology and telecoms firms and only 0.2% for other mult inat ionals. For New Zealand, the total consumer online shopping expenditure (that is, excluding business-to-business (B2B)) in 2015 was estimated at $4.7 billion (excluding GST). This consisted of $3.5 billion in goods and $1.2 billion on services. Of this, $1.6 billion was spent on goods and $0.5 billion was spent on services supplied from offshore. Further, online shopping had an average year on year growth rate of eighteen percent up to 2016 (with offshore sales growing faster than domestic). 52 By contrast New Zealand’s general retail market has generally grown from 4–6% each year since 2012 – significantly less than the online market. 53 For 2017, New Zealand Post estimates that the sale of goods online grew at a rate of 13% compared to a growth rate of only 1% for goods sold by bricks and mortar retail. This was made up of a 9% growth in domestic online sales, and a 23% growth in online cross border sales. Currently ecommerce makes up 8.1% of all retail sale of goods in New Zealand (in China by comparison it is already 23.1%). We do not have figures for B2B online transactions in New Zealand. However, we can use the existing global estimate that the B2B market is 234% of the B2C market to estimate a B2B online market in New Zealand for 2015 of $11 billion, and a total online market of $15.7 billion in 2015. Approximately $7 billion of this would be paid to offshore suppliers, if they made up the same proportion as they do for B2C supplies. Assuming an 18% growth rate, this would produce a total market of $25.8 billion in 2018, with supplies from offshore worth $11.5 billion and cross border digital services provided to New Zealand consumers, of approximately $2.7 billion in 2018. Given the assumptions required, these figures are unlikely to be very accurate, but they do give a ballpark indication of the size of the digital economy in New Zealand. Of these figures, the $2.7 billion for cross border services is the most relevant for a proposed DST. This is because the DST would not apply to the supply of goods or most domestically provided e-services (given the nature of e-services provided in New Zealand). Instead it would apply to a subset of the $2.7 billion of cross border services. 51 https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics 52 These figures are taken from an unpublished MBIE report in August 2017. The MBIE figures are based on information published by the BNZ (https://www.bnz.co.nz/business-banking/support/commentary/online-retail- sales-index) and Nielsen (http://www.nielsen.com/nz/en/insights/news/2016/new-zealanders-open-their-laptop- lids-instead-of-their-wallets.html). 53 https://www.focus-economics.com/country-indicator/new-zealand/retail-sales 53 Mult i-sided platforms and online advertising are particularly important elements of the digital economy for the purpose of this document. This is because a DST would apply to them (subject to de minimis thresholds). Accordingly, we discuss them specifically next. Intermediation – the sharing and gig economies An intermediat ion platform (or a mult i-sided platform as it is also called) generally refers to platforms used to facilitate the buying and selling of goods and services between unrelated persons. Digitalisation has allowed people to quickly and relatively cheaply connect and transact on these platforms, including across countries and in an increasing range of areas. Intermediation platforms form both the sharing economy (which is linked with assets) and the gig economy (which is linked with services). These include travel platforms like Uber, accommodation platforms like Airbnb and peer to peer lending platforms like Harmoney. Increasingly they also allow the self-employed to supply many other types of services to consumers and also businesses, such as house hold repairs and furniture assembly. Currently the sharing economy makes up a small share of the economy on most estimates. In 2014, the global sharing economy was estimated to be worth US$14 billion. However, it has been growing rapidly and is forecast to increase to US$335 billion by 2025. 54 Figures from the United States show that transport platforms dominate the sharing and gig economies, both in terms of payments and users. This is followed by asset sharing and selling platforms. Labour supply platforms make up a very small proportion of the sharing economy currently. This is shown in figure 3 prepared by JP Morgan Chase & Co Institute. They examined the proportion of payments into 2.3 million distinct Chase checking accounts from the different kinds of sharing platforms. 55 54 https://www.statista.com/statistics/830986/value-of-the-global-sharing-economy/ 55 Farrell, Diana, Fiona Greig, and Amar Hamoudi, The Online Platform Economy in 2018: Drivers, Workers, Sellers and Lessors, JPMorgan Chase Institute, 2018, https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/institute/report- ope-2018.htm 54 Figure 3 We expect the sharing and gig economies in New Zealand to follow a similar pattern. The JP Morgan Chase & Co Institute study also shows that the sharing and gig economies are not replacing traditional work for most people but are being used to supplement their earnings from it. This also seems consistent with the New Zealand experience, as the self-employment rate here has been declining moderately since 2000. 56 We do not have many statistics in New Zealand for the sharing and gig economies. For accommodation, Airbnb is the main provider in New Zealand. Airbnb guests spent $781.4 million in 2017, representing 2.8% of all tourism expenditure in New Zealand. 57 For transport platforms, Uber is the main provider in New Zealand. Uber has not publicly released its revenue for New Zealand, but it notes that New Zealand riders travelled a combined 83,158,994 kilometres using the Uber app in 2018 – the equivalent of travelling to the moon and back 108 times. 58 Uber’s global revenue for 2018 (including from Uber Eats, its food delivery business) was $11.4 billion (up 43% from 56 https://ecoprofile.infometrics.co.nz/auckland/Employment/SelfEmployment 57 Deloitte, Economic effects of Airbnb in New Zealand, 2018. 58 https://www.uber.com/en-NZ/newsroom/nz2018review/ 55 2017) on gross driver bookings of $50 billion (up 43%). Uber is still loss making, with $1.8 billion of adjusted losses (down 15%). 59 Trademe is the main platform New Zealanders use to buy and sell goods to each other. For its financial year ended June 2018, Trademe’s annual revenue was $250.4 million (up 6.6% from 2017) with net operating profits of $96.6 million (up 3.9%). 60 There are some concerns with the sharing economy however. It can undermine traditional business sectors, such as the taxi and hotel industries. Workers in the gig economy also lack employment protections (as they are classified as independent contractors) and may earn uncertain and/or low income. Online advertising Online advertising is the other important component of the digital economy for tax purposes. According to the OECD, time on the Internet has overtaken time spent on traditional media channels in many countries. This is largely driven by growth in the use of mobile devices, with mobile searches outstripping desktop searches in the last few years. Traditional avenues for reaching consumers (especially younger consumers) are becoming less relevant and are being replaced by online channels. Recent growth in advertising revenue has been largely driven by double digit growth in online advertising, and for the first time in 2017, global expenditure on online advertising outstripped television advertising expenditure. To give an idea of the importance of advertising to some of the biggest tech companies, advertising is Google’s primary revenue source, accounting for US$79 billion in 2016. 61 Kiwis are now spending around half of their media consumption time online. 62 For New Zealand, the total online advertising market for 2017 was $923 million, which was 36% of New Zealand’s total advertising market ($2.561 billion) and an increase of 9.7% over the previous year. 63 59 https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/uber-2018-financial-results.html 60 Although Trade Me would not be caught by a DST if it had a €750 million global turnover de minimis threshold. 61 OECD, Online Advertising: Trends Benefits and Risks for Consumers, January 2019. 62 Mosh Social Media, The New Zealand Facebook Report 2017, 2017. 63 New Zealand Advertising Industry Revenue Report 2017, http://www.asa.co.nz/wp- content/uploads/2018/04/ASA-2017-Media-Turnover.pdf 56 Figure 4 shows the composition of the New Zealand advertising market in 2017. 64 Figure 4 Search accounted for 62% of total online advertising in the third quarter of 2018 65 and the total online advertising revenue for the quarter was $266 million ($1.064 billion on an annualised basis).

Policy for taxing multinationals New Zealand’s policy for taxing multinationals has been guided by two main considerations: • New Zealand is a small open economy and we compete for capital with the rest of the world. This means we want New Zealand to be an attractive place for non- residents to invest and do business. However, we also want our fair share of tax. Our rules for taxing multinationals attempt to balance these competing objectives. • New Zealand’s tax policy is constrained by the international tax framework – we cannot unilaterally adopt tax measures which conflict with that framework. Recent measures to tax multinationals New Zealand has enacted several measures in recent years to improve our ability to tax multinationals. Many of these are in response to the OECD’s BEPS project. The OECD’s BEPS project arose out of significant global media and political concern about evidence suggesting that some multinationals paid little or no tax anywhere in the world. This problem is referred to as base erosion and profit shifting or BEPS. BEPS tax planning strategies exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. The OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan was finalised in October 2015. The Action Plan consists of 15 reports that contain recommendations to counter BEPS activities in three key areas: • more robust tax laws; • international agreements and co-operation; and • improving transparency and exchange of information. The recently enacted Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 is dedicated to countering multinational’s BEPS activities in New Zealand. The measures in the Act prevent multinationals from using: • artificially high interest rates on loans from related parties to shift profits out of New Zealand; • hybrid mismatch arrangements that exploit differences between countries’ tax rules to achieve an advantageous tax position; • artificial arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence (a permanent establishment) in New Zealand; 58 • related-party transactions (transfer pricing) to shift profits into offshore group members in a manner that does not reflect the actual economic activities undertaken in New Zealand and offshore; and • certain tactics to stymie an Inland Revenue investigation, such as withholding relevant information that is held by an offshore group member. In addition, New Zealand signed the OECD’s Multilateral Instrument on 7 June 2017, which amends most of New Zealand’s bilateral DTAs to prevent them from being used to facilitate BEPS activities. These measures (together with our existing law) address all of the BEPS issues identified by the OECD. New Zealand’s response to BEPS is also generally aligned with Australia’s. The only significant differences are that Australia has adopted a separate diverted profits tax, while we have gone further than Australia in limiting high-priced debt (which was identified as our number one BEPS issue). These measures are only the latest in a series New Zealand has undertaken to strengthen our laws for taxing mult inat ionals. Other measures include: • applying GST to cross border services – including e-books, music, videos and software purchased from overseas websites; • introducing legislation to apply GST to the cross-border supply of low value goods to New Zealand customers; • strengthening non-resident withholding tax rules (to ensure non-residents cannot claim interest deductions without also being required to withhold tax on that interest within a reasonable period); • limit ing the use o f look-through companies as conduit vehicles for investment by non-residents (to prevent them from being used to arbitrage New Zealand and foreign tax laws); • clarifying that New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule overrides DTAs; and • improving exchange of information between tax authorities, in particular by implementing the OECD’s exchange of cross-border rulings and Country-by- Country reporting initiatives under which tax authorities exchange certain informat ion on large mult inat ionals. New Zealand’s economic framework for international tax The measures set out in this discussion document are consistent with New Zealand’s economic framework for international tax. New Zealand has a general broad-base low rate (BBLR) tax framework, which aims to minimise distortions and promote economic efficiency. A robust company tax rate is an important component of this framework. The company tax rate should apply to both residents and non-residents who derive income from New Zealand sources. 66 It should not favour some taxpayers or some types of economic activity. 66 There are a number of reasons for applying the company tax rate to non-residents, such as ensuring that location- specific economic rents are taxed, maintaining current taxation of sunk investments and land, ensuring an equal playing field for local and non-resident competitors, and the availability of tax credits for New Zealand tax in the non-resident’s country (which effectively reimburses the non-resident for the New Zealand tax charged). 59 The current inability to fully tax the value generated in the digital economy that is paid to non-residents implies that this source of income is often taxed at a lower rate than other sources. This distortion can lead to unfairness and the substitution of low-taxed businesses for tax-paying businesses – specifically favouring foreign investors who can benefit from the current issues with the international tax framework. As the income generated from the digital economy is in part specific to the market location and the value generated by the users of that product, the overall reduction in investment or national income from the taxation of this source of income may be limited. For government spending initiatives, the tax revenue that is lost from an inability to tax the digital economy appropriately needs to be made up from other sources. As a result, the higher tax burden on other sectors of the economy will come with real economic costs. The proposed measures protect New Zealand’s BBLR tax base from these distortions and should ensure a more appropriate level of tax is paid by all taxpayers on their economic activities in New Zealand. They are consistent with New Zealand’s general approach to taxing inbound investment. Further information on New Zealand’s international tax framework and the economic impact of such base maintenance measures is set out in New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment. 67 67 Available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-other-nz-framework-inbound-investment/overview
