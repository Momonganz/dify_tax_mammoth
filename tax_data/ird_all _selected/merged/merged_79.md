Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on the Future Direction of Tax Administration Portfolio Purpose Finance / Revenue This paper seeks agreement to release a government green paper on the future of the New Zealand tax administration system. Previous Consideration Summary On 2 March 2015, Cabinet agreed to the government’s revenue strategy, and noted that the tax policy work programme has been designed to implement that strategy \[CAB Min (15) 6/9\]. Policy work to support the modernising of the tax administration system is a significant aspect of the tax policy work programme. The attached government green paper, which builds on a draft working paper that was produced as part of a 2014 conference on “Tax Administration for the 21st Century”, is the start of this aspect of the programme. The government green paper describes some of the policy areas of tax administration that will need to be examined to ensure the tax system is fit for purpose. It seeks feedback on whether the policy direction for modernising and simplifying the tax administration system is heading in the right direction - it will therefore help to identify any errors or omissions of scope before more detailed policy work is undertaken. The government green paper makes the following assumptions: • key tax bases will remain substantially in place, based on the broad-base low-rate (BBLR) tax framework; • social policy and other non-tax functions currently administered by Inland Revenue (eg relating to Working for Families, child support, student loans and KiwiSaver) will continue to be a key part of Inland Revenue’s portfolio of work; • the use of technology and the implementation and delivery of digital services is a key enabler to ensure the policy direction is realised. The diagram on page 5 depicts the key elements upon which the policy direction described in the government green paper (and in the associated discussion document on Better Digital Services) is based.

We seek the agreement of the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to release a Government green paper on the future of the New Zealand tax administration system. Executive summary 2. The Government green paper describes some of the policy areas of tax administration that will need to be examined to ensure the tax system is fit for purpose as we progress through the 21st century. The document indicates the key areas where change may be required to frame and enable Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme in modernising and simplifying tax administration. 3. The document is the first in a series of documents that will be released over the next few years. This green paper seeks feedback on the overall direction of potential changes and aims to identify any errors or omissions in scope before more detailed policy analysis is undertaken. 4. In conjunction with the release of this document, the Minister of Revenue is also seeking Cabinet’s agreement to release a discussion document which considers whether the current policy and legislative framework facilitates the implementation and delivery of secure digital services (see Cabinet paper titled Making Tax Simpler - Better Digital Services discussion document). Objectives 5. The purpose of the business transformation programme is to design a tax system that makes it easier and simpler for New Zealanders to interact with Government, contributing to the goals of providing better public services. A modem tax system that is simple to comply with will mean less effort is required from New Zealanders and New Zealand businesses in managing their tax and social policy affairs, boosting overall compliance. Costs to the Government of administering the tax system should be kept to a minimum. 6. A flexible tax system that utilises existing business processes will mean lower compliance costs. This means that people can spend less time on tax and more time on Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 7 of 221 running their businesses, supporting our wider goal to build a competitive and productive economy as part of the Business Growth Agenda. 7. These objectives will be achieved by: • making it easier and less expensive for businesses and other customers to meet their tax and social policy obligations, boosting overall levels of compliance; • increasing certainty through easy access to information, earlier and simpler transactions, timely and effective resolution of issues, obligations being met through normal business processes, improved response times and tailored interactions; • providing value for money for the Government through reduced administration costs, and more efficient collection of debt; • re-using data across Government, where appropriate; • increased use of digital services by both Inland Revenue and its customers; • ensuring that the integrity of the tax and social policy system is maintained by identifying key policy concerns and audit risks easily; and • providing flexibility for future changes. 8. To begin the dialogue Inland Revenue, in conjunction with the Treasury and Victoria University, hosted a conference called, “Tax Administration for the 21st century” in July 2014. 9. As part of the conference officials produced a draft working paper that outlined, at a very high level, a vision of some specific policy changes that could frame and support Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. The draft green paper attached to this Cabinet paper takes that draft working paper a step further in order to test its underlying assumptions. The future for business 10. The first building block is to streamline the collection of PAYE, GST and related information and integrate these obligations into business processes. This will reduce the compliance costs for businesses as “withholders” on behalf of others. The timely provision of data through the use of electronic and internet based technology is a key enabler to improve the tax system. Our understanding from industry sources is that over 50 per cent of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) use some form of accounting software. 11. Key benefits for business include: • reduced tax compliance costs in particular for small and medium enterprises; • greater speed and predictability in businesses’ tax affairs; • a two-way transfer of information between business’s own systems (e.g. payroll) and Inland Revenue, meaning that tax compliance obligations are being met as part of a business’s normal processes; and • errors being avoided in the first place or rectified in near real time. 12. Businesses not only withhold tax on behalf of others, but also pay tax on the income they earn. The green paper seeks feedback on how to simplify calculations for provisional tax, so that they are based on real-time information (for example when using approved accounting software), and the use of payment options that better reflect taxpayers’ cash flows. It also seeks feedback on other business tax related issues the Government should focus on from a tax administration perspective. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 8 of 221 13. Another focus is on ensuring it is easy for small businesses to comply with their tax obligations improving overall levels of compliance. Tailoring interactions to ensure the right support is available at the right time and the use of improved technology and business systems should be encouraged, making it easy to comply right from the start and hard not to. The future for individuals 14. For individual taxpayers, it is envisaged that in the future: • taxpayers will be able to quickly and easily satisfy their tax obligations via digital channels; • Inland Revenue will pre-populate online income tax returns and, for the majority of individuals, any interaction will involve just confirming income sources and amounts; • those with income sources that by their nature do not make it possible to pre-populate returns, amounts from these income sources would be the only additional information required from those individuals; • refunds will be made quickly and, in most cases, automatically (based on better use of data and analytics); and • any outstanding tax debts will be recovered proactively through automatic withholding from existing income sources, where appropriate. The future for social policy 15. The intention is to design a social policy system that works for the customer and is fit for purpose. It should have many of the advantages that individual taxpayers will receive, such as pre-population of information Inland Revenue or government already holds. It should also match the timeliness of payments to the need to receive (or ability to pay) on a more real­ time basis, providing increased certainty for individuals and families. The policy and legislative framework 16. As part of business transformation, key administration and legal issues that frame and underpin much of New Zealand’s tax system need to be considered. Changes to the way that taxpayers interact with Inland Revenue through better use of technology provides an opportunity to consider fundamental aspects of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) including the roles of the Commissioner, of taxpayers and third parties, and information sharing and secrecy. Background 17. Having a good overall tax system means having both good tax policies and a good administrative system; these two elements go hand in hand. In addition, the perception of fairness, together with the ease with which taxpayers can actually comply with their obligations, is also very important in assessing the overall effectiveness of a tax system. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 9 of 221 18. New Zealand’s tax policies are held in high regard internationally.1 A number of independent domestic reviews have also been undertaken in recent years and have fundamentally supported the policy settings that frame New Zealand’s tax system. 19. Business transformation is a long-term programme to consider different ways of delivering the tax and social policy system. To frame and support the programme, a review of the current policy and legislative settings is required. Modernising the tax administration system includes re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with taxpayers, and looking at possible changes to, amongst other pieces of legislation, the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 20. Business transformation will enable Inland Revenue to become a modem revenue organisation that is recognised for service and excellence and: • is agile, effective and efficient; • enables customers to self-manage with speed and certainty, thereby reducing compliance costs; • enables the Government to make timely policy changes; and • works with other agencies to optimise interaction across government. 21. Business transformation will be delivered in four customer-focused stages over a period of approximately eight years. In April 2014 (CBC (14) 2 refers) we advised that the first stage of the programme would be delivered in three major work streams: • strategic; • tactical; and • foundational. 22. The strategic work stream includes policy work to identify legislative barriers to providing digital services, and streamlining the collection of PAYE and GST information. 23. The following diagram depicts the key elements upon which the policy direction described in this Government green paper and the digital services paper (being concurrently considered by this Cabinet committee), is based. 1 See, for example: Deloitte’s 2014 Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey Report ihtto://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/T ax/dttl-tax-ap-2014-tax- comnlexitv-survev.pdf) Washington DC Tax Foundation’s 2014 international tax competitiveness index (see http://taxfoundation.org/article/2014-intemational-tax-competitiveness-index) For example the M cLeod Review in 2001 and, more recently, the Tax Working Group in 2010 Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 10 of 221 INDIVIDUALS1 TAX OBLIGATIONS e.g. More pre-population of the income resulting from improved collection of withholding tax information OTHER WITHHOLDING TAX REGIMES SUCH AS RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX e.g. Streamline the collection of other withholding tax information - integrating tax obligations into business processes PAYE e.g. Streamline the collection of PAYE, GST and related information - integrate tax obligations into business process DIGITAL SERVICES REVIEW BROADER TAX ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY SETTINGS TO FRAME AND SUPPORT THE BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME tiiViZ r Figure 1 24. The attached Government green paper is the first in a series of papers that will be released over the next two years. The series will build on aspects of the proposals contained in the attached green paper. Appendix A details the specific topics and indicative timing for the release of future green papers. The Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme 25. Cabinet recently approved the release of the Government’s tax policy work programme for the next 18 months (CAB Min (15) 6/9 refers). The policy work to support the modernisation of the tax administration system is a significant aspect of the work programme. The release of the attached Government green paper is the start of that aspect of the delivery of our tax policy work programme. Key assumptions 26. Some key assumptions have been made during the early consideration of the policy issues that are likely to underpin Inland Revenue’s business transformation. These include the following: • key tax bases will remain substantially in place based on the broad-base low-rate (BBLR) tax framework2; • social policy and other non-tax functions currently administered by Inland Revenue (for example, in relation to Working for Families, child support, student loans and KiwiSaver) will continue to be a key part of Inland Revenue’s portfolio of work; and TAX TYPE RATIONALISATION. WHERE APPROPRIATE BUSINESS TAX OBLIGATIONS e.g. Review and streamline the collection of business taxes such as provisional tax - integrating tax obligations into business processes SOCIAL POLICY eg. Review and streamline the delivery of social ossistanceproducts such as Working h r Families Tax Credits 2 BBLR ensures that as broad a range o f income and expenditure as practicable is taxed at rates that are as low as possible. A BBLR system helps keep administration and compliance costs low, and keeps economic distortions to a minimum. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 11 of 221 • the use of technology and the implementation and delivery of digital services is a key enabler to ensure the policy direction is realised. The future for business Employment income (PA YE) 27. As highlighted in figure 1 streamlining the collection of PAYE information is a key strategic element to modernising the administration of the tax system. Doing so will lead to a reduction in compliance costs for businesses. 28. PAYE is a withholding regime for salary and wages. A business that employs staff has certain obligations imposed on it, including the deduction of tax and ACC levies for each employee each payday.3 PAYE information is received monthly from employers (or intermediaries) through the employer monthly schedule (EMS). 29. The Government green paper considers three main issues in relation to employment income: • the collection of PAYE information; • modernisation of the PAYE rules more generally; and • enhancing withholding taxes to cover ‘employment like’ income. 30. The collection of PAYE information is still largely paper based. The shift to digital channels as part of business transformation provides an opportunity to: • make better use of businesses natural systems to provide information; • improve the timeliness and accuracy of information received; • reduce the level of duplication, correction and other interventions required by employers, intermediaries or Inland Revenue before the information can be effectively used; • improve the use of available information from an all-of-govemment perspective; and • consider the types of information necessary to ensure the tax administration system operates effectively. 31. The same approach should be adopted for the collection of GST information. Expanding the withholding regime 32. Withholding regimes are an effective means to collect income tax and are generally considered to be the foundation of an efficient tax administration system. As business transformation envisages a future where taxpayers’ systems are able to interact with Inland Revenue’s system there is an opportunity to expand the withholding regime to cover a wider range of situations that are similar to employment - such as independent contractors and particular industries. 33. There could be some resistance from businesses on the idea of extending the withholding regime. However, for the reasons referred to in paragraph 32, we consider it is worth testing the likely reaction through the release of the attached green paper. 3 The ACC levy is incorporated into the amount o f PAYE the employer deducts. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 12 of 221 Business tax 34. The tax system needs to focus on speed, accuracy, certainty, predictability and low business risk in business taxation matters. Businesses have also raised issues with the provisional tax rules. The green paper asks for specific feedback on the key administration issues we should be focusing on to meet business expectations. 35. The green paper also specifically seeks feedback on ways to improve the provisional tax rules. Businesses are required to pay income tax on their profits. The exact amount of tax that a business is required to pay for each year is only able to be determined after that year has finished. The provisional tax rules ensure that tax is paid throughout the year, rather than at the end of the year. 36. The Government green paper sets out some possible ways to achieve a more effective or more certain method for calculating and paying provisional tax, and in particular, it looks at how provisional tax could be better aligned to other business processes. 37. Any review of the provisional tax rules would have to consider changing the current rules excluding some taxpayers from use of money interest on provisional tax payments (referred to as “safe harbour taxpayers”) to reflect new payment calculations and re-consider how use of money interest would apply. 38. One idea explored in the document is that the calculation and payment of business income tax could be done more “on account” as income is earned during the year - much like PAYE for individuals. This has the potential to simplify the calculation of provisional tax and create more certainty for taxpayers. 39. Many small businesses have difficulty in meeting their tax obligations. Therefore, there is a real focus on how Inland Revenue can be more proactive and sophisticated in its approach to providing advice at the right time, and to encourage the use of improved business systems to ensure the first few years of a business’s lifecycle are successful. We are seeking feedback on what other business tax related issues the Government should focus on from a tax administration perspective. Withholding taxes on capital income 40. A review of the current resident withholding tax (RWT) rules should build on improvements arising from more effective and streamlined collection of PAYE information. The green paper considers ways to enhance the provision of information about RWT arising from interest and dividends by integration into existing business processes - similar to the process envisaged for an improved PAYE information gathering process as described in paragraph 10 above. 41. Inland Revenue currently receives RWT information from financial institutions on an annual basis. However, the annual system does not allow for the timely provision of data and is therefore not used to its full potential. Administration and compliance costs are correspondingly high. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 13 of 221 42. The green paper therefore seeks feedback on how best to integrate RWT into business processes, so that upfront validation of information is the norm, ensuring accuracy as much as possible. The future for individuals 43. Streamlined PAYE and withholding tax mechanisms (as discussed above) are the building blocks on which an individual’s experience of the tax system will be based. 44. A policy decision was made in the 1990s to remove the requirement to file income tax returns for as many individuals as possible. However, this approach has created inconsistency in the tax administration system between taxpayers who are not required to file, those who are, and those who choose to file in favourable circumstances (for example, to claim a refund). Significant numbers of individuals are now either required to file or are choosing to file returns. The rules can now also appear arbitrary and complex, which leads to fairness concerns. 45. A key consideration is whether it is still desirable to keep as many individuals as possible from actively interacting with the tax system. The Government green paper explores the possibility of Inland Revenue providing more extensive pre-populated information on tax returns for individual taxpayers. The only action required from the majority of taxpayers would be to check and confirm their details and, where applicable, report other income such as overseas income for which there was no deduction at source. 46. A practical difficulty with this approach is getting effective withholding rates in place, and minimising the costs involved in squaring up liabilities and refunds. The trade-off when seeking more accuracy is the resulting increase in compliance costs for the withholder and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 47. However, technology may help by making end of year square ups much less costly. The future for social policy 48. Social policies administered by Inland Revenue such as Working for Families and child support generally operate within the tax system which operates on a yearly basis. Some Working for Families and child support customers will go into debt, or are already in debt unnecessarily because Inland Revenue holds out-of-date information about them or their family. When circumstances change throughout the year, these customers are required to contact Inland Revenue. This means that customers may need to contact Inland Revenue multiple times or they may make no contact at all. Neither outcome is optimal. 49. The intent is to design a social policy system that works for the customer and is fit for purpose. The system needs to reflect the family’s circumstances and income (and therefore need) to ensure payments reflect that need. 50. Reviewing the administration of social policies includes consideration of the efficacy of the annual cycle and making greater use of information from other sources. More accurate timely and regular receipt of information is likely to be facilitated by advances in technology Debt prevention will be a key benefit arising from improvements in the administration of social policy. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 14 of 221 The policy and legislative framework for tax administration 51. Finally, business transformation requires consideration of key tax administration and legal issues that frame and underpin much of New Zealand’s tax system. Changes to the way that taxpayers interact with Inland Revenue through digital services provide an opportunity to consider fundamental aspects of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). These issues are: • the roles of Parliament, the Commissioner, the taxpayer and third parties in tax administration; • whether the Commissioner’s current role is appropriately legislated for when considering the future tax administration environment; • principles underpinning information and secrecy; • the suitability of the penalty, disputes and binding rulings regimes in the future environment; • record keeping and time bars in the future environment; and • the legislative structure of the tax Acts. Impact on taxpayers, including Government agencies 52. Modernising the tax administration system will have implications for taxpayers, including Government agencies. There will be short term implementation costs to achieve the long term gains of reduced compliance and administration costs. 53. The cumulative impact of both legislative change and changes to business processes will need to be carefully managed to ensure that businesses are not faced with successive changes through each stage of business transformation. Proposed timeline 54. Subject to Cabinet approval, we propose to release the Government green paper for public consultation on or after 31 March 2015, with an eight week consultation period. Officials will analyse the submissions and the Minister of Revenue will report back to Cabinet on feedback received and whether there is general acceptance of the direction as outlined in the paper for modernising the tax administration system. Consultation 55. Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), the Ministry of Education, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), the State Services Commission, Statistics New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service and the Ministry of Social Development. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet were informed on the proposals in the Government green paper. Officials also discussed the scope of the discussion document with the Commissioner’s Transformation Reference Group and the Taxpayers’ Simplification Panel. 56. Feedback from agencies has been supportive of the policy direction contained in the document and all who responded have expressed a desire to be further consulted. Our officials will continue to work with them over the course of the policy development process. ACC and DIA provided the following specific references for inclusion in the Green Paper: Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 15 of 221 • treating information as an asset; • Result Areas 9 and 10; and • ACC’s dependence on Inland Revenue’s information. Financial implications 57. The release of the Government green paper does not give rise to any financial implications. Human rights 58. There are no human rights implications associated with the release of the Government green paper. Legislative implications 59. The draft Government green paper does not suggest any immediate legislative implications. However, legislative changes will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement any of the potential changes identified. 60. The Minister of Revenue intends to introduce a bill titled Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) mid-year which will signal the start of modernising and simplifying the tax administration system. The bill will focus on reducing compliance costs for small to medium enterprises. Regulatory impact analysis 61. Officials advise that the substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the draft green paper at a level that is appropriate given the stage of the policy development process. Regulatory Impact Statements will be prepared, if required, when policy decisions are sought. Publicity 62. We intend to announce the release of the draft Government green paper at an appropriate event to be determined in due course. The Government green paper will be accompanied by an internet-based public consultation forum. It will set out a summary of the proposals and seek views on the same questions raised in the green paper. It will be linked to the internet-based public consultation on providing digital services. Extracts of the internet- based consultation are attached. Recommendations 63. We recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note the contents of the attached Government green paper Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration. 2. Note that the purpose of the Government green paper is to seek feedback on the policy direction for modernising and simplifying the tax administration system is heading in the right direction and to identify any errors or omissions of scope before more detailed work is undertaken.

Making Tax Simpler: Better Digital Services - A Government Discussion Document Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to release a government discussion document on how the tax system can be improved using digital services. Previous On 5 November 2014, the Cabinet Committee on State Sector Reform and Consideration Expenditure Control: • approved the commencement of the design of the future revenue system; • agreed to advance the implementation of early improvements in digital services for customers in support of digital interactions with the government. \[SEC Min (14) 15/2\] Summary Enabling digital services within the tax administration system is a key building block for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. The attached discussion document seeks feedback on a proposed set of principles and options to facilitate the implementation of better digital services. The suggested principles and options would: • provide reassurance and confidence to customers that the key focus of future digital services is to deliver better customer experiences; • encourage customers to move to better digital services over time, by providing specific assistance to some customers, while retaining non-digital alternatives for those who cannot adopt digital services; • in some circumstances, require some customers that deal with the tax information of others (eg tax intermediaries) to use digital services for some transactions where they are able to do so; • ensure tax legislation is technology-agnostic. The Minister of Revenue will report back to EGI following the consultation process, with a view to including the necessary legislation in the Tax (November) Bill. Regulatory Not required. Impact Analysis Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 31 of 221 Baseline Implications None from this paper.

This paper seeks the agreement of the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee to the release of a government discussion document (and the launch of accompanying internet-based consultation) on how the tax system can be improved using digital services. A better tax administration system needs to take full advantage of electronic and internet technology, and, more importantly, provide services designed with customers at the centre. Moving to better digital services in the tax administration system aligns with Government’s digital strategy to achieve better public services. The discussion document proposes a set of principles ensuring the better digital services will meet customers’ needs, and proposes options to facilitate customers move to better digital services. 2. This Cabinet paper is presented to the Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee alongside a Cabinet paper that seeks agreement for release of another discussion document. The discussion document attached to this present paper deals with a specific aspect of the transformation programme - the adoption of digital services by Inland Revenue’s customers. The other discussion document sets out the overall vision for Inland Revenue’s transformation programme. 3. Enabling digital services within the tax administration system is a key building block for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. The concepts for digital services set out in the attached paper provide the foundation for further detailed policy proposals that will be presented to Cabinet in the next two to three years. Executive summary 4. Most New Zealanders are already enjoying the benefits of digital services in personal and business interactions, and they expect public-sector agencies to meet the same standards as the private sector. 5. Government has agreed in principle to a long-term business transformation programme to look at different ways of delivering tax and social policy. Part of this programme’s vision is a future tax administration system that offers a wider range of secure digital services for greater customer convenience, and for tax interactions to be built into customers’ life events and business transactions. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernise and simplify the tax administration system to meet 21st-century needs. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 35 of 221 6. I propose to release a government discussion document that sets out a range of principles and options to deliver better customer experience using digital services, and makes suggestions to ensure tax legislation can facilitate the implementation of better digital services. The draft discussion document is attached. 7. The suggested principles and options would: • provide reassurance and confidence to customers that the key focus of future digital services is to deliver better customer experience; • encourage customers to move to better digital services over time, by providing specific assistance to some customers, while retaining non-digital alternatives for those who cannot adopt digital services; • in some circumstances, require some customers to use digital services for certain transactions where they are able to do so and where society as a whole would benefit from their move to digital services; and • ensure tax legislation is technology-agnostic. 8. I expect that some customers will raise concerns about the potential requirement to use digital services for some interactions with Inland Revenue. Background 9. In April 2013, Cabinet agreed the case for change for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme \[SEC Min (13) 4/4 and CAB Min (13) 10/4 refer\]. Cabinet also approved in principle the overall investment objectives and agreed that modernising the revenue system through business process re-engineering, supported by new technology is the preferred way forward. The first stage of the business transformation programme includes enabling secure digital services. 10. In November 2014 \[CAB Min (14) 15/2\], Cabinet agreed to the commencement of the design of the future revenue system. Problem 11. Despite successful delivery of digital services in some areas, Inland Revenue faces significant limitations on its ability to deliver the services that customers want. Customers often: • have difficulty accessing and using Inland Revenue information they need; • find Inland Revenue’s transactional processes overly time-consuming, disconnected and confusing; • regularly use multiple service delivery channels to undertake one transaction; • are uncertain whether they have done the right thing; and • are frustrated that information is not shared and is inconsistent, across Inland Revenue’s different services and more widely across government. 12. The limitations described above are largely a consequence of Inland Revenue’s twenty- five year old core technology which was designed around processing paper returns. In addition, Inland Revenue’s role has been expanded from simply collecting tax to the delivery of social policies such as student loan repayments, Working for Families tax credits and KiwiSaver. Adding social policy services to technology that is twenty-five years old has resulted in an extremely complex inter-twined system, which is expensive, risky and time- consuming to modernise. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 36 of 221 13. The delivery of tax administration and social policy services above through digital channels is complex. Inland Revenue’s customers are highly diversified; their needs, and their ability and desire to use digital services differ across types of customers and interactions. Some customers do not have sufficient knowledge or skill to use digital services or have no access to digital technology. Other customers will have the ability to use digital services but choose not to for a variety of reasons. 14. Current tax legislation, such as the Tax Administration Act 1994, was largely developed around a paper-based environment. For example, the phrases “by post” and “in writing” have been frequently used in current tax legislation. Comment Proposals in discussion document 15. The draft discussion document proposes a set of principles to ensure digital services can meet customers’ needs. I seek public views on these principles and whether others should be included. The principles include: • Services must be designed with the customer at the centre (an overriding principle). • No one size fits all; a wide range of digital services will be required, and digital services may not be appropriate for complex transactions. • Tax compliance and access to entitlements are critical. • Changes will be imposed only after costs and benefits have been considered. 16. The document further proposes a range of tailored approaches to encourage customers to adopt digital services. These are outlined in the following paragraphs. 17. Services will be digital by default for new taxpayers or existing customers taking on new products. 18. Inland Revenue will offer specific assistance for customers who do not have the knowledge or skills to use digital services, or the ability to access them. 19. Inland Revenue will continue to provide non-digital alternatives for customers who are unable to use digital services. 20. There will be some customers who could move to digital services for appropriate transactions but will choose not to. This group is expected to be small, as most customers are expected to choose to adopt new digital services in order to receive the benefits of convenience, speed and certainty that the digital services will deliver. Where the adverse impact of those customers not adopting digital services falls on the customers themselves and on Inland Revenue’s systems, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is likely to use her existing powers to support, encourage, and in some instances require those customers to adopt digital services for certain transactions. 21. Some customers who could move to digital services for appropriate transactions but choose not to, are dealing with the tax information of others, and therefore the impact of their decision could fall on others. Examples could include tax intermediaries who provide tax information about their clients to Inland Revenue, or employers who are required to provide PAYE information about their employees to Inland Revenue. As Inland Revenue’s transformation programme progresses, the level of service offered to those clients or Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 37 of 221 employees is expected to significantly improve, but in some instances will be contingent on Inland Revenue receiving information about them through digital channels. Where digital channels are not being used, the Commissioner is likely to use her existing powers to support, encourage, and in some instances require those customers to adopt digital services for some transactions. Ensuring that these customers do adopt digital services is critical to ensuring that the benefits of the new tax administration system are received by all, and I propose that the Commissioner’s decisions for these kinds of customers have binding legal effect. 22. Requiring customers to use digital services should be a last resort. Relying on a framework under which most customers will move to digital services voluntarily means that agencies will need to develop digital services that customers want to use. 23. I seek public views on these approaches and associated criteria, and whether other approaches and criteria should be considered. 24. The discussion document also suggests that tax legislation be reviewed to ensure the language used in legislation is modernised to be technology-neutral. I am intending to introduce a tax bill (Taxation (Business Transformation and Simplification) Bill) mid-year which will signal the start of modernising and simplifying tax administration, with a particular focus on reducing compliance costs for small to medium sized enterprises. 25. I expect that some customers will raise concerns about the potential requirement to use digital services for some interactions with Inland Revenue. I also expect some customers will raise concerns about the assistance options for those customers who have difficulty using digital services. Digital services are the building block for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme 26. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme is a technology-enabled change programme to implement the capability that will enable delivery of a modem revenue system. The use of technology and the implementation and delivery of digital services is a key enabler to ensure a successful outcome for business transformation. That outcome is a modernised tax administration system with both reduced tax system administration costs and reduced costs for individuals and businesses to comply with their tax obligations and access their social policy entitlements. 27. A system with a greater level of automation delivered through digital channels should deliver increased levels of taxpayer compliance. Taxpayers will find it easier to meet their obligations, and automation will make it more difficult to omit or provide incorrect information. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 38 of 221 Alignment with Government’s digital strategy 28. In 2014, the Government released the Key Result Area 10 Blueprint to guide all public agencies on redesigning existing digital services, increasing system capability and supporting New Zealanders through the digital transition. The government’s vision of future digital public services contains three dimensions: • digital by choice (meeting customers’ needs); • digital by design (optimising service efficacy); and • digital by default (achieving system efficiency). 29. The Government has also set up specific goals to improve New Zealand businesses’ interaction with government via Result 9: Better Public Services for Business, part of the Better Public Services programme. With the goal of increasing efficiency and reducing compliance costs for businesses, Result 9 aims to deliver a one-stop online shop for all the government advice and support that New Zealand businesses need to run and grow their businesses'. The introduction of the New Zealand Business Number is a key component of Result 9’s delivery of improved government services to business. 30. Both Result 9 and Result 10 are focused on improving interactions between customers and government by using digital technology to deliver joined-up customer services. A key enabler for both is the use of digital channels (because digitally-sourced information is much more easily shared). Greater use of digital services by Inland Revenue’s customers will therefore deliver benefits not only to those customers and to Inland Revenue but more widely across Government. 31. Information collected by Inland Revenue is already used by other government agencies, and improving the accuracy and timeliness of that information by collecting it through digital channels will also benefit those other government agencies. Further benefits may also arise to customers of those agencies if the better quality, more timely data leads to improved services. 32. A good example of an agency which uses Inland Revenue data is the Accident Compensation Corporation. It relies on Inland Revenue for information to allow the collection of work account levies from employers, work account and earner account levies from self- employed, and for collecting earners’ levies. This dependency also means that system changes will need to be coordinated between both agencies. Proposed timeline 33. Subject to Cabinet approval, I propose to release the discussion document for public consultation on or shortly after 31 March 2015, with a six week consultation period. I will report back to Cabinet on the policy proposals once public input has been taken into consideration, with the intention of including the necessary legislation in a tax bill scheduled for introduction in November 2015. 1 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/ahout-us/publications/cabinet-papers/bps-result-9-improving-business-interactions- with-govemment.pdf Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 39 of 221 Consultation 34. The discussion document will be released alongside a discussion document on the overall policy direction for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. 35. Officials have consulted with key external stakeholders being the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s Transformation Reference Group, the Taxpayers’ Simplification Panel, the Treasury, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Social Development, the Accident Compensation Corporation, the State Services Commission, the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Education on the suggested proposals in the discussion document. Officials will continue to work with government agencies over the course of the policy development process. 36. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed of the proposals. Financial implications 37. The suggested proposals in the discussion document are aimed at seeking the best solution for encouraging taxpayers to adopt digital services and removing legislative barriers to delivering digital services. We expect them to be broadly fiscally neutral. 38. Separate Cabinet papers will present business cases seeking funding for Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. Administration and compliance implications 39. The proposals in the discussion document are aimed at solutions that support and enable the majority of taxpayers to use digital services. Consequently, we expect there to be an overall reduction in both compliance and administration costs as the benefits are realised. 40. There may be some additional administration and/or compliance costs if other government agencies are required to use digital services as the result of these proposals. This will need to be managed carefully. My officials will work closely with agencies in understanding these implications. Legislative implications 41. The release of the discussion document does not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. However, legislative changes will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the proposals. Regulatory impact analysis 42. I advise that the substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the draft discussion document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. A Regulatory Impact Statement will be prepared later in the policy process, once the policy proposals have been finalised. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 40 of 221 Other implications 43. I have considered any likely human rights, gender, or disability implications associated with the release of the discussion document and consider that any implications have been addressed in the discussion document. For example, the document proposes that for customers who are unable to use digital services, assistance should be provided where necessary, or non­ digital services should be retained, as tax compliance and access to entitlements through the tax system are critical. Publicity 44. I will arrange the appropriate publicity for the release of the discussion document, and Inland Revenue will also publicise it through its channels. 45. The discussion document will be accompanied by the launch of an internet-based public consultation. It will set out a summary of the proposals and seek views on the same questions raised in the discussion document. It will be linked to the internet-based public consultation on the Green paper on Inland Revenue’s business transformation. Extracts of the internet- based consultation are attached. Recommendations 46. I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1. Note the contents of the attached draft Government discussion document, titled Better Digital Services. 2. Agree to the publication of the discussion document, and the launch of the internet-based consultation, which propose to: 2.1 provide reassurance and confidence to customers that the key focus of future digital services is to deliver better customer experiences; 2.2 encourage customers to move to better digital services over time, by providing specific assistance to some customers, while retaining non­ digital alternatives for those who cannot adopt digital services; 2.3 in some circumstances, require some customers that deal with the tax information of others to use digital services for some transactions where they are able to do so; 2.4 ensure tax legislation is technology-agnostic. 3. Agree to delegate to the Minister of Revenue the authority to release the discussion document and finalise the detail.

Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration and Better Digital Services: Feedback from Consultation PortfolioRevenue Purpose This paper notes the outcome of the submissions received on the first two Making Tax Simpler consultation documents. Previous Consideration On 18 March 2015, EGI agreed to the release of two discussion documents: Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration; Making Tax Simpler: Better Digital Services. \[EGI Min (15) 5/2-3\] Summary The above two discussion documents were released in March 2015 to support consultation on the government’s proposals for modernising and simplifying tax administration in New Zealand. In general, the feedback received on the two discussion documents supported the proposed direction and approach. The main themes from the responses were as follows: there was concern about the current provisional tax rules, and interest in the proposal for provisional tax to be calculated on a “pay as you earn” basis; submitters were equally divided on proposals for a greater level of interaction with Inland Revenue – some saw increased interaction with Inland Revenue as undesirable and difficult to achieve for those without internet access, while others saw significant value in the process being improved; large businesses have much less flexibility than smaller ones in changing their software to connect directly to Inland Revenue systems; 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 53 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E submitters generally saw the benefits of moving to greater use of digital channels, but thought that moving to digital should be optional, not a requirement; submitters were concerned that moving to digital should not result in an increase in costs; most submitters supported the key proposal of linking business accounting software directly to Inland Revenue’s system, although some submitters were concerned about security, privacy and cost. The attached Appendices 1 and 2 set out a summary of the comments received on the two discussion documents. Also attached is an anonymised report entitled Making Tax Simpler: Green Paper and Better Digital Services: Summary of Feedback. The Minister of Revenue intends to publicly release this report. The proposals identified in the consultation processes will be developed further, and the submissions received will be used to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed for release in the future. Treasury’s comments are on page 4. Regulatory Impact Analysis Not required. Baseline Implications None. Legislative Implications None. Timing Issues Three further Making Tax Simpler discussion documents will be released in November 2015. Announcement The Minister of Revenue will make an announcement. Anonymised details of the feedback will be published on Inland Revenue’s website. Proactive Release None. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. ACC, MBIE, Customs, DIA, Treasury, MSD, Statistics and Education were consulted. DPMC was informed. A number of interested groups were also consulted.

It also asks Cabinet to note that I intend to publicly release an anonymised summary of submissions based on the information in the attached appendices. 2.This paper further notes that the proposals identified in the consultations will be developed and the submissions received used to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed to be released as part of future Making Tax Simpler consultations. Executive summary 3.Cabinet agreed to the release of two Government discussion documents, Making Tax Simpler – A Government Green Paper on tax administration and Making Tax Simpler – Better digital services, earlier this year (EGI Min 15 5/2 and 5/3, CAB Min (15) 9/5 refer). 4.This present Cabinet paper asks Ministers to note the results of this consultation and that I intend to release a summary of these results shortly. In general, the feedback supported the direction and approach we are proposing for simplifying and modernising tax administration and supporting Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The subsequent discussion documents to be released in the coming years will set out in more detail the proposed changes to tax administration we are considering and allow people to provide more informed views. 5.This Cabinet paper further notes that the proposals identified in the consultations to date will be developed and the submissions used to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed to be released in the future as part of the Making Tax Simpler consultations. I intend to release, in November 2015, the following suite of discussions documents: Making Tax Simpler: towards a new Tax Administration Act; Making Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST; and 6.I recently introduced the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill, which shows that the Government is committed to simplifying and modernising tax administration. This bill includes legislation to remove the current legislative barriers that may prevent the use of digital channels, as proposed in the Better digital services discussion document. Appendix 2 - Page | 1 Out of scope Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 57 of 221 Background 7.On 31 March 2015, the Government released the first two in a series of discussion documents to support consultation on the Government’s proposals for modernising and simplifying tax administration in New Zealand. 8.The first document, Making Tax Simpler – A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper), aimed to introduce New Zealand to the overall direction of the tax administration modernisation programme and seek feedback on that direction. The second, Making Tax Simpler – Better digital services (Better digital services), outlined proposals for moving Inland Revenue and its customers toward much greater use of sophisticated digital technology. These two documents set the foundation for the Government’s approach to modernising and simplifying tax administration. 9.For both papers, an online forum, makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz, gave people the opportunity to submit comments online and answer a series of questions linked to those in the hard copies of the discussion documents. Written submissions were also received through the normal policy submission process. Comment 10.A large number of comments were received on the online forum, with more than 900 comments and more than 2,300 “tick the box” responses to the proposals in the two discussions documents. Ninety written submissions were also received, and officials met directly with key stakeholders and focus groups. 11.The overall response to the proposals was generally supportive. Both the general public and stakeholders welcome the opportunity to improve the tax administration system. This view was also generally taken by media commentators. Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand expressed support for the overall project, noting that a “ground up” review of the tax administration system is “long overdue” and “the current system has been built in an ad hoc way over many decades and has not kept up with changes in technology and business practice”. 12.The main themes from responses to the Green Paper consultation were as follows: Concern about the current provisional tax rules was the strongest theme to come through from the consultation. Many submitters were interested in the proposal in the Green Paper for provisional tax to be calculated on a “pay as you earn” basis. A minority said that they were comfortable with the current provisional tax rules. Submitters were about equally divided on proposals for a greater level of interaction with Inland Revenue for individuals, using new processes with a much greater level of pre-population of tax information. Some saw increased interaction with Inland Revenue as undesirable and difficult to achieve for those without internet access. Others, particularly those already filing, saw significant value in the process being improved. Large businesses have much less flexibility than smaller ones in changing their software to connect directly to Inland Revenue systems. 13.The main themes from responses to the Better digital services consultation were: Submitters generally saw the benefits of moving to greater use of digital channels but thought that moving to digital should be optional, not a requirement. Respondents said the quality of the digital offering should be good enough to make them want to move, and they believed that paper channels needed to remain available for some customers. Appendix 2 - Page | 2 Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 58 of 221 However, there was some support for mandating use of digital channels by specific groups of taxpayers who would otherwise impose costs on others, such as employers and tax agents. Submitters were concerned that moving to digital should not result in an increase in costs, either on an ongoing basis or as a result of the need to acquire new accounting software. Some submitters were sceptical and saw moving to digital as a cost-saving exercise for government that will increase their costs. The key proposal of linking business accounting software directly to Inland Revenue’s system was supported by most, although some expressed concerns about security, privacy and cost. 14.The attached appendices summarise the feedback received on the Green Paper (Appendix 1) and Better digital services (Appendix 2) consultations. These appendices incorporate the overall results of the online polls, together with more detailed summaries of all the comments received on the submissions and representative examples of the comments. I intend to publicly release an anonymised summary of the submissions received, based on these appendices. 15.Given the general support for the direction set out in the Green Paper, I have directed officials to continue to develop the proposals outlined in that paper and to use the submissions received as appropriate to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed to be released in the future: 1 16.The subsequent discussion documents to be released in the coming years, which will set out in more detailed the proposed changes to tax administration, will help people to better understand the likely impacts and benefits, allowing them to provide more informed views. As part of the suite of papers I am submitting to this Cabinet Committee for consideration today, I have included the following companion Cabinet papers Release of discussion document – Making Tax Simpler: towards a new Tax Administration Act; Release of discussion document – Making Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST; and 17.These proposals were all flagged in the Green Paper. My intention, subject to Cabinet’s agreement, is to release these three discussion documents in early November 2015. 18.The Better digital services paper’s proposals for greater use of digital technology were generally supported, with some reservations, particularly about the requirement to use digital channels. One proposal in that paper was removal of current legislative barriers that prevent use of digital channels. This change has already been included in the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill, which was introduced on 30 June 2015. 19.The Better digital services paper also proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should have the ability to require customers to use digital channels when those channels are available and not using them has a wider impact. The discussion document proposed that the Commissioner’s ability to require customers to adopt digital should have the full force of law. 1 This diagram sets out the proposed suite of discussion documents to be released over the coming years to modernise and simplify tax administration. Appendix 2 - Page | 3 Out of scope Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 59 of 221 Officials are still considering this issue in the context of the design of the rules to support the Better administration of PAYE and GST discussion document and will report back to Minsters in due course. 20.We will need to ensure that the implementation of any policy proposals to simplify and modernise tax administration are integrated and aligned with the implementation of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. Furthermore, as the business transformation programme and any policy proposals will be implemented over a number of years, officials need to ensure that design and delivery decisions taken in the earlier phases of the programme do not constrain design and delivery opportunities in the later phases of implementation. This is particularly important in relation to our ability to simplify the delivery of our social policy programmes. 21.Ministers will be asked to consider the implementation approach later this year, as part of the detailed business case for stage 1 of business transformation and the updated roadmap for the programme. Consultation 22.A copy of this paper was been provided to the Ministry of Social Development; the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment; the Ministry of Education; the New Zealand Customs Service; Statistics New Zealand; the Department of Internal Affairs; and ACC. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed about this paper. Treasury comment 23.The Treasury notes that there was broad acceptance for digital services, but respondents were concerned about the potential compliance costs associated with comprehensively mandating the use of these services. However, this may be because the discussion document did not consider in detail whether mandating could be appropriate for some taxpayer groups (for example, employers over a certain size). 24.The Treasury notes that the trade-offs associated with the decision whether to mandate digital services should be considered as part of the next business case in November 2015. This should include a comparison of the expected realisation of benefits under voluntary uptake with those under mandating. This will allow Ministers to make an informed decision on this matter. Financial implications 25.As this paper merely notes the outcome of the Green paper and Better digital services consultations, there are no financial implications. Human rights 26.This paper has no human rights implications. Legislative implications 27.This paper has no legislative implications.

Making Tax Simpler: Towards a New Tax Administration Act: Release of Discussion Document PortfolioRevenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to release the attached discussion document on Making Tax Simpler: Towards a New Tax Administration Act (the discussion document). Previous Consideration On 18 March 2015, EGI agreed to the release of a government green paper and a discussion document relating to Better Digital Services \[EGI Min (15) 5/2-3\]. The feedback received on those two documents has informed the proposals for this paper. Summary The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Commissioner) has statutory independence to ensure Inland Revenue is able to collect tax and carry out its duties, but the Commissioner is also a State sector chief executive with responsibilities to work closely with other government agencies to deliver more efficient public services. The discussion document examines how the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility can best coexist with the newly enhanced chief executive responsibilities in the State Sector Act 1988. In particular, the discussion document seeks feedback on the following proposals: to clarify the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities to provide for greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances, and to ensure the responsibility applies to the Commissioner’s non-tax functions (eg administering Working for Families tax credits, student loan repayments, child support, KiwiSaver and paid parental leave); to clarify Inland Revenue’s powers to access bulk third-party information and remotely stored information (eg by aligning the rules in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 to clarify how Inland Revenue can use the remote access regime, recognising that many Inland Revenue searches are carried out without a requirement for a warrant); 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 69 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E to narrow the secrecy rule from referring to “all information” to information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer (eg to allow for greater cross- government information sharing); how Inland Revenue could support improved information flows between government agencies, and whether a taxpayer should be able to consent to the release of their information; to impose an obligation on taxpayers who receive a pre-populated tax return to respond to that return within a prescribed period, and to treat that response as the taxpayer’s self-assessment for tax administration purposes. The discussion document notes that further consideration will be given to the advice and disputes regime, the time bar, record keeping and the future compliance and penalties approaches. Regulatory Impact Analysis A Regulatory Impact Statement will be submitted when final policy approval is sought. Baseline Implications Any fiscal implications will be included in the final policy proposals. Legislative Implications None from this paper. The Minister of Revenue intends to seek approval to include two tax bills on the 2016 Legislation Programme. The proposals in this paper will be included in the second of these bills, for introduction in late -2016. Timing Issues The release of the discussion document will be announced at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle briefing on 11 November 2015. Announcement The relevant documents will be posted on Inland Revenue’s Making Tax Simpler website. Proactive Release None. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. ACC, Crown Law, Customs, MBIE, Education, Treasury, DIA, Justice, Police, MSD and SSC were consulted. CAANZ and the NZ Law Society were also consulted. The Minister of Revenue indicates that the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Economic Development and the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment were consulted, and that discussion is not required with the government caucus, or with other parties represented in Parliament. 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 70 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1 note the contents of the government discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: Towards a New Tax Administration Act (the discussion document), attached to the submission under EGI-15-SUB-0110, which will consult on proposals to: 1.1 clarify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s care and management responsibilities; 1.2 clarify Inland Revenue’s powers to access bulk third-party information and remotely stored information; 1.3 narrow the secrecy rule; 1.4 impose an obligation to respond to a pre-populated return within a prescribed period for taxpayers receiving a pre-populated tax return, and to treat the response as the self-assessment; 2 agree to the release of the discussion document, and to the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents; 3 authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve any editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release; 4 invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and with final policy recommendations.

Following consultation I will report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and final policy recommendations. Background 6.Towards a new Tax Administration Act is one in a series of consultation documents setting out the Government’s proposals for the transformation of tax administration. The components of the business transformation consultation timeline are set out below: 7.This discussion document builds on the concepts set out in the Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) which outlined the likely scope of the review of the Tax Administration Act. Most but not all of the issues raised in the Green Paper are addressed in this discussion document, some are still under consideration and others will be included in subsequent Making Tax Simpler documents. 8.Submissions received on the Green Paper and the Making Tax Simpler: Better Digital Services discussion document have informed the discussion and proposals in Towards a new Tax Administration Act. 9.Further background is included in the companion Cabinet paper, Making Tax Simpler – Release of discussion documents and feedback on completed consultations. Comment 10.Tax administration refers to the rules and processes for collecting and disbursing the revenue and payments administered by Inland Revenue. The efficiency and effectiveness of these rules and processes is just as important for maintaining fairness in the tax system as the rules defining how much tax is due. In Towards a new Tax Administration Act the proposed framework for tax administration is discussed with an emphasis on the key roles of the Commissioner, taxpayers and tax agents as the three primary actors, as well as the rules around information collection and tax secrecy which underpin their interactions. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 74 of 221 3 Role of the Commissioner 11.Tax can only be levied according to laws enacted by Parliament. Inland Revenue’s role is to administer the Inland Revenue Acts and to collect tax to the best of its ability. In doing so, the integrity of the tax system and the confidentiality of people’s tax affairs must be maintained. The Commissioner has statutory independence to ensure Inland Revenue is able to collect tax and carry out its duties. The Towards a new Tax Administration Act discussion document examines the Commissioner’s role in three areas. 12.The first area examined is how the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility can best coexist with the newly enhanced chief executive responsibilities in the State Sector Act. As well as accountability for Inland Revenue, the Commissioner has a role in ensuring Inland Revenue works more closely with other government agencies to deliver more efficient public services. Requiring the Commissioner, as a state sector chief executive, to be responsive to the collective interests of government needs to be considered alongside the Commissioner’s statutory independence. The discussion document sets out how, in the transformed administration, the Commissioner’s role will continue to be complementary to her chief executive functions. 13.Secondly, the discussion document proposes a clarification to the care and management provision, so that in some limited cases the Commissioner can apply the legislation in a way that does not tie up Commissioner and taxpayer resources in outcomes that are inconsistent with the practice and policy intent. The proposal is that the Commissioner would be able to: Apply a policy-based approach to small gaps in the tax legislation; Deal pragmatically with legislative anomalies that are minor or transitory; Address cases of hardship (inequity) at the margins; or Deal with cases in which a statutory rule is difficult to formulate (meaning that the relevant legislation has failed to adequately deal with the particular situation). 14.Thirdly, the document also considers whether the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility in the non-tax functions is adequately expressed in legislation. The non-tax functions include administering Working for Families tax credits, student loan repayment, child support, KiwiSaver and paid parental leave. These functions have been added over time to Inland Revenue’s functions for collecting tax. Clarification that the “care and management” responsibility applies broadly, reflecting the objectives of these functions, would better support the Commissioner’s ability to use resources as effectively as possible to deliver more efficient services. Information collection 15.Information flows are critical to Inland Revenue’s interaction with taxpayers and third parties. Inland Revenue deals with large numbers of documents, forms, letters and returns that contain information about taxpayers’ income or assets. Outside of the tax return process, Inland Revenue can require a person to provide any information considered “necessary or relevant” to Inland Revenue’s functions. It is important to emphasise the “necessary or relevant” standard, or something similar, in the transformed administration. Retaining such a standard will provide people with continued confidence that Inland Revenue will not use its information-gathering powers to obtain information that is not needed. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 75 of 221 4 16.The availability and usability of large datasets has greatly improved with the aid of technology. To efficiently administer the tax system, Inland Revenue needs to continue to be able to collect one-off taxpayer-specific and bulk data, and obtain some third-party information on a repeating basis. Therefore, more robust rules for repeating access to large third-party datasets are recommended. 17.More taxpayers are storing information in the cloud and utilising cloud-based software. While Inland Revenue is able to use its search powers to access information remotely in some situations, these powers will require review to ensure access to such information in all relevant circumstances. 18.In order to ensure Inland Revenue’s ability to obtain necessary or relevant information, no matter how it is stored, it is proposed to clarify the rules for remote-access searches for Inland Revenue. The rules in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 are currently crafted in relation to remote access searches authorised under search warrants. The preferred approach is to align the rules in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 with a clarification of how Inland Revenue uses the remote access regime. This is intended to ensure Inland Revenue can use the remote access regime while recognising that many Inland Revenue searches are carried out without requirement for a warrant. Tax secrecy 19.Tax secrecy, or taxpayer confidentiality laws, exist in most jurisdictions. Traditionally, tax secrecy is viewed as a means of improving compliance by reassuring taxpayers that it is safe to provide their information to Inland Revenue. The reasons for taxpayer confidentiality are: to increase voluntary compliance by assuring taxpayers their information will go no further; as a balance for the broad information-collection powers granted to Inland Revenue; and to protect the privacy of taxpayers. 20.There is increasing movement towards sharing information, in particular to participate in more cross-government initiatives, including the Data Futures work and the Government ICT strategy. Therefore, it is an appropriate time to consider whether Inland Revenue’s current secrecy rules remain fit for purpose in a transformed tax administration. It is necessary to consider how a general framework of confidentiality with clear exceptions can be maintained, while at the same time modernising and allowing for greater cross-government information-sharing. 21.I propose in the first instance to narrow the coverage of the secrecy rule to information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer or taxpayers. The confidentiality of an individual’s or business’s affairs would, as a starting point, remain protected. This would not mean that taxpayer-specific information would never be disclosed; rather, as is the case now, a specific legislative exception to the general rule of confidentiality would be required. Rules would also remain to ensure that sensitive information about Inland Revenue processes continues to be protected. 22.Inland Revenue has an ability to enter into cross-agency information-sharing agreements in certain circumstances set out in the Tax Administration Act. Consideration could be given to greater use of this provision, or to amending the criteria to better enable its use in a wider range of circumstances. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 76 of 221 5 Feedback is also sought on whether taxpayers might be permitted to consent to the release of their information in certain circumstances, especially within the cross-agency contest where other sharing options are not available. The role of taxpayers and tax agents 23.The transformed tax administration envisages providing improved delivery of digital services, greater use of withholding payments, enhanced prepopulated income tax returns and better use of business’s existing systems to automate interactions with Inland Revenue. These features have implications for the obligations and responsibilities of taxpayers and tax agents. The discussion document sets out the steps that would be involved in prepopulating returns and also the obligations of taxpayers that would underpin these steps. Self-assessment as a concept would be retained, as it recognises that taxpayers are in the best position to determine their final tax liability. 24.Including more information on prepopulated returns should reduce compliance costs by offering a more personalised tax return process. Tax returns should also be more accurate, as the opportunity for taxpayer error will be minimised. This reduces the resources required to correct return errors, for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. To enable effective prepopulated returns, the discussion document considers: the obligations of a taxpayer with a prepopulated return in the context of self- assessment; what responses will be required from a taxpayer receiving a prepopulated return, and the consequence of failure to respond to a prepopulated return; and the ability for the taxpayer to amend the information contained in the prepopulated return. 25.Better use of technology and information will enable Inland Revenue to add more than just PAYE information or taxes withheld at source to a prepopulated return. However, the specific nature of the information that could be prepopulated is likely to be considered in a discussion document on improving the tax system for individuals that is due for release in 2016. The role of tax agents 26.About 5,300 tax agents are registered with Inland Revenue, and they manage the tax affairs of nearly two million clients. The advice and assistance tax agents give their clients contributes to the smooth running of the tax system. The discussion document recognises that features of the modernised tax administration will change the nature of the support agents provide; however, tax agents will continue to significantly influence compliance. Future issues 27.Finally the discussion document considers the advice and disputes regimes, the time bar and record-keeping requirements. Feedback is sought on the effectiveness of the current options for taxpayers to seek Inland Revenue’s view on specific issues. A more individualised approach to the time bar is also discussed, as this would be compatible with Inland Revenue’s future direction. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 77 of 221 6 28.Modernising the tax system provides an opportunity to recognise that taxpayer behaviour is about more than attitude. A combination of capability, opportunity and motivation make up compliance behaviour. The new approach to compliance could mean a different approach to penalties. The Better tax for small businesses discussion document considers possible changes to late filing and late payment penalties for businesses. 29.These areas will require further analysis once key features of the modernised tax administration have been decided on and implemented. Consultation 30.Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Accident Compensation Corporation, the State Services Commission, Statistics New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, the Ministry of Social Development, the Crown Law Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, The Treasury, and New Zealand Police. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were informed of the proposals in the discussion document. Financial implications 31.Approving the release of the Government discussion document will not have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Administrative implications 32.The administrative impacts of the proposed changes are being assessed in the context of the updated Business Transformation Business Case which is timetabled for submission before the end of 2015. The impacts will be reported on in the final policy advice to Cabinet. Human rights 33.I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Legislative implications 34.The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. However, legislative changes will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the proposals. Therefore, I intend to propose a bill be included on next year’s Cabinet Legislation Programme for introduction in late-2016. Regulatory impact analysis Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 78 of 221 7 35.The regulatory impact analysis requirements apply to some of the proposals in the discussion document. The substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the discussion document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. Regulatory Impact Statements will be prepared as part of reporting back on final policy proposals. Publicity 36.I intend to announce the release of the discussion document at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle briefing on 11 November 2015. I will announce, at the same time, the release of two other discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series, one on better administration of PAYE and GST, and the other on better tax for small business. 37.The release of the discussion documents will be accompanied by the launch of online public consultation. This will contain a summary of the proposals and seek views on questions raised in the discussion documents. The online consultation will be on the same website that was used for the consultation on the previous documents in the Making Tax Simpler series. Recommendations 38.I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure: 1.Note the contents of the Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act, which will consult on: 1.1the proposal to clarify the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities; 1.2the proposal to clarify Inland Revenue’s powers to access bulk third-party information and remotely stored information; 1.3the proposal to narrow the secrecy rule; 1.4the proposal to impose an obligation to respond to a prepopulated return within a prescribed period for taxpayers receiving a pre-populated tax return and to treat the response as the self-assessment. 2.Agree to the release of the Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act and the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents. 3.Authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release.

Making Tax Simpler: Better Administration of PAYE and GST: Release of Discussion Document PortfolioRevenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to release the attached discussion document on Making Tax Simpler: Better Administration of PAYE and GST (the discussion document). Previous Consideration On 18 March 2015, EGI agreed to the release of a government green paper and a discussion document relating to Better Digital Services \[EGI Min (15) 5/2-3\]. The feedback received on those two documents has informed the proposals for this paper. Summary The discussion document seeks feedback on: how new digital services could be used to minimise the compliance and administrative costs of providing PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue (eg information about employees’ earnings and PAYE deductions could be provided to Inland Revenue as part of an employer running their payroll). The proposals for consultation are discussed on pages 2-5 of this paper; a proposal that PAYE deductions be paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid (employers currently enjoy delayed payment arrangements); the proposed thresholds above which customers would be required to submit their GST information digitally; the proposal that GST refunds should generally be made by direct credit; potential changes to modernise the PAYE rules in order to improve their overall workability. 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 91 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E Many of the options set out in the discussion document involve making trade- offs in relation to compliance costs (eg deciding what method should be used to determine the amount of tax to be deducted from an extra pay involves making a trade-off between simplicity for employers and withholding accuracy). Feedback from the consultation will help inform the final policy proposals. Regulatory Impact Analysis A Regulatory Impact Statement will be submitted when final policy approval is sought. Baseline Implications Any fiscal implications will be included in the final policy proposals. Legislative Implications None from this paper. The Minister of Revenue intends to seek approval to include two tax bills on the 2016 Legislation Programme. The proposals in this paper will be included in the second of these bills, for introduction in late-2016. Timing Issues The release of the discussion document will be announced at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle briefing on 11 November 2015. The consultation period will close on 12 February 2016. Announcement The relevant documents will be posted on Inland Revenue’s Making Tax Simpler website. Proactive Release None. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. ACC, MBIE, Corrections, Customs, NZDF, Education, Treasury, Health, DIA, Justice, Privacy Commissioner, Police, Primary Industries, DPMC, MSD, SSC and Statistics were consulted. A number of interested groups were also consulted. The Minister of Revenue indicates that the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Economic Development were consulted, and that discussion is not required with the government caucus, or with other parties represented in Parliament. The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1 note that currently the provision of PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue is a separate manual process for employers and businesses, which has adverse impacts on: 1.1 customers’ compliance costs; 1.2 the timeliness and accuracy of the information, and its usefulness to Inland Revenue and wider government; 1.3 the way in which social policy is currently administered and could be delivered in future; 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 92 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E 2 note that the government discussion document, Maxing Tax Simpler: Better Administration of PAYE and GST (the discussion document), attached to the submission under EGI-15-SUB-0109, will consult on: 2.1 allowing employers and businesses to submit PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue directly from their payroll and accounting software at the time they run the business process they would be undertaking for their own purposes; 2.2 options for requiring employers to provide PAYE information on a pay day basis; 2.3 lowering the threshold for mandatory digital filing of PAYE information by employers; 2.4 the possibility that PAYE and other deductions withheld from employees’ salary or wages are paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid; 2.5 modernising the PAYE rules to improve their overall workability; 2.6 generally requiring GST refunds to be made by direct credit; 2.7 whether there should be a threshold, above which GST registered persons would be required to file their returns electronically; 3 agree to the release of the discussion document, and to the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents; 4 authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve any editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release; 5 invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of the consultation and with final policy recommendations.

The discussion document consults on how the administration of PAYE and GST could be improved, as well as on some potential changes to the PAYE rules, as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. 2.In conjunction with the release of this document, I am also seeking the Committee’s agreement to release two further Making Tax Simpler discussion documents, one on modernising the Tax Administration Act 199 3.Copies of the discussion documents are available, electronically or in print, from my office. Executive summary 4.In short, the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST (Better administration of PAYE and GST): Proposes how new digital services could be used to minimise the compliance and administrative costs of providing PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue. This would be achieved by integrating these processes with the business processes the customer would be undertaking for their own purposes (for example, information about employees’ earnings and PAYE deductions would be provided to Inland Revenue as part of an employer running the payroll). In the case of PAYE, the proposals would create opportunities to improve the delivery of social policy. Because of these wider benefits, a number of options for requiring the more frequent provision of PAYE information are consulted on. Raises the possibility that PAYE deductions should be paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid. Employers currently enjoy delayed payment arrangements. Consults on proposed thresholds above which customers would be required to file digitally, and on a proposal that GST refunds should generally be made by direct credit. Consults on some potential changes to modernise the PAYE rules, in order to improve their overall workability. The issues canvassed are technical issues that have been raised by employers as suggestions as to where the rules could be improved. Out of scope Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 95 of 221 2 5.Submissions on this discussion document will close on 12 February 2016. Following consultation I will report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of the consultation and final policy recommendations. Background 6.Better administration of PAYE and GST is one in a series of consultation documents setting out the Government’s proposals for the transformation of tax administration. The components of the business transformation consultation timeline are set out below: 7.This discussion document builds on the concepts set out in Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) which outlined the likely scope of the review of PAYE and GST processes and the PAYE rules. Most, but not all, of the issues raised in the Green Paper are addressed in the discussion document, some are still under consideration and others will be included in subsequent Making Tax Simpler discussion documents. 8.Submissions received on the Green Paper and the Making Tax Simpler: better digital services (Better digital services) discussion document have informed the discussion and proposals in Better administration of PAYE and GST. Comment PAYE information and payments 10.Pay as you earn (PAYE) is a withholding tax where employers deduct income tax from employees’ salary and wages and pay it to Inland Revenue. The PAYE system is also used to collect payments and information for many income-related social policies. 11.Currently, employers are required to provide an employer monthly schedule to Inland Revenue every month that details information about the gross earnings of, and PAYE, child support, student loan and KiwiSaver deductions made from, each of their employees during the previous month. The employer monthly schedule for a given month is due to be filed by: the 5 th of the following month for employers with $500,000 or more of combined PAYE tax and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) deductions in the preceding tax year; and the 20 th of the following month for employers with less than $500,000 of combined PAYE tax and ESCT deductions in the preceding tax year. Out of scope Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 96 of 221 3 12.Employers must pay PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue and provide an employer deductions form to Inland Revenue: by the 20 th of the month following the month in which they withheld the tax; or twice 1 monthly for employers with $500,000 or more of combined PAYE tax and ESCT deductions in the preceding tax year. 13.Employers with $100,000 or more of combined PAYE tax and ESCT deductions in the preceding tax year must submit their employer monthly schedule and employer deductions form by electronic means in a format prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 14.The current process for providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue was largely designed for a paper world. Completing the employer monthly schedule is an additional step removed from employers’ normal business process of running their payroll and must be completed for tax compliance purposes. Even when an employer monthly schedule must be provided digitally, it is essentially just an electronic version of the paper form. 15.In addition to the compliance costs that providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue imposes on employers: There is a greater risk of calculation errors when employers calculate their PAYE and related deductions manually, as well as the potential for transcription errors when employers transcribe information from their payroll records into the employer monthly schedule. There are significant administrative costs involved in processing paper employer monthly schedules and contacting employers and employees to correct inaccurate information. Inland Revenue’s ability to effectively use PAYE information is constrained by the fact that it is not received until the following month. For example, if Inland Revenue received more timely PAYE information, it could make earlier interventions to correct incorrect tax codes or suggest the use of a special tax code, thus reducing existing pressure points around secondary tax. The fact that PAYE information is aggregated into a monthly return is a key limitation, as it is not possible for government agencies that use the information to accurately calculate pay period income, such as weekly or fortnightly. More detailed information would create opportunities for future changes to social policy, for example, the period of assessment for Working for Families could be reduced from an annual basis to several times a year, which might better match assistance with need. Problems with the timeliness and accuracy of PAYE-related information limit the extent to which social policy recipients can be confident of receiving their correct social policy entitlements during the year and of avoiding social policy debt. Proposals for consultation 16.The discussion document consults on how new digital services could be used to integrate the process of providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue with the business processes that the employer undertakes for their own purposes (such as adding an employee to the payroll or running the payroll). This should minimise the effort businesses face in meeting their tax obligations, meaning more time for them to focus on their operations. This is consistent with the objectives of 1 By the 20 th of the same month for deductions made between the 1 st and the 15 th of the month, and by the 5 th of the following month for deductions made between the 16 th and the end of the month. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 97 of 221 4 the Government’s Business Growth Agenda. Legislative amendments will be necessary to enable an employer to meet their PAYE obligations in this way. 17.Employers submitting PAYE information to Inland Revenue at the time their business process occurs could reduce compliance costs for employers and improve the timeliness and accuracy of the information received by Inland Revenue. The discussion document seeks feedback on the changes which would be possible if PAYE information was provided to Inland Revenue at the time of the business process. Possible changes include simplifying the KiwiSaver enrolment process, modernising how employers are informed of required employee deductions, simplifying procedures for supplying and amending PAYE information, and changes that could eliminate the need to file nil returns of PAYE information. 18.The discussion document proposes that the threshold above which employers are required to use electronic means to file their employer monthly schedule is halved to $50,000 of PAYE tax and ESCT in the preceding tax year. The options for electronic filing include using a web portal into which an employer could type, or attach, the PAYE information; alternatively, employers could file electronically using payroll software. The proposed reduction in the threshold reflects the fact that many more employers now make use of digital technology than when the $100,000 threshold was set in 1999. 19.To fully benefit from the new digital PAYE services, employers will have to purchase payroll software or, for those already using software, they will have to adopt an upgraded version. 20.Timely, accurate PAYE information is important to the correct delivery of many current social policy entitlements and may be a prerequisite for future changes to social policy delivery. Feedback on an earlier proposal, in the Better digital services discussion document, that would enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to use her powers to require employers who are able, but choose not to, to use digital services to provide PAYE information, was mixed. Many submitters proposed that paper filing should remain an option for those who cannot use digital services, or who prefer not to. I consider the proposal to reduce the threshold for digital filing to $50,000, of PAYE and ESCT, to be reasonable in light of the increased use of digital technology since 1999. However, because of the earlier feedback, the discussion document does not propose that employers should be required to use payroll software that supports the new digital services. 21.Instead, the discussion document proposes changes which are focused on when PAYE information is provided, rather than on how it is provided. This leaves the decision about whether or not to use upgraded payroll software to the employer. Employers without upgraded software would be catered for with a modernised web-based portal, and employers below the digital filing threshold would retain the option of paper-based filing, for the foreseeable future. 22.The discussion document outlines several options for implementing the proposed change: Under a voluntary-first approach, employers would choose whether to provide PAYE- related information to Inland Revenue at the time the business process occurs (for example, providing information about PAYE and other deductions when the payroll is run, rather than in the following month). After an undefined period, a review would be conducted, as in the review approach described below. Under a review approach, there would be a defined period for voluntary provision of PAYE information at the time of the business process. This would be followed by a required review, where the costs, benefits and experience would be revisited. Depending on the outcome, employers may then be given a lead-in period, by the end of which they would have to provide PAYE-related information at the time the business process occurs. If it became a requirement to provide PAYE information when the business process Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 98 of 221 5 occurs, it is proposed that there would be an exemption process for those who could not use digital services to meet the new requirements. Under a legislated approach, legislation permitting the provision of PAYE-related information on the new basis would also identify a lead-in period, at the end of which employers would be required to provide PAYE information on that basis. Different periods might be provided for different classes of employer and, as outlined above, it is proposed that there would be an exemption process for those who could not use digital services to meet the new requirements. 23.The discussion document also raises the possibility of requiring PAYE and other deductions withheld from employees’ salary or wages to be paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid. This has the potential to reduce employers’ compliance costs, improve compliance and provide prompter payments to the Crown and third parties (such as recipients of child support). However, there is a trade-off between these benefits and the benefit (time value of money) the delayed payment of PAYE currently provides to employers. 24.I expect that some customers will raise concerns about paying PAYE earlier, and about the potential requirement to change the way in which they provide PAYE information. Some employers may find it difficult to envisage how integrating the provision of PAYE information into their business processes will reduce compliance costs and may regard the possible requirement to file PAYE information on a pay-day basis as increasing rather than reducing their compliance costs. Adopting or upgrading PAYE software would impose costs on many employers and, while the discussion document does not propose that customers be required to use upgraded software, the use of upgraded software or payroll intermediaries using such software is the only way that employers could fully benefit from the new services. 25.The discussion document reminds readers of the payroll subsidy, which is a government subsidy to assist small employers in engaging a payroll intermediary. The document seeks feedback on whether the Government should consider any additional form of financial assistance to assist employers to take advantage of the new digital services. The PAYE rules 26.At the same time as considering changes to administrative processes relating to the provision of PAYE information, there is an opportunity to consider modernising the PAYE rules to improve their overall workability. Proposals for consultation 27.The discussion document consults on: Whether the method for determining the amount of tax to be deducted from an extra pay should be changed. Whether the tax treatment of holiday pay should be clarified legislatively or administratively by Inland Revenue publication. Whether a mechanism should be introduced to improve withholding accuracy in years in which an extra pay day will occur. Whether legislated rate changes should be applied in the same way across PAYE-related tax types/products. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 99 of 221 6 Provision of GST information 28.When a person is registered for GST, they must file a GST return for each taxable period. A person’s taxable period is one, two or six months, depending on the amount of taxable supplies made in a 12-month period or, in some cases, on the election of the GST-registered person. Generally, GST returns must be filed along with any payment by the 28 th of the month following the end of the taxable period. GST returns can be filed electronically, through Inland Revenue’s myIR service, from a mobile application and E-File from tax agents, as well as by paper. 29.Creating and filing a GST return and paying GST involve time and effort for many registered businesses and persons. The majority of registered persons have to transcribe GST information from their accounts (paper-based or digital) to their preferred GST filing channels. Information cannot be transferred automatically and must be re-entered manually. 30.The calculation of GST can also add to compliance costs. Manual calculations can result in errors, leaving registered persons exposed to the risk of penalties. It also affects efficiency and results in additional costs to registered persons, as well as Inland Revenue, in fixing these errors. 31.Furthermore, the time and effort involved in communicating with Inland Revenue imposes costs on registered persons. Some seek confirmation from Inland Revenue that their return has been received and others seek advice or progress reporting on the payment of refunds. Proposals for consultation 32.The discussion document proposes allowing GST registered persons to provide GST information to Inland Revenue directly from their integrated accounting software used as part of their business processes, rather than producing and filing a GST return as a separate manual process. This should minimise the effort businesses face in meeting their tax obligations, meaning more time for them to focus on their operations. This is consistent with the objectives of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda. 33.Although the adoption by GST registered persons of the new digital GST services would reduce administrative costs for Inland Revenue, there are not wider system benefits like those expected from the adoption of the new PAYE services. The discussion document therefore proposes that the decision to adopt the new integrated GST services for providing GST information should be, for the foreseeable future at least, voluntary. 34.The discussion document also proposes that GST refunds are generally made by direct credit into the bank accounts of GST registered persons, rather than having the option of receiving them by cheque. 35.The discussion document also seeks feedback on whether there should be a threshold, above which, GST registered persons should be required to submit their GST returns electronically (through existing electronic channels or the new digital service). Consultation 36.The Treasury, the State Services Commission, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Accident Compensation Corporation, Statistics New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, the New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Police, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 100 of 221 7 the Ministry for Primary Industries and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been consulted. None of the government agencies consulted wished to include specific comment. 37.The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s Transformation Reference Group, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and a range of private sector employers have been consulted. The discussion document reflects some of the issues they raised with officials. Financial implications 38.Approving the release of the Better administration of PAYE and GST discussion document will not have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications will be included in the final policy advice to Ministers. Administrative implications Inland Revenue 39.The administrative impacts of the proposed changes are being assessed in the context of the updated Business Transformation Business Case which is timetabled for submission to the Cabinet Committee on State Sector Reform and Expenditure Control before the end of 2015. The impacts will be reported on in the final policy advice to Ministers. Implications for government agencies 40.The proposed changes to the PAYE system will have implications for government agencies as employers. If employers are required to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process, they will have to upgrade their payroll systems to allow for the provision of PAYE information on this basis. 41.Student allowances, most benefits and pensions, and ACC compensation payments are subject to PAYE. However, the systems MSD and ACC use for these clients are designed to administer the welfare and accident compensation programmes respectively. As such, these systems are not designed as “payrolls”. Work is not yet far enough advanced to understand all the implications of upgrading these systems to be consistent with the proposed changes to the PAYE system, but MSD advises that the costs are likely to be significant. 42.Other government agencies, such as the New Zealand Defence Force and Schools’ Payroll Service (previously known as Novopay), are also known to have concerns with aspects of the proposals in their current form. 43.Inland Revenue will continue discussions with these agencies over the next few months, so that the reporting to Ministers on policy recommendations will include options for these agencies. 44.Issues around tax secrecy and collecting information on behalf of other agencies are discussed in the companion discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: towards a new Tax Administration Act. Once these issues are worked through, there is potential for greater use of PAYE and GST information across government. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 101 of 221 8 Compliance implications 45.The proposals in the discussion document are aimed at solutions that support and enable many customers to use the new digital services for PAYE and GST. Consequently, although there will be one off costs as customers adopt or upgrade their software, we expect there to be an overall reduction in both compliance and administration costs as the benefits are realised. 46.In addition, the proposed changes to the provision of PAYE information will enable government agencies to intervene more quickly to ensure individuals receive their social policy entitlements. More timely income information will also help detect fraud earlier. 47.The proposal that employers should pay PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue at the same time staff are paid should improve compliance by reducing the risk that employers use the amounts they hold in trust to cover these payments for other purposes. 48.Much of the consultation on potential changes to the PAYE rules is in response to issues raised by employers. Many of the options involve making trade-offs in relation to compliance costs. For example, deciding what method should be used to determine the amount of tax to be deducted from an extra pay involves making a trade-off between simplicity for employers and withholding accuracy. Consultation feedback will help inform final policy decisions, where trade- offs have to be made. Human rights 49.I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. The discussion document consults on a proposal that employees should provide their date of birth to Inland Revenue, via their employer, after they have taken up a new job. Date of birth information would be used to help confirm identity to ensure that deductions, such as for KiwiSaver and to repay a student loan, are correctly credited and that obligations, such as child support, are correctly assigned. 50.It is possible that some people may be uncomfortable with this information being provided to their employer because of the possibility of subsequent age discrimination. My officials will develop final policy recommendations based on submissions. Legislative implications 51.The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. However, legislative changes will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the proposals. Therefore, I intend to propose that a bill be included on next year’s Cabinet Legislation Programme for introduction in late 2016, for this purpose. Regulatory impact analysis 52.The Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements apply to some of the proposals in the discussion document. The substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the discussion document at a level that is appropriate, given the stage of policy development. Regulatory Impact Statements will be prepared as part of reporting back on final policy proposals. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 102 of 221 9 Publicity 53.I intend to announce the release of the discussion document, at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle briefing on 11 November 2015. I will announce, at the same time, the release of two other discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series, one on modernising the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the other on better tax for small businesses. 54.The release of the discussion documents will be accompanied by the launch of online public consultation. This will contain a summary of the proposals and seek views on questions raised in the discussion documents. The online consultation will be on the same website used for the previous consultations in the Making Tax Simpler series. The consultation period will close on 12 February 2016. Recommendations 55.I recommend that the Committee: 1.Note that currently the provision of PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue is a separate manual process for employers and businesses, which has adverse impacts on: 1.1Customers’ compliance costs. 1.2The timeliness and accuracy of the information, and its usefulness to Inland Revenue and wider government. 1.3The way in which social policy is currently administered and could be delivered in future. 2.Note the Government discussion document, Maxing Tax Simpler: better administration of PAYE and GST, will consult on: 2.1Allowing employers and businesses to submit PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue directly from their payroll and accounting software at the time they run the business process they would be undertaking for their own purposes. 2.2Options for requiring employers to provide PAYE information on a pay day basis. 2.3Lowering the threshold for mandatory digital filing of PAYE information by employers. 2.4The possibility that PAYE and other deductions withheld from employees’ salary or wages are paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid. 2.5Modernising the PAYE rules to improve their overall workability. 2.6Generally requiring GST refunds to be made by direct credit. 2.7Whether there should be a threshold, above which, GST registered persons would be required to file their returns electronically.

Making Tax Simpler: Better Administration of PAYE and GST Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to a number of reforms to PAYE and GST that will reduce compliance and administrative costs and create opportunities for better service delivery to individuals. Previous Consideration On 21 October 2015, EGI agreed to the release of a discussion document on proposals to improve the administration of PAYE and GST, and invited the Minister of Revenue to report back on the outcome of the consultation and with final policy recommendations \[EGI-15-MIN-0109\]. Summary Following a consultation process, a number of changes are proposed, grouped under the following themes: using digital services to integrate tax requirements into normal business processes (eg facilitating the provision of PAYE information through payroll software, encouraging the take-up of digital PAYE services, lowering the electronic filing threshold for PAYE returns, and introducing a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns); getting it right from the start (eg requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with date of birth and contact details of all new employees); making the PAYE rules work better (eg changes relating to the tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance, and the tax treatment of retrospective increases in salary or wages). Agency comments (ACC, MSD, Education Payroll Limited and Treasury) are in paragraphs 69-77. A summary of the submissions received on the consultation document are in Appendix A. Regulatory Impact Analysis A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is attached. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team considers that the RIS meets the quality assurance criteria. 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 113 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0136 Baseline Implications There will be upfront costs to upgrade software, and those who choose not to go digital may incur increased compliance costs. The Ministry of Social Development and Education Payroll Limited (Novopay) have identified additional costs. The proposed cessation of the current payroll subsidy ($2 per employee per pay-run for up to a maximum of five employees) is expected to generate fiscal savings of $17.1 million over four years. Legislative Implications Amendments will be required to the Income Tax Act 2007, the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposed amendments will be included in a tax Bill that is expected to be introduced in late 2016, for enactment in 2017. Timing Issues The proposed changes will take effect from either 1 April 2018 or 1 April 2019, as noted in recommendations 14-16 below. Announcement The Minister of Revenue will announce the proposed changes and will release an anonymised version of the summary of submissions when the Bill is introduced. Proactive Release This paper will be proactively released at the time the Bill is introduced. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. ACC, MBIE, Corrections, Customs, NZDF, MBIE, Education, Treasury, DIA, Justice, Privacy Commissioner, Police, DPMC, MSD, SSC and Statistics were consulted. Health was informed. A number of accounting firms, industry representative bodies, business and payroll software providers, and a range of individual businesses and employers made submissions in response to the consultation document. The Minister of Revenue indicates that the Minister of Finance was consulted, and that discussion has occurred with the government caucus and is not required with other parties represented in Parliament. The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: Background 1 note that on 21 October 2015, the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee agreed to the release of a discussion document on proposals to improve the administration of PAYE and GST, and invited the Minster of Revenue to report back on the outcome of the consultation and with final policy recommendations \[EGI-15-MIN-0109\]; 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 114 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0136 Proposed changes 2 agree to the introduction of a number of reforms to PAYE and GST, as outlined in the paragraphs below, that will reduce compliance and administrative costs and create opportunities for better service delivery to individuals; Using digital services to integrate tax requirements into business processes: PAYE 3 agree that all employers be required to provide PAYE information on a pay period basis, with a minimum pay period of once a week, as follows: 3.1 payroll intermediaries, employers at or above a threshold, and those employers using payroll software, be required to submit that information digitally on the day following the payday; 3.2 employers below that threshold not using payroll software, and employers unable to access digital services, be required to submit that information by the 7 th working day following the payday; 4 agree that employees (including IR56 taxpayers) who are required to remit their own PAYE and related deductions be required to provide PAYE information by the 7 th working day after the end of the month in which they receive the payment(s); 5 agree that payroll software specifications include the following: 5.1 the requirement that PAYE information is provided on the day following payday; 5.2 functionality to allow employers to provide details of new and departing employees to Inland Revenue when they are added to, or removed from, the payroll; 6 agree that the threshold referred to in paragraph 3.1 above for mandatory digital submission of PAYE information be set at $50,000 per annum of PAYE and ESCT deductions; 7 agree that the PAYE thresholds for the remittance of PAYE and for the digital submission of PAYE information be able to be changed by Order-in-Council, and that the process include a requirement to consult with affected parties; Using digital services to integrate tax requirements into business processes: GST 8 agree that a legislative framework be introduced allowing for an electronic filing threshold for GST returns to be set by Order-in-Council; 9 agree that a non-electronic filing penalty for GST returns be introduced as part of the framework referred to in paragraph 8 above, and that the amount of the penalty be set at $250; Getting it right from the start 10 agree that: 10.1 in addition to IRD number and tax code, all new employees be required to provide contact information and date of birth information to their employer; 10.2 the employer must provide this information, along with the commencement date, to Inland Revenue; 3 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 115 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0136 PAYE rules 11 agree that, for PAYE deduction purposes, employers be given the option to treat holiday pay paid in advance and salary or wages paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which it relates;

This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee’s agreement to the introduction of a number of reforms to PAYE and GST that will reduce compliance and administrative costs and create opportunities for better service delivery to individuals. The proposals are part of the Government’s plans to modernise the revenue system through business process and technology change. The measures will: reduce compliance costs by enabling employers to meet their tax obligations as part of their normal business processes – for example, meeting PAYE obligations at the time they pay wages or salaries; enable Inland Revenue to use PAYE information more effectively to improve the accuracy of withholding and help prevent individuals getting into debt; create an opportunity for Government to subsequently redesign social policies – for example, by introducing shorter periods of assessment to better match assistance to periods of need; improve the workability of some PAYE rules; introduce a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns. 2. These proposals could be included in a bill to be introduced in the last quarter of 2016 and passed before Parliament is dissolved for the 2017 general election. Executive summary 3. PAYE and GST are major components of the tax system, raising 37% and 36% (24% Inland Revenue and 12% Customs) of total tax revenue respectively. Both PAYE and GST impose obligations on businesses and other organisations, including many very small entities. 4. The proposals take advantage of modern digital technology to reduce compliance and administrative costs. By reducing errors and improving timeliness, digital systems allow government agencies to make better use of income information – for example, to ensure that benefits and other assistance are not overpaid. Better quality and more timely PAYE information enables future improvements to social policy, such as better targeting tax credit assistance to periods of need. 5. The proposals for the reform of PAYE and GST are made up of the following measures that will take effect from either 1 April 2018 or 1 April 2019 as noted: Employers will be able to meet their PAYE information obligations by providing PAYE information on payday from 1 April 2018. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 119 of 221 2 Employers will be required to provide PAYE information on payday from 1 April 2019, but there will be no change to when employers have to pay their PAYE and related deductions. The threshold for electronic filing of PAYE information will be reduced from $100,000 a year of PAYE and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) to $50,000 a year from 1 April 2019; those above the threshold who are unable to access digital services will be able to apply for an exemption from the requirement to file PAYE information electronically. From 1 April 2019 payroll software will be required to offer services which employers can use to notify Inland Revenue of new and departing staff when they are added to or removed from the payroll. This will help ensure that new employees are set up correctly from the beginning of their employment. To help ensure that identity is correctly assigned, employers will be required to obtain date of birth information from new employees and pass it on to Inland Revenue from 1 April 2019. Employers will be required to pass on contact details for all new employees from 1 April 2019. The existing payroll subsidy provides $2 per employee per pay-run, up to a maximum of five employees, for employers who outsource their PAYE responsibilities to a listed payroll intermediary. The subsidy incentivises only one model of payroll provision and will end with effect from 1 April 2018. To strike a balance between the desire for more accurate withholding of PAYE and the impact on compliance costs, employers will be given the option to tax holiday pay paid in advance as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates, or under the existing extra pay method, from 1 April 2018. To reduce complexity and confusion for employers, the rules about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied will be aligned across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date the payment is made. A framework will be introduced allowing for the setting of an electronic filing threshold for GST returns. 6. The above measures will contribute to the achievement of Government’s Better Public Service Results 9 and 10. They will make PAYE income and deduction information available on a timely basis for 3.7 million New Zealanders. 1 As well as the compliance and administrative cost reductions and changes to social policy identified in this paper the information will create opportunities for future improvements in services as information is shared more effectively across government. 1 The population subject to PAYE includes employees and recipients of taxable benefits and entitlements; this includes most benefits, New Zealand superannuation, student allowance, and accident compensation. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 120 of 221 3 7. There will however be upfront costs to upgrade software and those who choose not to go digital may incur increased compliance costs. Therefore, I expect that there will be some resistance to the recommended changes. However, the continuation of the status quo is not sustainable. It limits the opportunities for those who want to benefit from more modern ways of interacting with Inland Revenue and it limits what we can do to provide better services to individuals, including changes to social policy. 8. Most government agencies will have the core costs of upgrading their payroll software covered by their contracts with the software vendors. The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Education Payroll Limited (Novopay) have identified additional costs. 9. There will be additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue associated with the transition but these will be accommodated within Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The package I am recommending will give rise to total fiscal savings of $17.1 million over the four years commencing 2016/17. 10. I propose to include these measures in a bill to be introduced in late 2016 to enable passage before Parliament is dissolved for the 2017 general election. This timetable aligns with the plans for Inland Revenue’s new computer system (Business Transformation) and should allow sufficient time for payroll software providers and employers to make the necessary changes to their systems. Background 11. The Government’s objective for the tax system is that it should be simple to comply with, making it easy for customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than when things go wrong. 12. Inland Revenue’s business transformation is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Transformation will simplify how services are delivered by changing how customers interact with a digitally-based revenue system, simplifying policies and making better use of data and intelligence to better understand taxpayers. Inland Revenue will facilitate compliance by providing assistance at the beginning so customers get it right from the start. 13. Business Transformation is far more than just a new computer system. It is re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. 14. In March 2015 the Government released two documents, Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration (Green Paper) and Making Tax Simpler: Better digital services – a Government discussion document. Feedback on those documents informed Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of PAYE and GST – A Government discussion document (the discussion document) which was released in November 2015. This set out the Government’s proposals for improving the administration of PAYE and GST and creating opportunities for better delivery of social policy in future. 15. An employer’s PAYE obligations 2 can broadly be described as deducting PAYE from an employee’s salary or wages each payday, providing information on the employee’s gross wages and deductions to Inland Revenue once a month, and paying the withheld PAYE and related deductions to Inland Revenue once or twice monthly. 3 Employers with over $100,000 per year of PAYE and ESCT deductions are required to send PAYE information to Inland Revenue electronically, while 2 Payroll intermediaries and government agencies such as MSD, ACC and Inland Revenue which pay benefits or entitlements subject to PAYE have the same obligations as employers and references to employers in this paper should be read as including these groups. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 121 of 221 4 employers below this threshold have the option of sending a paper employer monthly schedule. Not all employers are businesses; not for profit organisations, government agencies and individuals can also have obligations as employers. Comment 16. Feedback on the Green Paper and discussion documents confirmed many of the known pain points and indicated broad support, particularly from large organisations, representative bodies and existing users of business software, for greater integration of tax requirements into business processes. 17. Benefit modelling indicates that significant compliance cost savings are available to small businesses from the adoption of business software that integrates tax requirements into normal business processes. For example, for PAYE, compliance cost savings for small employers are estimated at between 15% and 40% of time spent on PAYE. Feedback nevertheless indicates that some businesses and other organisations are opposed to the prospect of using business software. While this package of measures will require employers to file PAYE information more frequently, it does not require them to use payroll software. 18. I am not recommending that employers be required to pay (remit) PAYE and other deductions to Inland Revenue any more often. Combining the process of making payments to Inland Revenue with the process of paying staff would maximise compliance and administrative cost savings. However, feedback from the discussion document indicated that most employers value the benefits from delayed payments, particularly the cash flow benefits, more than the compliance cost savings that could arise from a fully integrated process. The option of paying Inland Revenue at the same time as employees are paid will be available on a voluntary basis for those who would like to take advantage of it. The existing threshold of $500,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT will remain in place for twice monthly payment of PAYE and associated deductions. All other employers are required to pay PAYE by the 20 th of the month following. 19. The measures I am recommending enable compliance and administrative cost savings and improvements to service delivery, including of social policy. While the compliance cost savings will be achieved through the greater use of digital services in general and business software in particular, the proposals allow small organisations to choose whether or not to take advantage of digital services. Some measures to improve the fairness and workability of the PAYE rules are also included. 20. Further information on each measure is provided below. The proposals have been grouped under the following themes: Using digital services to integrate tax requirements into business processes Requiring PAYE information at the time of the business process Facilitating provision of PAYE information through payroll software Encouraging the take-up of digital PAYE services and targeting support Thresholds for PAYE obligations GST – Introducing a framework for setting an electronic filing threshold for GST returns 3 The 5,400 largest employers with over $500,000 a year of PAYE and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and all payroll intermediaries are required to pay PAYE and related deductions twice monthly and to provide PAYE information by the 5 th of the following month. All other employers are required to provide PAYE information and pay by the 20 th of the following month. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 122 of 221 5 Getting it right from the start Provision of all new employees’ date of birth and contact detail information from employers Making the PAYE rules work better Tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance Application of legislated rate changes Tax treatment of retrospective increase in salary or wages – de minimis provision Using digital services to integrate tax requirements into business processes 21. These measures take advantage of digital services to reduce compliance and administrative costs and to create opportunities for the improved delivery of social policy and other government services. Requiring PAYE information at the time of the business process 22. Legislation currently requires employers and payroll intermediaries to provide PAYE information about new and departing employees and about each employee’s income and deductions on a monthly cycle, regardless of the employer’s pay cycle. Although employers provide information for each employee, the information must be aggregated across pay periods to provide monthly totals. 23. The aggregated and delayed nature of PAYE information enables errors to perpetuate which creates rework and drives up compliance and administrative costs. If the provision of PAYE information was integrated with the process of paying staff, Inland Revenue would have disaggregated (pay period) information provided on, or just after, payday. Pay period information received sooner would enable better administration of the PAYE system and improved delivery of social policies, such as Working for Families tax credits. It would also create opportunities to improve the design of social policy – for example, by reducing the ‘square up’ period for Working for Families to allow periods of assistance to better match periods of need. The previously released Green Paper set out the Government’s early thinking in this area. A consultation document on social policy which will set out how these changes might work is scheduled for release in 2017. 24. A number of approaches to allow employers to provide information at the time of the business process were canvassed in consultation. Many of those who provided feedback preferred a voluntary approach to providing PAYE information on payday. However, even where change is associated with better service, inertia can slow the uptake of new approaches and a voluntary approach would delay the realisation of benefits. Without a legislative requirement it will also be difficult to ensure that software providers upgrade their payroll systems. This is particularly true for large overseas based providers of payroll software. As disaggregated, more timely PAYE information is a prerequisite for subsequent improvements to social policy I recommend that the legislation allows an initial voluntary phase but specifies a date by which all employers are required to provide PAYE information on payday. 25. Some employers pay employees on a daily basis but the legislation will have a minimum pay period of a week. An employer which pays on a daily basis, including a government agency such as MSD or ACC in respect of benefits or entitlements, would report weekly and a special pay run during a pay period, will be included with the next pay period return. 26. Just over 64,000 employers (or 33%) currently file their PAYE information on paper. This number is declining at a rate of approximately 9% a year. While employers already calculate PAYE Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 123 of 221 6 and deductions for each pay period, a requirement for payday filing is likely to increase compliance costs for those who continue to provide the information on paper forms sent by post. Consideration was given to whether a threshold should be used to exempt small employers from the requirement to submit information on payday and allow them to provide pay period information at month end. However, I consider that the benefits of payday filing to the wider system justify imposing the payday filing requirement on all employers. 27. I recommend that the legislation is amended so that employers can, on a voluntary basis, provide PAYE information on payday from 1 April 2018. 28. To ensure that pay period information is available on a much timelier basis for all employees I further recommend that the legislation should require all employers to submit PAYE information on payday from 1 April 2019. 29. Information will be received more quickly from employers filing electronically than will be possible from employers using paper and posting their return. Taking this into account, the due date for information provided from payroll software will be the day following payday and the due date for employers below the electronic filing threshold not using payroll software, will be the 7 th working day following payday. 30. Currently, certain types of employees (known as “IR 56 taxpayers” 4 ) are responsible for remitting their own PAYE and related deductions instead of their employer. There are approximately 1,600 active IR 56 taxpayers. Additionally, some other employees are required to remit PAYE. This occurs when an employer does not deduct PAYE and pays the employee a gross salary or wage. Under current rules, both these categories of employees are required to pay the tax and provide an employer monthly schedule by the 20 th of the month following payment. I recommend that the due date for provision of PAYE information from these employees be brought forward to the 7 th working day after the end of the month in which they receive the payment(s). This will align the due date with the proposed due date for an employer below the electronic filing threshold, not using payroll software, who pays its employees on the last day of a month. I consider that requiring PAYE information more frequently from these employees would impose an unduly onerous compliance burden on them. 31. Employers who supported reporting PAYE information on a payday basis asked for a simple error correction process. It is intended that genuine PAYE errors will be able to be self-corrected in a subsequent period. It was also suggested that the provisions around penalties and interest might need re-consideration. The penalty regime is currently being reviewed and, if substantive legislative change is required to support the PAYE changes, officials will report to me. Information sharing 32. The above changes to improve the quality and timeliness of information about income and deductions for over 3.7 million New Zealanders will increase its usefulness to other government agencies. While no specific legislative changes are proposed at this point, improved sharing of the information is intended. It is expected that a second Tax Administration Act discussion document will include greater detail on how the legislative framework could be changed to accommodate this. Facilitating provision of PAYE information through software 4 IR56 taxpayers include private domestic workers, embassy staff, New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies, and United States Antarctic Program personnel. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 124 of 221 7 33. The requirements for payroll software will include the ability for employers to provide details of new and departing employees to Inland Revenue at the time they are added to or removed from the payroll. Because businesses vary in the way they manage this process, it is not possible to legislate that this information should be provided when these business processes occur, but early receipt of such information would bring benefits. It will enable new employees to be set up correctly from the beginning of their employment, reducing subsequent re-work and employee debt. It would also sever the link in Inland Revenue’s systems between the employers and employees in a timely way which would stop Inland Revenue contacting employers about departed employees. 34. There was considerable support for this feature in consultation, so, although the requirement imposed on employers will be to include information about new and departing employers no later than the next payday return of PAYE information, payroll software providers will be required to offer a feature to provide earlier notice which employers will use to the extent that it brings them benefits. 35. Because the detailed specifications for PAYE changes are not yet available, some software providers and large employers who have heavily customised or ‘bespoke’ systems may be concerned that a date of 1 April 2019 provides insufficient time to amend their systems. The proposed timetable will allow almost 2½ years from the time a bill is introduced to schedule the changes, and approximately 18 months from the time legislation is passed to develop and implement them. This is broadly consistent with feedback requesting 2 to 3 years notice of required changes. Encouraging the uptake of digital PAYE services 36. A significant number of those who responded to consultation suggested that, in order to encourage digital uptake, Inland Revenue should make payroll software freely available. Others suggested that some form of subsidy should be provided to offset the cost of switching or updating software, while others commented favourably on the existing payroll subsidy. 37. Approximately one third of employers (64,000) currently file their PAYE information by typing into an online form and then submitting the information from the secure part of Inland Revenue’s website. Inland Revenue proposes to significantly upgrade its ‘e-services’ and PAYE- related calculators so that the experience of submitting information via the website on payday is more akin to online banking. User-friendly, intuitively designed e-services should also encourage a significant number of those currently using paper (another 64,000) to switch to digital services, even if they consider themselves ‘just too small’ to invest in payroll software. 38. Payroll software is inherently complex and does much more than calculate tax obligations. Although Inland Revenue proposes to upgrade its calculators and e-services, it does not propose to offer free payroll software as this would be a distraction from its core business and may disincentivise the private sector from innovations in this area. 39. The government has offered a payroll subsidy of $2 per employee per pay-run, for up to a maximum of five employees, since 2006. The subsidy was introduced to offset small employers’ compliance costs by incentivising them to outsource their PAYE responsibilities to listed payroll intermediaries. The subsidy is used by some payroll intermediaries to make free payroll services available, including to non-profit bodies. The payroll subsidy is currently available to almost 98% of employers and is paid to 20 listed payroll intermediaries on behalf of approximately 23,000 employers. 5 40. Officials considered that tighter targeting of the subsidy would return it to its original intent of supporting small employers who may lack payroll or digital skills. I nevertheless recommend 5 To minimise administrative costs, the subsidy is paid to the payroll intermediary, rather than to the employer. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 125 of 221 8 that the subsidy cease with effect from 1 April 2018, generating fiscal savings of $17.1 million over four years. 41. While I expect that the loss of the payroll subsidy could result in an increase in the price of services from listed payroll intermediaries the subsidy reflects an old fashioned approach to reducing barriers for small employers. The experience for employers filing through the Inland Revenue’s website will be significantly improved and a range of payroll software products and services already exist in the market at a variety of price points. In this context because only services provided by listed payroll intermediaries are subsidised, the payroll subsidy potentially distorts employers’ choices between different types of payroll products and services. Thresholds for PAYE 42. The existing electronic filing threshold of $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT was introduced in 1999. Since that time, the use of electronic channels has become much more widespread, not just in business, but across society in general 63% of those below the current threshold file PAYE information electronically, despite not being required to do so. 43. There was considerable opposition in consultation to lowering the electronic filing threshold, often on the grounds that small employers should still be able to use paper systems. Because a lower threshold of $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT will still allow 77% of employers to choose to file on paper, I recommend lowering the electronic filing threshold from $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT to $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT from 1 April 2019. Based on 2015 figures, this change would require approximately 6,000 employers to begin to file electronically. 44. It is further proposed that, in future, the level at which the threshold is set should be subject to change by Order-in-Council following consultation with affected parties. There will be a limited exception for those employers above the electronic filing threshold who are unable to access digital services. GST – Introduction of a framework for an electronic filing threshold for GST returns 45. Fast, effective and accurate information provision can best be achieved through electronic transfer of information. GST-registered persons and businesses can currently file their GST returns on paper or in electronic form. For the year to June 2015, taxpayers chose to file 65% of GST returns (1.8 million of the 2.9 million total GST returns filed) electronically. 46. It is anticipated that electronic filing of GST returns will increase as a result of Business Transformation. I recommend that a legislative empowering provision be introduced that allows me to introduce an electronic filing threshold by Order-in-Council if uptake needs to be encouraged. 47. While there may be transitional costs for some taxpayers, once a threshold is set and implemented, electronic transfer of GST returns will have the long-term benefit of reducing compliance and administrative costs. There will also be the benefit of reduced transcription errors. 48. The vast majority of businesses and persons in New Zealand have access to the internet and electronic transfer. However, a limited exemption will be available for taxpayers for which electronic filing would cause undue compliance costs. 49. To encourage taxpayers to file electronically and to recover the additional costs of administering paper returns there will be a penalty of $250 for those taxpayers who are, in the future, required to file in an electronic format and fail to do so. The level of the penalty is consistent with the existing minimum non-electronic filing penalty for PAYE and the minimum late filing penalty for GST returns for larger businesses. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 126 of 221 9 Getting it right from the start Provision of all new employees’ date of birth and contact detail information from employers 50. The overwhelming majority of new employees have to fill in two Inland Revenue forms when they start a new job. 6 There is significant duplication of information collected through the forms, which both ask for the employee’s name and IRD number. However, Inland Revenue does not ask for the employee’s date of birth. There are thousands of cases where employees have provided an incorrect IRD number or used a variant of their name. In the absence of further information to help confirm identity, most of these instances trigger contact with the employer and employee. Employers report that they can spend considerable time helping employees to sort out instances of identity confusion. If improved service delivery is going to be based on and informed by better information appropriately shared across government agencies, we need to be confident that individuals are correctly identified. 7 51. Many employers currently obtain date of birth information from new employees. I recommend that date of birth be added to the information required for Inland Revenue. Its provision will not be a condition of employment and its absence would not automatically trigger the use of the ‘no declaration’ tax rate of 45c in the dollar, 8 however if identity cannot be confirmed that is the appropriate deduction rate. The provision of date of birth information will help confirm identity and should reduce recourse to the penalty rate. The majority of submitters supported the addition of date of birth information to the information already provided to Inland Revenue at the time an employee starts a new job. 52. Contact information is currently provided, for Inland Revenue purposes, by the vast majority new employees. 9 To assist Inland Revenue in staying in touch with individual customers, I recommend requiring the provision of this information for all new employees. Most employers already collect this information for their own purposes and the legislation will enable them to send the information directly to Inland Revenue from their payroll systems. It is intended that a single form will remain for those who wish to continue using paper. Making the PAYE rules work better Tax treatment of holiday pay paid in advance 53. The tax treatment of holiday pay depends on whether the holiday pay is a lump sum payment (in which case it should be treated as an extra pay), or is included in an employee’s regular pay or paid in substitution for an employee’s ordinary salary or wages when annual paid holidays are taken (in these cases it should be treated as salary or wages). 54. In the case of holiday pay paid in advance (for example, where an employee takes four weeks’ annual leave and receives a lump sum payment of holiday pay covering the four weeks in advance), extra pay tax treatment has a tendency to result in over-withholding of PAYE. 55. More accurate withholding outcomes could be achieved if PAYE was deducted as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates. Consultation feedback suggested it was common practice to apply this alternative approach for end of (calendar) year holiday pay paid as a lump sum. Moreover, prior to Inland Revenue clarifying its operational 6 The IR330 which requires the employee to select a tax code and the KS2 KiwiSaver form. 7 Inland Revenue will recognise RealMe from June 2017. 8 The no declaration rate is automatically used if an IRD number is not provided and/or if a tax code is not selected. 9 Contact information (postal address, phone numbers and email) is required on the KiwiSaver deduction form which must be completed by new employees between the ages of 18 and 65 who are New Zealand citizens or entitled to live in New Zealand indefinitely and are not employed for 28 days or less or as casual employees. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 127 of 221 10 position on the correct tax treatment of holiday pay in November 2015, some payroll software applied this alternative approach to holiday pay paid in advance. 56. This alternative treatment would, however, be more complicated for employers to apply than treating the payment as an extra pay. This is due to the need, when future payments are made for pay periods to which the leave relates, for employers to calculate PAYE based on all earnings for the pay period, less PAYE already collected for the pay period. This will occur for pay periods that are not taken entirely on leave, but partially taken on leave and partially worked in. 57. Although it is a more precise method of withholding, I consider that the alternative method is too complicated to compel employers who do their payroll manually to use. I therefore recommend that employers be given the option to tax holiday pay paid in advance under the existing extra pay method, or as if the lump sum payment was paid over the pay periods to which the leave relates. For consistency, I also recommend that similar treatment be extended to the analogous situation of salary or wages paid in advance. Application of legislated rate changes 58. Different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE-related social policy products 10 have different rules on what is to be done when there is a legislated rate (or threshold) change during a pay period, or if there is rate (or threshold) change between the date the payment is made and the pay period to which the payment relates. The rates (or thresholds) that apply are sometimes based on the pay date, pay period end-date or pay period start-date, while sometimes apportionment applies. This creates complexity and confusion for employers which adds to compliance costs. 59. I recommend that the rules in the Inland Revenue Acts about how legislated rate or threshold changes are applied be aligned across the different types of PAYE income payments and PAYE- related social policy products, such that the rates and thresholds to be applied are those in force on the date the payment is made. Aligning the rules would simplify the transitional process for employers when a legislated rate (or threshold) change occurs, thus reducing compliance costs. There was strong support for this in consultation feedback. Tax treatment of retrospective increase in salary or wages – de minimis provision 60. Under the PAYE rules, a retrospective increase in salary or wages is treated as an extra pay. This is subject to a longstanding de minimis provision, so only applies where the total salary or wages a person earns in a week (including the increase) is more than $4. If a person earned less than $4 for the week, the payment would be treated as salary or wages but, due to the effects of inflation over the last half century, this is now extremely unlikely to occur. 61. I recommend that the de minimis rule in relation to the tax treatment of retrospective increases in salary or wages be repealed, as it is effectively redundant and the mischief it was presumably intended to address is no longer an issue. Consultation 62. In June 2014, Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Victoria University of Wellington hosted a conference entitled Tax Administration for the 21st Century. The conference explored options for making tax easier. Following this conference, the Government issued Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration, which set out the broad direction of proposed improvements to administration of the tax system, and Better Digital Services: A Government 10 PAYE-related social policy products include the ACC earners’ levy, student loan deductions, the minimum employee KiwiSaver contribution and the compulsory employer KiwiSaver contribution. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 128 of 221 11 Discussion Document, which outlined how digital technology could be used to improve service, reduce compliance costs and improve compliance. To encourage feedback from a wide audience, the release of these documents was accompanied by the launch of online public consultation on a dedicated Making Tax Simpler website. 63. On 11 November 2015, the Government released Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST: a Government discussion document (the discussion document), which outlined how digital technology could be used to streamline PAYE and GST processes. Once again, to encourage feedback from a wide audience, the discussion document was accompanied by the launch of online public consultation on the Making Tax Simpler website. A summary of the feedback provided is at Appendix A and agreement is sought to the public release of an anonymised version of this material at the time the bill is introduced. 64. Officials also consulted directly with a number of large private and public sector employers with complex payrolls and with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) which pay taxable benefits and compensation payments that are subject to the deduction of PAYE. The implications for government agencies are discussed in the subsequent section on administrative implications. Feedback from consultation has informed the development of the measures included in this paper. 65. The Treasury, the State Services Commission, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Accident Compensation Corporation, Statistics New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, the New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Police, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been consulted. Financial implications 66. The table below provides a summary of the fiscal impact of the measures I am recommending in this package. The payroll subsidy is an annual appropriation established under permanent legislative authority. The proposed repeal, with effect from 1 April 2018 will reduce expenditure from the baseline and increase the operating balance. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2015/162016/172017/182018/192019/20 & outyears Non-departmental Benefits and Other Related Expenses Payroll Subsidy PLA- -(1.700)(7.300)(8.100) Administrative implications Inland Revenue 67. The changes proposed in this report would be implemented in Inland Revenue’s new computer system, START, during stage 2 of the Business Transformation programme. 68. It is anticipated that there will be additional administrative costs associated with implementing the recommended changes to PAYE but these are expected to be largely transitional. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 129 of 221 12 It is expected that the administrative costs of the proposed changes will be accommodated within the programme funding. Other government agencies 69. Most government agencies will have the core costs of upgrading their payroll software covered by their contracts with the software vendors, although there will be costs associated with installing and testing the upgrade and training staff and changing processes. Small government agencies using ‘off the shelf’ packages or cloud-based services may face additional costs for upgrades but these are not expected to be material. 70. Student allowances, most benefits and pensions, and accident compensation payments are subject to PAYE. The systems MSD and ACC use for these clients are complex and are primarily designed to administer the welfare and accident compensation programmes respectively. The costs of change will fall on the agencies. 71. ACC has indicated general support for the provision of details of accident compensation payments on payday but has identified possible concern around its capacity to always share date of birth and contact information by the time of the first compensation payment. ACC has also identified a number of related opportunities for improving the accuracy of compensation payments and the calculation of levies. Inland Revenue and ACC will work closely to ensure that these benefits can, where possible, be realised through better information flows between agencies. 72. ACC does face some system constraints but their own transformation project includes the development of new systems which, provided the timeframes can be aligned, provides the opportunity for ACC to build in the necessary functionality at marginal cost. ACC has identified the importance of working closely with Inland Revenue through detailed design and subsequent phases to ensure that the programme requirements, implementation timeframes and delivery risks are effectively co-ordinated and managed. 73.Education Payroll Limited (EPL), through the Ministry of Education, commented that the schools’ existing payroll platform (Alesco, through supplier Ascender) could provide existing pay period information to Inland Revenue at the time staff is paid without major changes. Their response to the wider Inland Revenue transformation was caveated to the effect that, until the interface to be used between Inland Revenue and EPL is known, the capability to comply, lead time and costs cannot be confirmed and/or estimated. Ministry of Social Development comment 74. MSD is generally supportive of the proposals in the paper for the reforms to PAYE and GST, including those to improve the timeliness of these payments. However, MSD considers that the costs of implementing these changes require additional funding as these costs are not able to be absorbed within a baseline. The Ministry’s baseline is already facing significant cost pressures and a constrained financial outlook. 75. MSD will meet its costs as an employer adjusting its payroll systems. However, as noted in the paper, MSD’s systems are complex and primarily designed to administer the social welfare system. The systems currently provide information on a monthly schedule basis to Inland Revenue on payments made and tax adjustments for debt for clients receiving most main benefits, pensions and student allowances. Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Official Information Act 1982 Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 130 of 221 13 Treasury comment 77. Treasury supports the proposed changes as they will enable improvements in government services through more timely and useful information. In addition to public consultation, Inland Revenue has consulted with many government agencies and note that most will have any costs covered by their contracts with software vendors. We recognise the changes may present cost pressures on some agencies, but these should be funded from agency baselines. Additional funding could be considered for a few agencies on an exceptional basis. Agencies will have until 1 April 2019 to implement most changes, and it would be inequitable to provide funding to government agencies while the payroll subsidy for small and medium businesses is being removed. Compliance implications 78. The proposals in this paper will enable customers to use the new digital services for PAYE and GST. Consequently, there will be one off costs as customers adopt or upgrade their software. However, it is expected that there will be an overall reduction in both compliance and administration costs as the benefits are realised. 79. Inland Revenue will deliver targeted support and education to ensure that all employers understand the PAYE changes and, in particular, that those employers who are not taking advantage of digital services understand the available benefits. 80. The proposed changes to the provision of PAYE information will enable government agencies to intervene more quickly to ensure individuals are subject to accurate rates of withholding and are supported to avoid debt. More timely income information will also help detect fraud and overpayment earlier. Human rights 81. There are no human rights implications. While the provision of date of birth information to Inland Revenue at the time an employee takes up a new job may cause concern to some people, many employers routinely collect this information already. The proposal that date of birth information be provided to Inland Revenue to help confirm identity was supported by a majority of those who provided feedback on the subject. Legislative implications 82. The proposals contained in this package of measures would require legislative amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. I also recommend that drafters be instructed to modernise the way the PAYE rules are expressed in legislation. 83. It is proposed to include the amendments in a tax bill that would be introduced in late 2016 and enacted before the Parliament is dissolved for the 2017 general election. This timeline is necessary to provide sufficient time for payroll providers and large employers with customised payrolls to plan and implement the change. Withheld under section 9(2)(f)(iv) of the Official Information Act 1982 Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 131 of 221 14 Regulatory impact analysis 84. The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirements apply to most of the proposals in this paper and a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared and is attached. 85. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team at the Treasury (RIAT) has reviewed the RIS prepared by Inland Revenue. RIAT considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS meets the quality assurance criteria. Publicity 86. I propose to announce these measures and release an anonymised version of the summary of submissions when the bill is introduced. I also propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper.

First 2017 Omnibus Tax Bill: Miscellaneous Items Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to several miscellaneous amendments to tax legislation for inclusion in the next omnibus tax Bill. Previous Consideration On 15 June 2016, EGI made a number of decisions relating to pay period reporting and the due date for filing PAYE information \[EGI-16-MIN-0136\]. Summary Amendments to tax legislation are proposed to: Following further consultation with stakeholders, agreement is also sought to rescind earlier decisions relating to pay period reporting and the due date for filing PAYE information. Specifically, it is proposed that: rather than being required to file on a pay period basis, employers should be required to provide PAYE information on a payday basis; the due date for PAYE information above the electronic filing threshold for payroll intermediaries and for employers using payroll software should be the second working day, rather than the first day, after payday. 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E Out of scope Out of scope Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 143 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0297 Regulatory Impact Analysis Two Regulatory Impact Statements (RIS) are attached.

Executive summary 6Following further consultation by Inland Revenue with stakeholders on its Business Transformation programme (Better administration of PAYE and GST), I am also recommending that earlier decisions by Cabinet \[CAB-16-MIN-0283 refers\] in June relating to pay period reporting and the due date for filing PAYE information be rescinded and replaced: Rather than being required to file on a pay period basis, employers should be required to provide PAYE information on a payday basis. Out of scope Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 147 of 221 2 The due date for PAYE information employers above the electronic filing threshold, for payroll intermediaries and for employers using payroll software should be the second working day, rather than the first day, after payday. 7These changes to the PAYE rules should allow for better integration with payroll software and should improve the accuracy of the information sent to Inland Revenue. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 are necessary to implement this change. 8I recommend these miscellaneous changes to tax legislation be included in an omnibus taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in early 2017.

The decisions were made by the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on 15 June 2016 \[EGI -16-Min-0136 and CAB-16-MIN-0283\]. 64Following further consultation by Inland Revenue with stakeholders, I am now recommending the changes below: Out of scope Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 155 of 221 10 I recommend that the requirement that employers provide PAYE information on a pay period basis with a minimum period of a week, should be rescinded and replaced with a requirement that employers provide such information on a payday basis. Large employers frequently do ‘ad-hoc pays’ and the proposed change would require information from these payments to be provided at the time the payment was made rather than being held over and included with the next regular payroll. The recommended change would eliminate a minimum reporting period, allow for better integration with payroll software, and simplify the process of reconciling PAYE information and payments. It may be necessary to make special arrangements for some taxpayers who pay on a daily basis such as the Ministry of Social Development; such variation is permissible under current law. I further recommended that the due date for PAYE information, from payroll intermediaries, employers at or above the electronic filing threshold and employers using payroll software, should be changed from one day following payday to the second working day following payday. This change would better allow employers and payroll intermediaries with complex payrolls to update their payroll systems for errors and adjustments arising from the pay and as a consequence would improve the accuracy of the information sent to Inland Revenue. It is not considered necessary to change the filing due date for employers below the electronic filing threshold and not using payroll software as these employers are unlikely to deal with complex payrolls. 65The effect of these changes to the PAYE rules should reduce compliance costs on employers and PAYE intermediaries as the timing of the requirement better integrates with payroll software and should improve the accuracy of the information sent to Inland Revenue. Consultation 66The Treasury was consulted on the proposed changes recommended in this paper.

Apart from my recommendation to change the timing when PAYE information is provided to Inland Revenue by employers and PAYE intermediaries, the measures for inclusion in the first taxation bill for 2017 do not impact on Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Economic impacts 72The measures I am recommending in this paper are intended to improve the efficiency of tax legislation by reducing compliance and administration costs. No other economic impacts, apart from those already mentioned in this paper, have been identified. Human rights 73The changes I am recommending in this paper are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Legislative implications 74Implementing the changes in this paper requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. I recommend that the necessary amendments be included in the next omnibus taxation bill, which is scheduled for introduction in early 2017.

Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information: Release of Discussion Document Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to the release of the attached discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information (the discussion document) and to the launch of accompanying online consultation. Previous Consideration On 21 October 2015, EGI noted that the submissions received on two earlier consultation documents relating to A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration (the Green Paper) and Better Digital Services will be used to shape the detailed discussion documents proposed for release in the future \[EGI-15-MIN-0108\]. Summary A number of discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series have previously been released. The attached discussion document builds on the concepts set out the Green Paper and on the submissions received in the earlier discussion documents. This discussion document includes proposals to improve the collection of information about investment income. Investment income includes interest, dividends, portfolio investment entity (PIE) income, and royalties. In addition, income distributed by Maori Authorities to their members, while not investment income, is subject to Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) and has been included in the scope of the discussion document. No changes are proposed for royalties. The proposals would give Inland Revenue a more accurate picture of an individual’s income during a year, allowing tax returns to be pre-populated with more information. This in turn should increase voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get their tax right. The proposals include: requiring payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific withholding information on a monthly basis (or in line with the business process of paying the income if that occurs less often than monthly); removing the need for payers of withholding tax to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 171 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0105 increasing the “non-declaration rate” for RWT on interest, and for tax on PIEs to 45 percent; creating a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; requiring all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption. The discussion document does not include the possibility of withholding systems being used to more efficiently to collect underpayments of tax, eg through variable withholding rates – it is considered that the compliance costs required to implement this proposal would far outweigh any gains. Agency and sector comments are in paragraphs 37-45. Regulatory Impact Analysis Not required. Baseline Implications None from this paper. Legislative Implications None from this paper. Timing Issues The discussion document will be released in early June 2016 for a six-week consultation period. Announcement The Minister of Revenue will issue a media release. The release of the discussion document will be accompanied by the launch of online public consultation. The material will be published on the Making Tax Simpler website and on the standard Tax Policy website. Proactive Release None. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. Treasury, the Privacy Commissioner, DIA and TPK were consulted. DPMC, MBIE, Justice and SSC were informed. Corporate taxpayers group, large banks, share registries, some investment companies, Te Tumu Paeroa (a Maori Authority service provider), a custodian business, and some accountants servicing SMEs were also consulted. The Minister of Revenue indicates that the Minister of Finance was consulted, and that discussion is not required with the government caucus, or with other parties represented in Parliament. 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 172 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0105 The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1note the contents of the government discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information (the discussion document), attached to the submission under EGI-16-SUB-0105, which will consult on proposals to: 1.1 require payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific withholding information on a monthly basis (or in line with the business process of paying the income if that occurs less often than monthly); 1.2 require payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with information on each owner of joint investments; 1.3 require payers of investment income to provide information about customers who are subject to approved issuer levy; 1.4 require payers of investment income to provide information about customers who receive income that is exempt from withholding tax; 1.5 remove the need for payers of withholding tax to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; 1.6 increase the “non-declaration rate” for resident withholding tax on interest, and for tax on portfolio investment entities to 45 percent; 1.7 create a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; 1.8 require all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption; 2agree to the release of the discussion document and to the launch of accompanying online consultation on its contents; 3authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve any editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release; 4invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee on the outcome of consultation and with final policy recommendations.

These discuss potential changes to the timing and quantum of information that payers of investment income (such as interest and dividends) are required to provide to Inland Revenue and are part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Executive summary 2.Ultimately the Making Tax Simpler proposals are about making it easier for people to get their tax right, and harder to get things wrong. To achieve that the Making Tax Simpler series of consultation papers make a number of proposals, with these main underlying principles: Improve information flows to Inland Revenue and use the information received to prepopulate information for taxpayers to simplify the requirements for those taxpayers that have to, or choose to, file a tax return; Increase the use of digital services to bring that information together; Use the information to help ensure that people are on an appropriate tax rate and therefore that the tax deducted during the year does not result in large end of year debts or refunds. 3.The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information proposes: requiring payers of investment income to provide Inland Revenue with taxpayer specific withholding information on a monthly basis (or in line with the business process of paying the income if that occurs less often than monthly); otaxpayer specific information would include: the amount of income paid to the customer; the amount of tax withheld (if any), or imputation credits attached; the customer’s IRD number (if held); the customer’s name; the customer’s address; the customer’s date of birth (if held); if the investment is a joint investment, information on each owner of the investment; if the payer is paying approved issuer levy, details of the relevant customers; if the payer is paying interest that is exempt from withholding tax, details of the relevant customers; removing the need for payers of withholding tax to provide end of year tax certificates to their customers who have provided their IRD number; Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 175 of 221 increasing the “non-declaration rate” 1 for resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest, and for tax on portfolio investment entities (PIEs) to 45%; creating a database of taxpayers holding certificates of exemption from withholding tax; and requiring all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption. 4.The proposals in this document will affect a wide range of payers of investment income including banks, all companies that pay dividends, PIEs, Māori Authorities and individuals paying withholding income such as interest. 5.The key trade-off underlying the proposals is the benefits to customers in being able to access pre-populated information about their income from investments, to Inland Revenue in receiving better information sooner, and to the Government in being able to redesign social policy programmes to take advantage of more detailed and frequent information about investment income, versus the increased compliance costs on payers (albeit partly offset by benefits to those payers). 6.A copy of the discussion document is attached. Background 7.Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information is one in a series of consultation documents setting out the Government’s proposals for the transformation of tax administration in New Zealand. The components of the Business Transformation consultation timeline are set out below: 8.This discussion document builds on the concepts set out in the Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) which outlined the likely scope of the review of tax and social policy administration. Most but not all of the issues relating to investment income information raised in the Green Paper are addressed in this discussion document. The one item mentioned in the Green Paper which is not included in this discussion document is the possibility of withholding systems being used to more efficiently collect underpayments of tax, for example through variable withholding rates. This is not included in the discussion document as officials think the compliance costs to implement such a proposal would far outweigh any gains. Inland Revenue already has the ability to issue deduction notices to banks and others to collect tax debts. 9.Submissions received on the Green Paper and the Making Tax Simpler: Better Digital Services discussion document have informed the discussion and proposals in Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information. Comment 1 The “non-declaration rate” is applied when a customer does not provide the payer with their IRD number. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 176 of 221 10.New Zealand has an aging population and as people move further into their working lives and on into retirement they typically earn a greater proportion of their income from the investment of capital that they have built up. Income from the investment of capital such as interest and dividends is therefore expected to form a greater proportion of the income that the average person earns in the future and means that having efficient and effective withholding tax systems for these types of income is vital to the integrity of the tax system. 11.Investment income can take a number of different forms, for example: interest; dividends; royalties; and income derived by PIEs. In addition, income distributed by Māori Authorities to their members, while not investment income, is subject to RWT and has been included in the scope of the discussion document. No changes are proposed for royalties. 12.The discussion document proposes that payers of investment income provide more information more often on income from the investment of capital so that Inland Revenue can use that information to provide better services to people, and can ensure taxpayers are complying with the law. To reduce the compliance cost impact of this approach, the document contains options for providing information more easily and removing some types of payer obligations. 13.It is necessary for Inland Revenue to obtain withholding information on a timelier basis to enable the pre-population of that information onto tax statements, which will mean that taxpayers will be able to access their PAYE (currently pre-populated) and withholding tax information from one source. This will make it easier for people to get an accurate understanding of their tax position. 14.Payers of RWT are currently required to provide end of year tax certificates to the recipients of the income. These certificates set out the amounts and types of income and the amounts of RWT deducted. Taxpayers currently need to gather various pieces of correspondence about interest, dividends, Māori Authority distributions and any other income and add the relevant amounts to their PAYE income that is shown on their Summary of Earnings (“SOE”), Personal Tax Summary (“PTS”) or online IR3 tax return. Unless taxpayers are relatively well organised this process can be seen as being too hard or alternatively relevant information can be missed and an incorrect return can be filed. By increasing the amount of information that is pre-populated Inland Revenue will be saving taxpayers’ time and reducing the risk that they will file incorrect returns. Incorrect filing can expose a taxpayer to risk of penalties. 15.If this information was able to be pre-populated into tax returns by Inland Revenue it would be appropriate to remove the requirement for the payers to send out the end of year certificates. This would only be appropriate for recipients who had provided their IRD numbers to the payer of the income (as Inland Revenue would not be able to prepopulate information that could not be matched to an individual). 16.Obtaining withholding information during the tax year would also make it possible for Inland Revenue to advise payers of errors in the information they are providing or the rate choices that have been made by their customers. There would then be an opportunity for the payers to remediate these errors during the tax year and avoid creating taxpayer debt. 17.Better withholding information would enable Inland Revenue to construct a more complete picture of an individual’s income and the time at which it is earned. This would allow for a more accurate determination of the social assistance a taxpayer is entitled to during the income year and create options for more timely government assistance. It is considered that Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 177 of 221 this would in turn reduce issues relating to end-of-year square-ups and debt, as Inland Revenue would be able to adjust an individual’s entitlements during the year rather than undertaking one square-up at year-end. 18.The proposals in this discussion document will increase the amount of information that Inland Revenue will be able to pre-populate for taxpayers and for large numbers of taxpayers will mean that all of their taxable income information is available in one place. Taxpayers that receive income from a number of other sources that will not be able to be pre-populated such as foreign sourced income and rental income will still need to provide information on that income to Inland Revenue. To the extent that income is not able to be allocated to individual taxpayers due to limitations in the information reported (such as where people have not provided their IRD numbers to the interest payers) there will also be gaps in what Inland Revenue can pre-populate. 19.A later policy project in the Making Tax Simpler series will look at social policy entitlements and obligations. Making changes to how Inland Revenue could administer the social policy programmes, in a way that has a real beneficial impact on people, will require Inland Revenue obtaining more information during the year. 20.The discussion document includes a section on payment dates and the possibility of linking these to the dates on which payments of withholding income are made in some circumstances. This is most likely to be useful in situations where the payments are infrequent such as annual or six monthly distributions. Changes to the monthly RWT payment obligations for regular interest payers are not proposed. 21.The discussion document includes a proposal for Inland Revenue to provide a live certificate of exemption list or a searchable database to enable payers of withholding income to confirm on a regular basis that recipients have a valid certificate of exemption. Recipients of withholding income who are exempt from income tax under Acts other than tax Acts are also able to receive their investment income without tax being deducted, but are not required to obtain a certificate of exemption. The discussion document contains a proposal which would require all taxpayers seeking to receive their investment income that is not subject to withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption. This would mean that all exempt taxpayers would be included on the certificate of exemption list or database, which would enable payers of investment income to use this to confirm all exemptions in their systems are valid. 22.The proposals in this discussion document will potentially have an impact on all companies (big and small), PIEs, Māori Authorities and any other individuals and entities that pay withholding income such as interest. While banks are the largest withholding tax payers, a wide range of organisations have withholding obligations. The range of organisations involved means a one size fits all approach will not be appropriate. Instead, a range of return requirements and possible information transfer methods will need to be provided to suit the capability of the different types of withholding tax payers 2 . 23.Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation computer system upgrade will include changes to how information can be received. This will make it easier for payers of investment income to file information with Inland Revenue electronically. A key change for RWT, Non Resident Withholding Tax (“NRWT”) and Approved Issuer Levy (“AIL”) will be a gateway to upload information (similar to that used by PIEs to file returns). 24.In addition to the electronic gateway, there will be an option of an online form. Inland Revenue’s new computer system will be able to accept attachments filed with the online forms. This option may be particularly useful for smaller withholding taxpayers as it would 2 97% of the 16,601 interest payers in 2015 who filed interest withholding tax certificates filed detailed information for 10 or less recipients, while 10 filed more than 50,000 certificates. Similarly, more than 99% of companies have 10 or less shareholders whereas some listed companies will have more than more than 50,000 shareholders. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 178 of 221 enable them to attach calculations that are done in a format that does not meet the electronic gateway criteria. 25.Investment income payers of different types and sizes will have different levels of ability to file information electronically (whether by data transfer through a gateway or via online forms). The administrative impact for Inland Revenue will vary by how much information is provided to it electronically. The key risk of allowing all information to be provided by paper channels would be the significant disruption to the pre-population of investment income information if Inland Revenue received significant numbers of records in paper form and had to manually enter them into its computer system. 26.The document sets out a range of options relating to potentially requiring some or all payers to file information electronically. These include: Continuing to allow all payers the option of filing electronically or on paper: osubject to a review after a period of time; or ountil a given future date. Requiring some payers to file electronically straight away based on the number of recipients they pay investment income; Require most payers to file electronically straight away, with some exceptions (e.g. for those with no internet access). 27.Requiring some investment income payers to file electronically based on the number of recipients they pay investment income to would ensure that large and reasonably large payers would be required to file electronically while most payers of investment income would still be able to choose their option. Over 80% of interest certificates are filed by interest payers who file more than 10 certificates. 28.Companies do not currently provide detailed information about their shareholders to Inland Revenue. The information that companies would be required to provide to Inland Revenue is information it must already hold in order to pay dividends and send shareholder dividend statements to its shareholders. Potential challenges Challenges relating to the recipients of the income Joint accounts 29.Currently Inland Revenue only gets one IRD number in relation to each joint investment. To pre-populate return information for individuals Inland Revenue needs to allocate income earned on jointly owned investments to the individual owners. Allocating the income could potentially be done on a pro-rata basis provided there was a mechanism to allow the individual owners to re-allocate the income if the investment ownership was not equally distributed among the owners. Challenges relating to the payers of withholding income Non-filing payers 30.To the extent that payers of withholding income fail to file returns and pay tax Inland Revenue will be unable to pre-populate that income. As a result there will inevitably be some Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 179 of 221 gaps in the information for some taxpayers and they will be likely to still need to provide that information themselves. Payers who file returns on paper 31.Some payers of withholding income will not have the technological capability to file electronically or may be unwilling to do so. For payers that continue to file paper returns it will not be possible to make efficiency gains to offset potentially increased compliance costs. Increasing the non-declaration rate 32.The document proposes to increase the non-declaration tax rate for RWT and PIE investments to 45% (from 33 and 28% respectively), aligning it with the non-declaration rate for PAYE. The non-declaration rate is the tax rate used when a taxpayer does not provide their IRD number to the payer of investment income. Associating income information with the right taxpayers is vital for pre-population of tax statements, and ensuring that taxpayers are receiving or paying the correct amount of social policy entitlements or obligations. Impact on compliance costs 33.Requiring payers to provide more information, more often, is likely to result in an increase in compliance costs for payers (with a potential reduction in compliance costs for recipients of withholding income). This increase for payers could, however, be offset by making the interaction between payers and Inland Revenue more efficient. With the exception of the PIE tax regime, the processes currently in place for the transfer of information between withholding tax payers and Inland Revenue are very manual, requiring physical transmissions of information and a number of interactions between RWT payers and Inland Revenue. It is envisaged that improved technology and greater digitalisation will enable payers to transfer information and make payments to Inland Revenue more easily. 34.To the extent that payers use the electronic gateway, there will be some initial set up cost to ensure that their system is producing the appropriate reports to feed into the Inland Revenue system but officials do not expect the ongoing costs to be significant. If, however, payers do not use the electronic gateway, and file either electronically (by completing an online form), or by paper then officials expect that the initial set up costs would be smaller but there would be an ongoing increase in the cost to comply. 35.If, after consultation, Cabinet agrees to proceed with these proposals it will be important to ensure that timeframes for changes to reporting requirements are realistic, as payers of withholding income will not be confident to make system changes until the requirements have been enacted. The discussion document seeks feedback on timeframes that would be sufficient to make any system changes. 36.A number of other regulatory changes will also require system development, including the international Automatic Exchange of Information which is expected to require financial institutions to begin conducting due diligence and meeting reporting requirements on all new accounts from 1 July 2017. Consultation 37.Officials have consulted with the Treasury, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 180 of 221 State Services Commission, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and Te Puni Kōkiri. 38.Te Puni Kōkiri raised concerns regarding the impact of the changes on Māori Authorities, particularly smaller Māori Authorities, and their potential lack of capacity and systems to provide the detailed information. They have also raised concerns regarding the ability to provide beneficiary information where the ownership is held through whānau trusts. Officials are continuing to work with Te Puni Kōkiri to resolve these concerns. 39.The New Zealand Debt Management Office (“DMO”) has provided initial feedback regarding the potential impact of the possible changes on their operations. It was noted that it uses Computershare as its registry and that Computershare will have some system change costs. It also raised the potential for the additional disclosure requirements to affect investor demand where investors are investing through nominee companies. Officials will work through these points as they develop the proposals further. 40.In preparing the discussion document officials have held meetings with the five largest banks: Westpac, KiwiBank, ANZ, ASB and BNZ. All of the banks mentioned that they would need time to make technology changes if reporting requirements changed but they were largely accepting of suggestions that more detailed information could be provided more often (perhaps monthly) provided that there was an ability to correct errors in future periods. One bank suggested that more detailed information could be provided 6 monthly rather than monthly and was quite resistant to monthly detailed reporting. 41.Officials also met with AMP Financial Services and Appello Services to understand the position of organisations operating in the PIE sector. Their responses were quite different and reflected their different technology platforms and their ability to attribute income to investors and calculate their tax liability on a regular basis. Further consultation will be needed in this sector to understand the technological challenges that some of the proposals could impose. 42.Officials have also met with the two largest share registries: Computershare and Link Market Services. These organisations look after dividend distributions for most large New Zealand companies and also deal with the interest payments on a number of corporate bonds. They were accepting of the suggestions and could see benefit in some of the proposed changes although both noted that they would need to do some system development work, and one of the registries asked whether the Government would be contributing to the cost of any changes required. 43.Officials consulted with the Corporate Taxpayers Group. The Group did not think that receiving information on a monthly basis was necessary for pre-populating income tax returns, nor for all forms of social policy (as they are currently designed). The discussion document notes that in order to allow social policy to be redesigned, Inland Revenue requires more information on sources of income, such as income from investment during the year. 44.To understand the current position in the small to medium sized entity (“SME”) sector, officials have had discussions with accountants from two accounting practices active in the SME market. 45.In order to get some understanding of the potential effect of changes for Māori Authorities, officials met with other Inland Revenue staff members who deal with Māori Authorities on a day to day basis and also had discussions with Te Tumu Paeroa (formerly known as the Māori Trustee) and Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited (an administration service provider to a number of Māori Authorities). Māori Authorities range from very sophisticated businesses to small trusts holding small parcels of Māori land. Their administration models are also quite varied with some administering their own affairs while others use an intermediary such as Te Tumu Paeroa or Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited to provide their administrative services. Te Tumu Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 181 of 221 Paeroa and Te Awanui Huka Pak Limited have relatively sophisticated systems in order to deal with the large number of distributions they make; however, officials understand that one of the key issues in respect of a number of Māori Authorities will be their capability to provide the information (along with some reluctance in some cases). Financial implications 46.Approving the release of the Government discussion document will not have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Human rights 47.I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Legislative implications 48.The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. Legislative changes will, however, be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the proposals. Therefore, I propose to include any resulting legislative changes in an omnibus taxation bill. Regulatory impact analysis 49.The regulatory impact analysis requirements apply to some of the proposals in the discussion document. The substantive regulatory impact analysis elements have been included in the discussion document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. A Regulatory Impact Statement will be prepared as part of reporting back on final policy proposals. Publicity 50.I propose to issue a media release when the discussion document is released. If approved, officials will release the issues paper in early June with submissions closing six weeks later. 51.The release of the discussion document will be accompanied by the launch of online public consultation. This will contain a summary of the proposals and seek views on questions raised in the discussion documents. The online consultation will be on the same website that was used for the consultation on the previous documents in the Making Tax Simpler series. The discussion document will be available from this website, as well as the standard Tax Policy website.

Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information Portfolio Revenue Purpose This paper seeks agreement to the introduction of a number of reforms to the collection of investment income information to make it easier for people to comply with their tax and social policy obligations. Previous Consideration On 25 May 2016, EGI agreed to the release of a government discussion document on Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information, and invited the Minister of Revenue to report back on the outcome of the consultation and with final policy recommendations \[EGI-16-MIN-0105\]. Summary “Investment income information” is information collected about resident withholding tax (RWT), non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), approved issuer levy (AIL), and portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax. These taxes are withheld from interest, dividends, PIE income and taxable Maori authority distributions. There are a large number of payers of investment income (eg banks, PIEs, other financial institutions, companies and Maori authorities), that make payments to a large proportion of the New Zealand population. Following a consultation process, are number of changes are proposed, which will: reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by enabling Inland Revenue to pre-populate their investment income information in their tax records; enable Inland Revenue to use the investment income information more effectively to improve the accuracy of withholding, and help prevent individuals getting into debt; create an opportunity for the government to improve the delivery of social policies, eg by introducing shorter periods of assessment to improve the accuracy and timeliness of payments; link the provision of the investment income information with the payment of withholding taxes to Inland Revenue; improve the workability of a number of aspects of the withholding tax regimes for payers of investment income. 1 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 189 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0307 The proposals are summarised in paragraph 5. A summary of the submissions received is in Appendix A on pages 20-39. To date, limited feedback has been received from Maori authorities. Officials will continue to seek feedback from Maori authorities on the proposals. Regulatory Impact Analysis A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is attached. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team considers that the RIS meets the quality assurance criteria. Baseline Implications There will be some upfront costs for the payers of investment income, eg to upgrade their software. Administrative costs incurred by Inland Revenue will be met from within the Business Transformation budget. The pre-population of interest income is estimated to result in between $21 million - $27 million in additional income tax being paid per annum, commencing in 2018/19. Legislative Implications Changes will be required to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposals will be included in the tax Bill that is expected to be introduced in early 2017 and enacted in early 2018. Timing Issues The proposed changes will be implemented in Inland Revenue’s new computer system (START) during stage 2 of the Business Transformation programme. The proposed application dates (see recommendation 19 below) should provide sufficient time for investment income payers to plan and implement the required changes. Announcement The Minister of Revenue will make an announcement when the Bill is introduced. Proactive Release The relevant Cabinet papers will be proactively released at that time. Consultation Paper prepared by Inland Revenue. Treasury, Justice and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were informed. DPMC, MBIE, DIA, TPK and SSC were informed. A number of interested groups made submissions as part of the consultation process. The Minister of Revenue indicates that discussion is not required with the government caucus, or with other parties represented in Parliament. 2 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 190 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0307 The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: Background 1note that an 25 May 2016, the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee agreed to the release of a government discussion document on Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information, and invited the Minister of Revenue to report back on the outcome of the consultation and with final policy recommendations \[EGI-16-MIN-0105\]; 2agree to the introduction of a number of reforms to the rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 regarding investment income information that will, in conjunction with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme: 2.1 reduce compliance and administrative costs; 2.2 create opportunities for better service delivery to individuals; Detailed recipient information 3agree to require investment income payers (payers of interest, dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions) to provide detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis, or for the months in which payments are made if the payment frequency is less than monthly; 4agree to require payers of portfolio investment entity (PIE) income to provide investors’ prescribed investor rate (PIR) details six months into the income year; 5agree that payers of PIE income be required to specify whether the investor is in a “locked in” fund in the year-end detailed information they provide to Inland Revenue; 6agree to require investment income payers to provide the recipient’s date of birth to Inland Revenue as part of the monthly reporting, if it is held; 7agree to require investment income payers to provide detailed recipient information regarding each of the owners of jointly owned investments, if it is held; 8agree that detailed recipient information in respect of interest income subject to approved issuer levy (AIL) be required to be provided to Inland Revenue monthly for domestically issued debt, at the same time as the Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) and Non-Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) reporting; 9agree that detailed recipient information about interest income that is exempt from RWT because the investor has a certificate of exemption be required to be provided to Inland Revenue annually, but will be allowed to be provided monthly if preferred by the interest payer; 10 agree that the reporting due date for interest and PIE income (excluding “locked in” schemes) year-end information be brought forward to 15 May (for the tax year ended 31 March) from the current due date of 31 May; 3 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 191 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0307 Non-declaration 11agree to increase the non-declaration rate for interest subject to RWT to 45 percent; 12 agree that investors opening new investments in PIEs be required to provide their IRD number (or a declaration that they are non-resident and do not have an IRD number) within six weeks of making the initial investment if they are to remain a member of the PIE; Electronic filing 13 agree that investment income payers be required to file their withholding tax returns, including the detailed recipient information, electronically unless they receive an exemption from Inland Revenue; Certificates of exemption 14 agree the Inland Revenue make a source of information available to investment income payers to enable them to confirm whether or not recipients are exempt; 15 agree that recipients that are tax exempt under Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007 be required to have a certificate of exemption from withholding tax to be treated as exempt by investment income payers. This will ensure that they are included in the information source referred to in paragraph 14 above, and will enable investment income payers to rely on that source of information; End of year interest certificates 16 agree that the requirement to provide end of year withholding tax certificates to recipients of interest income who have provided their IRD number to the interest payer be removed; Error correction 17 agree that investment income payers be allowed to correct errors in previous withholding tax returns in their next return, subject to the following restrictions for errors being corrected in the following income year: 17.1 the amount of the error must be lower than the greater of $2,000 and 5 percent of the investment income payer’s total withholding tax liability for the year; and 17.2 the investment income payer must provide detailed recipient information in respect of the error, including the amount of the error for each recipient and the tax period or periods that the error relates to; Application date 18 agree that the implementation of the changes for investment income information follow a legislated approach, where the submission of investment income information on a monthly basis is initially voluntary but the legislation specifies the timeframe by the end of which employers will be required to provide investment income information on the new basis; 19 agree that the legislation includes the following implementation timetable: 19.1 1 April 2018: the date at which PIEs will be required to obtain the IRD number of new investors, or alternatively a self-certification that they are non-resident and do not have an IRD number; 4 I N C O N F I D E N C E Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 192 of 221 I N C O N F I D E N C E EGI-16-SUB-0307 19.2 1 April 2019: the date from which it becomes permissible for investment income payers to submit investment income information on a monthly basis (paragraph 3 above); 19.3 15 May immediately following the end of the tax year : the due date for filing the current detailed interest and PIE income information (excluding “locked in” schemes) for tax years beginning on or after 1 April 2018; 19.4 1 April 2020: the date from which the following will be required: 19.4.1 investment income payers (other than PIEs) to provide detailed recipient information on a monthly basis, or for the month in which the payments are made where the payments are made less often than monthly.

The proposals are part of the Government’s plans to modernise the revenue system through business process and technology change being implemented by Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The measures will: reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by enabling Inland Revenue to pre-populate their investment income information in their tax records; enable Inland Revenue to use the investment income information more effectively to improve the accuracy of withholding and help prevent individuals getting into debt; create an opportunity for Government to improve the delivery of social policies – for example, by introducing shorter periods of assessment to improve the accuracy and timeliness of payments; link the provision of the investment income information with the payment of withholding taxes to Inland Revenue; improve the workability of a number of aspects of the withholding tax regimes for payers of investment income. 2.These proposals would be included in the next omnibus taxation b ill, likely to be introduced in the first quarter of 2017. Executive summary 3.Investment income information is the information collected about resident withholding tax (RWT), non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), approved issuer levy (AIL) and portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax. These taxes are withheld from interest, dividends, PIE income and taxable Māori authority distributions. There are a large number of payers of investment income (including banks, PIEs, other financial institutions, companies (large and small), Māori authorities and some individuals) making payments to a large proportion of the New Zealand population. 4.The proposals take advantage of modern digital technology to reduce compliance and administrative costs. By reducing errors and improving timeliness, digital systems allow government agencies to make better use of income information – for example, to ensure that benefits and other assistance are not overpaid or underpaid. Better quality and more timely investment income information supports future improvements to social policy, such as better determining entitlements and obligations. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 195 of 221 2 5.The proposals for the reform of investment income information are made up of the following measures that will take effect from 1 April 2020 unless otherwise noted: Payers of interest, dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions will be required to provide detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis or for the months in which payments are made if the payment frequency is less than monthly. Payers may elect to file monthly from 1 April 2019 but will be required to file monthly from 1 April 2020. Payers of PIE income will be required to provide investors’ prescribed investor rate (PIR) details to Inland Revenue six months into the income year and will be required to specify whether the investor is in a “locked in” fund such as a KiwiSaver fund in the year-end detailed information they provide to Inland Revenue. To help ensure that identity is correctly assigned, investment income payers will be required to provide the recipient’s date of birth to Inland Revenue as part of the detailed recipient information reporting if it is held. This information is typically collected from new investors under anti money laundering rules. To enable jointly earned income to be split between the joint owners, investment income payers will be required to provide detailed recipient information regarding each of the owners of jointly owned investments if it is held. This will be provided either in the investment income payer’s main return files or alternatively in a separate report to the main withholding tax returns. Detailed recipient information in respect of interest income subject to AIL will be required to be provided to Inland Revenue monthly for domestically issued debt (at the same time as RWT and NRWT information is reported). Detailed recipient information about interest income that is exempt from RWT (because the investor has a certificate of exemption) will be required to be provided to Inland Revenue annually but will be allowed to be provided monthly if preferred by the interest payer. From the tax year beginning 1 April 2018, the reporting due date for interest and PIE income (excluding “locked in” schemes) year-end information will be brought forward to 15 May (for the tax year ended 31 March) from the current due date of 31 May. The non-declaration rate for interest subject to RWT will be increased to 45% to encourage non-declared interest recipients to provide their IRD number to their interest payer. Investors opening new investments in PIEs will be required to provide their IRD number (or a declaration that they are non-resident, do not have an IRD number and providing their foreign tax identification number) within six weeks of making the initial investment if they are to remain a member of the PIE. Investment income payers will be required to file their withholding tax returns including the detailed recipient information electronically unless they receive an exemption from Inland Revenue. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 196 of 221 3 Inland Revenue will make a source of information available to investment income payers that enable them to confirm whether or not recipients have certificates of exemption. To ensure that all exempt recipients are included in the information source discussed above (which will enable investment income payers to rely on that source of information), recipients that are tax exempt under Acts other than the Income Tax Act 2007 will be required to have a certificate of exemption from withholding tax to be treated as exempt by investment income payers. To reduce compliance costs for interest payers, the requirement to provide end of year withholding tax certificates to recipients of interest income who have provided their IRD number to the interest payer will be removed. To reduce compliance and administration costs, investment income payers will be allowed to correct errors in previous withholding tax returns in their next return subject to restrictions for errors being corrected in the following income year. 6.The above measures will contribute to the achievement of Government’s Better Public Service Results 9 and 10. They will make investment income and withholding tax deduction information available on a timely basis for New Zealanders receiving investment income. As well as the compliance and administrative cost reductions and changes to social policy identified in this paper the information will create opportunities for future improvements in services as information is shared more effectively across government. 7.There will however be upfront costs to upgrade software, particularly for payers of investment income making payments to large numbers of recipients, and there will be some on-going compliance costs for payers that don’t automate reconciliation processes. Therefore, I expect that there will be some resistance to the recommended changes. However, the continuation of the status quo limits the opportunities for those who want to benefit from more modern ways of interacting with Inland Revenue and it limits what we can do to provide better services to individuals, including changes to social policy. 8.Most Government agencies will be relatively unaffected by these proposals. The Debt Management Office pays large amounts of interest; however, it outsources the registry processes for debt issues to a registry services provider that will have to make any changes required. The registry services provider could increase its charges to the Debt Management Office to recover the costs of the changes but any such increase would be expected to be spread across all of the provider’s customers. 9.There will be additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue associated with the transition but these will be accommodated within Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The package I am recommending will give rise to additional revenue of $21-27 million per annum in respect of interest income and further fiscal savings relating to social policy abatement (the fiscal savings are currently unable to be quantified due to the lack of investment information provided under current settings). This revenue and the savings form part of the Business Transformation programme business case which has already been included in Government revenue forecasts. 10.I propose to include these measures in a bill to be introduced in early 2017. This bill is not expected to be passed until early 2018. The application dates proposed should allow sufficient time for investment income payers to design and make the necessary changes to their systems. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 197 of 221 4 Background 11.The Government’s objective for the tax system is that it should be simple to comply with, making it easy for customers to get things right and difficult to get wrong. It should serve the needs of all New Zealanders, put customers at the centre and help them from the start, rather than waiting until things go wrong. 12.Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation is a long-term programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. It will simplify how services are delivered by changing how customers interact with a digitally-based revenue system, simplifying policies and making better use of data and intelligence to better understand taxpayers. Inland Revenue will facilitate compliance by providing assistance at the beginning so customers get it right from the start. 13.Business Transformation is far more than just a new computer system. It is re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with customers, including improvements to policy and legislative settings and enabling more timely policy changes. 14.In March 2015 the Government released two documents, Making Tax Simpler: A Government green paper on tax administration (Green Paper) and Making Tax Simpler: Better digital services – a Government discussion document (CAB Min (15) 915). Feedback on those documents informed Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information – A Government discussion document (the discussion document) which was released in July 2016 (CAB-16-MIN-0236). This set out the Government’s proposals for improving the administration of investment income information and creating opportunities for better delivery of social policy in future. 15.Submissions from a range of parties expressed support for changes to improve the flow of information on investment income between payers and Inland Revenue and the better use of technology by Inland Revenue to match and pre-populate investment income data. However, all of the submissions expressed concerns over compliance costs and doubts over whether the benefits would justify the costs. These concerns were raised mainly about monthly reporting and joint account information provision. 16.Limited feedback has been received from Māori authorities and their advisors to date. I have instructed officials to continue to seek feedback from Māori authorities. 17.As expected, the submissions received were largely from investment income payers, advisory firms and industry organisations. The major benefits of this project are expected to flow to the recipients of investment income. As such, the tenor of the submissions may not reflect the wider reaction to the proposals. 18.The payers of investment income are required to deduct tax from the payments of investment income that they make (unless they pay less than a threshold amount or the recipient is eligible to be treated as exempt). The amount of the deductions is determined by the choices and circumstances of the recipients. For example, a non-resident earning interest can elect AIL or will be subject to NRWT at the rate applying for the country they are resident of, while a resident can select from a range of RWT rates if they have provided their IRD number to the payer. The payer then pays (remits) the deductions and submits a summary return (usually a paper form showing the total income paid and the total tax deducted) to Inland Revenue, usually in the following month. In the case of interest and PIE income the payer also provides detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year. 19.Payers of investment income also have obligations to report payment information to the recipients of the investment income. Companies have to provide shareholder dividend statements and Māori authorities have to provide Māori authority distribution statements when payments are Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 198 of 221 5 made. PIEs provide PIE investor statements and interest payers provide interest certificates after the end of the tax year. Comment 20.The measures I am recommending enable compliance and administrative cost savings and improvements to service delivery, including for social policy. The compliance cost savings will be achieved through the greater use of digital services and the pre-population of investment income to allow recipients to see as much of their tax information as possible in one place and to use it to meet their tax and social policy income calculation obligations. The use of digital forms will allow payers of investment income to a few recipients to save time and money by filing online rather than having to file paper returns. Some measures to improve the fairness and workability of the rules regarding investment income information are also included. 21.I am not recommending that payers of investment income be required to remit RWT, NRWT, PIE Tax and AIL to Inland Revenue any more often or any earlier. Rather, I am recommending that the payers of investment income align the process of providing detailed investment income information to Inland Revenue with their business processes for paying investment income and withholding the relevant tax. 22.Payers of investment income that make payments to large numbers of recipients have developed systems to calculate and deduct withholding taxes. These systems will need to be altered or redesigned to meet the proposed requirements and there will be upfront costs to achieve these changes. These payers are also likely to have some on-going costs to reconcile the information that they will be required to provide each month although they may be able to minimise these costs by automating their reconciliation processes. 23.Further information on each measure is provided below. The proposals have been grouped under the following themes: Getting it right from the start Requiring detailed recipient information to be provided on a monthly basis for most interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions. Increasing reporting on interest to include AIL (where the instrument has been issued from New Zealand) and interest income that has been treated as exempt. Increasing the non-declaration rate for RWT on interest income to 45%. Requiring new PIE investors to provide their IRD number to the PIE. PIEs to provide the PIR of their investors six months into the income year and to include locked in status in the detailed reporting at the end of the year. Date of birth information to be provided if held by the investment income payer. Joint owners’ identity details to be provided by investment income payers. Making the investment income rules work better Mandating digital filing. Bringing the due date for end of year returns forward to 15 May (from 31 May) for interest and PIE income (excluding locked-in PIE funds). Bringing forward the date for interest income is an interim measure until monthly reporting is in place. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 199 of 221 6 Making an information source of valid certificates of exemption available to investment income payers. Requiring recipients of investment income to have a certificate of exemption in order to be treated as exempt. Removing the requirement for interest payers to provide end of year interest certificates to recipients who have provided their IRD number. Allowing error correction within the same income year and also in the following year subject to thresholds. Getting it right from the start 24.These measures will enable Inland Revenue to proactively intervene during the year where recipients are on inappropriate tax rates and will create opportunities for the improved delivery of social policy and other government services. Requiring detailed recipient information to be provided monthly 25.Legislation currently requires payers of interest subject to RWT or NRWT and payers of PIE income to provide detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year. No detailed recipient information is required to be provided for dividends, Māori authority distributions and interest subject to AIL or that is treated as exempt. 26.The receipt of the detailed recipient information well after the year end and t he lack of information for some types of investment income means that investment income is unable to be easily associated with the recipient’s other tax records (as personal tax summaries have been prepared before the investment income information that Inland Revenue does receive has been able to be processed). It also means that Inland Revenue is unable to proactively adjust tax rates during the tax year to reduce debts or refunds due at the end of the year. 27.Receiving more complete information and receiving it sooner and more frequently would enable better administration of investment income information and improved delivery of social policies, such as Working for Families tax credits. In addition, Inland Revenue is often the source of income information for other Government agencies and these proposals could therefore enable reforms to the delivery of other services provided by Government. 28.It would also create opportunities to improve the design of social policy – for example, by reducing the annual period for Working for Families to allow periods to better match times of need. The previously released Green Paper set out the Government’s early thinking in this area. A consultation document on social policy, which will set out how these changes might work, is scheduled for release in 2017. 29.A number of frequency options for the provision of investment income information were canvassed in consultation. Feedback provided by the payers of investment income who make payments to large numbers of recipients showed that they preferred annual provision of information or if more frequent information was required quarterly provision of information. Some submitters did, however, note that if more frequent provision of information was required it would make little difference if it was required monthly or quarterly as the same systems changes would be required. 30.A group of interest payers pay withholding tax to Inland Revenue less often than monthly. These are interest payers that make interest payments of more than $5,000 per annum and withhold less than $500 per month. They are required to pay the tax they have withheld every two months if they withhold more than $500 every two months, but only every six months if they withhold less Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 200 of 221 7 than $500. There are approximately 23,500 payers who filed 6 or less RWT returns in the year ended 31 March 2015. Under the monthly reporting proposal these payers would have to file investment income information each month but will remain on the same payment basis. 31.Monthly information has been proposed as the preferred option as it allows the best matching of information for possible future changes to social policy calculation periods. For example, if the social policy period was changed to quarterly and the investment income was reported quarterly there would be a 3 month lag. This is because income calculations for social policy are completed before the beginning of the period and investment income reporting is done after the end of the period. This means that for the quarter beginning 1 July the social policy inco me calculation will be completed by 30 June while the investment income information for the quarter ended 30 June will not be provided until 20 July so the information for the quarter ended 31 March would have to be used. If the investment income information was provided on a monthly basis the information for the month ended 31 May would be available for inclusion in the social policy income calculation to be completed by 30 June. Reducing the delay allows assistance to be better targeted to periods of need. 32.While there may be some additional compliance costs with monthly provision of detailed investment income information, I consider that the benefits of monthly provision of detailed investment income information to the wider system justify the proposal. 33.A small group of submitters (made up of some very large payers of investment income) requested a period of three years from the enactment of the legislation to make and implement systems changes. This would suggest an application date for the proposed changes of 1 April 2021. This was endorsed by the New Zealand Bankers Association when I met with them. Inland Revenue have discussed possible application dates with these submitters and on the basis of those discussions recommended an application date of 1 April 2020 to me. While I am recommending a 1 April 2020 application date, I am willing to consider this further based on submissions made during the select committee process. 34.I also note that a number of financial institutions have just undertaken systems changes in relation to FATCA (recently completed or at remedial system development stage), are making systems changes for AEOI (now until second reporting date June 2019) and will also need to make changes for PAYE (by 1 April 2019). They are, therefore, expending considerable resources on overlapping tax related regulatory changes as shown by the following diagram: Late 2016 2017 2018 2019 Early 2020 FATCA Remedial AEOI System Development PAYE Design System Development Inv Income Design System Development 35.Some types of investment income are only likely to be paid sporadically such as dividends and Māori authority distributions. Where this income is paid less often than monthly I recommend that detailed investment income information is only required for the months in which investment income is paid. 36.During consultation some investment income payers have expressed interest in piloting the new requirements. I recommend that the legislation is amended so that investment income payers Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 201 of 221 8 can, on a voluntary basis, provide detailed investment income information on a monthly basis from 1 April 2019. 37.To ensure that detailed investment income information is available on a much timelier basis for all recipients I further recommend that the legislation should require all payers of investment income consisting of interest, dividends and Māori authority distributions to provide detailed investment income information on a monthly basis from 1 April 2020 . Interest income subject to AIL and investment income that is treated as exempt 38.Investment income payers have submitted that they may be unable to provide detailed reporting in respect of debt subject to the AIL regime that has been issued offshore. This is because these debt issues are often managed by paying agents in foreign jurisdictions who may be prevented from providing detailed recipient information by the laws in the other jurisdiction. I, therefore, recommend that the detailed reporting requirement does not apply to debt instruments issued outside of New Zealand where the interest payments are subject to AIL. 39.The reporting of detailed information in respect of interest paid to recipients that have been treated as exempt from income tax is a compliance measure. In order to reduce compliance costs I recommend that this information is only required on an annual basis but that investment income payers are allowed to provide it on a monthly basis if they choose to do so. Increasing the non-declaration rate on interest income to 45% 40.Non-declaration of a person’s IRD number makes it much more difficult for Inland Revenue to associate income with the recipient’s tax records. The current non-declaration rate for RWT on interest income is 33% and is equal to the top marginal tax rate; however, people can have higher effective marginal tax rates. If a person was on the 33% tax rate and had a student loan their effective marginal tax rate on their investment income could actually be 45%. The 33% non- declaration rate provides no incentive for people on the 33% tax rate or for people who also have social policy entitlements or obligations and may therefore have an effective marginal tax rate of more than 33% to provide their IRD numbers to their interest payer. 41.Submissions on the proposed 45% non-declaration rate for interest were mixed, however, around 20% of the end of year interest certificates relate to interest recipients who are non-declared. This equates to around 1 million non-declared interest certificates each year. Inland Revenue will work with banks to try to reduce the number of non-declared accounts. However, in order to encourage the remaining non-declared recipients of interest income to provide their IRD numbers to their investment providers, I recommend that the non-declaration rate for RWT on interest is increased from 33% to 45%. 42.Increasing the non-declaration rate will not be effective on its own. It is important that people who are non-declared are aware that they are non-declared. Inland Revenue will work with interest payers to try to obtain IRD numbers from non-declared recipients and to make them aware that they will be taxed at a higher rate unless they provide their IRD number to their interest payer before the proposal comes into effect. Requiring new PIE investors to provide their IRD numbers to the PIE 43.The level of non-declaration is relatively low for PIE investments (about 2%) and PIEs have indicated during consultation that they would prefer to require all new PIE investors to provide their Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 202 of 221 9 IRD numbers when they sign up than to have a higher non-declaration rate. In addition, providers and Inland Revenue would try to obtain IRD numbers for the currently non-declared investors. 44.I recommend that PIEs are required to obtain IRD numbers from new investors with an exception for investors that certify they are non-resident, don’t have an IRD number and provide their tax identification number from the country in which they are resident (this exception would require the collection of details that are consistent with Automatic Exchange of Information requirements). PIEs to provide the PIR of their investors six months into the income year and to report locked in status as part of detailed year end information 45.Currently PIEs only provide detailed recipient information after the end of the tax year and do not indicate in that information whether the PIE invested in is a locked in PIE or not. PIE income in a locked in PIE (such as a KiwiSaver fund or a retirement savings scheme with complying withdrawal restrictions) is not counted for social policy income calculation purposes. 46.As PIEs do not provide detailed recipient information until the end of the year Inland Revenue is unable to proactively check the PIR selected by the investors. Also, because PIEs do not have to declare whether the PIE is a locked in PIE or not on the detailed investor information, Inland Revenue is unable to easily determine whether the PIE income should be counted in the investor’s social policy income calculation. 47.I recommend that payers of PIE income are required to provide investors’ prescribed investor rates (PIRs) six months into the year, and in the end of year return include information on whether the fund the recipient has invested in is locked in. These changes will allow Inland Revenue to proactively adjust PIRs within the tax year and will allow Inland Revenue to appropriately allocate relevant PIE income to social policy income calculations. Date of birth information to be provided if held by the investment income payer 48.Date of birth information is often used to confirm identity and the discussion document proposed that investment income payers provide date of birth as part of their detailed recipient information where it is held. This would apply for all types of investment income including interest income, dividends, PIE income and Māori authority distributions. 49.The date of birth information would be used as a further identification data point to help to ensure that income information was pre-populated to the correct person’s tax records. It would be particularly helpful where a person’s investment is non-declared, the person has provided an incorrect IRD number or where a person uses multiple names. It could also be used to help with data matching when information is shared between Government agencies. 50.Some submitters expressed concerns that it would be difficult to obtain this informatio n from recipients, although limiting the requirement to provide date of birth information to information held by the investment income payer as suggested in the discussion document would resolve this problem. I note that date of birth information is typically required to be collected from new customers as part of anti-money laundering legislation. 51.I recommend that payers of investment income are required to include date of birth information in the detailed investment income that they provide to Inland Revenue if they hold that information. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 203 of 221 10 Payers of investment income to provide joint owners identity details 52.Currently interest and PIE income payers provide one IRD number for jointly owned investments. This means that Inland Revenue can only associate the income with this IRD number and is unable to associate the income with the other owners of the joint investment. 53.The discussion document considered the issue of jointly owned investments and ways in which the joint income could be pre-populated to the known owners’ tax records. Submitters were very clear that they are not well-placed to separate the income between the owners and some submitters were very strongly of the view that the only solution that is workable without unreasonable compliance costs is the provision of a separate report giving the known details of joint owners for jointly owned investments. Inland Revenue would then use this information to split the income evenly between the investors. 54.I therefore recommend that joint ownership information is provided by investment income payers and that they are given the option of providing it in their main withholding tax report or in a separate report. Inland Revenue officials have noted that there are some specific technical issues that were raised by submitters regarding share registry rules around trusts which will need to be taken into account when drafting legislation in respect of this proposal. Making the investment income rules work better Mandating digital filing 55.Using upgraded digital services which provide information in near real-time is key to maximising the benefits available from Inland Revenue’s transformation processes and submitters generally supported using improved digital services. The nature and number of investment income payers and the numbers of recipients each payer makes payments to mean that mandating digital is a logical option. There will also be a range of digital filing options from an online form designed to suit payers with only a small number of recipients to a data file transfer process designed to suit payers with hundreds of thousands of recipients. 56.Inland Revenue receives almost five million interest certificates annually and with a shift to monthly reporting this could increase to 60 million. The changes in respect of AIL reporting and reporting in respect of exempt income would also increase these figures for interest income. There would also be additional reporting from dividend payers and Māori authorities. This level of reporting strongly indicates the need to make digital reporting mandatory. In addition, these payers currently have to file paper forms when they pay investment income. Completing and submitting an online form rather than completing and posting in a paper form is likely to reduce their compliance costs. 57.The number of recipients per investment income payer is also a factor in recommending mandatory digital filing. Almost 94% of the interest payers pay 5 or less recipients. Similarly, 570,000 of the 573,000 companies registered as at 21 April 2016 had 10 or less shareholders. Because so many of the investment income payers make payments to a very small number of recipients, having a digital filing threshold based on the number of recipients would be likely to mean the vast majority of investment income payers would not be required to file digitally. If they chose to continue to file paper returns it would cause very significant administration costs. 58.When information is submitted digitally the format of the information being submitted can be validated before it is accepted so by mandating digital reporting the number of incorrect or incomplete returns may be able to be reduced. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 204 of 221 11 59.I therefore recommend that investment income payers are required to file their detailed investment income information digitally. 60.I also recommend having a process for allowing an exemption to the mandated digital filing for investment income payers who would experience unreasonable compliance costs or other hardship as a result of the requirement to file digitally. An example of investment income payers that this might apply to could be people without a computer or internet connection. The investment income payer would need to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for an exemption from the digital filing requirement. Bringing the due date for end of year returns forward to 15 May (from 31 May) for interest and PIE income (excluding “locked -in” PIE schemes) 61.As the main changes proposed may not take effect until April 2020, I recommend that the due date for the annual detailed file that is currently provided by interest payers is brought forward from 31 May to 15 May (for the year ended 31 March). This will allow Inland Revenue to include the interest information in the personal tax summaries prepared from the beginning of June each year (although joint income will not be able to be split between owners at this stage and there is likely to still be a significant number of non-declared certificates). This change would apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2018 with the first affected returns due by 15 May 2019. 62.I also recommend that the due date for the annual return of detailed PIE income information is brought forward from 31 May to 15 May for PIEs that are not “locked in” funds. This will allow the information to be associated with the recipient where they receive social policy entitlements or have social policy obligations. 63.These changes will enable Inland Revenue to pre-populate some information for taxpayers and enhance compliance. They will also allow some of the revenue benefits that will accrue from these proposals to be accessed earlier. Making an information source of valid certificates of exemption available to investment income payers 64.The discussion document considered whether Inland Revenue should provide a database (or other source of information) that allowed payers of investment income to check whether their customers had a valid certificate of exemption. Submitters were strongly in favour of this proposal as long as the information was kept up to date and was easily accessible and usable. 65.Issues and cancellations of certificates of exemption are published in the New Zealand Gazette on a quarterly basis. When a certificate of exemption expires at the end of one quarter and is renewed on the first day of the next quarter, the renewal will not appear in the New Zealand Gazette until after the next quarter has finished. Providing a database would allow payers to confirm exemption validity on a close to real time basis. 66.I recommend that Inland Revenue provide a certificate of exemption database (or other source of information) that enables investment income payers to confirm certificate of exemption validity on a real time or near real time basis. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 205 of 221 12 Requiring recipients of investment income to have a certificate of exemption in order to be treated as exempt 67.Recipients of investment income can be exempt from income tax under Acts other than the tax Acts. They are then able to request their investment income payer to pay their income to them without withholding any tax. They are able to apply for a certificate of exemption from Inland Revenue , but they don’t have to in order to be treated as exempt. Where the exempt recipient does not choose to apply for a certificate of exemption but instead asks the investment income payer not to withhold on the basis of their exempt status, this can cause compliance cost for the payer as they need to check the claim of exemption is reasonable. 68.I propose requiring any recipient that is eligible to be treated as exempt from withholding tax to obtain a certificate of exemption from Inland Revenue if they wish to continue to be treated as exempt. This will ensure that they are included in the database of valid certificates of exemption discussed above and reduce compliance costs for investment income payers. It will also enhance compliance as any recipients that are incorrectly being treated as exempt recipients will be able to be checked against the database and have their exempt status removed. 69.Investment income payers and Inland Revenue will work together to contact exempt recipients that do not have certificates of exemption to encourage them to apply for a certificate of exemption prior to the application of this requirement. The application process will be a one-off process for the affected parties and is a relatively straight forward process. Removing the requirement for interest payers to provide end of year interest certificates to recipients who have provided their IRD number 70.The discussion document proposed removing the requirement for interest payers to send end of year interest certificates to recipients that have provided their IRD numbers to their interest payer. Submissions on this proposal were mixed with some submitters seeing this as a worthwhile cost reduction measure, some suggesting it would make little difference, and others suggesting that the end of year certificates would still be needed for interest recipients to be able to check that the interest information shown by Inland Revenue was accurate. 71.The proposal to use the current year end information to pre-populate recipients’ tax records for tax years from 1 April 2018 will enable recipients of interest income to compare their year end certificate information with the information pre-populated by Inland Revenue for two years before the requirement to provide year end certificates was removed. Some interest payers have indicated that they will continue to voluntarily provide interest certificates at the end of the year to their customers even if the requirement is removed but that they would like more flexibility aro und those end of year certificates. By removing the requirement, interest payers that choose to continue to provide end of year certificates will be able to adapt the way that they do this (for example they could send them all out electronically therefore saving on postage and printing costs). 72.I recommend removing the requirement to provide end of year interest certificates to recipients that have provided their IRD numbers from the time that interest payers are required to provide detailed recipient information monthly. This will allow recipients some time to become comfortable with the information being pre-populated and gives Inland Revenue time to ensure that the pre-population process is operating as expected. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 206 of 221 13 Allowing error correction within the same income year and also in the following year subject to thresholds 73.Some submitters noted that, if detailed recipient information is sent to Inland Revenue more quickly, there will be more errors in the information allocated to the recipients’ tax records. As such there needs to be a simple means for the correction of errors. The investment income payers consulted with have expressed a definite preference for correcting errors in the period following the discovery of the error. This is currently allowed for errors found within the same income year but is not allowed if the errors related to a previous income year. 74.I propose that errors found within the same income year are allowed to be corrected in the next return. For an error to be corrected in a period in a subsequent income year to the year in which the error occurred, the amount of the error should be lower than the greater of $2,000 and 5% of the investment income payer’s total withholding tax liability (for the tax type and the tax year in which the error was made). In addition, the investment income payer would be required to provide information in respect of the error and the recipients affected. 75.The proposed thresholds are intended to ensure that minor errors do not require previous periods returns to be re-filed and also to allow for error correction by major investment income payers who can have very minor calculation errors across thousands of customers that add up to more significant sums very quickly. Consultation 76.In June 2014, Inland Revenue, the Treasury and Victoria University of Wellington hosted a conference entitled Tax Administration for the 21st Century. The conference explored options for making tax easier. Following this conference, the Government issued Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration, which set out the broad direction of proposed improvements to administration of the tax system, and Better Digital Services: A Government Discussion Document, which outlined how digital technology could be used to improve service, reduce compliance costs and improve compliance. To encourage feedback from a wide audience, the release of these documents was accompanied by the launch of online public consultation on a dedicated Making Tax Simpler website. 77.On 7 July 2016, the Government released Making Tax Simpler – Investment Income Information: a Government discussion document (the discussion document), which outlined how changes to the rules and processes around investment income information could be used to make it easier for recipients to get their tax right and for Inland Revenue to proactively intervene to help people avoid having large tax or social policy debts or refunds at the end of the year. Once again, to encourage feedback from a wide audience, the discussion document was accompanied by the launch of online public consultation on the Making Tax Simpler website. A summary of the feedback provided is at Appendix A and agreement is sought to the public release of an anonymised version of this material at the time the bill is introduced or the proposals are announced. 78.Officials also consulted directly with large investment income payers, registry services providers, industry organisations, accountants specialising in the large and the small business sectors, Te Tumu Paeroa and a Māori authority service provider. Feedback from consultation has informed the development of the measures included in this paper. 79.Limited feedback has been received from Māori authorities and their advisors to date. Officials have directly consulted with Te Puni Kokiri, Te Tumu Paeroa (formerly the Māori Trustee) and a Māori authority service provider. Officials who liaise with Māori authorities have Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 207 of 221 14 also emailed targeted information to them. I have instructed officials to continue to seek feedback from Māori authorities. 80.The Treasury, Te Puni Kokiri, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the State Services Commission have been consulted during the development of these proposals. Financial implications 81.All additional revenue and reduced expenditure that accrues under these proposals forms part of the Inland Revenue Business Transformation programme business case benefit and have already been accounted for by Government. 82.Inland Revenue has advised me that it is estimating that pre -population of interest income will result in between $21-27 million additional income tax being paid per annum beginning 2018-19. It is difficult to accurately estimate other benefits arising from the proposed changes due to the limitations in the information that is currently collected. Administrative implications Inland Revenue 83.The changes proposed in this report would be implemented in Inland Revenue’s new computer system, START, during stage 2 of the Business Transformation programme. It is anticipated that there will be additional administrative costs associated with implementing the recommended changes for investment income information but these are expected to be largely transitional. The administrative costs of the proposed changes will be accommodated within the programme funding. Other government agencies 84.In addition to public consultation, Inland Revenue has consulted with a number of government agencies and note that most will not have any additional costs as a result of these changes. The Debt Management Office does issue interest bearing debt and pays interest income to recipients, however, the management of the interest payments is outsourced to a registry service provider who will be making the systems changes as part of their wider registry business. Treasury comment 85.The Treasury supports the proposed changes as they will enable improved delivery of government services through more timely and useful income information. Withheld under section 9(2)(i) of the Official Information Act 1982 Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 208 of 221 15 Compliance implications 86.The proposals in this paper will enable recipients of investment income to meet their tax and social policy information requirements more easily and will reduce the risk that they will miss income out of their calculations. While the information and digital filing requirements may well reduce compliance costs for investment income payers making payments to a small number of recipients, it is expected that investment income payers making payments to large numbers of recipients will need to upgrade their systems and processes and there will be upfront costs. The proposed implementation dates with monthly reporting not being required until April 2020 are intended to give investment income payers enough time to make these changes as efficiently as possible. 87.There may also be some additional on-going costs for payers depending on their ability to automatically reconcile the payment they will be making with the information they will be providing. However, it is expected that there will be an overall reduction in both compliance and administration costs as the benefits are realised. 88.Inland Revenue will publicise the changes and will work with investment income payers to reduce the number of non-declared recipients and to identify recipients currently relying on exemptions under other Acts to reduce the number of recipients that will be negatively impacted by the proposed changes. 89.The proposed changes to the provision of investment income information will enable government agencies to intervene more quickly to ensure individuals are subject to accurate rates of withholding and are supported to avoid debt. More timely income information will also help detect fraud and overpayment earlier. Human rights 90.There are no human rights implications. While the provision of date of birth information to Inland Revenue (where it is held by the investment income payer) as part of the detailed recipient information may cause concern to some people, a number of investment income payers routinely collect this information already in order to meet anti money laundering requirements. The proposal that date of birth information be provided to Inland Revenue to help confirm identity was accepted or supported by a majority of those who provided feedback on the subject provided that it was limited to the information already held by the investment income payer. Legislative implications 91.The proposals contained in this package of measures would require legislative amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. I also recommend that drafters be instructed to modernise the way the rules relating to investment income information are expressed in legislation. 92.It is proposed to include the amendments in a tax bill that would be introduced in early 2017. The application dates proposed take this timeline into account and should provide sufficient time for investment income payers to plan and implement the changes required. Making Tax Simpler - Cabinet papers - March 2017Page 209 of 221 16 Regulatory impact analysis 93.The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirements apply to the proposals in this paper and a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared and is attached. 94.Treasury’s Regulatory Quality Team has reviewed the RIS prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS meets the quality assurance criteria. Publicity 95.I propose to announce these measures and release an anonymised version of the summary of submissions when the bill is introduced. I also propose to proactively release the Cabinet papers relating to this matter at that time. Recommendations 96.I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Growth and Infrastructure Committee: 1.Note that the proposals in Making Tax Simpler: Investment Income Information – A Government discussion document were previously considered by the Committee at the Committee’s meeting on 25 May 2016 (CAB-16 -MIN-0236). 2.Agree to the introduction of a number of reforms to the rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 regarding investment income information that will, in conjunction with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, reduce compliance and administrative costs and create opportunities for better service delivery to individuals. Detailed recipient information 3.Agree to require investment income payers (payers of interest, dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions) to provide detailed recipient information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis or for the months in which payments are made if the payment frequency is less than monthly. 4.Agree to require payers of PIE income to provide investors’ PIR details six months into the income year 5.Agree that payers of PIE income will be required to specify whether the investor is in a “locked in” fund in the year-end detailed information they provide to Inland Revenue. 6.Agree to require investment income payers to provide the recipient’s date of birth to Inland Revenue as part of the monthly reporting if it is held.

Acts administered by Inland Revenue 46 1. Introduction Inland Revenue plays a critical role in improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders by collecting and distributing money. We collect over 80 percent of the Crown’s revenue. We also administer social policies such as child support, Working for Families, KiwiSaver and student loan repayments. Our success is reflected in three outcomes: • Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. • People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in societ y. • New Zealanders benefit economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across our external environment. We want to make it easy for our customers to interact with us and to pay and receive the right amount. We also want to continue to meet the changing expectations o f government and society. With the advent of the various social policy functions, Inland Revenue is now the government agency that more New Zealanders deal with every day than any other agency. As such, Inland Revenue has responsibility for, or a major role in, seven regulatory systems: • Revenue raising and collection (with two sub-systems: income tax and consumption tax); • Working for Families tax credits; • Child support; • KiwiSaver; • Student loans; • Paid parental leave; and • Information sharing. Regulatory systems are the set of rules, norms and sanctions, given effect through the actions and practices of designated actors, to shape behaviour or interactions in pursuit of a broad goal or outcome. This document explains Inland Revenue’s stewardship of those regulatory systems. Environmental context For Inland Revenue, good stewardship of the regulatory systems means developing policy and designing administrative processes that will protect the tax system, by taking into account the various factors that contribute to a good tax and social policy system. 1 In New Zealand, a good tax and social policy system is an essential part of our economy and society. The tax system is a major national asset. Taxes raise money to finance government spending. This is essential if New Zealand is to provide the healthcare, education and other government services that its citizens expect. A robust tax base and high levels of voluntary compliance are critical. At the same time Inland Revenue needs to have effective enforcement so that the minority of taxpayers who do not willingly comply are compelled to do so. Almost one third of New Zealand’s GDP is collected in tax. This is a major intervention in the economy, so it is important that the tax system works well. Taxes create costs. In addition to the revenue raised (which is a transfer from taxpayers to the Government) there will be a set of additional or “deadweight” costs. These include costs to taxpayers in complying with the tax system, costs to Inland Revenue in administering the tax system and distortionary costs to the economy because of the way that taxes can cause firms and individuals to do things that would not be sensible in the absence of tax. For example, taxes can discourage people from working as long or as hard as they would in the absence of tax or from investing in businesses. Taxes can cause firms to invest in inefficient ways of working. Over time, Inland Revenue has increasingly been used as an agency for delivering social policy programmes. Social policy measures administered by Inland Revenue also create compliance costs, administration costs and distortionary costs. Good policy will keep all of these costs to a minimum. Our operating environment We are continually evaluating our environment to identify existing and emerging trends, risks and opportunities. This allows us to be ready to respond, ensuring sustainable and successful delivery of our services. Historically, the New Zealand public sector operating environment has been relatively uniform and stable, with clear boundaries. However, the last few decades have seen global drivers of change affecting New Zealand in unprecedented ways. We recognise that our world is now characterised by diversity, volatility and permeability, and that new times require new responses. We must continue to maintain the integrity of the tax system as New Zealand’s population becomes more diverse, digitally connected, and mobile. Like all countries, New Zealand needs to respond to domestic and international threats to our revenue from tax avoidance and evasion, as well as wider change drivers such as technology-driven change and volatility in the global economy. New Zealand’s population is changing, with increasing numbers of migrants who have different service needs. Our ageing population will also have economic costs and will put pressure on our revenue base. 2 We will continue working to: • build our capability to identify and assess emerging trends; • challenge our assumptions about the future and apply insights about possible future scenarios to make better decisions today; • build agility within Inland Revenue, including speed and ability to shift resources; • make better connections between our futures thinking, decision-making, planning, policy design and implementation, and risk-assessment processes; and • rethink how we collaborate with other government agencies, the private sector, customers and stakeholders. At the same time, the Government’s Business Transformation programme aims to modernise our tax administration and make it easier for people to get their taxes right and difficult to get wrong. The programme will enable and support a refocus of our compliance approach from reactive enforcement to proactively facilitating compliance. There is an opportunity to design a customer-centric environment which enables compliant behaviour “right from the start”, rather than correcting non-compliant behaviour afterwards. An example of “right from the start” is the proposed change to Working for Families which will mean that income and entitlement will be determined more frequently, and therefore will reduce the need for reconciliation and adjustment. This provides greater household income certainty as well as reducing the administrative and compliance costs of the system. The environment (and supporting systems) will be shaped around better understanding of customer behaviour and lifecycles. We will seek to shape this behaviour by influencing customers’ capability, motivation and opportunities to comply. Improving services for New Zealanders We recognise that a connected, collaborative public sector can better serve New Zealanders’ needs in a number of ways. We also recognise that the information we have is a strategic asset that can be shared to benefit government and society. We want to improve our collective ability to serve our customers well. We do this through contributing to the Better Public Services programme (particularly, Result 9 and 10), the Digital Government framework, and by sharing information and working with other government agencies. The Business Transformation programme is a key initiative that will deliver on many of the outcomes sought through Better Public Services, as it will significantly reduce effort for New Zealanders and businesses, making it much easier to deal with government. It also contributes to the Government’s objective for more integrated public services. We are working closely with other government agencies to deliver the innovative and effective public services that government and our customers expect. We are linking more of our customer services with those of other government agencies to provide a seamless service. 3 Through information sharing we assist other government departments to access data which helps New Zealanders and the public service through more accurately targeted services and support. We protect customer privacy and the integrity of the tax system when considering the benefits of greater information sharing across government. 4 2. The purpose of this strategy In 2015, the Government asked seven of the main regulatory agencies 1 to publish annual assessments of the current state of their regulatory systems, plans for amendments to regulation and new regulation, and their views of important emerging issues for regulation. This regulatory management strategy explains how Inland Revenue will meet its regulatory stewardship responsibilities under the State Sector Act 1988. This is Inland Revenue’s second regulatory stewardship strategy. Inland Revenue’s responsibilities cover seven regulatory systems. Our largest regulatory system – revenue raising and collection – can be further broken down into sub-systems based on income tax and consumption tax. Inland Revenue carries out numerous common regulatory functions: • policy; • legislation; • service design; • service delivery; • information provision; • compliance and enforcement; • monitoring and evaluation; • performance reporting; and • adjudication and rulings In some of our regulatory systems, some functions are carried out by other agencies. Definitions • A regulatory system is a set of rules, norms and sanctions, given effect through the actions and practices of designated actors, to shape behaviour or interactions in pursuit of a broad goal or outcome. • A regulated party is a person or organisation that is subject to behavioural expectations, obligations and/or sanctions within a regulatory system. • A regulatory agency is any agency (other than courts, tribunals and other independent appeal bodies) that has any of the following responsibilities for the whole or part of a regulatory system: monitoring; evaluation; performance reporting; policy advice; policy and operational design; legislative design; implementation; administration; information provision; standard-setting; licensing and approvals; or compliance and enforcement. 1 Inland Revenue, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Ministry for the Environment, Ministry of Primary Industries, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Justice and the Department of Internal Affairs. 5 3. How Inland Revenue meets its stewardship obligations Inland Revenue has a number of mechanisms, tools and initiatives in place to meet its regulatory stewardship responsibilities. These allow us to take a proactive and collaborative approach to the on-going monitoring and care of those regulatory systems. Inland Revenue’s strategic direction Inland Revenue’s corporate strategy is made up of six strands, which guide us in planning, making essential shifts and managing risks. These strands cover our customers, our people, our place in a digital world, external collaboration, policy agility, and information and intelligence. The external collaboration strand guides us in working with others inside and outside of government. Customer centricity Being customer-centric means that we will help customers get it right from the start, this will improve the customer experience and reduce compliance cost and effort – so customers spend less time dealing with their tax and social policy obligations. Policy agility Policy agility is end- to-end policy that needs access to good information and insights to be more effective, responsive and evidence based. Improving our policy agility will mean that we are able to maintain our world class tax system in an increasingly complex and changing world. The Generic Tax Policy Process and tax policy work programme Tax policy is developed using the Generic Tax Policy Process. This process is designed to ensure better, more effective tax policy development and implementation through early consideration of all aspects – and likely impacts on customers – of policy proposals. One of the main features of the process is built-in consultat ion wit h affected parties and other interested parties. Consultation takes a variety of forms ranging from the release of a consultation document, to workshops to dialogue with the private sector through to co-design. Most importantly, one size does not fit all and the approach ultimately depends on the nature and extent of the policy change and who is affected. The tax policy work programme, which is owned and agreed to by the Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Finance and is developed with the Treasury, is Inland Revenue’s plan for the development, management and delivery of legislative change. The highest priority improvements are reflected in the tax policy work programme, and include remedial changes and the routine regulatory updates we manage. We maintain a regulat ions register. 6 The Government tax policy work programme covers three broad areas: • Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, including Better Public Services; • international tax and base erosion and profit shifting; and • further improvements and enhancements to tax and social policy within the broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) policy framework. See Section Five for more information on the Generic Tax Policy Process and the tax policy work programme. News and information about the tax policy work programme is available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. Regulatory impact analysis We have a panel of experienced analysts available to help policy staff meet the Government’s regulatory impact analysis requirements, and to conduct independent quality assurance reviews of regulatory impact assessments (where they are not reviewed by Treasury’s Regulatory Qualit y Team). The panel assists policy staff wit h preparing regulatory impact assessments and national interest analysis’ (for tax treaties). Where quality assurance reviews are carried out by Inland Revenue, two panel members not involved in the project will confirm whether the regulatory impact assessment meets the quality assurance criteria. We also use external policy consultants to review the quality of our policy advice, to help us improve our processes and advice. Policy impact assessment We have a formalised policy impact assessment process to ensure that policy advice is supported by realistic and well thought through advice on the implementation costs and benefits of a proposed change. A specialised service design team determines whether or not a proposed change should be analysed for system impacts. When an analysis is undertaken it includes all parts of Inland Revenue that may be affected by the change. The policy impact analysis is signed off by the senior managers from each area that are involved in the analysis. This ensures that policy analysis appropriately reflects the implementation costs and risks when decisions are made. This also ensures that implementation colleagues fully understand pending change. 7 Connecting policy design and implementation Since 2006, Inland Revenue has had a dedicated service design team (Government Solutions) working alongside the policy design team, fostering a customer focus from the start and strengthening policy design and implementation links. Having policy and service design officials working throughout the Generic Tax Policy Process creates a better outcome. Engagement on the proposals to make provisional tax simpler and easy for business customers (in this case, small and medium enterprises), is a good example of co- design. It was clear from the outset that the simplest solution would be to incorporate provisional tax into the natural business cadence of business customers. To this end, software developers of the accounting packages used by business customers were invited to work alongside policy and design officials. This arrangement enabled software developers to be involved in every step of the policy and design process, which involved testing of both policy and implementation options, and technical input into the draft legislation. In addition, working parties and an oversight group comprising private sector representatives were established to provide governance and guidance to the co-design team. The resulting outcome is an industry-led solution that will meet the needs of business customers. Continuous improvement An emphasis on continuous improvement is crucial for becoming an organisation using intelligence for providing services better targeted to our customers. There are three key areas of focus which are interlinked, each crucial to the effectiveness and sustainability of a continuous improvement culture. The areas of focus are: • leadership thinking and behaviours that create and foster the culture, as reflected in Inland Revenue’s leadership dimensions; • management systems to highlight, understand and deliver business performance; and • the tools and technical capability to solve problems which deliver increased measurable value to our customers. Over the past three years we have had a dedicated continuous improvement team wit h the main objectives of growing continuous capability and leading improvement initiatives that have delivered increased value to the customer. We have seen over 130 frontline customer teams trained to solve problems in a structured way that add value to the customer. The outcome has been a self-sufficient business group that continue to identify and implement improvement initiatives, which results in on-going value being created for our customers. 8 Business Transformation programme Our mult i-year, mult i-stage Business Transformation programme is currently under way and reflects Inland Revenue’s acknowledgement that its processes and systems, and in some cases the legislation, limit its capability to meet the future requirements the Government may have of the tax system and the social policies Inland Revenue administers. We’re making it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. The capability that is being developed through Business Transformation addresses the expectations of good regulatory practise, and will improve the agility of Inland Revenue to develop and implement the regulatory changes required by government. See Section Five for more information. Modernising the Tax Administration Act – case study We are working to simplify and modernise the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The TAA centres on the rights and obligations of taxpayers, including the records that need to be kept, providing information, interpreting the law and reconciling any different interpretation by Inland Revenue, assessing and amending liabilities, paying and filing on time, and penalties arising from default. The current tax administration system in New Zealand relies heavily on primary legislation, as predominately reflected in the TAA. This means the rules are slow to adapt, and inflexible for different types of taxpayers. Our proposals released in December 2016 for consultation, include potential changes to the role of the Commissioner and design of a new TAA. They are: • Extending the care and management provision to allow the Commissioner some greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. • Allowing a greater use of regulations for tax administration, including: – allowing for a more tailored approach to different types of taxpayers; and – allowing trials of tax administration processes to be carried out. • Amending the structure of the TAA to reflect the modernised tax administration, including basing the Act around core provisions. • Moving to a more hierarchical approach to drafting the TAA, including a greater use of principles when appropriate. Accessible legislation We are currently actively working with the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) on the Access to Subordinate Instruments Project. Inland Revenue and the PCO have, so far, analysed the main Revenue Acts and identified potential subordinate instruments that may be legislative in nature and that may appropriately fall within the project. Once these provisions have been further reviewed and finalised, we will be looking at the need (and potential timing) for affected legislation to be confirmed and published on the New Zealand Legislation website. 9 We are active in the Government Regulatory Practice Initiative, which is a network of government regulatory agencies that lead and contribute to regulatory practice initiatives. With this network we improve leadership, culture, regulatory practice and workforce capability in regulatory organisations and systems. Compliance Compliance for Inland Revenue is when customers pay the taxes and get the entitlements they should. Our compliance model helps us understand our customers better. The more we understand customer needs and behaviours, the better we can tailor our actions to facilitate compliance. The compliance model shows us what makes up customer behaviour and provides a set of principles to help tailor the activities we use. Customer behaviour is more than attitude. A combination of capability, opportunity and motivation make up compliance behaviour – we can be more proactive and use different approaches to help customers comply. Right from the start As Inland Revenue transforms, we are changing how we work with customers. We are shifting our compliance approach to be more proactive and make it simpler and more certain for customers. We want to help customers get it right from the start, rather than correcting them when they get it wrong. Strategic direction for compliance Our approach to customers is increasingly flexible and adaptive. We understand more about outside factors that influence compliance, such as social marketing and system design. We want to give our customers certainty with the least number of interactions and we want our customer connections to be correct the first time. And we will be able to appeal to different customer groups in ways they can relate to. Adjudication and Rulings Public rulings The Office of the Chief Tax Counsel produces public statements on particular tax or social policy issues of interpretative uncertainty. These statements assist compliance by providing certainty and predictability to external tax advisers (our primary audience), taxpayers and internal staff. Our aim is to ensure that Inland Revenue provides legally accurate and consistent guidance. We consult on our items both internally and externally before finalising them. Taxpayer rulings The Office of the Chief Tax Counsel is responsible for the taxpayer rulings process. Taxpayer rulings are binding rulings that apply to a specific taxpayer or transaction, in particular private rulings and product rulings. Taxpayer rulings also include certain 10 advance pricing agreements (APAs), status rulings and financial arrangements determinations. Disputes review The Office of the Chief Tax Counsel acts as the final step in Inland Revenue's formal disputes resolution process before possible litigation. The key function is to take a fresh look at a dispute, providing an independent and impartial decision on the issues in the dispute. This role involves impartially considering the correct legal position after comprehensive research and analysis of the law. Information from our compliance and adjudication and rulings work is used to identify problems and loopholes in current systems. Inland Revenue publishes Tax Information Bulletins which include information about changes to tax-related legislation, proposed legislation, judgements, rulings and other specialist tax topics. Inland Revenue provides these bulletins as a service to people with an interest in New Zealand taxation. Future steps We will publish a revised regulatory stewardship strategy once Ministers confirm the next tax policy work programme after the 2017 general election. The programme is published online as soon as it is agreed. Our stakeholders are involved in the consultation process when we renew or update the published programme every 18 months. 11 4. Inland Revenue’s regulatory systems This section sets out Inland Revenue’s regulatory systems and the “fit -for-purpose” assessments for each of these. These assessments were completed by Inland Revenue. Other agencies have been given an opportunity to comment where relevant and appropriate. We anticipate including further multi-agency input and stakeholder views to our updated fitness-for-purpose assessments in the next strategy. There are seven systems: • Revenue raising and collection, with two sub-systems – income tax and consumption tax; • Working for Families tax credits; • Child support; • KiwiSaver; • Student loans; • Paid parental leave; and • Information sharing. In some of our regulatory systems, some regulatory functions are carried out by other agencies. The fit-for-purpose assessments cover four dimensions: • Effectiveness – To what extent does the system deliver the intended outcomes and impacts? • Efficiency – To what extent does the system minimise unintended consequences and undue costs and burdens? • Durability and resilience – How well does the system cope with variation, change and pressures? • Fairness and accountability – How well does the system respect rights and deliver good process? The fit-for-purpose assessments of the regulatory systems were completed by Inland Revenue subject matter experts. Where possible, these assessments have drawn on research, international comparisons and information held by Inland Revenue. As appropriate these assessments were tested with other participants in those regulatory systems. Over time, as the Business Transformation progresses and information and analysis processes (including information sharing) are developed, Inland Revenue will refine its regulatory system assessments. See Section Six for the current projects on the tax policy work programme and the regulatory systems they relate to. 12 Diagram 1: Inland Revenue regulatory systems – system and function view Diagram 2: Customers of Working for Families tax credits, student loans, and child support PolicyLe gis lationService designService delivery Information provision Compliance and enforcement M onitoring and evaluation Pe rformance re porting Adjudication and rulings C us to ms TreasuryTreasury MSD TreasuryTreasury TreasuryTreasury C us to ms M in Ed uM in Ed u MBIEMBIE Inland Revenue Inland Revenue Inland Revenue MSD Inland Revenue MSD Inland Revenue MBIE MBIE MBIE Paid pare ntal leave KiwiSave r Stude nt loans Working for Familie s tax cre dits Child s upport MSD Inland Revenue Inland Revenue Revenue rais ing and colle ction MSD 13 Revenue raising and collection System description Inland Revenue designs and collects taxes on income from employment, investment and business conducted in New Zealand and from the consumption of goods and services in New Zealand. This revenue of around $60 billion per annum funds approximately 80 percent of government activity each year. The income tax system also has a distribution and fairness element and in this there is a degree of overlap with the Working for Families system. All New Zealanders directly or indirectly interact with the tax system throughout their lives. For most, this is a minimal interaction through the deduction of Pay As You Earn (PAYE) withholding tax from salary or wages, resident withholding tax (RWT) from interest, or as GST is collected by a vendor at the point of sale of a good or service. More complex interactions with the tax system are experienced by businesses that may be subject to fringe benefit tax or company tax. Taxpayers who have more complex interactions with the tax system are represented by sophisticated stakeholder advocates, including: • Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; • New Zealand Law Society; • Corporate Taxpayers Group; • New Zealand Bankers Association; and • Financial Services Council. The tax system comprises a series of specific taxes, each of which is authorised by legislation. Though these can be analysed separately (and the two core elements are described below as sub-systems), it is important to recognise that a goal is for the tax system as a whole to operate coherently. The fit -for-purpose assessment for the revenue raising and collection system covers: • the overall tax system; • the income tax sub-system; and • the consumption tax sub-system. 14 The overall tax system Key legislation Income Tax Act 2007 Tax Administration Act 1994 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Gaming Duties Act 1971 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 System agencies Inland Revenue (Policy and Delivery) Treasury (Policy) New Zealand Customs Service (Deliver – some GST collection) Department of Internal Affairs Effectiveness New Zealand’s tax system provides reliable sources of revenue to fund Government programmes. New Zealand’s tax revenue amounts to around 30 percent of GDP. A key element in a good tax system is having a coherent framework. This ensures all the different parts of the system operate in support of each other. New Zealand’s broad-base low- rate (BBLR) tax framework provides a coherent approach. The coherent policy framework is supported by good administration. New Zealand is ranked within the top 10 OECD countries for ease of paying taxes. Efficiency New Zealand collects about 90 percent of its tax revenue from the three core taxes (personal, company and GST). New Zealand does not have taxes on transactions or turnover, such as stamp duty and cheque duty, which international tax reviews have identified as being particularly inefficient. As noted, New Zealand’s tax system is based on a broad-base, low- rate framework. The advantage of broad bases is they ensure taxes are able to raise the required amount of revenue without resorting to high rates of taxation. This minimises the extent by which taxes distort economic activity and do as little as possible to impede economic growth. Low rates minimise deadweight losses and also minimise incentives for non-compliance. Despite not having the economies of scale of most other developed economies, the New Zealand tax system operates efficiently in terms of administrative costs per dollar of revenue collected. International comparisons also suggest New Zealand imposes low compliance costs on taxpayers. The 2016 survey of tax compliance for SMEs indicated the costs of compliance had fallen by approximately 25 percent since the previous survey in 2013. Tax policy is developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is an open and interactive process whereby private sector representatives, particularly tax practitioners, are able to provide input into policies and policy design to remedy problems and improve implementation. Durability and resilience The BBLR framework is very durable. It was introduced in the mid- 1980s replacing a highly distortionary system with patchy application and some very high rates. Since then there has been buy-in from the public and successive tax reviews have supported the BBLR 15 framework. Leading tax practitioners with experience in New Zealand and overseas have commented on the very different nature of tax debates in New Zealand and other countries because of a lack of clear policy frameworks in other countries. A clear framework promotes compliance because it helps courts to decide what is and what is not avoidance. International surveys have indicated New Zealand’s tax system is perceived as more consistent and predictable than most other countries. Though the overall framework has been stable, tax policy has evolved to reflect Government priorities, new interpretations of the law, innovations in business practice, tax policy d evelopments in other countries and concerns of key stakeholders. Inland Revenue publishes and periodically updates its tax policy work programme which sets out the issues which will be worked on over the coming 1–2 years. The tax policy work programme (see Section Six) reflects the fact that to be resilient the tax system needs ongoing maintenance and enhancement. Fairness and accountability The GTPP provides the private sector with opportunity to influence tax policy. This has contributed to open and constructive policy debates, which is a hallmark of the New Zealand tax system. The disputes resolution process is designed to ensure that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case proceeds to a court. 16 The income tax sub-system System description The income tax system has two objectives: to raise revenue and to redistribute income through the use of a progressive tax scale. Individual income tax is the largest component of New Zealand’s tax system. It collects approximately 40 percent of New Zealand’s tax revenues. Most of the personal income tax is collected through employers deducting employees’ tax through the PAYE system. For many workers, the amount of tax deducted is accurate and they have no need to file a tax return at year end. Self-employed workers pay their tax either by having tax deducted through schedular arrangements or by paying provisional tax throughout their income year. Company income tax raises around 15 percent of total tax revenue. The company income tax system is designed to be a backstop for taxing the personal income of domestic investors. Company income tax is 28%, but New Zealand-based investors can claim imputation credits for tax paid by the company when the income is taxed upon distribution at the personal level. At the same time, the company tax is designed as a final tax on the New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors. Individual income tax Effectiveness The recently published OECD Report Taxing Wages 2015–16 pointed to New Zealand’s personal tax system being effective at raising revenue while maintaining relatively low tax rates and therefore minimising distortions. The personal tax collection as a percentage of GDP in New Zealand is 12.6 percent – the 5 th highest in the OECD. At the same time, New Zealand has low tax wedges – that is, low average tax rates. The tax wedge varies according to family composition and interaction with the progressive tax scale. Across a range of family types and income levels examined by the OECD, New Zealand has low tax wedges compared with OECD countries. For instance, for single workers on the average wage with no dependents, the tax wedge in New Zealand is 17.9 percent. This is the second lowest in the OECD. The OECD average is 36 percent. For a family with one earner on the average wage and two dependent children, the tax wedge in New Zealand falls to 6.2 percent because of Working for Families tax credits. This is the lowest rate in the OECD. The OECD average is 26.6 percent. This outcome – low wedges but high levels of revenue – reflects the absence of allowances or dispensations and relatively good compliance by taxpayers. Individual income tax, in combination with the transfer system, redistributes income. By one measure of redistribution or progressivity, namely the extent by which the average tax wedge grows as income grows, New Zealand is slightly more progressive than the OECD average. An alternative approach is the extent to which the tax and transfer 17 system reduces inequality. OECD data indicates that New Zealand reduces a standard measure of inequality, the Gini coefficient, by slightly less than the OECD average. Efficiency The extent by which taxes produce deadweight losses is influenced by average and marginal tax rates. In terms of average tax rates, as described above, the New Zealand system performs well. This is also the case for marginal tax rates; New Zealand’s highest marginal tax rate of 33% is relatively low by international standards. However, because of the interaction with the transfer system, some low-middle income taxpayers face higher effective marginal tax rates because of the combined impact of benefit abatement and personal taxation. The PAYE system provides an efficient means of collecting tax because compliance sits with the (relatively) few employers rather than the more numerous employees. The provisional tax system for self- employed is more onerous; Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation is creating opportunities for these processes to become easier for taxpayers by taking into account business cash flow and leveraging off accounting systems. New Zealand’s broad income tax base allows a lower rate, which increases efficiency. Expanding the base further, to include (for example) capital gains could allow a further reduction in income tax rates over time, but efficiency gains from lower rates have to be balanced against efficiency costs of realisation-based capital gains taxes themselves (for example, the lock-in of assets due to a desire to defer realisation through sale) and the high administrative cost of a capital gains system. Durability and resilience New Zealand’s personal tax system and collection through the PAYE system is long-standing. The system is amenable to periodic adjustments, such as the changes to tax thresholds introduced in the 2017 Budget. Fairness and accountability Generally, taxpayers with similar levels of income will pay similar amounts of tax, irrespective of the source of that income. One partial exception is that income earned as a capital gain is generally not taxed. Successive reviews of the New Zealand tax system have noted this gap but also noted the significant complications of a capital gains tax and consequently not recommended one be adopted. For most individuals, tax is deducted through the PAYE system. For those with stable incomes throughout the year, this produces an accurate deduction of tax and many such taxpayers do not need to file an annual return. For taxpayers with variable income, or those who are self-employed and pay tax through the provisional tax system, tax deductions are not as certain or reliable. However, all such taxpayers are required to square up their tax after the year-end, so taxpayers with identical total income will face identical tax obligations however the income is earned. This approach does create compliance for employers however this is the most efficient approach overall for the economy as the total cost of compliance would be significantly higher and accuracy would be significantly lower if all individuals completed their own income tax calculations. 18 Company tax Effectiveness To support the domestic personal tax system, the company rate should ideally be aligned to the top personal tax rate. In New Zealand this is almost but not fully achieved; the company rate being five percentage points below the top marginal tax rate. New Zealand, however, also has to consider how its company tax rate compares with that of other countries. This is because multinational companies will have incentives to allocate their expenses to countries with higher tax rates and their profits to countries with lower tax rates. Around the world, there is a downwards trend in company rates and New Zealand now sits above the OECD average, thereby creating pressure for New Zealand’s rate to reduce. However, in addition to the revenue implications, a lower company tax rate would widen the gap with the top marginal rate for personal income. Efficiency New Zealand’s dividend imputation system prevents company income from being double taxed (for New Zealand investors). In addition the (reasonably) close alignment of the comp any tax rate with the highest personal rate means that there is little incentive for incorporation decisions to be driven by tax considerations. In other words, the tax system is not driving economic choices, an outcome which is likely to be efficiency-enhancing. As a final tax on New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors, the efficiency of the tax is related to the level of location-specific “economic rents” (that is, above-normal returns) earned by those investors. If foreign investors are earning above-normal returns, taxing them is an efficient source of revenue because the tax does not discourage investment. If they are not earning above-normal returns then the tax will lower investment in New Zealand , which will ultimately be borne by New Zealanders in the form of lower wages or higher consumer prices. Inland Revenue’s view is that there are location-specific rents being earned by foreign investors and so taxing them is a relatively efficient way of raising revenue. Durability and resilience New Zealand is a participant in the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) initiatives. These initiatives aim to ensure multinationals pay tax in the countries where their economic (as opposed to accounting) profits are earned. Fairness and accountability Taxing income at the company level increases fairness because it means that individuals are less able to defer taxation by holding assets or earning income in a company. For policy reasons there are a number of income tax exemptions (for example, registered charities). See also the comments in the assessment for the revenue raising and collection system. 19 The consumption tax sub-system System description The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a tax on goods and services consumed in New Zealand, which is borne by the final consumer. It is levied at the rate of 15%. It is primarily administered by Inland Revenue. However, the New Zealand Customs Service administers GST levied on goods imported into New Zealand. Effectiveness GST raises about 30 percent of New Zealand’s tax revenue. The tax is a very effective revenue raising instrument. The rate of 15% is amongst the lowest in the OECD yet the amount of revenue raised, as a proportion of GDP, is amongst the highest for that same group of countries. This is a good example of how the BBLR framework applies in practice. New Zealand applies GST comprehensively, with very few exemptions or concessions. The main gap in this regulatory system is the importation of low value goods, which are currently exempt from GST. This is currently being considered in conjunction with Customs. The GST has an economic effect of taxing all labour income at 15%, making it a flat rather than progressive tax. This is an example where fairness needs to be considered in the context of the entire tax system rather than individual taxes, as the progressive elements of New Zealand’s tax system are introduced through the personal tax and transfer system. Efficiency The GST compliance gap is an estimate of the shortfall in GST collection compared with what one could expect based on the Department of Statistics measurement of consumption expenditure. New Zealand’s compliance gap appears to be in the 2–4 percent range, which is lower than that estimated in other comparable countries. Durability and resilience GST is durable as it has been in place for 30 years. In that time, the rate has been increased twice. It is a well-regarded scheme because its comprehensiveness and simplicity assist compliance and administration. Fairness and accountability See comment in the revenue raising and collection assessment. 20 Working for Families tax credits System description Working for Families is a package designed to help make it easier to work and raise a family. It pays extra money to many thousands of New Zealand families. Greater financial support is available for: • almost all families with children, earning under $70,000 a year; • many families with children, earning up to $100,000 a year; and • some larger families earning more. There are four types of tax credits: • family tax credit; • in-work tax credit; • minimum family tax credit; and • parental tax credit. Inland Revenue administers the programme jointly with the Ministry of Social Development. In the 2015–16 financial year, we distributed $2.4 billion in entitlements to support families. Key legislation Income Tax Act 2007 System agencies Inland Revenue (Policy and Delivery) Treasury (Policy) Ministry of Social Development (Policy and Delivery) Effectiveness The Working for Families tax credit system (WfF) is generally effective in providing low to middle income families with regular payments. Payments are easy to apply for and the majority of services are available online either through Inland Revenue or MSD. Around 70 percent of New Zealand families with dependent children receive Working for Families tax credits either through Inland Revenue or MSD. In order to receive regular payments families must estimate their anticipated earnings for the coming tax year – this can be difficult and an incorrect estimate can lead to either over or under payment of entitlements. Families can avoid this risk by opting to receive their payments at the end of the year, however this undermines the intent of WfF which is to provide support when it is needed. Changes proposed as part of the social policy Business Transformation project aim to remove this uncertainty by replacing the income estimate and instead calculating WfF entitlements based on recent, actual income. The amount of child support a person pays or receives will increase or lower (respectively) their income for Working for Families which may then lower or increase (respectively) their WfF entitlements. Efficiency The shared delivery model with MSD has advantages in that it allows beneficiaries to deal only with MSD with regards to their entitlements, but also disadvantages in that it necessitates 21 information shares between the departments as well as complexity for families coming off or going on benefit. The current WfF system generates a high level of low value contacts from families trying to estimate their income and dealing with the consequences of incorrect estimates. In 2015–16, 99.3 percent of WfF tax credit payments were made on the first regular payment date following an application. Durability and resilience WfF rates and eligibility rules are contained within the Income Tax Act 2007. The ability the system has to respond to changes in the environment is limited by the legislative process. To date this has not proved to be an impediment as generally information technology system changes require a longer lead in than the normal bill processes allows. Both Inland Revenue's and MSD's transformation programmes aim to provide a more responsive operating systems that can be quickly updated which will allow Government to react faster to environmental changes. Fairness and accountability Having the WfF rules in legislation provides a high level of transparency as all of the criteria and entitlement rates are publicly available. However, one consequence of having the rules in legislation is that they do not always cater to unusual or exceptional circumstances, which can mean in rare cases the law, as written, does not achieve the desired policy outcome. Changes proposed as part of the social policy Business Transformation project aim to introduce some flexibility by allowing the Commissioner limited discretion in how to apply the law when dealing with unusual or exceptional circumstances. The Generic Tax Policy Process ensures that any changes to the rules are subject, where possible, to robust public consultation prior to the introduction of any legislative amendment. 22 Child support System description The child support scheme makes sure that: • parents take financial responsibility for their children; and • financial contributions from liable parents help to offset the cost of benefits that support their children. Inland Revenue collects child support payments. In the 2015–16 financial year, we collected $474 million from 170,000 liable parents who pay child support and distributed $280 million to carers. The balance goes to the Crown to offset sole parent benefits paid to custodial pare nts by the Ministry of Social Development. Key legislation Child Support Act 1991 System agencies Inland Revenue (Policy and Delivery) Ministry of Social Development (Policy and Delivery) Effectiveness Child Support is a compulsory regime for beneficiaries and an optional regime for parents who are unable or do not want to come to a private arrangement. Child Support is assessed using annual income information from the previous calendar year or two tax years ago. This means that parents and ca rers know what payments they will have to make or what they might receive. However, there are some issues. Payments based on old income information may not reflect the current ability of each parent to contribute to the cost of raising a child. Changes proposed as part of the social policy Business Transformation project aim to make child support assessments better reflect the ability of the liable parent to pay and the receiving carer's need for support at the time by basing assessments on more recent income information. The child support formula considers each parent’s income and the amount of care they have for each of their children. While the regime works well for most situations, the definition of income is based off concepts from tax legislation. This can mean that some people are able to artificially reduce their income for child support by taking advantage of structures like trusts and companies or transactions such as loans and fringe benefits. Changes proposed as part of the social policy Business Transformation project would broaden the definition of income used so that it encompasses a wider range of incomes that, while they may not be taxable, are available to the parent and should be taken into account in assessing their ability to contribute to the costs of the child. The amount of child support a person pays or receives will increase or lower (respectively) their income for Working for Families which may then lower or increase (respectively) their WfF entitlements. Efficiency The current system uses the PAYE deduction regime for income tax to deduct child support obligations from liable parents who either elect to have them or who have fallen into arrears. Once a 23 payment is made by the liable parent, it can take a while to get to the receiving parent or carer. It is proposed that liable parents who receive salary, wages or contracting income subject to withholding tax would be required to have child support deductions. This would help those parents meet their obligations automatically and reduce the number of liable parents falling into debt. Once payments are received they will be able to be immediately passed on to the receiving carer. The system is most efficient when the liable parent is New Zealand based as it can leverage off the in formation received through the PAYE system and other elements of the tax system. Once a liable parent leaves New Zealand there are a number of arrangements and agreements between countries to support the collection of child support obligations. In 2015–16, 80.2 percent of child support assessments were issued within two weeks (the target is 80 percent). Durability and resilience The child support regime is contained within the Child Support Act 1991. The ability the system has to respond to changes in the environment is limited by the legislative process. To date this has not proved to be an impediment as generally information technology system changes require a longer lead in that the normal bill processes allows. Inland Revenue's transformation programme aims to provide a more responsive system that can be quickly updated which will allow Government to react faster to environmental changes. Fairness and accountability All the criteria and entitlement rates for child support are set out in legislation. This provides a high degree of transparency. However, one consequence of having the rules in legislation is that they do not always cater to unusual or exceptional circumstances, which can mean in rare cases the law, as written, does not achieve the desired policy outcome. Changes proposed as part of the social policy Business Transformation project aim to introduce some flexibility by allowing the Commissioner limited discretion in how to apply the law when dealing with unusual or exceptional circumstances. The Generic Tax Policy Process ensures that any changes to the rules are subject, where possible, to robust public consultation before the introduction of any legislative amendment. There are also a number of different kinds of independent reviews av ailable to parents who believe that their specific circumstances have not been taken into account. These reviews are based on Family Court processes and are contracted to independent review officers. Following the recent reform of the child support regime, which made changes to improve the fairness of assessments by looking at the incomes of both parents, Inland Revenue has undertaken research to measure whether these reforms have changed people's perspectives of the regime. Taken as a whole there was a slight increase in customers’ perceptions that the child support system is fair. 24 KiwiSaver System description KiwiSaver helps individuals save for retirement. Under the scheme, savings are accumulated through a combination of employee and employer contributions, and the member tax credit (an annual contribution by the Government to eligible members, aimed at incentivising saving). Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) are jointly responsible for administering the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Inland Revenue collects contributions and transfers them to scheme providers for investment. In the 2015–16 financial year we transferred approximately $5 billion to scheme providers. As at 30 June 2016 there were appro ximately 2.64 million people enrolled in KiwiSaver. This assessment does not account for the areas of KiwiSaver legislation MBIE is responsible for administering. Key legislation KiwiSaver Act 2006 System agencies Inland Revenue (Policy and Delivery) Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Policy and Delivery) The Treasury (Policy) KiwiSaver scheme providers Effectiveness KiwiSaver is an opt-out savings vehicle designed to make it easier for New Zealanders to save for their retirement. With over 2.64 million members KiwiSaver is now the primary way most New Zealanders save for their retirement. However, while KiwiSaver membership is high the majority of members only contribute funds at the minimum rate of 3%t. (For the 2015–16 year approximately 66 percent of employees were making contributions at a rate of 3%.) In 2015 approximately 119,200 members were on a contribution holiday. There are also concerns about members who have been on contribution holidays for over five years (meaning no contributions have been made to their KiwiSaver fund during this time), and members who do not contribute enough to receive the full member tax credit entitlement. Inland Revenue and MBIE are currently working on policy initiatives aiming to encourage members to increase their level of contributions, and therefore to increase the funds members will have accumulated to support themselves in retirement. 25 Efficiency KiwiSaver acts as a low-cost managed retirement saving vehicle. As employee contributions are made concurrent with PAYE deductions, KiwiSaver is convenient and does not have compliance costs for members. KiwiSaver is currently broadly available to New Zealand residents up to the age of 65. And as part of the policy increasing the New Zealand Superannuation age, the Government has agreed to remove the upper age limit for KiwiSaver membership. Inland Revenue aims to be efficient in its administration of KiwiSaver. Contributions for existing members are transferred to scheme providers in under a month, and it is anticipated this time will be further decreased as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Durability and resilience KiwiSaver legislation is principally contained in the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Therefore, the initiative’s ability to react to environmental and economic changes is affected by the length of the legislative amendment process. However, to date this has not generally been an issue. Any significant changes to KiwiSaver policy settings generally require system changes that have a longer lead in time than the average bill process. KiwiSaver scheme providers offer a choice of fund types, with varying degrees of risk and return. This, along with the ability for members to go on contribution holidays, adds a degree of flexibility to the scheme and considers the current financial situation and long-term savings needs of individual members. Fairness and accountability The KiwiSaver regime is set out in legislation. This provides a high degree of transparency. In addition, information about KiwiSaver (including statistical analysis, which is updated monthly) is publicly available on the Inland Revenue’s KiwiSaver website. Each of the nine default KiwiSaver providers also have websites where information can be publicly accessed. Members can make complaints about Inland Revenue’s administration of KiwiSaver by following Inland Revenue’s complaints process, which is outlined on the Inland Revenue website. Scheme providers are subject to accountability mechanisms set out in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. 26 Student loans System description Student loans make tertiary study more accessible to a wide range of people so that they may gain the knowledge and skills that enhance the economic and social well-being of New Zealanders. Inland Revenue jointly administers the student loan scheme with the Ministry of Social Development (StudyLink). The Ministry of Education is the lead agency for student loans and is responsible for strategic policy advice, forecasting demand and costing the scheme. The Ministry of Education sets the policy parameters within the context of the New Zealand tertiary education system and the goals of the Tertiary Education Strategy. StudyLink assesses loan eligibility and entitlement and makes student loan payments. Inland Revenue maintains student loan accounts after the loan is transferred from the Ministry of Social Development. Inland Revenue collects student loan repayments and ensures repayment obligations are met by borrowers. There were 731,754 borrowers at 30 June 2016 and Inland Revenue collected $1.2 billion in repayments in the 2015–16 financial year. This assessment is limited to Inland Revenue’s responsibility for administering the legislation, particularly repayments and compliance with obligations. The Ministry of Education, as the lead agency with overall responsibility for the student loan scheme, and the Ministry of Social Development have reviewed this assessment. Key legislation Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 System agencies Inland Revenue (Delivery) Ministry of Education (Policy) Ministry of Social Development/StudyLink (Delivery) Effectiveness Since the student loan scheme began in 1992, students have borrowed $23,146 million and loan repayments of $11,480 million have been collected ($1,208.8 million in the 2015–16 year). Nearly 450,000 borrowers have repaid their loans since the scheme began. Compliance with repayment obligations is high for New Zealand- based borrowers – only four percent were in default at 30 June 2016. However; 73 percent of overseas-based borrowers were in default at that time. Consequently, measures to improve compliance of overseas-based borrowers are a continuing focus. Efficiency The efficiency of the system in respect of collection of repayments from New Zealand-based borrowers arises through the low compliance costs imposed on borrowers who are wage and salary earners. Their repayments are assessed and collected by employers concurrently with PAYE. Opportunities to improve collections from New Zealand-based borrowers who are not wage or salary earners have been identified and are in included in the discussion document Making tax simpler – Better administration of social policy, released in 27 July 2017. The efficiency of collections from overseas-based borrowers has shown significant improvement through a range of initiatives implemented progressively since 2010; the most recent being the match of student loan borrowers against the Australian Taxation Office database of taxpayers. Continued improvement is anticipated from new operational initiatives, such as a focus on establishing contact with borrowers who have left New Zealand, but are not yet treated as overseas-based borrowers, to ensure they are aware of their changed obligations and assist them to maintain repayments. Durability and resilience The system is subject to active oversight, through a scheme-wide approach to student loans, with lead Ministers and a virtual student loan agency. The Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment is responsible for policy and the Minister of Revenue is responsible for the end-to -end operation of the student loan scheme, from lending to repayments. The lead official of the cross-agency group takes an overall view of the scheme’s effectiveness and is accountable to Ministers for its overall effectiveness Joint ministers meet quarterly. The three agencies with administrative responsibilities meet fortnightly to ensure early identification of emerging trends and development of appropriate responses. Fairness and accountability Borrowers can access information on each of the agency websites, which contain cross-links to relevant information. In addition, Inland Revenue continuously reviews the effectiveness of its direct marketing strategies to establish and maintain contact with overseas-based borrowers. Rights of objection, to challenge and to disputes procedures are set out in law. Details of these rights are also set out on both the Inland Revenue and StudyLink websites. Inland Revenue’s drive to improve the compliance of overseas- based borrowers will help to address a perceived lack of fairness when borrowers leave New Zealand for an extended period and choose not to continue loan repayments. 28 Paid parental leave System description Paid parental leave replaces a proportion of an employee's income from employment when they take parental leave. Paid parental leave payments are subject to PAYE deductions for income tax, student loan repayments and child support. Inland Revenue makes payments for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. In the 2015–16 financial year, we made $217 million in payments to 26,300 parents. The assessment below is limited to Inland Revenue’s agency role of responsibility for processing applicatio ns and making payments. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment were given an opportunity to contribute. Key legislation Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 System agencies Inland Revenue (Delivery) Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Policy) Effectiveness There were 2,222 new applications for paid parental leave (PPL) in May 2017 and 2,897 applications processed in the same period. A high number of complaints (54) in the 2016 calendar year (and first five months of 2017) reflected a deficiency in the law which has been corrected with effect from 1 June 2017. Statistics for May 2017 indicate awareness of the availability of PPL across all ethnicities and industry types. In that month the majority of applicants had weekly income between $770–$960. Efficiency In 2015–16, 97.8 percent of PPL payments were issued to customers on the first regular pay day following the agreed date of entitlement (target was 97 percent). The payments are made through a payroll-type system, which makes it possible to make child support, student loan and KiwiSaver deductions at the customer’s request. Inland Revenue’s processes for handling annual adjustments to rates are set to be highly responsive. For instance it was possible to fully implement the new rates effective from 1 July 2017 after being notified of the rates on only 31 May 2017. Durability and resilience Paid parental leave is included in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s employment relations and standards regulatory system. Fairness and accountability The primary source of information about eligibility for PPL is the MBIE website. However, the Inland Revenue website also contains basic information about eligibility, when and how to apply. 29 Information sharing System description The sharing of information between Inland Revenue and other agencies improves the effectiveness and efficiency of government. There are tensions between tax secrecy and cross-government information sharing. This tension has resulted in the Tax Administration Act having a number of legislated exceptions to tax secrecy to enable either the sharing of information from Inland Revenue to other agencies, or both the receiving of information from and sharing of information to other agencies to ensure the efficient and effective administration of the tax system. Inland Revenue’s tax secrecy rule is set out in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and requires all Inland Revenue officers to “maintain, and assist in maintaining, the secrecy of all matters relating to” the Inland Revenue Acts. The confidentiality of tax information is important for three reasons: • to balance Inland Revenue’s wide information-gathering powers; • to promote voluntary compliance, whereby taxpayers are comfortable providing information to Inland Revenue if they know the information will not be disclosed further; and • to maintain the integrity of the tax system, as tax secrecy is a critical component of the integrity of the tax system. Key legislation Tax Administration Act 1994 Sections 81 to 89 and 143C, 143D and 143E System agencies Multiple agencies – see diagram 3. Recently Inland Revenue has also begun sharing information with: • credit reporting agencies – sharing significant debt information on non-compliant taxpayers with Centrix Group Ltd, Dun & Bradstreet, and Equifax; and • the Companies Office – sharing information on taxpayers who commit serious offences under the Companies Act 1993. Effectiveness The effective administration of the New Zealand tax system relies on taxpayers’ voluntary compliance. Critical to this compliance is taxpayers having trust in Inland Revenue that their information will not be disclosed inappropriately. However, to operate the tax system efficiently, or increasingly, for purposes relating to wider government, Inland Revenue sometimes needs to disclose information to taxpayers and third parties when it is reasonable to do so. An appropriate balance is needed in situations when these principles are inconsistent, and Inland Revenue strives to achieve that balance working in consultation with the affected parties and in collaboration with the agencies involved. Efficiency While the general rule regarding taxpayer information is one of secrecy, there are a number of targeted exceptions to this rule. In relation to these targeted exceptions, Inland Revenue currently has information-sharing agreements with several agencies. These agreements are authorised either via specific exceptions contained in section 81(4) of the TAA, information matching 30 provisions (sections 82–85 of the TAA and Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act) or broader information sharing provisions (section 81BA of the TAA or the new AISA regime). The information sharing agreements aim at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government by working with other agencies and private providers, as well as providing better services and outcomes to customers. The agreements are developed considering the risks and putting in place the appropriate safeguards to minimise unintended consequences, such as breaches of secrecy and privacy. Durability and resilience The tax secrecy rules in New Zealand tax legislation are long- standing. Similar rules about the confidentiality of taxpayer information are common across tax agencies internationally. Inland Revenue already shares a significant amount of information with other agencies. However, the rules are constantly being looked at – seeking to be modernised and clarified to better provide for confidentiality and sharing in a customer centric and intelligence-led environment, and balance the trade-offs inherent in decisions about whether to share. Fairness and accountability Information is critical to Inland Revenue’s ability to perform its functions. Much of that information is provided by taxpayers. This may be information about themselves (such as in an individual or business income tax return) or about other taxpayers they deal with (such as in an employer monthly schedule). Inland Revenue can enforce the provision of information that is not received through regular channels and has significant powers to do so, but the use of these powers is the exception rather than the rule. For taxpayers to be comfortable providing their information, they need to feel the information requested is reasonable and is treated appropriately by Inland Revenue. Currently, surety is given by what is often referred to as the tax secrecy rule – which essentially requires that information provided to Inland Revenue is for tax purposes and will only be used for such purposes. Inland Revenue is working on refinements to the tax administration act in which the roles of the Commissioner, taxpayers and tax agents are articulated, as well as the rules around information collection and tax secrecy which underpin the interactions between these parties. 31 Diagram 3: Inland Revenue information sharing Note: This diagram is simplified to reflect the main information flows between agencies and Inland Revenue. There are some instances, for example charities registration by Department of Internal Affairs, where information flows to Inland Revenue as well. 32 5. The Generic Tax Policy Process and the tax policy work programme The laws for imposing and administering tax in New Zealand are contained in a number of Acts of Parliament. In broad terms the laws that impose taxes are contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains the rules for how obligations are to be satisfied. Changes to the regimes delivered by Inland Revenue therefore need to be initiated in legislation. The tax policy work programme is Inland Revenue’s plan for developing, managing and delivering legislative change. Tax policy work programmes cover three years. The Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) The Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) has operated since 1994 to ensure better, more effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals, such as their revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs, and economic and social objectives. Another feature of the process is that it builds external consultation and feedback into the policy development process, providing opportunities for public comment at several stages. Consultation throughout the policy process contributes to greater transparency of policy-making, allowing the Government to set out the policy objectives of proposals and the trade-offs it has made in developing them. The process therefore helps the public to understand the rationale behind Government policy proposals. It also helps to ensure that when Ministers are making policy decisions, they are fully informed of different views and can judge them on their merits. This improves the quality of tax policy. The consultative process sometimes cannot be used for changes that require immediate action to protect the revenue base. It would not be possible to move quickly and, at the same time, to engage in wide consultation on changes to close a recently identified loophole, for example to block a scheme that is losing the country hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. The GTPP is widely accepted as the way to make tax policy, and tax professionals and professional associations expect it to be used. It leads to cooperation, assistance and frank dialogue. New Zealand’s private sector is particularly well informed on tax policy issues. In large part this is a legacy of the open and constructive policy debates that started 30 years ago and were consolidated into the GTPP 20 years ago. In recent years there has also been growing engagement with the academic community on tax reform. This is helping us embark on an open process of engaging with the wider community on the opportunities that are opened up as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. 33 How the tax policy work programme is developed Developing a new tax policy work programme The tax policy work programme follows the development of the Government’s revenue strategy and economic strategy. Developing the work programme involves identifying and scoping broad policy proposals and prioritising and sequencing the development of initiatives. Stakeholders are invited to suggest how the work programme may be developed. We also look at budgeted resource requirements, the time needed to develop, legislate for and implement initiatives, and the methods of consultation and communication to be employed throughout the process. This culminates in a joint report by Inland Revenue and the Treasury to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue, proposing a tax policy work programme. Once approved, the work programme becomes a detailed tax policy agreement between the Government and the two departments. The work programme is generally made public, attracting strong interest from the tax and business communities, to whom it provides greater certainty and an understanding of the Government’s direction in tax policy. As time passes, and the work programme is updated and new policy initiatives are added to it, there is a risk that there will be more items on the programme than can be reasonably progressed. It is therefore important that when items are added to the work programme, existing priorities are reviewed to ensure that the Government’s expectations across the work programme are met. A new tax policy work programme will be developed for the three years following the 2017 general election. Prioritising items on the tax policy work programme The items on the work programme are prioritised using the following criteria: • efficiency (to what extent will the policy help the tax system to minimise impediments to economic efficiency and growth); • equity and fairness (the degree to which the proposal will support the Government’s goals for vertical and horizontal equity); • compliance costs for the taxpayer or customer are minimised; • administration and system costs are minimised; and • integrity and coherence of the tax system is maintained and enhanced. Priorit isat ion is undertaken by Inland Revenue tax policy specialists and is endorsed by the Project Priorit isat ion and Allo cat ion Committee, which includes Treasury officials. 34 The structure of the tax policy work programme The tax policy work programme consists of: • sub-programmes, which identify the key broad areas of focus; • projects, within those sub-programmes, which focus on specific issues and changes; • remedials – smaller changes, which while important for accuracy and clarity, typically do not change the policy intent; for example, correcting an earlier drafting error; • watching briefs, which are the developing issues being monitored or researched, and for which there is not yet a clear or overwhelming need to make changes; • regulatory updates – Inland Revenue maintains a regulations register, which identifies the routine updates and reviews that are undertaken to maintain the currency of the tax and social policies it administers, such as a routine rate adjustment; and • research – this includes staying up to date with economic literature and developments overseas. The sub-programmes of the tax policy work programme reflect the strategic context of Inland Revenue as well as the challenges facing Inland Revenue’s regulatory management. These are: • policies to support Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation; • policies to address international taxation concerns and implement necessary measures to address base erosion and profit shifting; • policies to enhance and maintain the broad-based, low-rate tax system; and • social po licies. Business Transformation and Better Public Services Business Transformation A significant part of the tax policy work programme is to support the design and implementation of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Overall this should reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, reduce administration costs for Government and improve the overall efficiency of tax administration, including increased voluntary compliance. It will also create opportunities to improve Inland Revenue’s contribution to cross-agency initiatives for the delivery of better public services. The areas we are focusing on include: • progression of the two phases of the business tax package; • better administration of PAYE and GST; • pre-population and filing obligations for individuals; 35 • modernising the Tax Administration Act 1994; and • modernising and simplifying the administration of social policies. Better Public Services Inland Revenue is committed to working collaboratively across government to deliver outcomes for New Zealanders. We play a key role in the Better Public Services through: • Sharing a significant amount of information with the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation with a view to improving efficiency and enabling better outcomes for customers. • Participating in the Gang Intelligence Centre, launched in 2015. • Working closely with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment on the design and implementation of the New Zealand Business Number. • Committing to Digital Government (previously called the ICT Partnership). This framework has been set up to support the goal of a single, coherent ICT ecosystem supporting radically transformed public services. • Contributing to SmartStart, a project led by the Department of Internal Affairs. It is a product designed around the birth of a baby for use on digital devices. This was released in December 2016, and is the first life-event-based service created by Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Health, the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Social Development. This tool makes it much easier for new and expectant parents to get the services and support they need to set up their child for the future. International tax and base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) BEPS describes techniques used by some multinational companies to avoid paying tax anywhere in the world. BEPS tax planning strategies may exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules or they may take advantage of tax rules that are grounded in a “bricks and mortar” economic environment which may not address less tangible forms of commerce, such as digital services. Addressing BEPS issues requires international co-ordination. International concern around BEPS remains high and is prominent in the news media. The G20 and OECD have emphasised the need for a co-ordinated multilateral solution by developing a 15-point action plan which covers three themes: • greater transparency and exchange of information; • more robust domestic tax laws; and • international agreements and cooperation. Greater transparency and exchange of information The work programme meets OECD timelines for the automat ic exchange of information (AEOI) initiative. The recommendations made by the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules are also being implemented. 36 More robust domestic tax laws New Zealand’s domestic cross-border tax laws need to be robust. This is to ensure that our domestic tax settings protect our tax base and do not facilitate double non- taxation, tax avoidance or evasion. New Zealand already has strong controlled foreign company rules; and does not have harmful tax practices, as confirmed by the OECD in its last review in 2012. In addit io n, we have introduced GST on online services consumed in New Zealand and measures to prevent the avoidance of non- resident withholding tax on interest paid to related parties. We will: • Continue working on a package of BEPS initiatives. This includes hybrid mismatch rules to prevent companies structuring their business entities or financing arrangements to take advantage of differences in how countries’ tax these arrangements, and interest limitation rules which will prevent companies stripping excessive profits out of New Zealand using deductible interest payments. • Ensure an appropriate definition is applied for the permanent establishment of mult inat ional businesses. International agreements and cooperation The tax policy work programme reflects the need to work with the OECD and treaty partners to ensure international agreements are fit for purpose. Our work includes: • implementing OECD’s multilateral instrument (signed in June 2017), which amends our network of tax treaties to insert a new anti-treaty abuse article, a new permanent establishment definition, anti-hybrid entity rules and dispute resolut ion articles; • maintaining the tax treaties we have with 40 other countries and applying these to New Zealand income; and • applying revised OECD transfer pricing guidelines to address misallocation of profits to low tax jurisdict ions. International cooperation New Zealand is a committed and active member of the international tax community, which is important for improving the effective functioning of the world economy. Our OECD commitments account for the majority of our resources committed to our international obligations. The OECD is a rule-making body. As an OECD member, decisions made by the OECD have a direct impact on New Zealand’s international tax policy settings and this has given rise to much of the domestic and BEPS tax policy work programme. Enhancements to tax policy within broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) tax settings There is high public support for New Zealand’s general tax structure, with its BBLR tax settings. BBLR settings involve taxing a very broad range of consumption through GST and a very broad range of business and personal income through income 37 tax at low or moderate tax rates. Keeping bases broad minimises distortionary costs of taxes. Moreover, this allows tax rates to be kept as low as possible which also helps minimise distortions. Our BBLR tax system also helps keep compliance costs relat ively low. It is impossible to maintain a good tax system through a set of static rules. An effective approach requires on-going modification and refinement of legislat ion as new situations, behaviours, related legislation and judicial rulings emerge. We will not serve the Government or our customers well if we do not put sufficient resources into the repair and maintenance of existing tax law. There is capacity reserved within the tax policy work programme to ensure there is a balance of enhancements to tax settings within the BBLR framework that will go some way to meeting stakeholders’ need for clarity and certainty in the tax system, while ensuring expected Government revenue is maintained. This includes dealing with important remedial issues as they arise, which ensures that current tax law is operating as intended. This is essential in maintaining public support for the tax system. Social policy About half of Inland Revenue’s business is delivering social policy programmes, including the repayment of student loans, administering Working for Families tax credits, child support and KiwiSaver. Inland Revenue has an important role in providing advice on these policies. Social policies such as Working for Families involve significant government expenditure and affect large numbers of people. Our role in these social policy areas is closely linked to other portfolios, including ACC, education, health, and social development. As part of Business Transformation, we are looking at how our social policies can best be delivered within Inland Revenue’s transformed infrastructure and processes. In addition, we ensure the maintenance and enhancement of existing social policy settings. The social policy-related work programme has been planned to ensure that we have capacity to respond to emerging issues across each social policy regime. 38 6.

Section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was introduced in August 2011 as an exception to the secrecy rules to make the disclosure of informat ion fro m the Inland Revenue Department to other government agencies more flexible. The aim was to increase administrative efficiency by adding flexibility to the release of information, and to improve the provision of services by reducing the need for individuals to provide complex and duplicated information to multiple agencies. 2. The Inland Revenue Department currently has two information sharing agreements under that provision – one with the Ministry of Social Development and another with the Accident Compensation Corporation. The agencies have reported a range of benefits resulting from the current agreements, such as, fraud detection, increased efficiencies for service provision, and providing access to accurate and timely information. 3. The provision contains a requirement (section 81BA(4)) that it be reviewed after five years of enactment (29 August 2016) and before the expiry of six years (29 August 2017). A review has now been undertaken with key stakeholders (Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Ministry of Social Development, Accident Compensation Corporation, Ministry of Justice, and The Treasury). 4. Prior to introduction of section 81BA in 2011, research was undertaken on the public’s view of greater information sharing between government agencies. Generally, the public supported the idea of sharing information to increase efficiency of services provided. However, there was also the opinion that appropriate privacy and security safeguards be ensured. 5. The review of the Tax Administration Act’s secrecy provisions, currently underway as part of the Making Tax Simpler Government consultation, has also been taken into account to ensure the recommendations resulting from this report are consistent with the proposals presented. 6. The majority of stakeholders have expressed support for retaining section 81BA. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner questioned whether section 81BA is relevant given the Privacy Act provides for information sharing under an Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) under Part 9A of the Act, and whether the override of the Privacy Act contained in section 81BA(6) is necessary. 7. Officials agree that Part 9A of the Privacy Act would be the most appropriate mechanism to share personal information, even when the share involves some non-personal information. However, when the share involves little, or no, personal information (for example, when only company information is involved), the Privacy Act would not apply and 2 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 section 81BA would be more appropriate. Guidance material will be developed to explain when and how the two legislative mechanisms for information sharing should be used and this material will be publicly available. 8. In view of the value added by the current agreements, and future opportunities to share non-personal information with other agencies, officials recommend that section 81BA be retained in the meantime, subject to the outcome of the review of the Tax Administration Act’s confidentiality framework. In regards to section 81BA(6), officials agree it is unnecessary, and will refer its removal to the Tax Administration Act review work for consideration. 3 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 BACKGROUND 9. The Inland Revenue Department uses tax secrecy as one of the methods to support the effective functioning of the tax administration, which includes maintaining the integrity of the tax system and promoting voluntary compliance. 10. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 strictly prohibits disclosure of information gathered as part of the Inland Revenue Acts, except where disclosure is reasonably necessary to carry into effect those Acts, or when a specific exception applies. When new proposals for access to information are sought by another government agency, these are first assessed against the likely impact of the integrity of the tax system, and subsequently in relation to their impact on privacy. 11. Current information sharing and disclosure for cross government purposes are legislated for as exceptions to the tax secrecy requirements. They are based on other agencies exchanging relevant information with the Inland Revenue Department for a number of purposes that range from revenue collection activities to production of official statistics. The information also assists other agencies to confirm customer’s eligibility to benefits and services, as well as identifying illegal behaviour. 12. The exceptions to the tax secrecy requirements state in which circumstances information can be shared and disclosed and for what purposes. These are legislated: • through the exceptions listed in section 81, which allow disclosure of taxpayer information for specific purposes and under specific provisio ns; • through section 81A which allows disclosure of individual information under an approved information sharing agreement (AISA) and an Order in Council; • through section 81BA, where the Inland Revenue Department may share informat ion with other government agencies as specified in an Order in Council. 13. Section 81BA was introduced as an exception to the secrecy rule to make the disclosure of information from the Inland Revenue Department to other government agencies more flexible. It enabled information to be released in more circumstances than was previously possible wit h the aim of increasing administrative efficiency, reducing the need for individuals to provide complex and duplicated information to multiple agencies. SECTION 81BA FRAMEWORK 14. Section 81BA contains two key elements: • a set of legislative principles as to when an exception to secrecy can be applied (section 81BA(1)); and 4 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 • an administrative framework to ensure that decisions made under the legislation are robust (section 81BA(3)). 15. Under the framework, information is only shared with another agency if the government agency seeking access to the information has the ability and the authority to collect that information in its own right, but it is more efficient for the agency to obtain or verify the information from the Inland Revenue Department, and the information is available and already collected by the Inland Revenue Department. Cabinet makes the final decision about whether the Inland Revenue Department should share information with another government agency through an Order in Council. 16. An Order in Council adds agility to the process of policy change. While the framework has been included in primary legislation, the operational details of the information sharing are specified by Order in Council, which can be changed within a shorter timeframe, if required, in comparison to legislation. The Order in Council specifies the conditions for the communication of the information to another agency, such as the purpose and the classes of information to be shared. 17. Several privacy safeguards are built into the legislative framework, such as the requirement that information shared must be information that the requesting agency is authorised and able to collect in its own right, but it would be more efficient to obtain it from the Inland Revenue Department. In addit ion, the Inland Revenue Department and the agency seeking access to the information must enter into a memorandum of understanding, covering a range of specified matters, including safeguards for the information being shared. 18. Consultation must be undertaken with the Privacy Commissioner and the requesting agency in the making of the information sharing agreement and prior to the recommendation of an Order in Council to that effect. CURRENT AGREEMENTS 19. Since its introduction in 2011, the Inland Revenue Department has utilised the section 81BA framework to share information with: • Ministry of Social Development – Tax Administration (Information Sharing with Ministry of Social Development) Order 2012, under which the Inland Revenue Department may share information with the Ministry of Social Development for the purposes of assessing eligibility to benefits and services, by providing access to more accurate and timely earnings information. The agreement with the Ministry of Social Development enables sharing information about income received by individuals in receipt of a benefit and their personal circumstances where those are relevant to benefit entitlement level. Examples of the information shared are: sources and amounts of income, information on relationship and 5 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 dependents, and change of beneficiaries’ circumstances. The sharing of information occurs monthly. • Accident Compensation Corporation – Tax Administration (Information Sharing with Accident Compensation Corporation) Order 2015, where the Accident Compensation Corporation requests informat ion fro m the Inland Revenue Department from time to time for the purposes of assessing levies, eligibility for, and calculating, earnings-related compensat ion. The agreement with the Accident Compensation Corporation enables the sharing of information about businesses and self-employed people which will enable them to calculate earnings levies and compensation. Data shared includes business description (e.g. close company or self-employed) and earnings data. The sharing of information occurs as determined by the Annual Schedule received from the Accident Compensation Corporation, and can either be requested fortnightly, monthly, or on demand. CONSULTATION PRIOR TO INTRODUCING SECTION 81BA 20. Public consultation on the concept of greater information sharing between government agencies, and specifically the Inland Revenue Department sharing its data with a range of government agencies, was previously undertaken as part of the legislative process for introducing section 81BA in the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill 2011. 21. A discussion document (Making Tax Easier, June 2010) sought submissions on the proposal of the Inland Revenue Department sharing Pay As You Earn (PAYE) data with the Ministry of Social Development. The majority of submitters were in favour of the proposal and commented that it could increase efficiency and reduce the need for individuals to provide complex and duplicated information to multiple agencies. 22. However, some supporters were keen to ensure the appropriate privacy and security safeguards were in place, and concerned to ensure that only relevant information was shared with relevant agencies. Some submitters who disagreed with the proposal were concerned there was little enough privacy as it was, and there was concern about the level of information already available, increasing the risk of error with greater levels of automated data sharing. 23. The concerns have been worked through to ensure the proposal offered security safeguards in accordance with government security standards, and individuals’ privacy was protected according to the requirements of the Privacy Act 1993. 6 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 24. Business NZ commented that feedback from their members showed they view various government departments as ‘the Government’, so any sharing of information for government purposes is often assumed to take place anyway. LAW COMMISSION REVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT 1993 25. Prior to the release of the discussion document in 2010, officials consulted with the Law Commission to ensure the proposed information sharing was consistent with the Law Commission’s review of privacy, particularly regarding process. The Law Commission did not raise any concerns and was satisfied for the Inland Revenue Department to proceed with consultation, and with including the proposals in the wider Making Tax Easier discussion document fro m June 2010. The Law Commission also indicated that this should not affect the direction that their review was heading in, nor would it impact on their timeline for the release of their privacy review. MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 26. The Ministry of Social Development saw the information sharing under the new framework as having considerable potential to improve and enlarge the current information matching arrangements with the Inland Revenue Department, and supported the concept of the data sharing framework. Accurate and timelier information on employment income from the PAYE tax database would assist the Ministry of Social Development to assess correct entitlements more quickly, make timely adjustments to payments where income levels change, and consequently avoid unnecessary debt for customers. MINISTRY OF JUSTICE 27. The Ministry of Justice considered the Inland Revenue Department’s data sharing proposal presented a number of significant opportunities for the fines and civil debt enforcement operation of the Courts. The immediacy and accuracy of access to PAYE data fro m the Inland Revenue Department could enable the Courts to drive down administrative costs, eliminating costs associated with obtaining information such as a fine defaulter’s place of employment. This would likely see a reduction in the use of more administratively costly forms of enforcement, such as seizure of property, and would also reduce the need to seek information from multiple agencies to resolve cases. THE TREASURY 28. The Treasury supported the information sharing framework outlined as a basis for sharing data and considered that this would lead to administrative efficiencies within the public sector. The framework would support the Government’s priority of delivering better, COMMENTS FROM THE AGENCIES CONSULTED IN 2010 7 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 smarter public services for less. Given the importance of taxpayer secrecy to voluntary compliance, a gradual shift towards enhanced data sharing seemed appropriate. THE OFFICE OF THE PRIVACY COMMISSIONER 29. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner raised some concerns about the new framework before section 81BA was introduced. While supporting the aim of increasing the speed, accuracy, and administrative efficiency of information exchange between the Inland Revenue Department and the Ministry of Social Development, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner was of the opinion the framework should contain many more safeguards than initially presented, and recommended that Inland Revenue officials worked with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s staff to explore using the information matching framework (set out in Part 10 of the Privacy Act 1993) to deliver this proposal. This was resolved at the time and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has subsequently expressed being broadly comfortable with the proposed information sharing between the Inland Revenue Department and the Ministry of Social Development, and agreed the initiative would improve the efficiency of an important public service, and should produce significant benefits. CONSULTATION ON SECTION 81BA REVIEW 30. The provisio n (section 81BA) has been in place now for five years and contains a requirement (section 81BA(4)) that it be reviewed. Consultation has been undertaken with key stakeholders regarding the following mandated considerations: • the operation of the section; • the impacts of the section (in consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner); • whether any amendments to the section are necessary or desirable; and • whether the section is needed. 31. The Accident Compensation Corporation strongly supports the continuity of the share, and the underlying principle that the Accident Compensation Corporation should be able to obtain customer information which the Inland Revenue Department already holds, and is legally available to the Accident Compensation Corporation. It considers this a much more convenient and usually quicker process than collecting it directly and it avoids the customer being approached by multiple agencies for the same information. 32. The Accident Compensation Corporation is aware that proposals for changes to the secrecy provisions of the Tax Administration Act are being considered, and is hopeful that ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION 8 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 these will provide more flexible provisions for sharing information between agencies. While the current arrangements requiring an Order in Council and a subsequent Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are effective, a single step of an MOU between agencies under the authority of the new legislation would be quicker and more efficient to implement, and more amenable to any amendments that changing circumstances require. 33. The Ministry of Social Development reports great benefits as a result of the share enabled by the Tax Administration (Information Sharing with Ministry of Social Development) Order 2012. The information sharing has been operating under section 81BA since March 2013, and the benefits are reflected in the accurate determination of entitlements, early detection of customers with overpayments, and identification of fraud. This ensures customers are given an opportunity to comply in a timely manner, which reduces the overall number of cases requiring further action. The measured benefits from this share are outlined further in this paper in paragraphs 45-48. 34. The Ministry of Justice supports the recommendations presented in this paper. In particular, they agree that an AISA is not an appropriate mechanism for sharing that relates primarily to non-personal information. They expect to be consulted in relation to the guidance to be developed, in relation to when various sharing mechanisms should be used. 35. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper. 36. The comments provided by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner relate to: • the state of having dual information sharing mechanisms; and • the explicit Privacy Act override in section 81BA(6). Other mechanisms for information sharing 37. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner noted that in 2011, when section 81BA was introduced, the AISA framework had not been enacted. Part 9A of the Privacy Act is now in place and the Inland Revenue Department has experience in using the framework. They note that section 81A (Disclosure of information under approved information sharing agreement) is being amended to clarify that the Inland Revenue Department may supply both personal information about an identifiable individual, and non-personal informat ion, to another agency under an AISA. That clarification will further support the Inland Revenue Department’s MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT MINISTRY OF JUSTICE THE TREASURY THE OFFICE OF THE PRIVACY COMMISSIONER 9 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 ability to use AISAs in the future. They suggest that the Part 9A AISA mechanism would be a more appropriate mechanism to share information in most situations, particularly where significant personal information was involved. 38. They comment that when they were consulted on the initial proposal for bespoke information sharing provisions to be included in the Tax Administration Act in 2010-11, it was said that uncertainty may arise if multiple mechanisms were available to enable the same information sharing activities to occur. In their opinion this point remains a valid concern and may lead to confusion and uncertainty over the most appropriate mechanism to use. 39. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner therefore recommended that, if the Inland Revenue Department concludes there is merit in retaining section 81BA, it would be helpful for both the Inland Revenue Department staff and other agencies, and for public transparency, if the Inland Revenue Department develops guidance explaining when and how it was envisaged the different sharing mechanisms would be used. The explicit override in section 81BA(6) currently unduly affects the interface with the Privacy Act 40. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s main area of uncertainty relates to the intended application of section 81BA(6) which provides that: ‘The communication of information under this section is not subject to the Privacy Act 1993.’ 41. Because the Office of the Privacy Commissioner could not identify any consideration of that clause during the 2010-11 policy development phase, they have concluded that the provision was mostly likely a drafting inclusion aimed at clarifying that the information sharing foreseen by the new section 81BA would not be affected by the restrictions on use and disclosure of information under principles 10 and 11 of the Privacy Act 1 . They consider the savings provisions in section 7 2 of the Privacy Act, combined with the clear authority provided for under section 81BA itself, adequately provide for certainty in this regard. 42. They also do not see any need for a statutory override of the other privacy principles that they consider should still apply, e.g.: 1 Principle 10 relates to the use of information for other purposes other than the one the information was obtained in connection with, and Principle 11 relates to disclosure of information to other body or agencies unless the agency believes, on reasonable grounds, the specified exceptions apply. 2 Part 2 section 7(3) - An action is not a breach of privacy of any of principles 1 to 5, 7 to 10 and 12 if that action is authorised by or under the law. 10 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 • Principle 5, which addresses an agency’s obligations to provide appropriate safeguards for the storage and security of personal information; • Principles 6 and 7, which address an individual’s rights to access and correct personal information an agency holds; and • Principle 8, which requires agencies to take reasonable steps to ensure information is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant, and not misleading before use. 43. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner considers that subsection 81BA(6) is not only unnecessary, but could provide an unwarranted override that could effectively undermine the privacy interests of the persons subject to any information sharing under a section 81BA information sharing agreement. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner, therefore, recommends that if the Inland Revenue Department concludes it is appropriate to retain section 81BA, consideration should nonetheless be given to removing section 81BA(6). Officials will recommend this for consideration as part of the wider review of the Tax Administration Act’s secrecy provisions. 44. The Accident Compensation Corporation supports the recommendations resulting from this review, and has a view that the removal of section 81BA(6) will not affect the Corporation’s ability to rely on section 81BA for the exchange of information with Inland Revenue, which is necessary for the efficient provision of services to its customers. MEASURED BENEFITS 45. Sharing information under this provision has increased efficiency, reducing the need for individuals to provide complex and duplicated information to multiple agencies. Utilising the framework to provide information to the Ministry of Social Development has generated a number of benefits, resulting from the Ministry of Social Development having access to more accurate and timely earnings information. 46. In March 2013, the Ministry of Social Development started using the Inland Revenue Department’s PAYE informat ion to identify all current working-age beneficiaries who also had emplo yment income. Based on the information provided by the Inland Revenue Department, the programme has enabled the Ministry of Social Development to identify clients who have not notified a change in employment circumstances in a timely manner, result ing in more timely assessment and delivery of correct entitlement to social assistance, and reduced compliance costs to employers and the Ministry of Social Development. MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 11 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 47. The information sharing between the Inland Revenue Department and the Ministry of Social Development has shown positive results 3 . At 30 June 2013, 3,139 benefits had been cancelled because the recipient was not entitled to them, saving the taxpayer $33.7 million per year. At 30 June 2014, the number of cancelled benefits increased to 6,000 amounting to $47.4 million in savings. The amount of money recovered from fraud overpayments in 2013/14 was $3.94m, and in 2014/15 was $4.85m. 48. The Ministry of Social Development reports 4 2,336 client benefits were cancelled in 2014/15, and 1,652 in 2015/16, and detection of $37.7 million in overpayments in 2014/15 and $44.4 million in 2015/16. 49. In regards to the benefits generated from the sharing agreement with the Accident Compensation Corporation, the sharing has been operating for a shorter period of time, since January 2016, and the Accident Compensation Corporation reports it has not been able to quantify the benefits as yet. However, its limited experience has been positive so far, since the Corporation now has access to information that the Inland Revenue Department holds that could otherwise be difficult and time-consuming for the Corporation to collect. REVIEW OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT’S CONFIDENTIALITY FRAMEWORK 50. A discussio n document entit led Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act was released by the Government at the end of 2016. The document included proposals on information collection and confidentiality, considering the need for greater information sharing within government to support the Government’s better public services objectives. 51. The discussion document proposed a model for informat ion disclosures fro m The Inland Revenue Department to other government agencies for non-tax-related purposes, for the provision of public services. It is a proposal to modernise the information protection and disclosure framework in the Tax Administration Act by moving to a regulatory model that allows information sharing to be enabled by Order in Council. 3 Inland Revenue Annual Report 2013 and Annual Report 2014 4 Report on information sharing activity for the period 01 July 2014 to 30 June 2016, Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue ACCIDENT COMPENSATION CORPORATION 12 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 52. The aim of the new model would be providing greater flexibility and timeliness to the implementation and amendment of information sharing agreements. This would improve efficiency and effectiveness of government services, while not compromising the ability of the Inland Revenue Department to perform its funct ion. The model would also ensure the appropriate safeguards are in place, ensuring confidentiality is not impacted more than necessary to achieve the purpose of the information sharing. 53. The proposed model would need to meet certain criteria to allow Inland Revenue information to be shared for the provision of public services. The criteria are: • providing the information will improve the ability of the government to efficiently and effectively deliver services or enforce laws • the information cannot easily or efficiently be obtained or verified from other sources • the amount and type of information provided is proportionate given the purpose for which it is being shared • the information will be adequately protected by the receiving agency • sharing the information will not unduly inhibit the provision of information to the Inland Revenue Department in the future. 54. The model would also include an underlying memorandum of understanding where the operational details would be set out, such as: • the classes or types of information to be shared • how the information will be used • how the information will be provided or accessed • requirements for security, storage and disposal • how (or whether) information can be further disclo sed • any review requirements, including disclosure of any breaches. 55. The proposed model is very similar to section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 56. The benefits provided by the agreements are evident in the evaluation of the shares provided by the two agencies (the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation) with which the Inland Revenue Department has information sharing agreements under the 81BA provision. These agreements have enabled fraud detection, increased efficiencies for service provision, and provided access to accurate and timely information. 13 Review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 2017 57. Key stakeholders consulted on this review have, in the majority, expressed support for retaining the section. Officials have considered their comments, as well as the proposals on the recent Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, to develop final recommendations. The relevant points are discussed as follows. 58. The Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act contained proposals to modernise the confidentialit y framework, with the aim of providing a more flexible, cohesive and transparent framework governing the protection and sharing of the Inland Revenue Department’s information. It is recommended that final decisions on the future of section 81BA are made as part of this wider review. 59. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner commented that having multiple mechanisms for information sharing may raise uncertainty. However, while an AISA provided under Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993 would be the most appropriate mechanism to share personal information, even when the share involves some non-personal information, it would not be the most appropriate mechanism for shares that involve little or no personal information, for example, when sharing company information. In these situations, section 81BA provides an appropriate mechanism and there are further opportunities where it could be used, since the Inland Revenue Department holds business information that could be useful to other agencies. For this reason, it is recommended the section be retained in the meantime, subject to the outcome of the Tax Administration Act review of the confidentiality framework. In this regards, officials agree with the suggestion for developing guidance explaining when and how the different sharing mechanisms should be used, and making the guidelines publicly available. 60. Another main point considered is the explicit Privacy Act override in section 81BA(6). Officials agree with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner comments that this could have unintended consequences by allowing the Inland Revenue Department to disregard all 12 privacy principles, and preventing individuals from exercising their right to make a complaint to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. The removal of section 81BA(6) will, therefore, also be recommended for consideration as part of the review of the Tax Administration Act’s secrecy provisions. 14

2017 review of the Commissioner’s mileage rate for expenditure incurred for the business use of a motor vehicle
===============================================================================================================

2017 review of the CIR's mileage rate for expenditure incurred for business use of a motor vehicle - petrol, diesel, hybrid and electric vehicles.

[Operational Statement 09/01 ("OS")](/operational-statements/os-0901-commissioner-s-statement-of-a-mileage-rate-for-expenditure-incurred-for-the-business-use-of-)
 published in the _Tax Information Bulletin_ Volume 21, Number 3 (May 2009) provides the Commissioner's statement of a mileage rate for expenditure incurred for the business use of a motor vehicle. This OS provides that the Commissioner will review mileage rate on a yearly basis.

A review of the Commissioner’s mileage rate results in an increased rate of 73 cents per kilometre for both petrol and diesel fuel vehicles for the 2017 income year compared to 72 cents for the 2016 income year. The increase is primarily due to a slight increase in fixed vehicle costs and higher average fuel costs during the 2017 income year. The 2017 income year for business taxpayers with a standard 31 March balance date, runs from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017.

This year we are also able to set mileage rates for hybrid and electric cars. For the first time we have been able to obtain reliable data in respect of the fixed and running cost for these types of vehicles. These mileage rates are:

*   Hybrid - 73 cents per km
*   Electric - 81 cents per km

For both Hybrid and Electric vehicles, our data shows that although these types of vehicle have lower running costs, these are offset by higher fixed costs.

The Commissioner is required to set a mileage rate for persons whose business travel is 5,000 km or less in an income year. The mileage rate is set retrospectively for persons required to file a return for business income, so that the rate reflects the average motor vehicle operating costs for an income year. Those persons who meet the criteria have a choice of using the mileage rate method or they may use actual costs if they consider that the Commissioner’s mileage rate does not reflect their true costs. Taxpayers that choose to use actual costs are required to keep records to support any expenditure claimed.

The Commissioner does not propose to amend the returns for taxpayers who have already filed their 2017 returns using the 2016 mileage rate.

The Commissioner accepts that employers may use the 2017 vehicle mileage rate as a reasonable estimate of costs when they reimburse employees for the use of their private vehicle for business related travel for a current income year (post 1 April 2017).

Also, employers may use an alternative estimate other than the Commissioner’s vehicle mileage rate when reimbursing employees for use of their private vehicle for employment related use. It is accepted that employers may use the motor vehicle running cost data published by other reputable sources, for example the New Zealand Automobile Association Incorporated, as an alternative reasonable estimate for reimbursement of employees.

The mileage rate does not apply in respect of motor cycles as this mode of transport is not commonly used for business purposes. Any self-employed persons who use this form of transport for business purposes will need to calculate their actual expenditure or in the situation of an employer reimbursement, they may make a reasonable estimate of the employee’s costs.

As a consequence of changes to the legislation, effective from the 2018 income year, a draft replacement OS will be released for consultation at some future stage.

Coversheet: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules Advising agencies The Treasury and Inland Revenue Decision sought The analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Col/ins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The problem the proposals discussed in this impact statement seek to address is the use of debt financing by taxpayers to reduce their New Zealand income tax liability significantly. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The adoption of a restricted transfer pricing rule for determining the allowable interest rate (for tax purposes) on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower will help ensure interest rates on such loans cannot be excessive. In addition, changing the way deductible debt levels are calculated under the thin capitalisation rules will ensure that taxpayers with little equity are unable to have large amounts of deductible debt. These changes will provide a solution that is sustainable , efficient and equitable, while minimising impacts on compliance and administration costs. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that the new interest limitation rules are forecast to produce approximately $80-90 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to these proposals which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. R eg ul atory Imp ac t Assess ment: BEP S - s tr ength enin g o ur int eres t li mit ati on rule s 1 1 Where do the costs fall? The costs primarily fall on foreign-owned taxpayers operating in New Zealand (though there may be some minor impacts on New Zealand-owned taxpayers with international operations). Tax payments for affected parties are forecast to increase by approximately $80-90 million per year on an ongoing basis. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? As with all tax rules, there is some risk of taxpayer non-compliance. However, this is mitigated as the rules predominately apply to large companies- and the tax affairs of large companies are closely monitored by Inland Revenue. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. There is no incompat ibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems '. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is moderate evidence in relation to the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debt, and good evidence in relation to allowable debt levels . Inland Revenue has some data on interest rates paid on related-party debts, as well as examples of structures that appear to have the effect of increasing the interest rate on such debt. However, this data is not comprehensive. Inland Revenue has data on the debt, asset and equity levels of significant foreign-owned enterprises, which allows an accurate estimation of the impact of the non-debt liability adjustment for those firms. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 2 Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer's comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 3 Impact Statement: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement , except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem While good evidence of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is generally difficult to come by, there is an exception for BEPS in relation to interest payments . Fairly good data on interest deductions (especially for large firms) is available for analysis through Inland Revenue's International Questionnaire. This dataset includes debt levels, related-party debt levels, and related-party interest payments of large foreign-owned firms. However, there are still limitations to that data - for example, data on interest rates on related-party debt (and the interest rates facing a New Zealand subsidiary's parent company) is not captured in the Questionnaire. Where possible, this information was obtained from other sources (such as credit ratings of parent companies and disclosed related -party interest rates in financial statements) or estimated (for example, estimating interest rates based on related-party interest payments and related-party debt amounts). However, this other data is less comprehensive and accurate. Consultation The preferred option in relation to limiting interest rates on related-party interest rates has not been subject to consultation . This was because it was developed in response to submissions on the original proposals . However, it is similar in many respects to the original proposal, which was subject to consultation. In addition, to ensure the rule operates effectively and to mitigate the risk of unintended outcomes, it will be subject to consultation with submitters on the technical detail. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Carmel Peters Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 13July2017 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 4 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? BEPS BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries' domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over MNEs not engaged in BEPS and domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens' trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter BEPS. BEPS using interest deductions The use of debt financing is one of the simplest ways of shifting taxable profits from one jurisdiction to another. For example, because interest payments are deductible, a related- party cross-border loan from a parent to a subsidiary can be used to reduce taxes payable in the jurisdiction that the subsidiary is located. New Zealand's BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. This includes developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). If no further action is taken, MNEs that currently have high levels of debt in New Zealand, or highly-priced related-party debt, will be able to continue paying little tax in New Zealand. There is also a risk that additional MNEs would adopt similar structures. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand's tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government's distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. New Zealand's tax system has been the subject of numerous broad-based reviews - most recently the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in 2010. it is well regarded and generally functions well. No other government agencies have a direct interest in the tax system. However, a good tax system is important for a well-functioning economy - many government agencies therefore Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 5 have an indirect interest in the tax system. Foreign investment in New Zealand is generally taxed under our company tax at 28 percent. New Zealand's tax system has rules that limit the deductible debt levels and interest rates for taxpayers with foreign connections. These rules affect only foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies. Thin capitalisation rules New Zealand has "thin capitalisation" rules to limit tax deductions for interests that non- residents are allowed. These rules generally require an investment owned by a non-resident to have a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 60 percent (interest deductions are denied to the extent the allowable debt-to-asset ratio is exceeded). Thin capitalisation rules also apply to New Zealand-owned firms (frequently referred to as the "outbound thin capitalisation rules"). These rules generally require a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 75 percent. They are designed to prevent a disproportionate portion of a New Zealand company's debt being placed in New Zealand. Like the tax system as a whole, we consider that the thin capitalisation rules are serving us well. The rules are well understood and taxpayers subject to the rules generally have conservative debt levels and, for those with related-party debt, the debt is at conservative interest rates - as evidenced by the significant amount of tax paid by foreign-owned firms operating in New Zealand (foreign controlled firms paid 39 percent of company tax in the 2015 tax year). Transfer pricing rules lt is important to limit not just the quantum of debt in New Zealand, but also the interest rate on that debt. For third-party debt, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to obtain as low an interest rate as possible. However, these pressures do not necessarily exist in a related-party context. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. Broadly speaking (and as they apply to related-party debt), these rules seek to ensure that the interest rate on a given loan contract is in line with what would have been agreed between unrelated parties. NRWT While payments of interest to related parties are deductible, they are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). NRWT applies at either 15 percent or 10 percent, depending on whether New Zealand has a Double Taxation Treaty with the interest recipient's home jurisdiction. This means that, while the use of debt can reduce tax payable in New Zealand, it does not completely eliminate it. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 6 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? A simple way that non-residents can reduce their New Zealand tax liability significantly is by capitalising a New Zealand investment with debt instead of equity, because they can then take interest deductions in New Zealand. This is shown in the example below. Example Australian investor A puts $1 OOm of capital in a New Zealand company as equity. Company earns $10m from sales and pays $2.8m New Zealand tax. Company pays a net dividend (not tax deductible) of $7.2m to A. Total New Zealand tax is $2.8m. Australian investor B puts $100m of capital into a New Zealand company as debt, with an interest rate of 10%. Company earns $10m from sales but has to pay $10m of tax-deductible interest to B, reducing taxable income to $0. No tax is paid by the company, but a 10% tax on interest is imposed on B (non-resident withholding tax). Total New Zealand tax is $1 m. Having a generally well regarded tax system does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An on-going policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and ensure that MNEs are paying a fair amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures - such as rules for limiting the amount of debt allowable in New Zealand, and the interest rate on that debt-are therefore important. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. This impact statement considers two related policy opportunities: • ensuring the rules for setting the allowable interest rates on related-party debt are sufficiently robust; and • ensuring the basis for setting the allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules is appropriate. Scale of the problem The OECD's Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan) included developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). We consider the fact that the OECD has included profit shifting using interest in its BEPS Action Plan as evidence that this is a significant policy issue internationally. As mentioned above, most MNEs operating here have relatively low levels of debt and do not have interest rates considered to be excessive. However, there are a small number of taxpayers with either debt levels that are too high, or interest rates that are excessive. While small in number, the fiscal impact of these arrangements is significant - we estimate the tax revenue lost is $80-90 million per year. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 7 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on scope. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stake holders The stakeholders are primarily taxpayers (in particular , MNEs) and tax advisors . The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers ' affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. Consultation already undertaken In March 2017, the Government released the discussion document BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules . The discussion document consulted on two key proposals which are considered in this impact statement - new interest limitation rules and a non-debt liabilities adjustment to the thin capitalisation rules . The Government received 27 submissions on the discussion document. Most submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals. In general, submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS risks facing New Zealand , and that part of this would involve strengthening New Zealand's rules for limiting interest deductions for firms with cross-border related-party debt. However, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward . The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Interest limitation The discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach for pricing inbound related-party loans. Instead, the allowable interest rate for such a loan would - in most instances - be set with reference to the New Zealand borrower's parent 's borrowing costs (referred to as an "interest rate cap "). General reaction Most submitters argued that the interest rate cap proposal was not necessary and should not proceed. They noted that the Government , in the discussion document BEPS - transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance , proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally . Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates . Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons , including that it: • is inconsistent with the arm's length standard, so would result in double taxation; • will increase compliance costs; • will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk ; and • has no international precedent. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 8 Only two submitters wrote in favour of the proposed cap. However, the proposal did attract positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts. Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks - "transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates , so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules ". Allowable debt levels The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand ("deductible debt"). Currently , the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer 's assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer's assets is allowable). The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer's maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer's assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest-bearing debts (a "non-debt liability adjustment " ). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provis ions , and deferred tax liabilities. General reaction Several submitters indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax). A number of other submitters argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers ' thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold. Stakeholders' views displayed no clear pattern. Two big accounting firms agreed with the proposal while two others disagreed . Similarly , of the three major stakeholder groups who submitted on the proposal , one supported and two opposed the change . Deferred tax To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable prof its and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer's non-debt liabilities could include "deferred tax liabilities ", which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer 's assets could include "deferred tax assets" which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit. All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that , for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, deferred tax liabilities should be ignored . Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer 's assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets - deferred tax assets) - (non-debt liabilities - deferred tax liabilit ies) . Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 9 Submitters noted that Australia's thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because: • often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future; • deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity; and • deferred tax balances can be volatile - taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them. Further consultation Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, officials are planning to undertake further public consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Related-party interest rates We have identified five mutually exclusive options to the address the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debts. Option 4 (administrative guidance) is a non-regulatory option. The other options for change involve changing New Zealand's tax legislation. Option 1: Interest rate cap (discussion document proposal) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Restricted transfer pricing Under a restricted transfer pricing approach, inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that: • There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and • All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored -unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have third-party debt featuring those terms and conditions. The types of modifications to the terms, conditions and surrounding circumstances we would seek to make under this approach are: o That the loan has no exotic terms that are generally not seen with third-party lending o That the loan is not subordinated o That the loan duration is not excessive o That the debt level of the borrower is not excessive. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower's foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 10 parent. This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable. This option was developed following consultation to address some of the concerns raised by submitters; however, it has not itself been subject to consultation. Option 3: Adopt EBITDA-based rule (OECD recommended approach) This option would involve limiting the amount of interest deductions a taxpayer is allowed with reference to their earnings (specifically, their profits before deductions for interest, depreciation and amortisation are taken into account, also known as their EBITDA). This new approach would completely replace the thin capitalisation rules, becoming the new method for limiting interest deductions for taxpayers with international connections. This approach would constrain the tax effectiveness of highly priced debt, since it directly limits interest deductions rather than limiting the amount of debt; a taxpayer with highly priced debt would be more likely to exceed their EBITDA limit and face interest denial. Almost all submitters did not support the adoption of an EBITDA-based rule. Option 4: Administrative guidance This option would involve Inland Revenue issuing administrative guidance on how it will assess the risk of related-party lending transactions -similar to what has recently been released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (discussed below). Under this option, related-party loans with certain features (such as having an interest rate in line with the interest rate facing the borrower's foreign parent) would be given a low risk rating and be unlikely to be challenged by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers with higher interest rates would be more likely to have their related-party loan investigated. Several submitters suggested this option be adopted in place of the interest rate cap. They argued that it would provide certainty for taxpayers who desired it, but taxpayers who value certainty less would be free to breach the guidelines. Option 5: Status quo (ordinary transfer pricing) This option would involve continuing to price related-party debt under the transfer pricing rules. As discussed above, the Government proposed strengthening these rules in the discussion document BEPS -transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. Many submitters argued that this should be sufficient to address any concerns over related- party interest rates. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 11 Relevant experience from other countries The ATO has released draft guidelines regarding the interest rates of cross-border related- party loans. 1 These guidelines are designed to encourage Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies to restructure their related-party loans into ordinary "vanilla" loans. Overall, the guidelines have a clear expectation that the interest rate on related-party loans should be in line with the foreign parent's cost of funds: "Generally, the ATO expects any pricing of a related-party debt to be in line with the commercial incentive of achieving the lowest possible 'all-in' cost to the borrower. The A TO expects, in most cases, the cost of the financing to align with the costs that could be achieved, on an arm's length basis, by the parent of the global group to which the borrower and lender both belong." Allowable debt levels We have identified three mutually exclusive options relating to setting the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rules. The options (other than the status quo) involve changing New Zealand's tax legislation. Option 1: Proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment (as proposed in the discussion document) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Proceed with non-debt liabilities proposal excluding deferred tax Under this option, a taxpayer's deferred tax would be ignored for the purposes of the non- debt liability adjustment. That is, a taxpayer's allowable debt level would be set with reference to the result of the formula: (assets- deferred tax assets)-(non-debt liabilities- deferred tax liabilities). Of submitters who supported the proposed non-debt liability adjustment in principle, this was the preferred option. Option 3: Status quo (do not proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment) Under this option, maximum deductible debt levels would continue to be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules with reference to assets, ignoring non-debt liabilities. As mentioned in section 2.5, this was the preferred option of some submitters. Relevant experience from other countries Australia has thin capitalisation rules that are broadly similar to New Zealand's. Australia's rules currently require a non-debt liability adjustment, but deferred tax is carved-out. That is, Australia's rules are consistent with option 2. 1 ATO compliance approach to taxation issues associated with cross-border related-party financing arrangements and related transactions, PCG 2017/04. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 12 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government's vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality-the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity-similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance -compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration -administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; and • Sustainability -the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved Efficiency, fairness and sustainability are the most important criteria. lt is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these three criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No options were ruled out of scope.

Option 2 (restricted transfer pricing) ++ Option 2 will provide a reasonably strong limit on related-party debt interest rates, reducing the ability for some firms to profit shift.

However, it also increases the uncertainty of returns on New Zealand investment, since whether or not interest is deductible turns on a taxpayer's EBITDA, which can be very variable. 0 On the one hand, option 3 would be somewhat effective at preventing excessive interest rates. On the other hand, it could result in interest denial for firms with very conservative interest rates and debt positions (say, for example, if a taxpayer is in loss). 0 Compliance costs in some instances would reduce under option 3, as there would be fewer transfer pricing disputes about related- party debt. However, an EBITDA-based rule would be a fundamental shift in our interest limitation rules - taxpayers and agents would have to come to grips with an entirely new regime.

Interest limitation We consider that option 2 -developing a restricted transfer pricing approach - is the best option to limit interest expenses in relation to inbound related-party debt. Following consultation and further analysis, we consider that if the Government pursued the interest rate cap (option 1 ), adjustments would be needed to the original discussion document proposal which would make it more complex. For example, to address some of the concerns expressed by submitters, a different or modified rule may need to be applied to firms with low levels of debt. The result of these adjustments would be that different rules would apply to taxpayers in different situations (more so than originally proposed). Such differences create perceptions of unfairness, and give rise to boundaries that can be difficult to formulate, administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient -especially as taxpayers try to arrange their circumstances to fall within certain boundaries. The difficulty is, however, that simply relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by some submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes. lt is clear that the international consensus (as reflected in the OECD recommendation for countries to adopt an arbitrary formulaic approach (EBITDA)) is to move away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. In addition, as noted in section 2.5, commentators have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions. Accordingly, we consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is the best approach. Like the interest rate cap, it will ensure the policy objective -ensuring there is a robust mechanism for determining the interest rates for inbound related-party debt; however, since the restricted transfer pricing rule has more flexibility (compared to the interest rate cap - the other option that would most effectively achieve the policy objective) it is both more efficient and fairer. Owing to the time available (and since it was developed subsequent to the initial consultation), this option has not been subject to consultation with stakeholders. This modification will address many, but not all of, submitters' concerns - it is still a departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Nevertheless, we expect that it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because: • it allows for some limited flexibility- meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and • it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand's Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur frequently because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related party debt. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules 1 17 Allowable debt levels At this stage, we do not have a preference between option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment as originally proposed) and option 2 (non-debt liability adjustment with deferred tax carve- out). Option 3 (status quo) is not preferred. Both options 1 and 2 have similar impacts in terms of efficiency and fairness (and have no significant impacts in terms of compliance and administration costs). The non-debt liability adjustment in option 1 is potentially too extensive because of the inclusion of all types of deferred tax, but, on the other hand, the adjustment in option 2 is too narrow because of the exclusion of all deferred tax. We consider that the best approach is to recommend neither options 1 or 2 at this stage, but instead consult further with stakeholders on whether there is another feasible option (since this is a minor technical detail, more consultation on this matter is feasible). For example, it might be possible to identify deferred tax liabilities that are the least likely to result in a future tax payment, and restrict the carve-out of deferred tax to just that identified group.

As discussed above, allowing BEPS through interest deductions is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take use interest deductions to reduce their New Zealand (and possibly worldwide) tax liability is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders. lt is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself, which all of the stakeholders already discussed have an interest in preserving. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'? Yes. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Implementation of both reforms (relating to related-party interest rates and allowable debt level) will be given effect through a combination of legislation and Inland Revenue administrative guidance. The legislative changes proposed will be progressed (subject to Cabinet approval) as part of a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced in late 2017. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin. In relation to the allowable debt level proposal, we will consult further with stakeholders on whether a preferred option can be identified. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue will make the final decision on which option should be progressed (option 1, option 2, or a potential new option) following this consultation. These reforms are expected to apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, subject to legislation progressing to enactment before this date. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that transitional relief or grandparenting should be provided to give taxpayers sufficient lead-in time to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider that the planned application date of 1 July 2018 is sufficiently prospective because: • the interest rate proposal applies only to related-party transactions (which are more easily altered compared to transactions with third-parties); and • in relation to the allowable debt level proposal, debt and asset levels under the thin capitalisation rules can be measured as at the end of the relevant income year, meaning taxpayers would have until at least 30 June 2019 to rearrange their affairs. In addition, in response to consultation, we propose that advanced pricing agreements Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules 1 21 (APAs) existing prior to the application date of these changes will be grandparented. Once the proposals are implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is the risk that the relevant transfer pricing legislation could contain unintended errors or have unintended consequences. However, this risk can be efficiently managed by way of remedial amendments. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. Inland Revenue closely monitors the tax affairs of New Zealand's largest companies {which are, in general, the affected population of these proposals). For example, Inland Revenue currently collects data from these firms on their debt levels (including levels of related-party debt) through its International Questionnaire. This will allow how the proposals have impacted debt levels and related-party interest payments to be analysed. More generally, Inland Revenue is considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for all the BEPS measures being implemented. Any additional information may be collected via a disclosure statement that must be provided to Inland Revenue or it may be collected using existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTTP involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, following enactment, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect could either be included as remedial amendments in future tax bills, or if they involve more complex issues could be added to the tax policy work programme. Further consultation would be implicit in this approach. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

Coversheet: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Advising agencies Inland Revenue, The Treasury Decision sought This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Col/ins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? - The policy problem is that taxpayers can reduce their worldwide tax liability through hybrid mismatch arrangements, which in most cases are deliberately designed to take advantage of the different characterisations countries use for financial instruments and entities. Hybrid mismatch arrangements (which include branch mismatches) result in less group taxation when compared with straightforward arrangements that are seen consistently by the relevant countries. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? A tailored adoption of the OECD's BEPS Action 2 recommendations will comprehensively deal with the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements while making modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This tailored solution is sustainable and achieves gains to efficiency and fairness, while minimising compliance costs where possible. There will be a significant benefit in adopting a solution which is adopted by other countries and which will therefore be easier for multinational businesses to understand and comply with. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that new rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements are forecast to produce approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to this regulatory proposal which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 1 Where do the costs fall? Taxpayers that use hybrid mismatch arrangements will face a medium level of compliance costs. These may be up-front, in the form of restructuring costs to transition to more straightforward (non-hybrid) arrangements, or they may be ongoing in the case of taxpayers that keep their hybrid mismatch arrangements in place and must apply new tax rules in order to comply with the law. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There is some risk of taxpayer noncompliance with the proposed rules. However, the risk of taxpayers being inadvertently caught by the proposed rules has been minimised due to the design of the preferred regulatory option which seeks to exclude the most simple offshore structures (foreign branches). More generally, the impacts have been reduced through the proposals taking into account the New Zealand context and adjusting the OECD- recommended rules as needed. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Not every type of hybrid arrangement that would be countered by the proposals has been observed in New Zealand. However, Inland Revenue is aware of some historic and current hybrid arrangements, and there is a very high likelihood there are others that relate to New Zealand and will be affected by this regulatory proposal. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS -hybrid mismatch arrangements Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer's comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 2 Impact Statement: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements problem in New Zealand. Inland Revenue is aware of some mismatch arrangements, but the full extent of the problem is unknown. This is because evidence of the problem primarily comes from Inland Revenue's investigations staff. Under current law these staff do not routinely examine offshore tax treatment (and therefore arrangements that lower a group's worldwide tax obligations), which is an important part of identifying a hybrid mismatch arrangement under the proposals. Range of options considered Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD's work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand's ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of hybrid mismatch arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response. Responsible Manager (signature and date): -..........\_\_\_ Paul Kilford Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 12July2017 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? BEPS Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinational groups to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries' domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens' trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Hybrid mismatch arrangements Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when taxpayers exploit inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. The OECD's BEPS package includes Action 2: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are prevalent worldwide and are an important part of the base erosion and profit shifting strategies used by multinational companies. If no action is taken by the international community to counter these types of arrangements they are likely to continue to be used to avoid worldwide taxation and drive economic inefficiencies and unfairly distributed tax burdens. New Zealand's BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. In September 2016 the Government released a BEPS discussion document: Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements which proposed adoption of the OECD Action 2 recommendations in New Zealand and sought submissions on how that should be done. In March 2017 the Government released two further discussion documents: BEPS - Strengthening our interest limitation rules; and BEPS -Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand. This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions. At the same time, Cabinet noted that the reforms proposed in the BEPS documents would be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. Cabinet also noted that officials are continuing to develop and consult on all aspects of the BEPS project and that Cabinet approval will be sought for final policy decisions later in 2017. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS • Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 4 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand's tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government's distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. Company tax and international rules The company tax system is designed to be a backstop for taxing the personal income of domestic investors. Company tax is deducted at 28%, but New Zealand based investors can claim imputation credits for tax paid by the company when the income is taxed upon distribution at the personal level. At the same time, the company tax is designed as a final tax on New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors and foreign-owned companies earning New Zealand-sourced income. Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge in the area of international tax is to ensure that multinational firms pay a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Anti-avoidance rules and base protection measures are important part of ensuring that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non- residents to invest. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements Businesses can use hybrid mismatch arrangements to create tax advantages through exploiting inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. For example, using a hybrid entity or a foreign branch, a single expense may be deducted in two different jurisdictions, potentially reducing the tax payable on two different streams of income. Another example is a payment that is tax- deductible in one jurisdiction with no corresponding taxable income in the jurisdiction where the payment is received. However it is achieved, the result of a hybrid mismatch arrangement is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates when compared with a straightforward arrangement that is seen consistently by both relevant countries. Hybrid mismatch arrangements also have the effect of subsidising international investment relative to domestic investment, which distorts the efficiency of global markets. Since releasing its final recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements, the OECD expanded the scope of BEPS Action 2 to include branch mismatches. Branch mismatch arrangements are a result of countries approaching the allocation of income and expenses between a branch and a head office in different ways. Branch mismatch arrangements can also result in a reduction in the overall taxation of a corporate group, so are similar in effect to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 5 lt is important to note that the policy problem is limited to circumstances when global tax is reduced as a result of a hybrid mismatch. This project does not address other mechanisms that taxpayers may use to lower their global tax liability, such as the use of low-tax jurisdictions to trap income. Hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand New Zealand has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) that can, in some instances, neutralise the effects of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. However, the target of the GAAR is arrangements that avoid New Zealand tax. The arrangement must also do so in a manner that is outside Parliament's contemplation; a classic indicator being that the arrangement gains the advantage in an artificial or contrived way. Although the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement reduces the overall tax paid by the parties to the arrangement, it is often difficult to determine which country involved has lost tax revenue. Further, the use of a hybrid is not necessarily artificial or contrived in and of itself. Accordingly, the GAAR does not provide a comprehensive solution to counter the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements. New Zealand also has some specific rules in its domestic law that go some way to addressing particular recommendations made by the OECD in relation to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Inland Revenue is aware of a significant volume of hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand. For example, the amount of tax at issue in recent litigation for a prominent type of hybrid financial instrument was approximately $300 million (across multiple years). In relation to hybrid entities, deductions claimed in New Zealand that are attributable to the most prominent hybrid entity structure results in approximately $50 million less tax revenue for New Zealand per year. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD's work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand's ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Consistent with the OECD approach, the analysis has been focused on arrangements between related parties or where a hybrid mismatch has been created through a structured arrangement between unrelated parties. We have also chosen to restrict the policy thinking to cross-border activity. Purely domestic hybrid mismatches (some of which are contemplated by the OECD Action 2 final report) are outside the scope of this regulatory proposal. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stakeholders Stakeholders of this regulatory proposal are primarily taxpayers (typically multinational businesses that have hybrid mismatch arrangements) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers' affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. The proposed rules affect only taxpayers with foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 6 connections - that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers , and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. Another stakeholder of this regulatory proposal is the OECD, which is aiming to eradicate hybrid mismatch arrangements to the extent possible. This goal can only be achieved through countries adopting hybrid mismatch rules of some kind and neutralising the mismatches that arise when different sets of rules apply to the same transaction or entity . In addition, other countries that have enacted or are proposing to enact hybrid mismatch rules (for example , Australia and the United Kingdom) will be interested in the interaction between their own hybrid mismatch rules and any rules that New Zealand introduce into law . The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is interested in the regulatory proposal to the extent that it affects bank regulatory capital. Submissions to discussion document There were 20 submissions made to the September 2016 Government discussion document. Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals both in general views and specific coverage. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package , subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions of some variety. However, a greater number of submitters were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand. Submissions also covered a number of specific aspects of, and general concerns with, the proposals, including the complexity of the proposals and that New Zealand should not be in the first wave of countries adopting the proposals. Further and ongoing consultation We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers ' Association) in order to discuss specific design issues relating to hybrid mismatch arrangements. We have also consulted with officials representing Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the proposed rules work as intended , and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation . We have also consulted with the Reserve Bank. The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 7 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Four options were considered in the development of this regulatory proposal. These options are mutually exclusive and can be regarded as four points on a decision spectrum measuring how closely (if it all) New Zealand aligns itself with the OECD recommendations in dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements. None of the options (with the exception of the status quo option) are non-regulatory opt ions. This is because our judgment is that the policy problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot be addressed without changing tax rules, and that is something that can only be done through the use of legislation (as per section 22(a) of the Constitution Act 1986). These options are what we consider other countries dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements will consider in their policy development process. The United Kingdom and Australia can both be said to have chosen their own version of option 2. Some other countries have had rules to deal with hybrid mismatches that predate the OECD 's work in this area. Status quo: No action This option relies on New Zealand's existing law (including the GAAR) to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements and avoids the increased compliance costs and administrative costs of the other options. The status quo option also contemplates that other countries have introduced or will introduce their own hybrid mismatch rules, some of which will neutralise hybrid mismatch arrangements relating to New Zealand. Option 1: Strict adoption of OECD recommendations The OECD recommendations as set out in its BEPS Action 2 report are a comprehensive set of principle-based rules to counteract all types of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Option 1 is to strictly adopt those recommendations as described by the OECD into New Zealand domestic law. This option would deal with the range of hybrid mismatch arrangements targeted by the OECD to the extent they are found in or affect New Zealand . lt would have the advantage of interacting well with other countries that similarly adopt the OECD recommendations into their domestic law. Option 2: Tailored adoption of OECD recommendations Option 2 is to adopt the core principles of the OECD recommendations with suitable modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This option bears close relation to Option 1 as it involves introducing OECD- consistent hybrid rules unless there is a compelling reason to depart from the OECD approach. Thus, this option would solve the policy problem while ensuring that particular New Zealand issues are addressed . Option 2 also recognises that there are some instances where New Zealand's existing tax laws are sufficient (or can be made sufficient with relatively minor amendment) to achieve the effect intended by an OECD recommendation . Option 3: Targeted hybrid rules Option 3 is to introduce targeted hybrid rules that address only the significant hybrid mismatches that the Government is aware of. This option would solve the policy problem by addressing the current hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand. lt would avoid Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 8 enacting rules targeted at arrangements which are not currently seen in New Zealand. Consultation These four options were identified prior to consultation. The September 2016 discussion document proposed adoption of the OECD recommendations (options 1 and 2) and sought feedback on how that should be done. The document stated the Government's alternative options as option 3 and maintaining the status quo and concluded that they were not the best way forward. Consultation has affected the nature of option 2 in particular and has been helpful for options analysis generally. ,-------~-- 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government's vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency of compliance -compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible • Efficiency of administration -administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible • Neutrality-the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible • Fairness and equity-similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way • Sustainability-the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were and continue to be considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? We ruled out designing a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This is for reasons of international compatibility and to save compliance costs.

Recommended Not recommended Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS • Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 10 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? We consider that option 2 is the best option for addressing the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. lt is an internationally consistent, proactive option which delivers net benefits to New Zealand greater than that of the other options considered. Option 2 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand's tax system. Businesses that are able to exploit hybrid mismatch arrangements can currently operate at lower effective tax rates when compared with other businesses. This can result in a 'hybrid' business crowding out more productive investment and making international investment decisions based on whether a mismatch is available rather than commercial grounds. In addition, the imposition of higher taxes elsewhere in order to make up lost tax revenue due to the use of hybrid mismatches is likely to be less efficient than imposing more moderate taxes across all economic actors. By eliminating the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements in a comprehensive way, these inefficiencies can be removed. In a related sense, option 2 will help to improve the equity and fairness of the New Zealand tax system. Unintended tax benefits that are streamed to some taxpayers who are able to take advantage of hybrid mismatches means that a greater tax burden must fall on other taxpayers (such as purely domestic firms) who do not have the hybrid mismatch opportunities that cross border businesses do. Accordingly, introducing rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements will restore some fairness to the tax system as those tax burdens will be shared more equally. Option 2 will also have revenue collection benefits. The New Zealand tax revenue loss caused by the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is difficult to estimate because the full extent of arrangements involving New Zealand is unknown and because the behavioural effects of introducing hybrid mismatch rules are difficult to ascertain. However, the tax revenue at stake is significant in the cases that Inland Revenue is aware of. Importantly, the case for New Zealand to adopt the OECD recommendations is strengthened by the fact that other countries have enacted, or are proposing to enact, hybrid mismatch rules. This is because a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving a New Zealand counterparty may still be neutralised by the other country if they have a 'secondary' right to counteract under OECD principles. In that case, the tax benefit of the hybrid mismatch would be eliminated, but the tax collected would be by the counterparty country. In these circumstances, New Zealand would be better off having its own hybrid mismatch rules so that it can collect revenue when it has the priority to do so under the OECD recommendations. Whether New Zealand or the counterparty country collects any additional revenue as a result of implementing the rules depends on the actions taken by the affected business. Option 2 is ultimately a balance between the positive impacts described above and the trade- off compliance costs. lt attempts to introduce a comprehensive set of rules which is adjusted for the New Zealand tax environment. For instance, we identified early in the policy development process that one of the OECD recommendations would not interact smoothly with New Zealand's approach to the taxation of the foreign branches of New Zealand companies. The recommendation in question had to be modified under option 2 so that the tax treatment of a simple offshore branch structure of a New Zealand company (which is not part of the policy problem) would be unaffected by the introduction of the hybrid mismatch Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 11 rules. We have also recommended a delay to the effective date of an OECD-recommended rule which applies to what are known as "unstructured imported mismatches". This rule could cause undue compliance costs if it was to come into effect at the same time as the other rules. Delaying its effective date until a significant number of other countries have introduced hybrid mismatch rules means the associated New Zealand-specific compliance costs will either disappear or will be no greater than the costs faced by a multinational group operating in those other countries. Accordingly, the compliance costs of the regulatory proposal are to be minimised to the extent possible, while still introducing a comprehensive set of rules to deal with the range of OECD-identified hybrid mismatches. This is where option 2 shows its advantage over option 1 which we view as having similar efficiency, fairness and revenue benefits. Option 1 would result in relatively higher compliance costs because the OECD recommendations are designed as a general set of best-practice rules and, in regards to their detail, are not necessarily optimal for individual countries such as New Zealand. When compared with option 1, option 2 ensures that the rules are workable and appropriate for the New Zealand tax environment. lt is also important to note that the ongoing compliance costs relating to this regulatory issue are expected to be optional in the majority of cases. The proposed rules will apply to taxpayers who use a hybrid mismatch arrangement after the rules become effective. Those taxpayers will generally have the option of incurring one-off costs to restructure into non- hybrid arrangements and remove themselves from the scope of the proposed rules. Any higher tax payments resulting from the non-status quo options will make cross border investment less attractive for taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements. However, these taxpayers should not be allowed to exploit hybrid mismatches to achieve a competitive advantage over taxpayers that do not use hybrid mismatch arrangements (such as purely domestic firms). Further, a significant number of New Zealand's major investment partners have introduced or will introduce hybrid mismatch rules. Other countries adopting these rules means that in many cases the tax efficiency of hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand will be negated through the operation of the other country's rules on the counterparty, As a result, we believe that any impacts on inbound and outbound cross border investment from introducing hybrid mismatch rules in New Zealand will be low. The status quo option would involve the least complexity and lowest compliance costs. However, similar to the cross-border investment discussion above, taxpayers whose groups deal with New Zealand's major trading partners that are adopting hybrid mismatch rules would have to understand the impact of those rules. The additional complexity of New Zealand having hybrid mismatch rules would therefore be lessened by the international momentum in this area. Option 3 is an option that was preferred by many submitters to the Government discussion document on hybrid mismatch arrangements. Submitters pointed out that many of the structures considered by the OECD to be problematic have not been seen in New Zealand and therefore do not need to be counteracted. They also argued that the OECD recommendations are complex and have the potential for overreach. We do not think a targeted approach would serve New Zealand well when compared with option 2. The OECD recommendations are a coherent package intending to deal to the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements exhaustively. Deliberately omitting aspects of the recommendations from New Zealand's response may cause taxpayers to exploit those remaining hybrid mismatch opportunities (which may even be seen as tacitly blessed). To the extent that happens, the efficiency, revenue, and fairness benefits of option 3 would be eroded. In Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS & Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 12 addition, other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have introduced or are intending to introduce a relatively comprehensive set of hybrid mismatch rules. If New Zealand does the same it will ensure our rules are internationally comparable and that they interact well with the rules of other countries without significant compliance issues. By favouring option 2, we also have consulted extensively on the OECD recommendations and how they should best be introduced into New Zealand law. This consultation has enabled us to design suitable modifications to the OECD recommendations to reduce complexity and compliance costs, limit overreach, and in some cases, increase the efficiency of the outcomes. \] 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties I Comment: nature of cost or Impact Evidence (identify) benefit (e.g. ongoing, one-off), $m present value, certainty evidence and assumption (e.g. for monetised (High, compliance rates), risks impacts; high, medium or medium or low for low) non-monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Compliance costs: Increased costs Medium Medium from understanding the rules and applying them to taxpayers' transactions and structures.

The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence. 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? As discussed above, allowing the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses . This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities (and/or employ other BEPS strategies) is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders as it is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'? Yes, option 2 (tailored adoption of OECD recommendations) conforms to the expectations for the design of regulatory systems document. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 14 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The major exceptions are: • the proposed rule for "unstructured imported mismatch arrangements", which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 January 2020; and • the proposed rules applying to New Zealand "reverse hybrids", which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 April 2019. Another exception we recommend is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules (until the next call date) hybrid financial instruments issued by banks as regulatory capital (in Australian or New Zealand) to third party investors before the discussion document release date of September 2016. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider an application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government's intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Audit staff will need to familiarise themselves with the proposed rules and how they operate in practice. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment. In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their hybrid mismatch arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we are minimising compliance costs where possible under our tailored adoption of the OECD recommendations. For example, and as mentioned above, we have delayed the application date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule contained in the OECD recommendations to acknowledge that it would be significantly more difficult and costly to comply with than the other rules if it applied at the outset. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements 1 15 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. However, it may be difficult to assess the true impact of this regulatory proposal. This is because many taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of the proposed rules. lt will be difficult to measure the full extent of this behavioural effect. Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post- implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

Impact Summary: Hybrids/NRWT issue Section 1: General information Purpose Inland R evenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice s et out in this Impact Summary, except a s otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice h as been produced for the purpose of informing policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis This analysis has been limited by the following factors: • The scale of the problem (in term s of its fiscal costs) h as not been accurately identified b e c a u s e it will depend on the behavioural resp o n se of taxpayers, which may in turn be informed by work currently being undertaken by Inland Revenue. • No consultation with external stakeholders (including th o se who would be affected by the proposed action). Responsible Manager (signature and date): Paul Kilford Policy and Strategy Inland R evenue 22 November 2017 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 1 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem identified arises only in a very specific s e t of fact circum stances: • There is a New Zealand branch or “perm anent establishm ent” (PE) of a non-resident company; • That PE borrows money from another non-resident in the sam e o v e rsea s jurisdiction a s the P E ’s corporate residence; • The borrowing tak es place under a “hybrid” instrument which m ean s it is treated a s one form of financing (debt) by New Zealand, but ano th er form of financing (equity) by the other country. An exam ple is s e t out in the diagram below. The view until now of Inland R evenue and m any taxpayers h as b een that New Zealand can withhold non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on the paym ents. However, som e taxpayers have disputed this view and a s a co n seq u en ce Inland R evenue is currently reconsidering w hether it is legally correct. Inland R evenue has sought Crown Law’s advice, and h as indicated that it may well decide the law d o e s not permit NRWT to be withheld. This interpretation is b ased on a view that the paym ents are dividends for the purposes of our double tax agreem ents (DTA). B ecause double tax agreem ents over-ride dom estic law, this view would, if adopted, m ean that the taxpayer would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for the paym ents (b e c au se New Zealand treats the paym ents a s interest), but the paym ents would not be subject to NRWT (b ecau se the other country and the DTA treat them a s dividends). This is contrary to the intent of the provisions, a s deductible outbound interest should always have Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T em plate | 2 NRWT (or its alternative, approved issuer levy (AIL)) withheld unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise. The hybrid mismatch m easu res already proposed and approved by Cabinet (and covered by the regulatory impact analysis: http://taxpolicy .ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps- 20-ria-hybrids-july-2017.pdf) would en su re that paym ents m ade under such hybrids could not be both deductible in New Zealand and n o n -a s s e s s a b le o v erseas. In som e circum stances the m e asu res would still allow a deduction in New Zealand for the paym ents. However the m e asu re s do not cover w hether NRWT m ust be withheld from such payments. Consequently, the currently proposed hybrid m e asu re s would still permit paym ents under a hybrid financial instrument to be deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT. This contrasts with the tax treatm ent of dividends, which a re not deductible. It also contrasts with the tax treatm ent of ordinary interest, which is deductible but subject to NRWT (or AIL). As a result of this, the currently proposed hybrid mismatch m easu res would remove the incentive to use th e se types of hybrids in most, but not all c a s e s. The hybrids could still be attractive if the non-resident w as not concerned about the assessability of the paym ents in its hom e jurisdiction. For example, if the non-resident had tax losses, w as tax exempt, or simply preferred to pay tax in its home jurisdiction (as m ost Australian com panies do due to their imputation system). If no action is taken, Inland R evenue’s changed interpretation could therefore expose the New Zealand tax b a se to significant risk. It is difficult to estim ate the fiscal risk, a s it d ep en d s in part on tax p ay ers’ behaviour, and in part on w hether section BG 1 would apply to counteract the arrangem ents (section BG 1 may apply to som e arrangem ents but not others). The risk is in two parts: a risk that $60 million of previously paid NRWT or AIL might be refunded in the n ear term, and an ongoing risk th at $15 million per annum of NRWT or AIL might no longer be payable. Both risks could materialise a s a fiscal cost against existing baselines. Addressing the problem will increase baselines by $1 million per annum on a go forward basis, relative to the status quo. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The only taxpayers affected are those that enter into the structure illustrated in the response to question 2.1 above. However, a s far a s Inland R evenue is aw are, many of the taxpayers that use th e se structures already pay NRWT or AIL in accordance with the policy intent. As a result, for m ost affected taxpayers, any change in the law to align with the policy intent would only reaffirm Inland R ev en u e’s pre-existing legal interpretation - and so would not involve the imposition of additional tax or compliance costs com pared with their current position. However, the proposed approach would stop som e of th e se taxpayers from claiming a tax refund for the NRWT or AIL they paid in previous y ears if Inland R evenue’s interpretation chan g es. It would also stop som e of them from ceasing to pay AIL or NRWT in future years. A small num ber of taxpayers have disputed Inland R ev en u e’s current legal view and not paid NRWT or AIL. T h ese taxpayers would be affected by the proposed change, a s they would now be required to pay NRWT or AIL. However, this is the outcom e we want to achieve with the proposed change, a s the policy intent is for all taxpayers to be subject to NRWT or AIL Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 3 on cross border deductible interest paym ents (unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise). 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Limitations in respect of stakeholder e n g ag em en t a re s e t out in section 5, below. The scope of this problem is limited by the extremely narrow fact-pattern identified. The proposed regulatory action h a s two major interdependencies: BEPS and hybrids The current problem with the NRWT rules only arises for hybrid mismatch arrangem ents. Hybrid mismatch arrangem ents are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangem ents that create a tax advantage by exploiting differences in the tax treatm ent of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries. The result of hybrid mismatch arrangem ents is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangem ent relates. In July 2017 the Government announced th at it would com prehensively adopt the OECD’s hybrid mismatch recom m endations, with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. In addition to the regulatory impact analysis referred to in resp o n se to question 2.1, the relevant Cabinet papers can be found at: • http://taxpolicv.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps-13-cabinet-paper- overview-july-2017.pdf (which covers the BEPS p ackage more broadly); and • http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps-19-cabinet-paper- hvbrids-july-2017.pdf (which is specific to the hybrids proposals). The hybrids work is a relevant interdependency b e c a u s e it estab lish es that Cabinet wished to "... sen d the clear m e ssa g e that using hybrid mismatch arrangem ents should not produce a tax advantage ...” (see paragraph 7 of the hybrids-specific Cabinet p a p er linked above). Therefore, we consider that addressing the problem identified in this Impact Sum m ary is consistent with bringing into effect the outcom e clearly desired by Cabinet for hybrid m ism atches. As explained in 2.1 above, however, the existing hybrids m e asu res still allow for cross border financial instruments to carry paym ents which a re deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT. Accordingly, the proposed m easure would supplem ent the existing hybrids m e asu res by cancelling a further hybrid mismatch tax advantage. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Sum m ary T em plate | 4 NRWT amendments New Zealand h as recently reviewed and updated its rules related to NRWT and its alternative, AIL. T hese reforms w ere enacted a s part of the Taxation (Annual R ates for 2016-17, Closely Held Com panies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. The relevant Regulatory Impact Statem ent can be found at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-ris-archcrm-bill/nrwt- related-party-and-branch-lending-nrwt-change s As s e t out in paragraph 26 of that document, the objective of the reforms w as to “... ensure the return received by a non-resident lender from an associated borrower (or a party that is economically equivalent to an associated borrower) will be subject to NRWT and, at a time, that is not significantly later than when income tax deductions for the funding costs are available to the borrower.” In the structure that is the subject of this Impact Summary, the potential outcome is that a taxpayer will (ab sen t the proposed m easure) be entitled to a deduction but have no corresponding NRWT liability. This is contrary to the stated policy objective. Accordingly, the proposed m easure supplem ents the previous NRWT am endm ents by ensuring that NRWT cannot be avoided for deductible interest paym ents on hybrid instruments. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 5 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? W e have considered four options, three of which involve addressing the identified problem by ensuring that NRWT applies in all instances where a deduction is allowed in New Zealand for an interest e x p en se and for this outcome to occur notwithstanding the effect of our double tax ag reem en ts (the “policy solution”). However, they differ in their proposed application date. The four options are: • Option 1: The status quo, which would allow Inland R evenue to finalise its legal view and allow that view to prevail on all existing and future arrangem ents. This would likely result in the problem identified in 2.1 continuing. • Option 2: Provide that NRWT or AIL applies to any deductible interest paym ent with a New Zealand source (the policy solution). The policy solution would have prospective effect. • Option 3: Enact the policy solution retrospectively to the earliest date from which taxpayers can claim refunds for AIL or NRWT overpaym ents. • Option 4: Enact the policy solution retrospectively to the earliest date from which taxpayers can claim refunds for AIL or NRWT overpaym ents, but also include a “sav in g s” provision for taxpayers that have already adopted the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable prior to the Bill containing the policy solution being introduced. Currently the potential non-applicability of NRWT or AIL a rises under New Z ealand’s DTAs. DTAs are incorporated into New Zealand law under the Income Tax Act 2007, which s tates that DTAs have effect notwithstanding any other provision of that Act (subject to som e exceptions). Accordingly, the policy solution would need to expressly override our DTAs in the am ending legislation. W e note that Australia already h as a rule that legislates the policy solution, including an express DTA override. Criteria The four options are a s s e s s e d in this Impact Summ ary against the following criteria: • Economic efficiency - the tax system should, to the extent possible, apply neutrally and consistently to economically equivalent transactions. This m ean s the tax system should not provide a tax preferred treatm ent for one transaction over another similar transaction or provide an advantage to one b usiness over another. This helps en su re that the most efficient forms of investment which provide the b est returns to New Zealand a s a whole are undertaken. At the sam e time there is a concern that tax es should not unduly raise the cost of capital and discourage inbound investment. • Fairness - the options should en su re that the law is see n a s treating people fairly and consistently and should not allow people to avoid their tax obligations (including any foreign tax obligations). • Integrity of the tax system - the options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely fashion while not providing opportunities for tax avoidance or arbitrary tax reductions Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T em plate | 6 Analysis In th e following options analysis, an option having a fiscal risk is s e e n a s a negative. However, this will not automatically disqualify the option. There are times when changing the law will have a fiscal cost or risk for the Government, but this is nevertheless desirable b e ca u se of the gains in one or more of the other a s s e s s m e n t criteria. Option 1 - not preferred W e consider that the policy solution is preferable to the status quo. The status quo will likely m ean that a PE would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for paym ents on certain hybrid instrum ents (as the paym ents a re characterised a s “interest” under New Zealand dom estic law), but the paym ents would not be subject to NRWT (as the paym ents are characterised a s “dividends” under the DTA). This is contrary to the intent of the relevant DTA provisions, a s outbound interest, which is deductible in determining the profits of a PE, should always have NRWT withheld unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise (e.g. the sovereign wealth fund exem ptions provided in som e of our DTAs). It also e x p o se s the New Zealand tax b a se to a fiscal risk, a s it allows a deduction from New Zealand tax for a paym ent without a corresponding tax liability for the recipient. Accordingly, the statu s quo negatively affects the integrity of the tax system . The general anti avoidance rule in section BG 1 might still apply to som e of the arrangem ents using th e se kinds of hybrid instruments, in which c a s e NRWT or AIL would still need to be paid. However, there is a high risk that section BG 1 would not apply to other arrangem ents we are aw are of. In addition, the status quo option negatively affects both fairness and econom ic efficiency. This is b eca u se it would give a competitive adv an tag e to a multinational firm that u s e s the relevant funding structure over a dom estic firm or another, more compliant, multinational. This is contrary to the objectives of the BEPS work more generally and the hybrids project in particular. Under the statu s quo option, Inland R evenue’s changed interpretation could expose the New Zealand tax b a se to significant risk. It is difficult to estim ate the fiscal risk, a s it dep en d s in part on taxpayers’ behaviour, and in part on w hether section BG 1 would apply to counteract the arrangem ents (section BG 1 may apply to som e arrangem ents but not others). The risk is in two parts: a risk that $60 million of previously paid NRWT or AIL might be refunded in the n ear term, and an ongoing risk that $15 million per annum of NRWT or AIL might no longer be payable. Both risks could materialise a s a fiscal cost against existing baselines. Addressing the problem will increase baselines by $1 million per annum on a go forward basis, relative to the statu s quo. Option 2 - not preferred This option would ad d re ss the policy issue identified in 2.1. It would also have ad v an tag es in term s of fairness, economic efficiency and the integrity of the tax system com pared with the statu s quo option (by eliminating the status q u o ’s disadvantages in th e se regards). However, th e se ad v an tag es would only arise for future income years. Taxpayers who used the relevant hybrid structure in previous income y ears may be entitled to request a refund of the Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 7 NRWT or AIL they previously paid. W e consider that it would be unfair to allow taxpayers to claim refunds of their previously paid AIL or NRWT in th e se circum stances. It would also reduce the integrity of the tax system . It is clear that NRWT / AIL w as intended to be payable on cross border interest paym ents. This w as also Inland R evenue’s interpretation of the law until now, which w as followed by many taxpayers. The ability of so m e taxpayers to avoid NRWT AIL through the u se of a hybrid instrument is a clear loophole in the current rules, and taxpayers aw are of the issue would have perceived it a s such. Accordingly, we consider there should be no legitimate expectation for taxpayers to obtain a refund for any AIL or NRWT previously paid in resp ect of th ese hybrid instruments. W e estim ate that there is a potential one-off fiscal risk of $60 million under this option. This is b e ca u se taxpayers that are known to use this structure may be able to obtain refunds of their previously paid AIL/NRWT under this option if Inland R evenue ch an g es its current legal interpretation (and the previously paid NRWT or AIL h a s b een included in the fiscal baseline),. This option would also give rise to a potential $1 million per annum fiscal benefit com pared with the current baseline. This is b ecau se taxpayers in active disputes would be required to pay $1 million of NRWT in future tax years if the policy solution w as implemented (and this $1 million h as not been included in current fiscal baselines). Option 3 - not preferred Option 3 would ad d ress the policy issue in 2.1. As a retrospective m easure, it would also stop taxpayers from claiming a refund for any previously paid NRWT or AIL. Accordingly, it is preferable to option 2 a s it h a s ad v an tag es in term s of fairness, econom ic efficiency and integrity of the tax system , over the statu s quo option in respect of both future and p ast income years. This option also h as the lowest potential fiscal risk of all the options (equal with option 4). This option also h as the largest potential fiscal benefit. This is becau se, in addition to the fiscal benefit of option 2 in respect of future income years, this option would also require the taxpayers that have disputed Inland R evenue’s current legal interpretation to pay NRWT in respect of p ast tax years in the event that Inland R evenue’s current legal interpretation changes. This NRWT h as not been included in the current fiscal baselines. Accordingly, this gives rise to an additional potential one-off fiscal benefit of approximately $5 million. However, this option would also retrospectively ch ange the law for those taxpayers who have already taken the position that NRWT or AIL w a s not payable and entered into disputes with Inland Revenue. This would be fair, a s different taxpayers in the sam e position would be treated the sam e. In addition, excluding taxpayers who have taken an aggressive tax position from the retrospective application of the rules s ee m s to reward them for their aggressive behaviour. However, there is a wider issue of legal certainty involved. If Parliament retrospectively ch an g es a law taxpayers have relied on, then this m ean s taxpayers can never fully rely on the law (as stated at the time) in any dispute with the Government. This would erode the integrity of the tax system from a wider perspective. It would also erode perceptions of fairness, in that the Government might be perceived a s misusing its legislative power to win a Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Sum m ary T em plate | 8 dispute with taxpayers. Option 4 - preferred This option a d d re s s e s the policy problem s et out in 2.1. It also has fairness, economic efficiency and integrity of the tax system ad v an tag es over the status quo option in respect of both future and p ast income years. Although this option is slightly less fair than option 3, it b est supports the integrity of the tax system . This is b eca u se it prevents taxpayers from claiming refunds for previously paid NRWT or AIL, while preserving the legal position of taxpayers that previously adopted the position that NRWT or AIL w as not payable prior to the introduction of the Bill containing the policy solution. This option would also give rise to a potential fiscal benefit of $1 million per annum compared with current baseline. This is b eca u se taxpayers that are still disputing Inland R evenue’s current position would be required to pay $1 million of NRWT in future tax years (and this $1 million has not been included in current fiscal baselines). W e note that this option d o es have a smaller potential fiscal benefit than option 3, a s it does not require taxpayers disputing Inland R evenue’s current legal interpretation to pay NRWT in resp ect of p ast tax years. W e estim ate the reduced potential fiscal benefit to be approximately $5 million. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? W e consider Option 4 to be the b est option. This option a d d re s s e s the policy problem set out in 2.1. It also h as advantages, in term s of fairness, economic efficiency and the integrity of the tax system , over the status quo option in resp ect of both future and past income years. Although this option is less fair than option 3, it b est supports the integrity of the tax system. This is b ecau se Option 4 prevents taxpayers from claiming refunds for previously paid NRWT or AIL, while preserving the legal position of taxpayers that previously adopted the position that NRWT or AIL w as not payable prior to the introduction of the BEPS Bill. Accordingly it a d d re s s e s the policy problem without the draw backs of options 2 and 3. Option 4 also h a s the lowest equal fiscal risk. However, it lacks Option 3’s potential one-off $5 million fiscal benefit. Even so, we consider the lack of this fiscal benefit is outweighed by the importance of protecting the integrity of the law from a wider perspective. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 9 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected partiesComment: nature of cost or benefit (eg Impact (identify)ongoing, one-off), evidence and $m present value, for assum ption (eg compliance rates), risks monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, com pared to taking no action Regulated partiesThe proposed approach rem oves the ability of taxpayers to avoid NRWT or AIL for future periods. It d o es not ch ange the previously adopted position for p ast periods. W e a re aw are of several taxpayers who have entered into the hybrid structure s e t out in 2.1. W e have calculated the fiscal costs based on th ese taxpayers. If there are further taxpayers, then the impact will be increased. W e do not expect there to be other taxpayers with a significant value of such hybrid structures, but we cannot confirm this. W e note that m any taxpayers already pay NRWT and AIL under the current rules. Accordingly the proposed approach will not increase their costs com pared with their current position. However it will deprive them of a future cost saving if com pared with the status quo option if Inland R evenue ch an g es its legal view. A potential $16m per annum cost arising from additional NRWT or AIL for future y ears com pared with doing nothing if Inland R evenue ch an g es its legal view. A potential one off $60m co st arising from the denial the NRWT or AIL refunds which taxpayers may be entitled to for p ast y ears if Inland Revenue c h an g es its legal view and no action is taken.

None Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 10 Expected benefits of proposed approach, com pared to taking no action Regulated parties The regulated parties will be required to pay NRWT or AIL regardless of w hether they enter into hybrid structures. This will be a cost for taxpayers that have entered into such structures. However it will be a benefit for other taxpayers, a s it will en su re that taxpayers who have entered into such structures cannot obtain a competitive ad vantage over dom estic firms and more compliant multinationals. Accordingly the proposed approach will improve econom ic efficiency. No monetary value Regulators With the proposed law change, Inland R evenue will not need to consider w hether the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 applies to any of the arrangem ents (other than taxpayers not subject to the retrospective application of the rule). It can be difficult and resource intensive to consider the application of section BG 1. Accordingly the proposed approach will sav e Inland R evenue administrative costs, and potentially court costs. However th e se a re impossible to quantify at this stage. Too difficult to quantify Wider governm ent The Government will be able to collect NRWT or AIL from all deductible cross border interest paym ents, in accordance with the policy intent. This will potentially sav e the Government up to $60m in one off costs for p ast years (in respect of refunds for previously paid NRWT or AIL), and 16m per annum for future years. A potential $60m one off benefit. A potential $16m benefit per annum going forward.

Non-monetised benefits Administrative savings, a s the Governm ent will not have to consider the application of section BG 1 to most arrangem ents. Medium Economic efficiency benefits from an equal application of NRWT to all cross border interest payments. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 11 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The proposed approach involves the third explicit override of New Z ealand’s DTAs in recent years. Accordingly, it may aro u se concern that New Zealand d o es not respect its DTAs. However, the proposed approach confirms the interpretive approach previously adopted by NZ, and currently adopted by som e of our DTA partners and mirrors a rule already in place in Australia. It also closes a clear loophole if Inland R evenue were to change its legal interpretation. Accordingly, we do not expect disagreem ent over the policy outcome. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? B ecause this problem p o ses a base-m aintenance risk, Inland R evenue and Treasury officials have not consulted with the private sector. This m eans that the problem identification and options have been generated by officials based on the information available. It is recognised that private secto r input is an important part of the generic tax policy process. In saying this, it is not unusual for base-m aintenance chan g es to be m ade without consultation b ecau se there is a risk that publicising the existence of a perceived loophole may incentivise taxpayers to take advantage of its existence in the short term. In addition, the m easure only legislatively confirms the tax treatm ent Inland R evenue has been applying to date. It also closes what would be a clear loophole if Inland Revenue were to ch an g e that tax treatm ent. Further, there will be an opportunity for the public to submit on the m easure during the S elect Committee pro cess and feedback will be considered at that point. There may be som e private sector concern about the am endm ent, given that it applies retrospectively and will be the third explicit override of our DTAs in recent years. However, we do not expect disagreem ent over the policy outcome. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 12 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Section 6: Implementation and operation The proposed solution will be given effect by inclusion in the Taxation (Neutralising B ase Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill 2017, which is scheduled to be introduced into the House in D ecem ber 2017. Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcem ent of the new arrangem ents. W e do not have any concern about our ability to do so. The new arrangem ents will have retrospective effect, except for taxpayers that have, prior to introduction of the Bill, taken the position th at NRWT or AIL is not payable. W e consider that this allows sufficient preparation time for regulated parties, as: • the proposed approach will only affect a small num ber of taxpayers that have disputed Inland R evenue’s current legal interpretation and not settled the dispute; • the taxpayers that have maintained their position that NRWT or AIL is not payable are aw are that Inland R evenue historically d o e s not agree, and so a re on notice that their current practice may not be acceptable; • many of those currently take the view that NRWT or AIL is payable, and so they will not need to change their current practice. W e will mitigate implementation risks by publicising the proposed approach a s part of the Commentary on the Bill. W e will also inform the taxpayers who currently take the view that no NRWT or AIL is payable of the proposed law change. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 13 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The new arrangem ents will be monitored through Inland R evenue’s normal risk review and audit function. This will check w hether taxpayers are complying with the proposed approach. If any follow-up legislative action is required it will go through the Generic Tax Policy P ro cess (GTPP). 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The proposed approach simply closes a potential loophole and confirms the Governm ent’s intended tax treatm ent for cross border interest paym ents. Accordingly, we consider that no specific review of the arrangem ents is necessary. Stakeholders will have the opportunity to raise concerns during the S elect Committee process. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that h as been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland R evenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the pro cess is the implementation and review stage, which involves post­ implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. In practice, any ch an g es identified a s n ecessary following enactm ent would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP.

Why is Government intervention required? The problem the proposals discussed in this impact statement seek to address is the use of debt financing by taxpayers to reduce their New Zealand income tax liability significantly. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The adoption of a restricted transfer pricing rule for determining the allowable interest rate (for tax purposes) on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower will help ensure interest rates on such loans cannot be excessive. In addition, changing the way deductible debt levels are calculated under the thin capitalisation rules will ensure that taxpayers with little equity are unable to have large amounts of deductible debt. These changes will provide a solution that is sustainable , efficient and equitable, while minimising impacts on compliance and administration costs. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that the new interest limitation rules are forecast to produce approximately $80-90 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to these proposals which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. R eg ul atory Imp ac t Assess ment: BEP S - s tr ength enin g o ur int eres t li mit ati on rule s 1 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 25 of 76 Where do the costs fall? The costs primarily fall on foreign-owned taxpayers operating in New Zealand (though there may be some minor impacts on New Zealand-owned taxpayers with international operations). Tax payments for affected parties are forecast to increase by approximately $80-90 million per year on an ongoing basis. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? As with all tax rules, there is some risk of taxpayer non-compliance. However, this is mitigated as the rules predominately apply to large companies- and the tax affairs of large companies are closely monitored by Inland Revenue. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. There is no incompat ibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems '. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is moderate evidence in relation to the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debt, and good evidence in relation to allowable debt levels . Inland Revenue has some data on interest rates paid on related-party debts, as well as examples of structures that appear to have the effect of increasing the interest rate on such debt. However, this data is not comprehensive. Inland Revenue has data on the debt, asset and equity levels of significant foreign-owned enterprises, which allows an accurate estimation of the impact of the non-debt liability adjustment for those firms. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.

Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 3 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 27 of 76 Impact Statement: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement , except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem While good evidence of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is generally difficult to come by, there is an exception for BEPS in relation to interest payments . Fairly good data on interest deductions (especially for large firms) is available for analysis through Inland Revenue's International Questionnaire. This dataset includes debt levels, related-party debt levels, and related-party interest payments of large foreign-owned firms. However, there are still limitations to that data - for example, data on interest rates on related-party debt (and the interest rates facing a New Zealand subsidiary's parent company) is not captured in the Questionnaire. Where possible, this information was obtained from other sources (such as credit ratings of parent companies and disclosed related -party interest rates in financial statements) or estimated (for example, estimating interest rates based on related-party interest payments and related-party debt amounts). However, this other data is less comprehensive and accurate. Consultation The preferred option in relation to limiting interest rates on related-party interest rates has not been subject to consultation . This was because it was developed in response to submissions on the original proposals . However, it is similar in many respects to the original proposal, which was subject to consultation. In addition, to ensure the rule operates effectively and to mitigate the risk of unintended outcomes, it will be subject to consultation with submitters on the technical detail.

BEPS BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries' domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over MNEs not engaged in BEPS and domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens' trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter BEPS. BEPS using interest deductions The use of debt financing is one of the simplest ways of shifting taxable profits from one jurisdiction to another. For example, because interest payments are deductible, a related- party cross-border loan from a parent to a subsidiary can be used to reduce taxes payable in the jurisdiction that the subsidiary is located. New Zealand's BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. This includes developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). If no further action is taken, MNEs that currently have high levels of debt in New Zealand, or highly-priced related-party debt, will be able to continue paying little tax in New Zealand. There is also a risk that additional MNEs would adopt similar structures. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand's tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government's distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. New Zealand's tax system has been the subject of numerous broad-based reviews - most recently the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in 2010. it is well regarded and generally functions well. No other government agencies have a direct interest in the tax system. However, a good tax system is important for a well-functioning economy - many government agencies therefore Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 5 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 29 of 76 have an indirect interest in the tax system. Foreign investment in New Zealand is generally taxed under our company tax at 28 percent. New Zealand's tax system has rules that limit the deductible debt levels and interest rates for taxpayers with foreign connections. These rules affect only foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies. Thin capitalisation rules New Zealand has "thin capitalisation" rules to limit tax deductions for interests that non- residents are allowed. These rules generally require an investment owned by a non-resident to have a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 60 percent (interest deductions are denied to the extent the allowable debt-to-asset ratio is exceeded). Thin capitalisation rules also apply to New Zealand-owned firms (frequently referred to as the "outbound thin capitalisation rules"). These rules generally require a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 75 percent. They are designed to prevent a disproportionate portion of a New Zealand company's debt being placed in New Zealand. Like the tax system as a whole, we consider that the thin capitalisation rules are serving us well. The rules are well understood and taxpayers subject to the rules generally have conservative debt levels and, for those with related-party debt, the debt is at conservative interest rates - as evidenced by the significant amount of tax paid by foreign-owned firms operating in New Zealand (foreign controlled firms paid 39 percent of company tax in the 2015 tax year). Transfer pricing rules lt is important to limit not just the quantum of debt in New Zealand, but also the interest rate on that debt. For third-party debt, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to obtain as low an interest rate as possible. However, these pressures do not necessarily exist in a related-party context. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. Broadly speaking (and as they apply to related-party debt), these rules seek to ensure that the interest rate on a given loan contract is in line with what would have been agreed between unrelated parties. NRWT While payments of interest to related parties are deductible, they are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). NRWT applies at either 15 percent or 10 percent, depending on whether New Zealand has a Double Taxation Treaty with the interest recipient's home jurisdiction. This means that, while the use of debt can reduce tax payable in New Zealand, it does not completely eliminate it. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 6 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 30 of 76 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? A simple way that non-residents can reduce their New Zealand tax liability significantly is by capitalising a New Zealand investment with debt instead of equity, because they can then take interest deductions in New Zealand. This is shown in the example below. Example Australian investor A puts $1 OOm of capital in a New Zealand company as equity. Company earns $10m from sales and pays $2.8m New Zealand tax. Company pays a net dividend (not tax deductible) of $7.2m to A. Total New Zealand tax is $2.8m. Australian investor B puts $100m of capital into a New Zealand company as debt, with an interest rate of 10%. Company earns $10m from sales but has to pay $10m of tax-deductible interest to B, reducing taxable income to $0. No tax is paid by the company, but a 10% tax on interest is imposed on B (non-resident withholding tax). Total New Zealand tax is $1 m. Having a generally well regarded tax system does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An on-going policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and ensure that MNEs are paying a fair amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures - such as rules for limiting the amount of debt allowable in New Zealand, and the interest rate on that debt-are therefore important. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. This impact statement considers two related policy opportunities: • ensuring the rules for setting the allowable interest rates on related-party debt are sufficiently robust; and • ensuring the basis for setting the allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules is appropriate. Scale of the problem The OECD's Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan) included developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). We consider the fact that the OECD has included profit shifting using interest in its BEPS Action Plan as evidence that this is a significant policy issue internationally. As mentioned above, most MNEs operating here have relatively low levels of debt and do not have interest rates considered to be excessive. However, there are a small number of taxpayers with either debt levels that are too high, or interest rates that are excessive. While small in number, the fiscal impact of these arrangements is significant - we estimate the tax revenue lost is $80-90 million per year. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 7 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 31 of 76 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on scope. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stake holders The stakeholders are primarily taxpayers (in particular , MNEs) and tax advisors . The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers ' affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. Consultation already undertaken In March 2017, the Government released the discussion document BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules . The discussion document consulted on two key proposals which are considered in this impact statement - new interest limitation rules and a non-debt liabilities adjustment to the thin capitalisation rules . The Government received 27 submissions on the discussion document. Most submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals. In general, submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS risks facing New Zealand , and that part of this would involve strengthening New Zealand's rules for limiting interest deductions for firms with cross-border related-party debt. However, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward . The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Interest limitation The discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach for pricing inbound related-party loans. Instead, the allowable interest rate for such a loan would - in most instances - be set with reference to the New Zealand borrower's parent 's borrowing costs (referred to as an "interest rate cap "). General reaction Most submitters argued that the interest rate cap proposal was not necessary and should not proceed. They noted that the Government , in the discussion document BEPS - transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance , proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally . Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates . Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons , including that it: • is inconsistent with the arm's length standard, so would result in double taxation; • will increase compliance costs; • will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk ; and • has no international precedent. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 8 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 32 of 76 Only two submitters wrote in favour of the proposed cap. However, the proposal did attract positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts. Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks - "transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates , so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules ". Allowable debt levels The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand ("deductible debt"). Currently , the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer 's assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer's assets is allowable). The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer's maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer's assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest-bearing debts (a "non-debt liability adjustment " ). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provis ions , and deferred tax liabilities. General reaction Several submitters indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax). A number of other submitters argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers ' thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold. Stakeholders' views displayed no clear pattern. Two big accounting firms agreed with the proposal while two others disagreed . Similarly , of the three major stakeholder groups who submitted on the proposal , one supported and two opposed the change . Deferred tax To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable prof its and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer's non-debt liabilities could include "deferred tax liabilities ", which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer 's assets could include "deferred tax assets" which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit. All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that , for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, deferred tax liabilities should be ignored . Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer 's assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets - deferred tax assets) - (non-debt liabilities - deferred tax liabilit ies) . Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules I 9 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 33 of 76 Submitters noted that Australia's thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because: • often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future; • deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity; and • deferred tax balances can be volatile - taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them. Further consultation Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, officials are planning to undertake further public consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Related-party interest rates We have identified five mutually exclusive options to the address the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debts. Option 4 (administrative guidance) is a non-regulatory option. The other options for change involve changing New Zealand's tax legislation. Option 1: Interest rate cap (discussion document proposal) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Restricted transfer pricing Under a restricted transfer pricing approach, inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that: • There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and • All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored -unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have third-party debt featuring those terms and conditions. The types of modifications to the terms, conditions and surrounding circumstances we would seek to make under this approach are: o That the loan has no exotic terms that are generally not seen with third-party lending o That the loan is not subordinated o That the loan duration is not excessive o That the debt level of the borrower is not excessive. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower's foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- strengthening our interest limitation rules I 10 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 34 of 76 parent. This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable. This option was developed following consultation to address some of the concerns raised by submitters; however, it has not itself been subject to consultation. Option 3: Adopt EBITDA-based rule (OECD recommended approach) This option would involve limiting the amount of interest deductions a taxpayer is allowed with reference to their earnings (specifically, their profits before deductions for interest, depreciation and amortisation are taken into account, also known as their EBITDA). This new approach would completely replace the thin capitalisation rules, becoming the new method for limiting interest deductions for taxpayers with international connections. This approach would constrain the tax effectiveness of highly priced debt, since it directly limits interest deductions rather than limiting the amount of debt; a taxpayer with highly priced debt would be more likely to exceed their EBITDA limit and face interest denial. Almost all submitters did not support the adoption of an EBITDA-based rule. Option 4: Administrative guidance This option would involve Inland Revenue issuing administrative guidance on how it will assess the risk of related-party lending transactions -similar to what has recently been released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (discussed below). Under this option, related-party loans with certain features (such as having an interest rate in line with the interest rate facing the borrower's foreign parent) would be given a low risk rating and be unlikely to be challenged by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers with higher interest rates would be more likely to have their related-party loan investigated. Several submitters suggested this option be adopted in place of the interest rate cap. They argued that it would provide certainty for taxpayers who desired it, but taxpayers who value certainty less would be free to breach the guidelines. Option 5: Status quo (ordinary transfer pricing) This option would involve continuing to price related-party debt under the transfer pricing rules. As discussed above, the Government proposed strengthening these rules in the discussion document BEPS -transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. Many submitters argued that this should be sufficient to address any concerns over related- party interest rates. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 11 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 35 of 76 Relevant experience from other countries The ATO has released draft guidelines regarding the interest rates of cross-border related- party loans. 1 These guidelines are designed to encourage Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies to restructure their related-party loans into ordinary "vanilla" loans. Overall, the guidelines have a clear expectation that the interest rate on related-party loans should be in line with the foreign parent's cost of funds: "Generally, the ATO expects any pricing of a related-party debt to be in line with the commercial incentive of achieving the lowest possible 'all-in' cost to the borrower. The A TO expects, in most cases, the cost of the financing to align with the costs that could be achieved, on an arm's length basis, by the parent of the global group to which the borrower and lender both belong." Allowable debt levels We have identified three mutually exclusive options relating to setting the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rules. The options (other than the status quo) involve changing New Zealand's tax legislation. Option 1: Proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment (as proposed in the discussion document) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Proceed with non-debt liabilities proposal excluding deferred tax Under this option, a taxpayer's deferred tax would be ignored for the purposes of the non- debt liability adjustment. That is, a taxpayer's allowable debt level would be set with reference to the result of the formula: (assets- deferred tax assets)-(non-debt liabilities- deferred tax liabilities). Of submitters who supported the proposed non-debt liability adjustment in principle, this was the preferred option. Option 3: Status quo (do not proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment) Under this option, maximum deductible debt levels would continue to be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules with reference to assets, ignoring non-debt liabilities. As mentioned in section 2.5, this was the preferred option of some submitters. Relevant experience from other countries Australia has thin capitalisation rules that are broadly similar to New Zealand's. Australia's rules currently require a non-debt liability adjustment, but deferred tax is carved-out. That is, Australia's rules are consistent with option 2. 1 ATO compliance approach to taxation issues associated with cross-border related-party financing arrangements and related transactions, PCG 2017/04. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 12 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 36 of 76 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government's vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality-the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity-similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance -compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration -administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; and • Sustainability -the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved Efficiency, fairness and sustainability are the most important criteria. lt is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these three criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No options were ruled out of scope.

Option 2 (restricted transfer pricing) ++ Option 2 will provide a reasonably strong limit on related-party debt interest rates, reducing the ability for some firms to profit shift.

However, it also increases the uncertainty of returns on New Zealand investment, since whether or not interest is deductible turns on a taxpayer's EBITDA, which can be very variable. 0 On the one hand, option 3 would be somewhat effective at preventing excessive interest rates. On the other hand, it could result in interest denial for firms with very conservative interest rates and debt positions (say, for example, if a taxpayer is in loss). 0 Compliance costs in some instances would reduce under option 3, as there would be fewer transfer pricing disputes about related- party debt.

Interest limitation We consider that option 2 -developing a restricted transfer pricing approach - is the best option to limit interest expenses in relation to inbound related-party debt. Following consultation and further analysis, we consider that if the Government pursued the interest rate cap (option 1 ), adjustments would be needed to the original discussion document proposal which would make it more complex. For example, to address some of the concerns expressed by submitters, a different or modified rule may need to be applied to firms with low levels of debt. The result of these adjustments would be that different rules would apply to taxpayers in different situations (more so than originally proposed). Such differences create perceptions of unfairness, and give rise to boundaries that can be difficult to formulate, administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient -especially as taxpayers try to arrange their circumstances to fall within certain boundaries. The difficulty is, however, that simply relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by some submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes. lt is clear that the international consensus (as reflected in the OECD recommendation for countries to adopt an arbitrary formulaic approach (EBITDA)) is to move away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. In addition, as noted in section 2.5, commentators have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions. Accordingly, we consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is the best approach. Like the interest rate cap, it will ensure the policy objective -ensuring there is a robust mechanism for determining the interest rates for inbound related-party debt; however, since the restricted transfer pricing rule has more flexibility (compared to the interest rate cap - the other option that would most effectively achieve the policy objective) it is both more efficient and fairer. Owing to the time available (and since it was developed subsequent to the initial consultation), this option has not been subject to consultation with stakeholders. This modification will address many, but not all of, submitters' concerns - it is still a departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Nevertheless, we expect that it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because: • it allows for some limited flexibility- meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and • it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand's Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur frequently because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related party debt. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules 1 17 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 41 of 76 Allowable debt levels At this stage, we do not have a preference between option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment as originally proposed) and option 2 (non-debt liability adjustment with deferred tax carve- out). Option 3 (status quo) is not preferred. Both options 1 and 2 have similar impacts in terms of efficiency and fairness (and have no significant impacts in terms of compliance and administration costs). The non-debt liability adjustment in option 1 is potentially too extensive because of the inclusion of all types of deferred tax, but, on the other hand, the adjustment in option 2 is too narrow because of the exclusion of all deferred tax. We consider that the best approach is to recommend neither options 1 or 2 at this stage, but instead consult further with stakeholders on whether there is another feasible option (since this is a minor technical detail, more consultation on this matter is feasible). For example, it might be possible to identify deferred tax liabilities that are the least likely to result in a future tax payment, and restrict the carve-out of deferred tax to just that identified group.

As discussed above, allowing BEPS through interest deductions is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take use interest deductions to reduce their New Zealand (and possibly worldwide) tax liability is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders. lt is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself, which all of the stakeholders already discussed have an interest in preserving. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'? Yes. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Implementation of both reforms (relating to related-party interest rates and allowable debt level) will be given effect through a combination of legislation and Inland Revenue administrative guidance. The legislative changes proposed will be progressed (subject to Cabinet approval) as part of a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced in late 2017. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin. In relation to the allowable debt level proposal, we will consult further with stakeholders on whether a preferred option can be identified. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue will make the final decision on which option should be progressed (option 1, option 2, or a potential new option) following this consultation. These reforms are expected to apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, subject to legislation progressing to enactment before this date. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that transitional relief or grandparenting should be provided to give taxpayers sufficient lead-in time to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider that the planned application date of 1 July 2018 is sufficiently prospective because: • the interest rate proposal applies only to related-party transactions (which are more easily altered compared to transactions with third-parties); and • in relation to the allowable debt level proposal, debt and asset levels under the thin capitalisation rules can be measured as at the end of the relevant income year, meaning taxpayers would have until at least 30 June 2019 to rearrange their affairs. In addition, in response to consultation, we propose that advanced pricing agreements Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules 1 21 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 45 of 76 (APAs) existing prior to the application date of these changes will be grandparented. Once the proposals are implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is the risk that the relevant transfer pricing legislation could contain unintended errors or have unintended consequences. However, this risk can be efficiently managed by way of remedial amendments. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. Inland Revenue closely monitors the tax affairs of New Zealand's largest companies {which are, in general, the affected population of these proposals). For example, Inland Revenue currently collects data from these firms on their debt levels (including levels of related-party debt) through its International Questionnaire. This will allow how the proposals have impacted debt levels and related-party interest payments to be analysed. More generally, Inland Revenue is considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for all the BEPS measures being implemented. Any additional information may be collected via a disclosure statement that must be provided to Inland Revenue or it may be collected using existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTTP involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, following enactment, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect could either be included as remedial amendments in future tax bills, or if they involve more complex issues could be added to the tax policy work programme. Further consultation would be implicit in this approach. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-strengthening our interest limitation rules I 22 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 46 of 76 Coversheet: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Advising agencies Inland Revenue, The Treasury Decision sought This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Col/ins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? - The policy problem is that taxpayers can reduce their worldwide tax liability through hybrid mismatch arrangements, which in most cases are deliberately designed to take advantage of the different characterisations countries use for financial instruments and entities. Hybrid mismatch arrangements (which include branch mismatches) result in less group taxation when compared with straightforward arrangements that are seen consistently by the relevant countries. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? A tailored adoption of the OECD's BEPS Action 2 recommendations will comprehensively deal with the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements while making modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This tailored solution is sustainable and achieves gains to efficiency and fairness, while minimising compliance costs where possible. There will be a significant benefit in adopting a solution which is adopted by other countries and which will therefore be easier for multinational businesses to understand and comply with. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that new rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements are forecast to produce approximately $50 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to this regulatory proposal which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 47 of 76 Where do the costs fall? Taxpayers that use hybrid mismatch arrangements will face a medium level of compliance costs. These may be up-front, in the form of restructuring costs to transition to more straightforward (non-hybrid) arrangements, or they may be ongoing in the case of taxpayers that keep their hybrid mismatch arrangements in place and must apply new tax rules in order to comply with the law. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There is some risk of taxpayer noncompliance with the proposed rules. However, the risk of taxpayers being inadvertently caught by the proposed rules has been minimised due to the design of the preferred regulatory option which seeks to exclude the most simple offshore structures (foreign branches). More generally, the impacts have been reduced through the proposals taking into account the New Zealand context and adjusting the OECD- recommended rules as needed. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Not every type of hybrid arrangement that would be countered by the proposals has been observed in New Zealand. However, Inland Revenue is aware of some historic and current hybrid arrangements, and there is a very high likelihood there are others that relate to New Zealand and will be affected by this regulatory proposal. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS -hybrid mismatch arrangements Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer's comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 2 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 48 of 76 Impact Statement: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements problem in New Zealand. Inland Revenue is aware of some mismatch arrangements, but the full extent of the problem is unknown. This is because evidence of the problem primarily comes from Inland Revenue's investigations staff. Under current law these staff do not routinely examine offshore tax treatment (and therefore arrangements that lower a group's worldwide tax obligations), which is an important part of identifying a hybrid mismatch arrangement under the proposals. Range of options considered Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD's work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand's ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of hybrid mismatch arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response.

BEPS Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinational groups to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries' domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens' trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Hybrid mismatch arrangements Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when taxpayers exploit inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. The OECD's BEPS package includes Action 2: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are prevalent worldwide and are an important part of the base erosion and profit shifting strategies used by multinational companies. If no action is taken by the international community to counter these types of arrangements they are likely to continue to be used to avoid worldwide taxation and drive economic inefficiencies and unfairly distributed tax burdens. New Zealand's BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. In September 2016 the Government released a BEPS discussion document: Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements which proposed adoption of the OECD Action 2 recommendations in New Zealand and sought submissions on how that should be done. In March 2017 the Government released two further discussion documents: BEPS - Strengthening our interest limitation rules; and BEPS -Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand. This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions. At the same time, Cabinet noted that the reforms proposed in the BEPS documents would be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. Cabinet also noted that officials are continuing to develop and consult on all aspects of the BEPS project and that Cabinet approval will be sought for final policy decisions later in 2017. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS • Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 4 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 50 of 76 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand's tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government's distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. Company tax and international rules The company tax system is designed to be a backstop for taxing the personal income of domestic investors. Company tax is deducted at 28%, but New Zealand based investors can claim imputation credits for tax paid by the company when the income is taxed upon distribution at the personal level. At the same time, the company tax is designed as a final tax on New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors and foreign-owned companies earning New Zealand-sourced income. Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge in the area of international tax is to ensure that multinational firms pay a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Anti-avoidance rules and base protection measures are important part of ensuring that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non- residents to invest. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements Businesses can use hybrid mismatch arrangements to create tax advantages through exploiting inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. For example, using a hybrid entity or a foreign branch, a single expense may be deducted in two different jurisdictions, potentially reducing the tax payable on two different streams of income. Another example is a payment that is tax- deductible in one jurisdiction with no corresponding taxable income in the jurisdiction where the payment is received. However it is achieved, the result of a hybrid mismatch arrangement is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates when compared with a straightforward arrangement that is seen consistently by both relevant countries. Hybrid mismatch arrangements also have the effect of subsidising international investment relative to domestic investment, which distorts the efficiency of global markets. Since releasing its final recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements, the OECD expanded the scope of BEPS Action 2 to include branch mismatches. Branch mismatch arrangements are a result of countries approaching the allocation of income and expenses between a branch and a head office in different ways. Branch mismatch arrangements can also result in a reduction in the overall taxation of a corporate group, so are similar in effect to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 5 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 51 of 76 lt is important to note that the policy problem is limited to circumstances when global tax is reduced as a result of a hybrid mismatch. This project does not address other mechanisms that taxpayers may use to lower their global tax liability, such as the use of low-tax jurisdictions to trap income. Hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand New Zealand has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) that can, in some instances, neutralise the effects of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. However, the target of the GAAR is arrangements that avoid New Zealand tax. The arrangement must also do so in a manner that is outside Parliament's contemplation; a classic indicator being that the arrangement gains the advantage in an artificial or contrived way. Although the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement reduces the overall tax paid by the parties to the arrangement, it is often difficult to determine which country involved has lost tax revenue. Further, the use of a hybrid is not necessarily artificial or contrived in and of itself. Accordingly, the GAAR does not provide a comprehensive solution to counter the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements. New Zealand also has some specific rules in its domestic law that go some way to addressing particular recommendations made by the OECD in relation to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Inland Revenue is aware of a significant volume of hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand. For example, the amount of tax at issue in recent litigation for a prominent type of hybrid financial instrument was approximately $300 million (across multiple years). In relation to hybrid entities, deductions claimed in New Zealand that are attributable to the most prominent hybrid entity structure results in approximately $50 million less tax revenue for New Zealand per year. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD's work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand's ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Consistent with the OECD approach, the analysis has been focused on arrangements between related parties or where a hybrid mismatch has been created through a structured arrangement between unrelated parties. We have also chosen to restrict the policy thinking to cross-border activity. Purely domestic hybrid mismatches (some of which are contemplated by the OECD Action 2 final report) are outside the scope of this regulatory proposal. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stakeholders Stakeholders of this regulatory proposal are primarily taxpayers (typically multinational businesses that have hybrid mismatch arrangements) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers' affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. The proposed rules affect only taxpayers with foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 6 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 52 of 76 connections - that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers , and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. Another stakeholder of this regulatory proposal is the OECD, which is aiming to eradicate hybrid mismatch arrangements to the extent possible. This goal can only be achieved through countries adopting hybrid mismatch rules of some kind and neutralising the mismatches that arise when different sets of rules apply to the same transaction or entity . In addition, other countries that have enacted or are proposing to enact hybrid mismatch rules (for example , Australia and the United Kingdom) will be interested in the interaction between their own hybrid mismatch rules and any rules that New Zealand introduce into law . The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is interested in the regulatory proposal to the extent that it affects bank regulatory capital. Submissions to discussion document There were 20 submissions made to the September 2016 Government discussion document. Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals both in general views and specific coverage. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package , subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions of some variety. However, a greater number of submitters were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand. Submissions also covered a number of specific aspects of, and general concerns with, the proposals, including the complexity of the proposals and that New Zealand should not be in the first wave of countries adopting the proposals. Further and ongoing consultation We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers ' Association) in order to discuss specific design issues relating to hybrid mismatch arrangements. We have also consulted with officials representing Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the proposed rules work as intended , and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation . We have also consulted with the Reserve Bank. The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 7 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 53 of 76 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Four options were considered in the development of this regulatory proposal. These options are mutually exclusive and can be regarded as four points on a decision spectrum measuring how closely (if it all) New Zealand aligns itself with the OECD recommendations in dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements. None of the options (with the exception of the status quo option) are non-regulatory opt ions. This is because our judgment is that the policy problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot be addressed without changing tax rules, and that is something that can only be done through the use of legislation (as per section 22(a) of the Constitution Act 1986). These options are what we consider other countries dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements will consider in their policy development process. The United Kingdom and Australia can both be said to have chosen their own version of option 2. Some other countries have had rules to deal with hybrid mismatches that predate the OECD 's work in this area. Status quo: No action This option relies on New Zealand's existing law (including the GAAR) to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements and avoids the increased compliance costs and administrative costs of the other options. The status quo option also contemplates that other countries have introduced or will introduce their own hybrid mismatch rules, some of which will neutralise hybrid mismatch arrangements relating to New Zealand. Option 1: Strict adoption of OECD recommendations The OECD recommendations as set out in its BEPS Action 2 report are a comprehensive set of principle-based rules to counteract all types of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Option 1 is to strictly adopt those recommendations as described by the OECD into New Zealand domestic law. This option would deal with the range of hybrid mismatch arrangements targeted by the OECD to the extent they are found in or affect New Zealand . lt would have the advantage of interacting well with other countries that similarly adopt the OECD recommendations into their domestic law. Option 2: Tailored adoption of OECD recommendations Option 2 is to adopt the core principles of the OECD recommendations with suitable modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This option bears close relation to Option 1 as it involves introducing OECD- consistent hybrid rules unless there is a compelling reason to depart from the OECD approach. Thus, this option would solve the policy problem while ensuring that particular New Zealand issues are addressed . Option 2 also recognises that there are some instances where New Zealand's existing tax laws are sufficient (or can be made sufficient with relatively minor amendment) to achieve the effect intended by an OECD recommendation . Option 3: Targeted hybrid rules Option 3 is to introduce targeted hybrid rules that address only the significant hybrid mismatches that the Government is aware of. This option would solve the policy problem by addressing the current hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand. lt would avoid Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 8 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 54 of 76 enacting rules targeted at arrangements which are not currently seen in New Zealand. Consultation These four options were identified prior to consultation. The September 2016 discussion document proposed adoption of the OECD recommendations (options 1 and 2) and sought feedback on how that should be done. The document stated the Government's alternative options as option 3 and maintaining the status quo and concluded that they were not the best way forward. Consultation has affected the nature of option 2 in particular and has been helpful for options analysis generally. ,-------~-- 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government's vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency of compliance -compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible • Efficiency of administration -administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible • Neutrality-the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible • Fairness and equity-similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way • Sustainability-the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were and continue to be considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? We ruled out designing a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This is for reasons of international compatibility and to save compliance costs.

Recommended Not recommended Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS • Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 10 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 56 of 76 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? We consider that option 2 is the best option for addressing the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. lt is an internationally consistent, proactive option which delivers net benefits to New Zealand greater than that of the other options considered. Option 2 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand's tax system. Businesses that are able to exploit hybrid mismatch arrangements can currently operate at lower effective tax rates when compared with other businesses. This can result in a 'hybrid' business crowding out more productive investment and making international investment decisions based on whether a mismatch is available rather than commercial grounds. In addition, the imposition of higher taxes elsewhere in order to make up lost tax revenue due to the use of hybrid mismatches is likely to be less efficient than imposing more moderate taxes across all economic actors. By eliminating the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements in a comprehensive way, these inefficiencies can be removed. In a related sense, option 2 will help to improve the equity and fairness of the New Zealand tax system. Unintended tax benefits that are streamed to some taxpayers who are able to take advantage of hybrid mismatches means that a greater tax burden must fall on other taxpayers (such as purely domestic firms) who do not have the hybrid mismatch opportunities that cross border businesses do. Accordingly, introducing rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements will restore some fairness to the tax system as those tax burdens will be shared more equally. Option 2 will also have revenue collection benefits. The New Zealand tax revenue loss caused by the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is difficult to estimate because the full extent of arrangements involving New Zealand is unknown and because the behavioural effects of introducing hybrid mismatch rules are difficult to ascertain. However, the tax revenue at stake is significant in the cases that Inland Revenue is aware of. Importantly, the case for New Zealand to adopt the OECD recommendations is strengthened by the fact that other countries have enacted, or are proposing to enact, hybrid mismatch rules. This is because a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving a New Zealand counterparty may still be neutralised by the other country if they have a 'secondary' right to counteract under OECD principles. In that case, the tax benefit of the hybrid mismatch would be eliminated, but the tax collected would be by the counterparty country. In these circumstances, New Zealand would be better off having its own hybrid mismatch rules so that it can collect revenue when it has the priority to do so under the OECD recommendations. Whether New Zealand or the counterparty country collects any additional revenue as a result of implementing the rules depends on the actions taken by the affected business. Option 2 is ultimately a balance between the positive impacts described above and the trade- off compliance costs. lt attempts to introduce a comprehensive set of rules which is adjusted for the New Zealand tax environment. For instance, we identified early in the policy development process that one of the OECD recommendations would not interact smoothly with New Zealand's approach to the taxation of the foreign branches of New Zealand companies. The recommendation in question had to be modified under option 2 so that the tax treatment of a simple offshore branch structure of a New Zealand company (which is not part of the policy problem) would be unaffected by the introduction of the hybrid mismatch Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 11 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 57 of 76 rules. We have also recommended a delay to the effective date of an OECD-recommended rule which applies to what are known as "unstructured imported mismatches". This rule could cause undue compliance costs if it was to come into effect at the same time as the other rules. Delaying its effective date until a significant number of other countries have introduced hybrid mismatch rules means the associated New Zealand-specific compliance costs will either disappear or will be no greater than the costs faced by a multinational group operating in those other countries. Accordingly, the compliance costs of the regulatory proposal are to be minimised to the extent possible, while still introducing a comprehensive set of rules to deal with the range of OECD-identified hybrid mismatches. This is where option 2 shows its advantage over option 1 which we view as having similar efficiency, fairness and revenue benefits. Option 1 would result in relatively higher compliance costs because the OECD recommendations are designed as a general set of best-practice rules and, in regards to their detail, are not necessarily optimal for individual countries such as New Zealand. When compared with option 1, option 2 ensures that the rules are workable and appropriate for the New Zealand tax environment. lt is also important to note that the ongoing compliance costs relating to this regulatory issue are expected to be optional in the majority of cases. The proposed rules will apply to taxpayers who use a hybrid mismatch arrangement after the rules become effective. Those taxpayers will generally have the option of incurring one-off costs to restructure into non- hybrid arrangements and remove themselves from the scope of the proposed rules. Any higher tax payments resulting from the non-status quo options will make cross border investment less attractive for taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements. However, these taxpayers should not be allowed to exploit hybrid mismatches to achieve a competitive advantage over taxpayers that do not use hybrid mismatch arrangements (such as purely domestic firms). Further, a significant number of New Zealand's major investment partners have introduced or will introduce hybrid mismatch rules. Other countries adopting these rules means that in many cases the tax efficiency of hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand will be negated through the operation of the other country's rules on the counterparty, As a result, we believe that any impacts on inbound and outbound cross border investment from introducing hybrid mismatch rules in New Zealand will be low. The status quo option would involve the least complexity and lowest compliance costs. However, similar to the cross-border investment discussion above, taxpayers whose groups deal with New Zealand's major trading partners that are adopting hybrid mismatch rules would have to understand the impact of those rules. The additional complexity of New Zealand having hybrid mismatch rules would therefore be lessened by the international momentum in this area. Option 3 is an option that was preferred by many submitters to the Government discussion document on hybrid mismatch arrangements. Submitters pointed out that many of the structures considered by the OECD to be problematic have not been seen in New Zealand and therefore do not need to be counteracted. They also argued that the OECD recommendations are complex and have the potential for overreach. We do not think a targeted approach would serve New Zealand well when compared with option 2. The OECD recommendations are a coherent package intending to deal to the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements exhaustively. Deliberately omitting aspects of the recommendations from New Zealand's response may cause taxpayers to exploit those remaining hybrid mismatch opportunities (which may even be seen as tacitly blessed). To the extent that happens, the efficiency, revenue, and fairness benefits of option 3 would be eroded. In Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS & Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 12 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 58 of 76 addition, other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have introduced or are intending to introduce a relatively comprehensive set of hybrid mismatch rules. If New Zealand does the same it will ensure our rules are internationally comparable and that they interact well with the rules of other countries without significant compliance issues. By favouring option 2, we also have consulted extensively on the OECD recommendations and how they should best be introduced into New Zealand law. This consultation has enabled us to design suitable modifications to the OECD recommendations to reduce complexity and compliance costs, limit overreach, and in some cases, increase the efficiency of the outcomes. \] 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties I Comment: nature of cost or Impact Evidence (identify) benefit (e.g. ongoing, one-off), $m present value, certainty evidence and assumption (e.g. for monetised (High, compliance rates), risks impacts; high, medium or medium or low for low) non-monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Compliance costs: Increased costs Medium Medium from understanding the rules and applying them to taxpayers' transactions and structures.

The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence. 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? As discussed above, allowing the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses . This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities (and/or employ other BEPS strategies) is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders as it is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government's 'Expectations for the design of regulatory systems'? Yes, option 2 (tailored adoption of OECD recommendations) conforms to the expectations for the design of regulatory systems document. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS- Hybrid mismatch arrangements I 14 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 60 of 76 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The major exceptions are: • the proposed rule for "unstructured imported mismatch arrangements", which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 January 2020; and • the proposed rules applying to New Zealand "reverse hybrids", which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 April 2019. Another exception we recommend is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules (until the next call date) hybrid financial instruments issued by banks as regulatory capital (in Australian or New Zealand) to third party investors before the discussion document release date of September 2016. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider an application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government's intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Audit staff will need to familiarise themselves with the proposed rules and how they operate in practice. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment. In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their hybrid mismatch arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we are minimising compliance costs where possible under our tailored adoption of the OECD recommendations. For example, and as mentioned above, we have delayed the application date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule contained in the OECD recommendations to acknowledge that it would be significantly more difficult and costly to comply with than the other rules if it applied at the outset. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements 1 15 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 61 of 76 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. However, it may be difficult to assess the true impact of this regulatory proposal. This is because many taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of the proposed rules. lt will be difficult to measure the full extent of this behavioural effect. Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post- implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS-Hybrid mismatch arrangements 1 16 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 62 of 76 Impact Summary: Hybrids/NRWT issue Section 1: General information Purpose Inland R evenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice s et out in this Impact Summary, except a s otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice h as been produced for the purpose of informing policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis This analysis has been limited by the following factors: • The scale of the problem (in term s of its fiscal costs) h as not been accurately identified b e c a u s e it will depend on the behavioural resp o n se of taxpayers, which may in turn be informed by work currently being undertaken by Inland Revenue. • No consultation with external stakeholders (including th o se who would be affected by the proposed action). Responsible Manager (signature and date): Paul Kilford Policy and Strategy Inland R evenue 22 November 2017 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 63 of 76 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem identified arises only in a very specific s e t of fact circum stances: • There is a New Zealand branch or “perm anent establishm ent” (PE) of a non-resident company; • That PE borrows money from another non-resident in the sam e o v e rsea s jurisdiction a s the P E ’s corporate residence; • The borrowing tak es place under a “hybrid” instrument which m ean s it is treated a s one form of financing (debt) by New Zealand, but ano th er form of financing (equity) by the other country. An exam ple is s e t out in the diagram below. The view until now of Inland R evenue and m any taxpayers h as b een that New Zealand can withhold non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on the paym ents. However, som e taxpayers have disputed this view and a s a co n seq u en ce Inland R evenue is currently reconsidering w hether it is legally correct. Inland R evenue has sought Crown Law’s advice, and h as indicated that it may well decide the law d o e s not permit NRWT to be withheld. This interpretation is b ased on a view that the paym ents are dividends for the purposes of our double tax agreem ents (DTA). B ecause double tax agreem ents over-ride dom estic law, this view would, if adopted, m ean that the taxpayer would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for the paym ents (b e c au se New Zealand treats the paym ents a s interest), but the paym ents would not be subject to NRWT (b ecau se the other country and the DTA treat them a s dividends). This is contrary to the intent of the provisions, a s deductible outbound interest should always have Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T em plate | 2 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 64 of 76 NRWT (or its alternative, approved issuer levy (AIL)) withheld unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise. The hybrid mismatch m easu res already proposed and approved by Cabinet (and covered by the regulatory impact analysis: http://taxpolicy .ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps- 20-ria-hybrids-july-2017.pdf) would en su re that paym ents m ade under such hybrids could not be both deductible in New Zealand and n o n -a s s e s s a b le o v erseas. In som e circum stances the m e asu res would still allow a deduction in New Zealand for the paym ents. However the m e asu re s do not cover w hether NRWT m ust be withheld from such payments. Consequently, the currently proposed hybrid m e asu re s would still permit paym ents under a hybrid financial instrument to be deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT. This contrasts with the tax treatm ent of dividends, which a re not deductible. It also contrasts with the tax treatm ent of ordinary interest, which is deductible but subject to NRWT (or AIL). As a result of this, the currently proposed hybrid mismatch m easu res would remove the incentive to use th e se types of hybrids in most, but not all c a s e s. The hybrids could still be attractive if the non-resident w as not concerned about the assessability of the paym ents in its hom e jurisdiction. For example, if the non-resident had tax losses, w as tax exempt, or simply preferred to pay tax in its home jurisdiction (as m ost Australian com panies do due to their imputation system). If no action is taken, Inland R evenue’s changed interpretation could therefore expose the New Zealand tax b a se to significant risk. It is difficult to estim ate the fiscal risk, a s it d ep en d s in part on tax p ay ers’ behaviour, and in part on w hether section BG 1 would apply to counteract the arrangem ents (section BG 1 may apply to som e arrangem ents but not others). The risk is in two parts: a risk that $60 million of previously paid NRWT or AIL might be refunded in the n ear term, and an ongoing risk th at $15 million per annum of NRWT or AIL might no longer be payable. Both risks could materialise a s a fiscal cost against existing baselines. Addressing the problem will increase baselines by $1 million per annum on a go forward basis, relative to the status quo. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The only taxpayers affected are those that enter into the structure illustrated in the response to question 2.1 above. However, a s far a s Inland R evenue is aw are, many of the taxpayers that use th e se structures already pay NRWT or AIL in accordance with the policy intent. As a result, for m ost affected taxpayers, any change in the law to align with the policy intent would only reaffirm Inland R ev en u e’s pre-existing legal interpretation - and so would not involve the imposition of additional tax or compliance costs com pared with their current position. However, the proposed approach would stop som e of th e se taxpayers from claiming a tax refund for the NRWT or AIL they paid in previous y ears if Inland R evenue’s interpretation chan g es. It would also stop som e of them from ceasing to pay AIL or NRWT in future years. A small num ber of taxpayers have disputed Inland R ev en u e’s current legal view and not paid NRWT or AIL. T h ese taxpayers would be affected by the proposed change, a s they would now be required to pay NRWT or AIL. However, this is the outcom e we want to achieve with the proposed change, a s the policy intent is for all taxpayers to be subject to NRWT or AIL Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 3 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 65 of 76 on cross border deductible interest paym ents (unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise). 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Limitations in respect of stakeholder e n g ag em en t a re s e t out in section 5, below. The scope of this problem is limited by the extremely narrow fact-pattern identified. The proposed regulatory action h a s two major interdependencies: BEPS and hybrids The current problem with the NRWT rules only arises for hybrid mismatch arrangem ents. Hybrid mismatch arrangem ents are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangem ents that create a tax advantage by exploiting differences in the tax treatm ent of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries. The result of hybrid mismatch arrangem ents is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangem ent relates. In July 2017 the Government announced th at it would com prehensively adopt the OECD’s hybrid mismatch recom m endations, with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. In addition to the regulatory impact analysis referred to in resp o n se to question 2.1, the relevant Cabinet papers can be found at: • http://taxpolicv.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps-13-cabinet-paper- overview-july-2017.pdf (which covers the BEPS p ackage more broadly); and • http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps-19-cabinet-paper- hvbrids-july-2017.pdf (which is specific to the hybrids proposals). The hybrids work is a relevant interdependency b e c a u s e it estab lish es that Cabinet wished to "... sen d the clear m e ssa g e that using hybrid mismatch arrangem ents should not produce a tax advantage ...” (see paragraph 7 of the hybrids-specific Cabinet p a p er linked above). Therefore, we consider that addressing the problem identified in this Impact Sum m ary is consistent with bringing into effect the outcom e clearly desired by Cabinet for hybrid m ism atches. As explained in 2.1 above, however, the existing hybrids m e asu res still allow for cross border financial instruments to carry paym ents which a re deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT. Accordingly, the proposed m easure would supplem ent the existing hybrids m e asu res by cancelling a further hybrid mismatch tax advantage. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Sum m ary T em plate | 4 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 66 of 76 NRWT amendments New Zealand h as recently reviewed and updated its rules related to NRWT and its alternative, AIL. T hese reforms w ere enacted a s part of the Taxation (Annual R ates for 2016-17, Closely Held Com panies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. The relevant Regulatory Impact Statem ent can be found at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-ris-archcrm-bill/nrwt- related-party-and-branch-lending-nrwt-change s As s e t out in paragraph 26 of that document, the objective of the reforms w as to “... ensure the return received by a non-resident lender from an associated borrower (or a party that is economically equivalent to an associated borrower) will be subject to NRWT and, at a time, that is not significantly later than when income tax deductions for the funding costs are available to the borrower.” In the structure that is the subject of this Impact Summary, the potential outcome is that a taxpayer will (ab sen t the proposed m easure) be entitled to a deduction but have no corresponding NRWT liability. This is contrary to the stated policy objective. Accordingly, the proposed m easure supplem ents the previous NRWT am endm ents by ensuring that NRWT cannot be avoided for deductible interest paym ents on hybrid instruments. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 5 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 67 of 76 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? W e have considered four options, three of which involve addressing the identified problem by ensuring that NRWT applies in all instances where a deduction is allowed in New Zealand for an interest e x p en se and for this outcome to occur notwithstanding the effect of our double tax ag reem en ts (the “policy solution”). However, they differ in their proposed application date. The four options are: • Option 1: The status quo, which would allow Inland R evenue to finalise its legal view and allow that view to prevail on all existing and future arrangem ents. This would likely result in the problem identified in 2.1 continuing. • Option 2: Provide that NRWT or AIL applies to any deductible interest paym ent with a New Zealand source (the policy solution). The policy solution would have prospective effect. • Option 3: Enact the policy solution retrospectively to the earliest date from which taxpayers can claim refunds for AIL or NRWT overpaym ents. • Option 4: Enact the policy solution retrospectively to the earliest date from which taxpayers can claim refunds for AIL or NRWT overpaym ents, but also include a “sav in g s” provision for taxpayers that have already adopted the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable prior to the Bill containing the policy solution being introduced. Currently the potential non-applicability of NRWT or AIL a rises under New Z ealand’s DTAs. DTAs are incorporated into New Zealand law under the Income Tax Act 2007, which s tates that DTAs have effect notwithstanding any other provision of that Act (subject to som e exceptions). Accordingly, the policy solution would need to expressly override our DTAs in the am ending legislation. W e note that Australia already h as a rule that legislates the policy solution, including an express DTA override. Criteria The four options are a s s e s s e d in this Impact Summ ary against the following criteria: • Economic efficiency - the tax system should, to the extent possible, apply neutrally and consistently to economically equivalent transactions. This m ean s the tax system should not provide a tax preferred treatm ent for one transaction over another similar transaction or provide an advantage to one b usiness over another. This helps en su re that the most efficient forms of investment which provide the b est returns to New Zealand a s a whole are undertaken. At the sam e time there is a concern that tax es should not unduly raise the cost of capital and discourage inbound investment. • Fairness - the options should en su re that the law is see n a s treating people fairly and consistently and should not allow people to avoid their tax obligations (including any foreign tax obligations). • Integrity of the tax system - the options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely fashion while not providing opportunities for tax avoidance or arbitrary tax reductions Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T em plate | 6 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 68 of 76 Analysis In th e following options analysis, an option having a fiscal risk is s e e n a s a negative. However, this will not automatically disqualify the option. There are times when changing the law will have a fiscal cost or risk for the Government, but this is nevertheless desirable b e ca u se of the gains in one or more of the other a s s e s s m e n t criteria. Option 1 - not preferred W e consider that the policy solution is preferable to the status quo. The status quo will likely m ean that a PE would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for paym ents on certain hybrid instrum ents (as the paym ents a re characterised a s “interest” under New Zealand dom estic law), but the paym ents would not be subject to NRWT (as the paym ents are characterised a s “dividends” under the DTA). This is contrary to the intent of the relevant DTA provisions, a s outbound interest, which is deductible in determining the profits of a PE, should always have NRWT withheld unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise (e.g. the sovereign wealth fund exem ptions provided in som e of our DTAs). It also e x p o se s the New Zealand tax b a se to a fiscal risk, a s it allows a deduction from New Zealand tax for a paym ent without a corresponding tax liability for the recipient. Accordingly, the statu s quo negatively affects the integrity of the tax system . The general anti avoidance rule in section BG 1 might still apply to som e of the arrangem ents using th e se kinds of hybrid instruments, in which c a s e NRWT or AIL would still need to be paid. However, there is a high risk that section BG 1 would not apply to other arrangem ents we are aw are of. In addition, the status quo option negatively affects both fairness and econom ic efficiency. This is b eca u se it would give a competitive adv an tag e to a multinational firm that u s e s the relevant funding structure over a dom estic firm or another, more compliant, multinational. This is contrary to the objectives of the BEPS work more generally and the hybrids project in particular. Under the statu s quo option, Inland R evenue’s changed interpretation could expose the New Zealand tax b a se to significant risk. It is difficult to estim ate the fiscal risk, a s it dep en d s in part on taxpayers’ behaviour, and in part on w hether section BG 1 would apply to counteract the arrangem ents (section BG 1 may apply to som e arrangem ents but not others). The risk is in two parts: a risk that $60 million of previously paid NRWT or AIL might be refunded in the n ear term, and an ongoing risk that $15 million per annum of NRWT or AIL might no longer be payable. Both risks could materialise a s a fiscal cost against existing baselines. Addressing the problem will increase baselines by $1 million per annum on a go forward basis, relative to the statu s quo. Option 2 - not preferred This option would ad d re ss the policy issue identified in 2.1. It would also have ad v an tag es in term s of fairness, economic efficiency and the integrity of the tax system com pared with the statu s quo option (by eliminating the status q u o ’s disadvantages in th e se regards). However, th e se ad v an tag es would only arise for future income years. Taxpayers who used the relevant hybrid structure in previous income y ears may be entitled to request a refund of the Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 7 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 69 of 76 NRWT or AIL they previously paid. W e consider that it would be unfair to allow taxpayers to claim refunds of their previously paid AIL or NRWT in th e se circum stances. It would also reduce the integrity of the tax system . It is clear that NRWT / AIL w as intended to be payable on cross border interest paym ents. This w as also Inland R evenue’s interpretation of the law until now, which w as followed by many taxpayers. The ability of so m e taxpayers to avoid NRWT AIL through the u se of a hybrid instrument is a clear loophole in the current rules, and taxpayers aw are of the issue would have perceived it a s such. Accordingly, we consider there should be no legitimate expectation for taxpayers to obtain a refund for any AIL or NRWT previously paid in resp ect of th ese hybrid instruments. W e estim ate that there is a potential one-off fiscal risk of $60 million under this option. This is b e ca u se taxpayers that are known to use this structure may be able to obtain refunds of their previously paid AIL/NRWT under this option if Inland R evenue ch an g es its current legal interpretation (and the previously paid NRWT or AIL h a s b een included in the fiscal baseline),. This option would also give rise to a potential $1 million per annum fiscal benefit com pared with the current baseline. This is b ecau se taxpayers in active disputes would be required to pay $1 million of NRWT in future tax years if the policy solution w as implemented (and this $1 million h as not been included in current fiscal baselines). Option 3 - not preferred Option 3 would ad d ress the policy issue in 2.1. As a retrospective m easure, it would also stop taxpayers from claiming a refund for any previously paid NRWT or AIL. Accordingly, it is preferable to option 2 a s it h a s ad v an tag es in term s of fairness, econom ic efficiency and integrity of the tax system , over the statu s quo option in respect of both future and p ast income years. This option also h as the lowest potential fiscal risk of all the options (equal with option 4). This option also h as the largest potential fiscal benefit. This is becau se, in addition to the fiscal benefit of option 2 in respect of future income years, this option would also require the taxpayers that have disputed Inland R evenue’s current legal interpretation to pay NRWT in respect of p ast tax years in the event that Inland R evenue’s current legal interpretation changes. This NRWT h as not been included in the current fiscal baselines. Accordingly, this gives rise to an additional potential one-off fiscal benefit of approximately $5 million. However, this option would also retrospectively ch ange the law for those taxpayers who have already taken the position that NRWT or AIL w a s not payable and entered into disputes with Inland Revenue. This would be fair, a s different taxpayers in the sam e position would be treated the sam e. In addition, excluding taxpayers who have taken an aggressive tax position from the retrospective application of the rules s ee m s to reward them for their aggressive behaviour. However, there is a wider issue of legal certainty involved. If Parliament retrospectively ch an g es a law taxpayers have relied on, then this m ean s taxpayers can never fully rely on the law (as stated at the time) in any dispute with the Government. This would erode the integrity of the tax system from a wider perspective. It would also erode perceptions of fairness, in that the Government might be perceived a s misusing its legislative power to win a Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Sum m ary T em plate | 8 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 70 of 76 dispute with taxpayers. Option 4 - preferred This option a d d re s s e s the policy problem s et out in 2.1. It also has fairness, economic efficiency and integrity of the tax system ad v an tag es over the status quo option in respect of both future and p ast income years. Although this option is slightly less fair than option 3, it b est supports the integrity of the tax system . This is b eca u se it prevents taxpayers from claiming refunds for previously paid NRWT or AIL, while preserving the legal position of taxpayers that previously adopted the position that NRWT or AIL w as not payable prior to the introduction of the Bill containing the policy solution. This option would also give rise to a potential fiscal benefit of $1 million per annum compared with current baseline. This is b eca u se taxpayers that are still disputing Inland R evenue’s current position would be required to pay $1 million of NRWT in future tax years (and this $1 million has not been included in current fiscal baselines). W e note that this option d o es have a smaller potential fiscal benefit than option 3, a s it does not require taxpayers disputing Inland R evenue’s current legal interpretation to pay NRWT in resp ect of p ast tax years. W e estim ate the reduced potential fiscal benefit to be approximately $5 million. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? W e consider Option 4 to be the b est option. This option a d d re s s e s the policy problem set out in 2.1. It also h as advantages, in term s of fairness, economic efficiency and the integrity of the tax system , over the status quo option in resp ect of both future and past income years. Although this option is less fair than option 3, it b est supports the integrity of the tax system. This is b ecau se Option 4 prevents taxpayers from claiming refunds for previously paid NRWT or AIL, while preserving the legal position of taxpayers that previously adopted the position that NRWT or AIL w as not payable prior to the introduction of the BEPS Bill. Accordingly it a d d re s s e s the policy problem without the draw backs of options 2 and 3. Option 4 also h a s the lowest equal fiscal risk. However, it lacks Option 3’s potential one-off $5 million fiscal benefit. Even so, we consider the lack of this fiscal benefit is outweighed by the importance of protecting the integrity of the law from a wider perspective.

W e do not expect there to be other taxpayers with a significant value of such hybrid structures, but we cannot confirm this.

This will be a cost for taxpayers that have entered into such structures. However it will be a benefit for other taxpayers, a s it will en su re that taxpayers who have entered into such structures cannot obtain a competitive ad vantage over dom estic firms and more compliant multinationals. Accordingly the proposed approach will improve econom ic efficiency. No monetary value Regulators With the proposed law change, Inland R evenue will not need to consider w hether the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 applies to any of the arrangem ents (other than taxpayers not subject to the retrospective application of the rule). It can be difficult and resource intensive to consider the application of section BG 1. Accordingly the proposed approach will sav e Inland R evenue administrative costs, and potentially court costs.

The proposed approach involves the third explicit override of New Z ealand’s DTAs in recent years. Accordingly, it may aro u se concern that New Zealand d o es not respect its DTAs. However, the proposed approach confirms the interpretive approach previously adopted by NZ, and currently adopted by som e of our DTA partners and mirrors a rule already in place in Australia. It also closes a clear loophole if Inland R evenue were to change its legal interpretation. Accordingly, we do not expect disagreem ent over the policy outcome. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? B ecause this problem p o ses a base-m aintenance risk, Inland R evenue and Treasury officials have not consulted with the private sector. This m eans that the problem identification and options have been generated by officials based on the information available. It is recognised that private secto r input is an important part of the generic tax policy process. In saying this, it is not unusual for base-m aintenance chan g es to be m ade without consultation b ecau se there is a risk that publicising the existence of a perceived loophole may incentivise taxpayers to take advantage of its existence in the short term. In addition, the m easure only legislatively confirms the tax treatm ent Inland R evenue has been applying to date. It also closes what would be a clear loophole if Inland Revenue were to ch an g e that tax treatm ent. Further, there will be an opportunity for the public to submit on the m easure during the S elect Committee pro cess and feedback will be considered at that point. There may be som e private sector concern about the am endm ent, given that it applies retrospectively and will be the third explicit override of our DTAs in recent years. However, we do not expect disagreem ent over the policy outcome. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 12 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 74 of 76 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Section 6: Implementation and operation The proposed solution will be given effect by inclusion in the Taxation (Neutralising B ase Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill 2017, which is scheduled to be introduced into the House in D ecem ber 2017. Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcem ent of the new arrangem ents. W e do not have any concern about our ability to do so. The new arrangem ents will have retrospective effect, except for taxpayers that have, prior to introduction of the Bill, taken the position th at NRWT or AIL is not payable. W e consider that this allows sufficient preparation time for regulated parties, as: • the proposed approach will only affect a small num ber of taxpayers that have disputed Inland R evenue’s current legal interpretation and not settled the dispute; • the taxpayers that have maintained their position that NRWT or AIL is not payable are aw are that Inland R evenue historically d o e s not agree, and so a re on notice that their current practice may not be acceptable; • many of those currently take the view that NRWT or AIL is payable, and so they will not need to change their current practice. W e will mitigate implementation risks by publicising the proposed approach a s part of the Commentary on the Bill. W e will also inform the taxpayers who currently take the view that no NRWT or AIL is payable of the proposed law change. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Tem plate | 13 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 75 of 76 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The new arrangem ents will be monitored through Inland R evenue’s normal risk review and audit function. This will check w hether taxpayers are complying with the proposed approach. If any follow-up legislative action is required it will go through the Generic Tax Policy P ro cess (GTPP). 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The proposed approach simply closes a potential loophole and confirms the Governm ent’s intended tax treatm ent for cross border interest paym ents. Accordingly, we consider that no specific review of the arrangem ents is necessary. Stakeholders will have the opportunity to raise concerns during the S elect Committee process. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that h as been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland R evenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the pro cess is the implementation and review stage, which involves post­ implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. In practice, any ch an g es identified a s n ecessary following enactm ent would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP.

Why is Government intervention required? There are international concerns about multinationals not paying their fair share of tax. This is because some multinationals use base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) strategies to report low taxable profits in New Zealand and other countries in which they operate. These BEPS strategies include arrangements between related parties which shift profits out of New Zealand (usually into a lower taxed jurisdiction). They also include arrangements which are designed to ensure New Zealand is not able to tax any income from sales here despite there being a physical presence in New Zealand in relation to the sales. These particular BEPS strategies are known as transfer pricing and permanent establishment (PE) avoidance. Finally, Inland Revenue faces administrative difficulties in investigating large multinationals. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposed approach is to adopt the package of measures outlined in the Government discussion document BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance (March 2017), with some changes resulting from consultation, as the measures will: • ensure that multinationals cannot structure their affairs for the purpose of avoiding a taxable presence in New Zealand; • stop companies from shifting profits out of the New Zealand tax base through artificial arrangements; and • make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate such multinationals. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 3 of 76 Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit by receiving an additional $50 million of revenue per annum. Compliant businesses will benefit because the multinationals involved in transfer pricing and PE avoidance activities will no longer be able to achieve a competitive advantage. Also, the measures will support voluntary compliance by protecting the integrity of the tax system. Where do the costs fall? Multinationals which currently engage in BEPS activities will face a medium level of compliance costs. These taxpayers may choose to transition into more tax compliant agreements which will require restructuring costs; or they may apply for advance pricing agreements (APAs). However, the majority of multinationals are compliant and should not be materially affected by the proposals. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There is a risk that foreign companies investing in New Zealand will view the proposals as complex and onerous, incentivising them to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand or to cease operating in New Zealand altogether. However, most of the affected foreign companies are dependent on having personnel in New Zealand to arrange their sales. Without personnel on the ground, they would not be able to service their New Zealand market. It is also unlikely that they would cease to operate in New Zealand altogether. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is limited certainty of evidence in relation to the problem of transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements. This is because such activities are often not directly observable in the absence of specific audit activity. However, Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases involved in these types of BEPS arrangements which are currently under audit. While there are only 20 New Zealand-owned multinationals that earn over the threshold for some of the main proposals (over EUR €750 million of consolidated global revenue), the European Union (EU) has estimated that there may be up to 6,000 multinationals globally Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 2 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 4 of 76 that do. However, we do not know how many of these global multinationals operate in New Zealand. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 3 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 5 of 76 Impact Statement: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures in New Zealand. In common with BEPS activities generally, transfer pricing and PE avoidance is difficult to quantify as tax avoidance is often not directly observable. We consider that, while most multinationals are compliant, there is a minority that engage in transfer pricing and PE avoidance. Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases of transfer pricing and PE avoidance currently under audit that collectively involve about $100 million per year of disputed tax. These cases show our existing rules are vulnerable and Inland Revenue considers that the use of avoidance arrangements will increase if the weaknesses in the current rules are not addressed. Furthermore, as New Zealand endorses the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan), there is an expectation that we will take action against BEPS and implement a number of the OECD’s recommendations. Range of options considered Our analysis of options has been primarily constrained by New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs). Under its DTAs, New Zealand can only tax non-residents on business profits if they have a PE in New Zealand. We have also been somewhat constrained by the fact that New Zealand endorses the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs, and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response.

BEPS BEPS refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinationals to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved when multinationals exploit gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In 2013, the OECD published its BEPS Action Plan which identified actions needed to address BEPS (including transfer pricing and PE avoidance), set deadlines to implement these actions, and identified the resources needed and the methodology to implement these actions. In 2015, the OECD released its final package of recommended actions for countries to implement to counter BEPS. If no action is taken to counter transfer pricing and PE avoidance arrangements, multinationals that are currently engaging in these types of arrangements will be able to continue, and the number of these types of avoidance cases will continue to increase. New Zealand’s BEPS work New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international avoidance and is advancing a number of the OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. In September 2016, the Government released the BEPS discussion document Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements. In March 2017, the Government released two further discussion documents: BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules; and BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance; along with the officials’ issues paper New Zealand’s implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS. The BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance discussion document consulted on the Government’s proposal to introduce a new set of tax rules to counter BEPS activities involving transfer pricing and PE avoidance. Many of the proposals follow the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan recommendations (such as updating our transfer pricing legislation to align with the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines). Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 6 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 8 of 76 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand’s tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework ensures the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and result in multinational firms paying a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures, such as transfer pricing and PE rules, are important to protect the tax base and ensure that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. New Zealand’s PE rules New Zealand’s ability to tax non-residents on their New Zealand sales income is determined by our domestic tax rules in conjunction with our DTAs. Under our DTAs, New Zealand is generally prevented from taxing a non-resident’s business income unless the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. This is the case even if that income has a source in New Zealand under our domestic legislation. In general, New Zealand can only tax a non-resident multinational group on its sales here if both of the following conditions are met: • The multinational group has a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand. This means the group must operate in New Zealand either through a New Zealand- resident subsidiary (in which case the subsidiary is taxable on its income) or through a PE of a non-resident group member. A PE is basically a place of business of the non-resident, but it also includes an agent acting for the non-resident. • Where a multinational operates in New Zealand through a PE of a non-resident group member, some of the non-resident’s net profits from its sales can be attributed to its taxable presence here. This involves determining: o The amount of the non-resident’s gross sales income which can be attributed to its PE here; and o The amount of the expenses which can be deducted from that income to determine the net taxable profits in New Zealand. The non-resident must also have a sufficient taxable presence in New Zealand (if a DTA applies) for New Zealand to charge non-resident withholding tax on certain payments by the non-resident (such as a royalty) to other parties in connection with the New Zealand sales income. New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules “Transfer pricing” refers to the use of cross-border payments between associated entities such as a parent and a subsidiary. Transfer pricing rules are therefore concerned with Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 7 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 9 of 76 determining the conditions, including the price (and therefore the tax liability), for transactions within a multinational group resulting in the allocation of profits to group companies in different jurisdictions. New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation was first introduced in 1995 and is largely focused on the legal form of the transaction and adjusting the consideration that is paid to an arm’s length amount (which can be zero). Due to the increased complexity and tax planning of cross-border intra-group trade over the last 22 years, New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing rules are unable to adequately address some types of profit shifting. General anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) New Zealand also has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) which effectively overrides other provisions of the tax legislation to deny the tax benefits of an arrangement when a more than incidental purpose of the arrangement is to obtain a tax benefit. However, the GAAR is unlikely to be effective at addressing all transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures on its own. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem of transfer pricing and PE avoidance Some multinational companies operating in New Zealand exploit deficiencies in the current international tax system (both in New Zealand and abroad) by using transfer pricing and PE avoidance strategies to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite carrying out significant economic activity here. Transfer pricing and PE avoidance can lead to unfairness and the substitution of low-taxed investors for tax-paying investors. This has the potential to reduce national income while doing little or nothing to reduce the overall pre-tax cost of capital to New Zealand or increase the overall level of investment. It also distorts the allocation of investment by favouring foreign investors who set out to game the system. Transfer pricing avoidance One of the major strategies used by multinationals to shift profits out of New Zealand and reduce their worldwide tax bills is transfer pricing. Related parties may agree to pay an artificially high or low price for goods, services, funding, or intangibles compared to the “arm’s length” price or conditions that an unrelated third party would be willing to pay or accept under a similar transaction. By manipulating these transfer prices or conditions, profits can be shifted out of New Zealand and into a lower-taxed country or entity. PE avoidance Some multinationals reduce their New Zealand tax liability by structuring their affairs to avoid a PE arising, despite carrying on significant activity here. Impacted population These rules affect only taxpayers with foreign connections – that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies. Many of the proposed measures will apply only to multinational groups with over EUR €750 million of consolidated global revenue. While there are only 20 New Zealand-owned multinationals that earn this much, the EU has estimated that there may be up to 6,000 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 8 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 10 of 76 multinationals globally that do. However, we do not know how many of these global multinationals operate in New Zealand. Transfer pricing and PE arrangements in New Zealand Inland Revenue is aware of about 16 cases of transfer pricing and PE avoidance currently under audit that collectively involve about $100 million per year of disputed tax. These cases show our existing rules are vulnerable and Inland Revenue considers that the use of avoidance arrangements will increase if the weaknesses in the current rules are not strengthened. Furthermore, as New Zealand endorses the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, there is an expectation that we will take action against BEPS and implement a number of the OECD’s recommendations. Inland Revenue’s judgement is that the transfer pricing and PE proposals can expect to add $50 million a year of revenue to the forecasts. This $50 million per year estimate relates to the fact that the proposals will make it more difficult to avoid tax under the transfer pricing and PE rules and easier to find and assess any remaining avoidance cases. This should reduce future avoidance arrangements and free up investigator resources. The changes will also result in more revenue being able to be assessed from any multinationals which continue to use transfer pricing or PE avoidance arrangements. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Our analysis of options has been primarily constrained by New Zealand’s DTAs. Under our DTAs, New Zealand can only tax non-residents on business profits if they have a PE in New Zealand. The OECD guidance permits departure from this only in respect of tax avoidance. We have also been somewhat constrained by the fact that New Zealand endorses the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. 1 Most of the submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Submissions on the discussion document The Government received 16 submissions on the discussion document from key stakeholders. 1 We also met with six of the main submitters to discuss their submissions in more detail. Many submitters strongly opposed the proposals that increased Inland Revenue’s power to investigate large multinationals. Others argued that the proposals could have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented. However, most submitters accepted the need for measures to address the transfer pricing and PE avoidance issues identified in the discussion document. Some submitters even welcomed the proposals as a positive step by the Government to ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax. Further consultation Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, we are planning to undertake further public Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 9 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 11 of 76 consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details, and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 10 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 12 of 76 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Officials have identified four mutually exclusive options to address the problem: • Option 1 – Status quo • Option 2 – MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines • Option 3 – Diverted profit tax • Option 4 – Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation) Option 1 is the only non-regulatory option. The other options involve implementing an international agreement or changing New Zealand tax legislation. Option 1: Status quo This option would retain the existing tax rules for multinationals (as described in the sections above). Under this option, Inland Revenue would continue trying to enforce the existing rules and/or apply the GAAR to challenge tax avoidance arrangements. Option 2: MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines Option 2 is to rely on the combination of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI) 2 and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines without amending our domestic law. Under this option, any PE avoidance issues would be addressed under the OECD’s new PE definition in the MLI, and any transfer pricing issues would be addressed by applying the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines. Option 3: Diverted profits tax Option 3 is to adopt a diverted profits tax (DPT). A DPT is a separate tax on the “diverted profits” that arise from transfer pricing and PE avoidance. It is levied at a penal rate, compared with income tax, and has greatly enhanced assessment and collection powers. Both the UK and Australia have already implemented a DPT to target multinationals engaging in BEPS strategies. DPTs are intended to incentivise taxpayers to pay the correct amount of income tax under the normal rules rather than to raise revenue by themselves. Option 4: Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation) This option involves adopting the package of measures proposed in the discussion document, with some changes resulting from consultation. The discussion document proposals have taken certain features of a DPT and combined them with the OECD’s BEPS measures and some domestic law amendments to produce a package of measures that is tailored for the New Zealand environment. The intention is that this approach would be as effective as a DPT in addressing transfer pricing and PE avoidance in New Zealand, but it would do so within our current frameworks and with fewer drawbacks. Under this option, we would introduce: • an anti-avoidance rule that will prevent multinationals from structuring their operations 2 The MLI allows countries to quickly and efficiently implement a number of the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan measures that can only be implemented through changes to DTAs, without having to bilaterally renegotiate their existing DTAs. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 11 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 13 of 76 to avoid having a PE (a taxable presence) in New Zealand where one exists in substance; • stronger transfer pricing rules which will adjust related party transactions if they do not align with the actual substance of the multinational’s economic activities; shift the burden of proof onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length; and extend the time bar for transfer pricing from four years to seven years; • stronger “source rules” so New Zealand has a greater ability to tax New Zealand- sourced income; and • a range of administrative measures that will strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large multinationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues) that do not cooperate with a tax investigation (such as allowing Inland Revenue to request information that is held by an offshore group member). Consultation These four options were identified prior to consultation. The discussion document proposed the adoption of a package of reforms combining elements of a DPT with the OECD’s recommendations and some domestic law amendments (option 4). The discussion document discussed the status quo (option 1) and the DPT (option 3). Some submitters proposed that the better approach would be to sign the MLI and apply the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines without amending our domestic law (option 2). In response to consultation we have refined the proposals so they are better targeted at BEPS arrangements with less compliance costs and fewer unintended impacts on compliant taxpayers engaging in ordinary, commercial dealings. Significant changes made as a result of consultation were: • More narrowly targeting the PE avoidance rule at avoidance arrangements (we will consult further on how best to achieve this). • Clarifying that the test for reconstructing an arrangement would be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. • The PE avoidance rule will only apply where an applicable DTA does not include the OECD’s widened PE definition (as in cases where the OECD’s new PE definition is included, the proposed PE avoidance rule will be unnecessary). • The anti-avoidance source rule will be more narrowly targeted at the existing issues Inland Revenue has identified with the source rules. • We have decided not to proceed with the proposal to require multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront as we agree with submitters that the existing “use of money interest” rates that Inland Revenue charges on unpaid tax provide a sufficient incentive to pay any tax which has been assessed. The above changes are likely to be welcomed by submitters. Evidence from Australia’s reforms Australia’s recent experience updating their transfer pricing laws (in 2013) and introducing a new Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL) demonstrates the effectiveness of tax reforms Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 12 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 14 of 76 to address PE avoidance and transfer pricing issues. Australia’s MAAL came into effect on 11 December 2015 and prevents multinationals from structuring their affairs to avoid having a PE in Australia. It is very similar to our proposed PE avoidance rule. As of 4 June 2017, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) had identified 221 taxpayers they believed to be shifting profits to a non-resident group member resident in a low-tax jurisdiction. Of these 221 taxpayers, the ATO has cleared 102. Furthermore, since the MAAL was introduced, 18 companies with PE avoidance structures have restructured their affairs to bring their sales onshore – and a further 11 are currently working with the ATO to restructure. According to the ATO, as a result of the introduction of the MAAL, an additional AUS$6.4 billion worth of assessable income will now be reported in Australia. This translates into $100 million a year in additional tax revenue for Australia. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; • Neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; and • Sustainability – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved. In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality, and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were, and continue to be, considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Two options were ruled out of scope due to their radical nature, namely: • cancel New Zealand’s DTAs; and • prevent multinationals from selling products in New Zealand if they were suspected of involvement in BEPS activities. The former would harm New Zealand exporters and outbound investors. The latter would not only harm New Zealand consumers (as they would no longer be able to import certain goods), but it would also violate New Zealand’s trade agreements.

See below for further details. Efficiency of administration 0 0 We do not expect there will be increased administrative costs under this option as the reforms largely change the way some taxpayers self-assess the income and deductions they report to Inland Revenue. - We expect there will be increased administrative costs under this option as a DPT is a separate tax from an income tax. 0 We do not expect there will be increased administrative costs under this option. T he proposed administrative measures should also make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate uncooperative multinationals. See below for further details. Neutrality 0 + Option 2 will remove some of the tax benefit of currently observed transfer pricing and PE avoidance opportunities in New Zealand. See below for further details. + Option 3 will remove the tax benefit of currently observed transfer pricing and PE avoidance opportunities involving New Zealand. However, it may have a negative impact on investment certainty for taxpayers. + + Option 4 will remove the tax benefit of all currently observed transfer pricin g and PE avoidance opportunities involving New Zealand. See below for further details.

Option 3 (Diverted profits tax) • Fairness and equity: While option 2 has some fairness benefits, it also has some significant fairness detriments owing to its penal tax rate, reduced taxpayer rights, and wide scope. Further, a DPT could also impact on the perception of the fairness of New Zealand’s tax system for multinationals investing into New Zealand. • Sustainability: C ompared to the other options it would provide less certainty for, and impose more compliance costs on, taxpayers. Option 4 (Discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation)) • Efficiency of compliance: It is also highly likely that a number of taxpayers will choose to restructure their affairs and/or apply APAs. • Efficiency of administration: The proposals may place a higher demand on Inland Revenue’s transfer pricing team and more transfer pricing specialists may be required to deal with this. • Neutrality: This option will ensure multinationals engaged in BEPS activities are not tax-advantaged over more compliant domestic and non-resident businesses. This will provide some efficiency gains. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 15 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 17 of 76 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? We consider that option 4 (discussion document proposals (as amended through consultation)) is the best option to combat transfer pricing and PE avoidance. Option 4 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand’s tax system by eliminating the ability for multinationals to engage in aggressive transfer pricing and PE avoidance schemes to receive tax benefits. Option 4 will: • ensure that multinationals cannot structure their affairs for the purpose of avoiding a taxable presence in New Zealand; • stop companies from shifting profits out of the New Zealand tax base through artificial arrangements; and • make it easier for Inland Revenue to investigate such multinationals. Option 4 will also improve the equity and fairness of New Zealand’s tax system. Multinationals engaging in BEPS activities are currently able to structure their affairs to receive unintended tax benefits placing them at a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic companies. As a result, these more compliant multinationals and domestic companies end up suffering a greater tax burden. Option 4 will therefore ensure that the tax burden is shared more equally among taxpayers. While option 4 will impose additional tax and compliance costs on some taxpayers, it is important to note that some of the measures will only apply to large multinational groups with over EUR €750 million of consolidated group turnover. Submitters on the discussion document argued that the imposition of higher tax payments may make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. However, as a number of like-minded countries throughout the OECD are undertaking similar BEPS measures, we believe that any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and that implementing the proposals in option 4 remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests (see further discussion in section 5.3 below). Option 1 (status quo) was preferred by a number of submitters to the discussion document. However, retaining the current rules would mean that those multinationals engaging in aggressive transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures would be able to continue, and the number of these types of avoidance cases would continue to increase. While New Zealand has a GAAR (see above in section 2.2), i t is unlikely to be effective at addressing all transfer pricing and PE avoidance structures on its own. This is because applying the GAAR often leads to resource-intensive court cases and it may be difficult to show that certain avoidance structures fail the Parliamentary contemplation component of the GAAR. Option 2 (MLI and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines) was the option suggested by many submitters. However, we consider that adopting the OECD’s recommendations on their own (without corresponding domestic amendments) would not effectively address the issue of transfer pricing and PE avoidance. First, New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing legislation does not contemplate an ability to apply some important aspects of the new OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. This means that Inland Revenue would only be able to Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 16 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 18 of 76 apply the guidelines to the extent that our current domestic rules allow. Domestic law changes would likely be needed to adequately address the issue. Second, while option 2 has some fairness benefits, it will not prevent all taxpayers from using such arrangements. This is because the MLI will only apply where both countries choose to adopt it – and many of New Zealand’s trading partners do not intend to adopt it. It is therefore important that New Zealand adopt its own PE avoidance measure to supplement the MLI, otherwise there would still be a gap for multinationals to exploit. Third, the OECD’s BEPS measures do not address issues specific to New Zealand, such as issues with our current source rules and the practical difficulties of taxing multinationals (such as information asymmetry and the administrative costs of taxpayer disputes). Option 3 (diverted profits tax) is not recommended. This option would provide less certainty for, and impose significant compliance costs on, taxpayers. This is because a DPT is a separate tax at a much higher rate than the standard company tax rate and includes stringent enforcement mechanisms. This means an investor may find themselves being charged a much higher rate of tax (plus interest and penalties) that can be difficult to challenge or credit against prior year losses or taxes charged by other countries. This increased risk and uncertainty may reduce their willingness to invest in New Zealand (compared to more certain investments elsewhere). 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Compliance costs: increased costs understanding the rules and applying them to transactions and structures for multinationals which currently engage in BEPS activities.

Low Low Low Low Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 18 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 20 of 76 \*Note that the evidence for the $50 million figure is a conservative estimate made in light of the behavioural uncertainty associated with introducing transfer pricing and PE avoidance rules together with the fact that the full extent of these types of avoidance arrangements affecting New Zealand is unknown. The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be significantly higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence. 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? During consultation on the discussion document, some submitters raised concerns that adopting the proposed measures would have a detrimental impact on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination. In particular, these submitters were concerned that the proposed measures introduce complex and onerous rules which may incentivise foreign companies to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand, thereby reducing GDP and lowering employment levels. The higher tax payments and compliance obligations resulting from these measures will inevitably make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. However, at the same time, these multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in our tax rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Furthermore, arbitrary reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment into New Zealand. New Zealand is also undertaking these BEPS measures in line with a number of like-minded countries throughout the OECD. Given this, we believe any impacts on foreign direct investment into New Zealand will not be material and implementing these measures remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests. It is also highly unlikely that foreign companies will remove their existing personnel from New Zealand as a result of these proposals. Most of the affected foreign companies are dependent on having personnel in New Zealand to arrange their sales. Without personnel on the ground, they would not be able to service their New Zealand market. It is also unlikely that they would cease to operate in New Zealand altogether. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? Yes, option 4 (to adopt the package of measures in the discussion document) conforms to Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 19 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 21 of 76 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. One exception is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules all advance pricing agreements (APAs) existing prior to the application date. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider the planned application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government’s intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment. In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we plan on meeting with taxpayers and preparing detailed guidance materials. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance rules | 20 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 22 of 76 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation, and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. When the MAAL was introduced in Australia, 18 companies restructured their affairs to bring their sales onshore (and a further 11 are currently working with the ATO to restructure). We envisage a similar response to our proposals whereby a number of taxpayers will restructure their affairs to report their sales in New Zealand. We also expect more taxpayers to apply for APAs as a result of the new transfer pricing rules. However, it will be difficult to assess the true impact of the transfer pricing proposals. Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post- implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is significantly unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation.

Why is Government intervention required? The problem the proposals discussed in this impact statement seek to address is the use of debt financing by taxpayers to reduce their New Zealand income tax liability significantly. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The adoption of a restricted transfer pricing rule for determining the allowable interest rate (for tax purposes) on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower will help ensure interest rates on such loans cannot be excessive. In addition, changing the way deductible debt levels are calculated under the thin capitalisation rules will ensure that taxpayers with little equity are unable to have large amounts of deductible debt. These changes will provide a solution that is sustainable, efficient and equitable, while minimising impacts on compliance and administration costs. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that the new interest limitation rules are forecast to produce approximately $80–90 million per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to these proposals which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 25 of 76 Where do the costs fall? The costs primarily fall on foreign-owned taxpayers operating in New Zealand (though there may be some minor impacts on New Zealand-owned taxpayers with international operations). Tax payments for affected parties are forecast to increase by approximately $80–90 million per year on an ongoing basis. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? As with all tax rules, there is some risk of taxpayer non-compliance. However, this is mitigated as the rules predominately apply to large companies – and the tax affairs of large companies are closely monitored by Inland Revenue. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is moderate evidence in relation to the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debt, and good evidence in relation to allowable debt levels. Inland Revenue has some data on interest rates paid on related-party debts, as well as examples of structures that appear to have the effect of increasing the interest rate on such debt. However, this data is not comprehensive. Inland Revenue has data on the debt, asset and equity levels of significant foreign-owned enterprises, which allows an accurate estimation of the impact of the non-debt liability adjustment for those firms. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria.

Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 3 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 27 of 76 Impact Statement: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem While good evidence of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is generally difficult to come by, there is an exception for BEPS in relation to interest payments. Fairly good data on interest deductions (especially for large firms) is available for analys is through Inland Revenue’s International Questionnaire. This dataset includes debt levels, related-party debt levels, and related-party interest payments of large foreign-owned firms. However, there are still limitations to that data – for example, data on interest rates on related-party debt (and the interest rates facing a New Zealand subsidiary’s parent company) is not captured in the Questionnaire. Where possible, this information was obtained from other sources (such as credit ratings of parent companies and disclosed related-party interest rates in financial statements) or estimated (for example, estimating interest rates based on related-party interest payments and related-party debt amounts). However, this other data is less comprehensive and accurate. Consultation The preferred option in relation to limiting interest rates on related-party interest rates has not been subject to consultation. This was because it was developed in response to submissions on the original proposals. However, it is similar in many respects to the original proposal, which was subject to consultation. In addition, to ensure the rule operates effectively and to mitigate the risk of unintended outcomes, it will be subject to consultation with submitters on the technical detail.

BEPS BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by some multinational enterprises ( MNEs) to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over MNEs not engaged in BEPS and domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter BEPS. BEPS using interest deductions The use of debt financing is one of the simplest ways of shifting taxable profits from one jurisdiction to another. For example, because interest payments are deductible, a related- party cross-border loan from a parent to a subsidiary can be used to reduce taxes payable in the jurisdiction that the subsidiary is located. New Zealand’s BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. This includes developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). If no further action is taken, MNEs that currently have high levels of debt in New Zealand, or highly-priced related-party debt, will be able to continue paying little tax in New Zealand. There is also a risk that additional MNEs would adopt similar structures. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand’s tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. New Zealand’s tax system has been the subject of numerous broad-based reviews – most recently the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group in 2010. It is well regarded and generally functions well. No other government agencies have a direct interest in the tax system. However, a good tax system is important for a well-functioning economy – many government agencies therefore Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 5 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 29 of 76 have an indirect interest in the tax system. Foreign investment in New Zealand is generally taxed under our company tax at 28 percent. New Zealand’s tax system has rules that limit the deductible debt levels and interest rates for taxpayers with foreign connections. These rules affect only foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. The impacted population is therefore predominately large companies. Thin capitalisation rules New Zealand has “thin capitalisation” rules to limit tax deductions for interests that non- residents are allowed. These rules generally require an investment owned by a non-resident to have a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 60 percent (interest deductions are denied to the extent the allowable debt-to-asset ratio is exceeded). Thin capitalisation rules also apply to New Zealand-owned firms (frequently referred to as the “outbound thin capitalisation rules”). These rules generally require a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 75 percent. They are designed to prevent a disproportionate portion of a New Zealand company’s debt being placed in New Zealand. Like the tax system as a whole, we consider that the thin capitalisation rules are serving us well. The rules are well understood and taxpayers subject to the rules generally have conservative debt levels and, for those with related-party debt, the debt is at conservative interest rates – as evidenced by the significant amount of tax paid by foreign-owned firms operating in New Zealand (foreign controlled firms paid 39 percent of company tax in the 2015 tax year). Transfer pricing rules It is important to limit not just the quantum of debt in New Zealand, but also the interest rate on that debt. For third-party debt, commercial pressures will drive the borrower to obtain as low an interest rate as possible. However, these pressures do not necessarily exist in a related-party context. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates. Broadly speaking (and as they apply to related-party debt), these rules seek to ensure that the interest rate on a given loan contract is in line with what would have been agreed between unrelated parties. NRWT While payments of interest to related parties are deductible, they are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). NRWT applies at either 15 percent or 10 percent, depending on whether New Zealand has a Double Taxation Treaty with the interest recipient’s home jurisdiction. This means that, while the use of debt can reduce tax payable in New Zealand, it does not completely eliminate it. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 6 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 30 of 76 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? A simple way that non-residents can reduce their New Zealand tax liability significantly is by capitalising a New Zealand investment with debt instead of equity, because they can then take interest deductions in New Zealand. This is shown in the example below. Example Australian investor A puts $100m of capital in a New Zealand company as equity. Company earns $10m from sales and pays $2.8m New Zealand tax. Company pays a net dividend (not tax deductible) of $7.2m to A. Total New Zealand tax is $2.8m. Australian investor B puts $100m of capital into a New Zealand company as debt, with an interest rate of 10%. Company earns $10m from sales but has to pay $10m of tax-deductible interest to B, reducing taxable income to $0. No tax is paid by the company, but a 10% tax on interest is imposed on B (non-resident withholding tax). Total New Zealand tax is $1m. Having a generally well regarded tax system does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An on-going policy challenge is to ensure that our tax rules are up to date and ensure that MNEs are paying a fair amount of tax in New Zealand. Base protection measures – such as rules for limiting the amount of debt allowable in New Zealand, and the interest rate on that debt – are therefore important. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non-residents to invest. This impact statement considers two related policy opportunities: • ensuring the rules for setting the allowable interest rates on related-party debt are sufficiently robust; and • ensuring the basis for setting the allowable debt level in the thin capitalisation rules is appropriate. Scale of the problem The OECD’s Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS Action Plan) included developing best-practice rules to limit BEPS using interest deductions (BEPS Action 4). We consider the fact that the OECD has included profit shifting using interest in its BEPS Action Plan as evidence that this is a significant policy issue internationally. As mentioned above, most MNEs operating here have relatively low levels of debt and do not have interest rates considered to be excessive. However, there are a small number of taxpayers with either debt levels that are too high, or interest rates that are excessive. While small in number, the fiscal impact of these arrangements is significant – we estimate the tax revenue lost is $80–90 million per year. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 7 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 31 of 76 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on scope. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stakeholders The stakeholders are primarily taxpayers (in particular, MNEs) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers’ affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. Consultation already undertaken In March 2017, the Government released the discussion document BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules. The discussion document consulted on two key proposals which are considered in this impact statement – new interest limitation rules and a non-debt liabilities adjustment to the thin capitalisation rules. The Government received 27 submissions on the discussion document. Most submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals. In general, submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS risks facing New Zealand, and that part of this would involve strengthening New Zealand’s rules for limiting interest deductions for firms with cross-border related-party debt. However, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward. The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Interest limitation The discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach for pricing inbound related-party loans. Instead, the allowable interest rate for such a loan would – in most instances – be set with reference to the New Zealand borrower’s parent’s borrowing costs (referred to as an “interest rate cap”). General reaction Most submitters argued that the interest rate cap proposal was not necessary and should not proceed. They noted that the Government, in the discussion document BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance, proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally. Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates. Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons, including that it: • is inconsistent with the arm’s length standard, so would result in double taxation; • will increase compliance costs; • will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk; and • has no international precedent. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 8 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 32 of 76 Only two submitters wrote in favour of the proposed cap. However, the proposal did attract positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts. Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks – “transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates, so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules”. Allowable debt levels The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand (“deductible debt”). Currently, the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer’s assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s assets is allowable). The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest-bearing debts (a “non-debt liability adjustment”). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities. General reaction Several submitters indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax). A number of other submitters argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers’ thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold. Stakeholders’ views displayed no clear pattern. Two big accounting firms agreed with the proposal while two others disagreed. Similarly, of the three major stakeholder groups who submitted on the proposal, one supported and two opposed the change. Deferred tax To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable profits and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer’s non-debt liabilities could include “deferred tax liabilities”, which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer’s assets could include “deferred tax assets” which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit. All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that, for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, deferred tax liabilities should be ignored. Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer’s assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities). Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 9 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 33 of 76 Submitters noted that Australia’s thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because: • often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future; • deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity; and • deferred tax balances can be volatile – taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them. Further consultation Following Cabinet decisions in July 2017, officials are planning to undertake further public consultation on outstanding policy issues, technical design details and an exposure draft of selected parts of the planned BEPS bill. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Related-party interest rates We have identified five mutually exclusive options to the address the problem of excessive interest rates on related-party debts. Option 4 (administrative guidance) is a non-regulatory option. The other options for change involve changing New Zealand’s tax legislation. Option 1: Interest rate cap (discussion document proposal) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Restricted transfer pricing Under a restricted transfer pricing approach, inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that: • There is a rebuttable presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent; and • All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have third-party debt featuring those terms and conditions. The types of modifications to the terms, conditions and surrounding circumstances we would seek to make under this approach are: o That the loan has no exotic terms that are generally not seen with third-party lending o That the loan is not subordinated o That the loan duration is not excessive o That the debt level of the borrower is not excessive. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 10 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 34 of 76 parent. This restricted transfer pricing rule would be coupled with a safe harbour, which would be based on the interest rate cap as initially proposed. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable. This option was developed following consultation to address some of the concerns raised by submitters; however, it has not itself been subject to consultation. Option 3: Adopt EBITDA-based rule (OECD recommended approach) This option would involve limiting the amount of interest deductions a taxpayer is allowed with reference to their earnings (specifically, their profits before deductions for interest, depreciation and amortisation are taken into account, also known as their EBITDA). This new approach would completely replace the thin capitalisation rules, becoming the new method for limiting interest deductions for taxpayers with international connections. This approach would constrain the tax effectiveness of highly priced debt, since it directly limits interest deductions rather than limiting the amount of debt; a taxpayer with highly priced debt would be more likely to exceed their EBITDA limit and face interest denial. Almost all submitters did not support the adoption of an EBITDA-based rule. Option 4: Administrative guidance This option would involve Inland Revenue issuing administrative guidance on how it will assess the risk of related-party lending transactions – similar to what has recently been released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (discussed below). Under this option, related-party loans with certain features (such as having an interest rate in line with the interest rate facing the borrower’s foreign parent) would be given a low risk rating and be unlikely to be challenged by Inland Revenue. Taxpayers with higher interest rates would be more likely to have their related-party loan investigated. Several submitters suggested this option be adopted in place of the interest rate cap. They argued that it would provide certainty for taxpayers who desired it, but taxpayers who value certainty less would be free to breach the guidelines. Option 5: Status quo (ordinary transfer pricing) This option would involve continuing to price related-party debt under the transfer pricing rules. As discussed above, the Government proposed strengthening these rules in the discussion document BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. Many submitters argued that this should be sufficient to address any concerns over related- party interest rates. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 11 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 35 of 76 Relevant experience from other countries The ATO has released draft guidelines regarding the interest rates of cross-border related- party loans. 1 These guidelines are designed to encourage Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies to restructure their related-party loans into ordinary “vanilla” loans. Overall, the guidelines have a clear expectation that the interest rate on related-party loans should be in line with the foreign parent’s cost of funds: “Generally, the ATO expects any pricing of a related-party debt to be in line with the commercial incentive of achieving the lowest possible ‘all-in’ cost to the borrower. The ATO expects, in most cases, the cost of the financing to align with the costs that could be achieved, on an arm’s length basis, by the parent of the global group to which the borrower and lender both belong.” Allowable debt levels We have identified three mutually exclusive options relating to setting the allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rules. The options (other than the status quo) involve changing New Zealand’s tax legislation. Option 1: Proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment (as proposed in the discussion document) As described in section 2.5. Option 2: Proceed with non-debt liabilities proposal excluding deferred tax Under this option, a taxpayer’s deferred tax would be ignored for the purposes of the non- debt liability adjustment. That is, a taxpayer’s allowable debt level would be set with reference to the result of the formula: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities). Of submitters who supported the proposed non-debt liability adjustment in principle, this was the preferred option. Option 3: Status quo (do not proceed with non-debt liabilities adjustment) Under this option, maximum deductible debt levels would continue to be calculated under the thin capitalisation rules with reference to assets, ignoring non-debt liabilities. As mentioned in section 2.5, this was the preferred option of some submitters. Relevant experience from other countries Australia has thin capitalisation rules that are broadly similar to New Zealand’s. Australia’s rules currently require a non-debt liability adjustment, but deferred tax is carved-out. That is, Australia’s rules are consistent with option 2. 1 ATO compliance approach to taxation issues associated with cross-border related-party financing arrangements and related transactions, PCG 2017/D4. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 12 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 36 of 76 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible; and • Sustainability – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved Efficiency, fairness and sustainability are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these three criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No options were ruled out of scope. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 13 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 37 of 76 Section 4: Impact Analysis Option 1 (interest rate cap) Option 2 (restricted transfer pricing) Option 3 (EBITDA-based rule) Option 4 (administrative guidance) Status quo Efficiency and neutrality + Option 1 will provide a strong limit on related-party interest rates, reduc ing the ability for some firms to profit shift. This would level the playing field for firms, providing efficiency gains. However, for some firms the interest rate allowed under the cap may be too low, which lowers the efficiency benefits. ++ Option 2 will provide a reasonably strong limit on related- party debt interest rates, reducing the ability for some firms to profit shift. This would level the playing field for firms, providing efficiency gains. 0 Option 3 will provide an effective limit on all interest expenses (including related-party interest expenses). However, it also increases the uncertainty of returns on New Zealand investment, since whether or not interest is deductible turns on a taxpayer’s EBITDA, which can be very variable. + Some taxpayers would benefit from the certainty provided by the administrative safe harbour. However, for taxpayers willing to exceed the safe harbour, this option is no different than the status quo – excessive interest rates on related-party debt would still be possible. 0 Fairness and equity ++ Option 1 has fairness benefits as it would ensure taxpayers cannot have excessive interest rates on their related-party debts. ++ Option 2 has fairness benefits as it would ensure taxpayers cannot have excessive interest rates on their related-party debts. 0 On the one hand, option 3 would be somewhat effective at preventing excessive interest rates. On the other hand, it could res ult in interest denial for firms with very conservative interest rates and debt positions (say, for example, if a taxpayer is in loss). 0 Option 4 would not prevent firms from achieving excessive interest rates on related-party debt. For taxpayers willing to exceed the administrative s afe, harbour this option is no different to the status quo. 0 Efficiency of compliance ++ Option 1 would reduce compliance costs for many taxpayers – the allowable interest rate on related-party debt would be set on a clear objective factor (the credit rating of the foreign parent). However, in some cases – where the non-resident parent has no credit rating – compliance costs will stay the same or could potentially increase. + Option 2 would reduce complianc e costs s omewhat, as the interest rat e cap would be available as a safe harbour. Taxpayers not utilising the safe harbour will still be required to do a transfer pricing analysis (i.e. same as status quo) 0 Compliance costs in some instances would reduce under option 3, as there would be fewer transfer pricing disputes about related- party debt. However, an EBITDA-based rule would be a fundamental shift in our interest limitation rules – taxpayers and agents would have to come to grips with an entirely new regime. + Option 4 would reduce compliance costs somewhat, as the interest rate cap would be available as a safe harbour. Taxpayers not utilising the safe harbour will still be required to do a transfer pricing analysis (i.e. same as status quo). 0 Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 14 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 38 of 76 Efficiency of administration ++ Option 1 would avoid the need for potentially complex and expensive disputes over whether the interest rate on related- party debt is set appropriate. ++ Option 2 would reduce the need to review the interest rates of taxpayers utilising the safe harbour. For the remaining taxpayers, the restrictions (e.g. striking out exotic terms) would simplify the transfer pricing analysis. + Option 3 would reduce administration costs because there would be less need to review and challenge related- party loans under transfer pricing. + Option 4 would reduce the need to review the interest rates of taxpayers utilising the safe harbour. 0 Sustainability + Option 1 would apply to taxpayers that have structured their affairs to strip the maximum profits out of New Zealand; however, it could also affect the interest rates of less aggressive taxpayers. ++ Option 2 should generally only affect taxpayers with more aggressive debt structures. 0 Option 3 could result in interest deduction denial even if a taxpayer has conservative debt levels. + Option 4 would not prevent firms from achieving excessive interest rates on related-party debt. 0 Overall assessment + ++ Recommended option 0 + 0 Key: ++ much better than the status quo + better than the status quo 0 about the same as the status quo - worse than the status quo - - much worse than the status quo Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 15 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 39 of 76 Allowable debt levels Option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment) Option 2 (adjustment with no deferred tax) Status quo Efficiency and neutrality + Option 1 will reduce the allowable debt levels for taxpayers with little equity (and high levels of non-debt liabilities). This will help ensure taxpayers have a more commercial level of debt. It will also equalise the thin capitalisation outcomes for taxpayers in otherwise similar situations. This should improve efficiency. However, submitters have argued that in some instances deferred tax (a type of non- debt liability) does not represent real liabilities; to the extent this is correct, reducing allowable debt levels in relation to these liabilities could hamper efficiency. + Option 2 will reduce the allowable debt levels for taxpayers with little equity (and high levels of non-debt liabilities). This will help ensure taxpayers have a more commercial level of debt. It will also equalise the thin capitalisation outcomes for taxpayers in otherwise similar situations. This should improve efficiency. However, this option carves out all types of deferred tax – yet, in many instances, deferred tax will represent a future tax payment a taxpayer will be required to make. To the extent this is the case, this option would allow some taxpayers to have too high a debt level. 0 Fairness and equity + Taxpayers with the same level of accounting profit will have the same thin capitalisation outcomes. This option therefore improves fairness. However, submitters have argued that in some instances deferred tax does not represent a real liability. To the extent this is correct, including deferred tax in the non-debt liability adjustment could be seen as unfair. + Taxpayers with the same level of accounting profit will have the same thin capitalisation outcomes. This option therefore improves fairness. However, this option excludes all deferred tax – yet, in many instances, deferred tax will represent a future tax payment a taxpayer will be required to make. To the extent this is the case, this option will not treat taxpayers in the same situation the same. 0 Efficiency of compliance 0 Neither option will have a significant impact on compliance costs. The result of both options is just a change to how the existing thin capitalisation calculations are carried out. However, there may be some one-off compliance costs if the changes mean taxpayers breach their thin capitalisation limits and, as a result, decide to restructure their borrowing. 0 Efficiency of administration 0 Neither option has a significant impact on administrative costs. Thin capitalisation calculations are carried out by taxpayers – this change has no substantive impact on Inland Revenue. 0 Sustainability + Both options similarly target firms with debt levels that are too high relative to their levels of equity and are therefore well targeted. Firms with low levels of debt, or with reasonable levels of debt relative to equity, will be largely unaffected by either option. 0 Overall assessment + + 0 Key: ++ much better than the status quo + better than the status quo 0 about the same as the status quo - worse than the status quo - - much worse than the status quo Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 16 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 40 of 76 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Interest limitation We consider that option 2 – developing a restricted transfer pricing approach – is the best option to limit interest expenses in relation to inbound related-party debt. Following consultation and further analysis, we consider that if the Government pursued the interest rate cap (option 1), adjustments would be needed to the original discussion document proposal which would make it more complex. For example, to address some of the concerns expressed by submitters, a different or modified rule may need to be applied to firms with low levels of debt. The result of these adjustments would be that different rules would apply to taxpayers in different situations (more so than originally proposed). Such differences create perceptions of unfairness, and give rise to boundaries that can be difficult to formulate, administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient – especially as taxpayers try to arrange their circumstances to fall within certain boundaries. The difficulty is, however, that simply relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by some submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes. It is clear that the international consensus (as reflected in the OECD recommendation for countries to adopt an arbitrary formulaic approach (EBITDA)) is to move away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. In addition, as noted in section 2.5, commentators have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions. Accordingly, we consider that the restricted transfer pricing rule is the best approach. Like the interest rate cap, it will ensure the policy objective – ensuring there is a robust mechanism for determining the interest rates for inbound related-party debt; however, since the restricted transfer pricing rule has more flexibility (compared to the interest rate cap – the other option that would most effectively achieve the policy objective) it is both more efficient and fairer. Owing to the time available (and since it was developed subsequent to the initial consultation), this option has not been subject to consultation with stakeholders. This modification will address many, but not all of, submitters’ concerns – it is still a departure from using ordinary transfer pricing. Nevertheless, we expect that it will be more acceptable compared to the originally proposed interest rate cap because: • it allows for some limited flexibility – meaning the allowable interest rate can depart from the cost of funds facing the foreign parent if that is appropriate in the circumstances; and • it would be subject to the Mutual Agreement Procedure under New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements, meaning taxpayers who consider that the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty could seek resolution. This will address double taxation concerns. We do not, however, expect this will occur frequently because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related party debt. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 17 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 41 of 76 Allowable debt levels At this stage, we do not have a preference between option 1 (non-debt liability adjustment as originally proposed) and option 2 (non-debt liability adjustment with deferred tax carve- out). Option 3 (status quo) is not preferred. Both options 1 and 2 have similar impacts in terms of efficiency and fairness (and have no significant impacts in terms of compliance and administration costs). The non-debt liability adjustment in option 1 is potentially too extensive because of the inclusion of all types of deferred tax, but, on the other hand, the adjustment in option 2 is too narrow because of the exclusion of all deferred tax. We consider that the best approach is to recommend neither options 1 or 2 at this stage, but instead consult further with stakeholders on whether there is another feasible option (since this is a minor technical detail, more consultation on this matter is feasible). For example, it might be possible to identify deferred tax liabilities that are the least likely to result in a future tax payment, and restrict the carve-out of deferred tax to just that identified group.

As discussed above, allowing BEPS through interest deductions is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take use interest deductions to reduce their New Zealand (and possibly worldwide) tax liability is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders. It is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself, which all of the stakeholders already discussed have an interest in preserving. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? Yes. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Implementation of both reforms (relating to related-party interest rates and allowable debt level) will be given effect through a combination of legislation and Inland Revenue administrative guidance. The legislative changes proposed will be progressed (subject to Cabinet approval) as part of a BEPS taxation bill to be introduced in late 2017. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin. In relation to the allowable debt level proposal, we will consult further with stakeholders on whether a preferred option can be identified. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue will make the final decision on which option should be progressed (option 1, option 2, or a potential new option) following this consultation. These reforms are expected to apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018, subject to legislation progressing to enactment before this date. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that transitional relief or grandparenting should be provided to give taxpayers sufficient lead-in time to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider that the planned application date of 1 July 2018 is sufficiently prospective because: • the interest rate proposal applies only to related-party transactions (which are more easily altered compared to transactions with third-parties); and • in relation to the allowable debt level proposal, debt and asset levels under the thin capitalisation rules can be measured as at the end of the relevant income year, meaning taxpayers would have until at least 30 June 2019 to rearrange their affairs. In addition, in response to consultation, we propose that advanced pricing agreements Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 21 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 45 of 76 (APAs) existing prior to the application date of these changes will be grandparented. Once the proposals are implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is the risk that the relevant transfer pricing legislation could contain unintended errors or have unintended consequences. However, this risk can be efficiently managed by way of remedial amendments. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. Inland Revenue closely monitors the tax affairs of New Zealand’s largest companies (which are, in general, the affected population of these proposals). For example, Inland Revenue currently collects data from these firms on their debt levels (including levels of related-party debt) through its International Questionnaire. This will allow how the proposals have impacted debt levels and related-party interest payments to be analysed. More generally, Inland Revenue is considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for all the BEPS measures being implemented. Any additional information may be collected via a disclosure statement that must be provided to Inland Revenue or it may be collected using existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTTP involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, following enactment, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect could either be included as remedial amendments in future tax bills, or if they involve more complex issues could be added to the tax policy work programme. Further consultation would be implicit in this approach. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules | 22 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 46 of 76 Coversheet: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Advising agencies Inland Revenue, The Treasury Decision sought This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Proposing Ministers Steven Joyce (Finance) and Hon Judith Collins (Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The policy problem is that taxpayers can reduce their worldwide tax liability through hybrid mismatch arrangements, which in most cases are deliberately designed to take advantage of the different characterisations countries use for financial instruments and entities. Hybrid mismatch arrangements (which include branch mismatches) result in less group taxation when compared with straightforward arrangements that are seen consistently by the relevant countries. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? A tailored adoption of the OECD’s BEPS Action 2 recommendations will comprehensively deal with the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements while making modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This tailored solution is sustainable and achieves gains to efficiency and fairness, while minimising compliance costs where possible. There will be a significant benefit in adopting a solution which is adopted by other countries and which will therefore be easier for multinational businesses to understand and comply with. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The Government will benefit in that new rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements are forecast to produce approximately $50 m illion per year on an ongoing basis. There are also efficiency and fairness benefits to this regulatory proposal which cannot be assigned to particular beneficiaries. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 47 of 76 Where do the costs fall? Taxpayers that use hybrid mismatch arrangements will face a medium level of compliance costs. These may be up-front, in the form of restructuring costs to transition to more straightforward (non-hybrid) arrangements, or they may be ongoing in the case of taxpayers that keep their hybrid mismatch arrangements in place and must apply new tax rules in order to comply with the law. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? There is some risk of taxpayer noncompliance with the proposed rules. However, the risk of taxpayers being inadvertently caught by the proposed rules has been minimised due to the design of the preferred regulatory option which seeks to exclude the most simple offshore structures (foreign branches). More generally, the impacts have been reduced through the proposals taking into account the New Zealand context and adjusting the OECD- recommended rules as needed. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Not every type of hybrid arrangement that would be countered by the proposals has been observed in New Zealand. However, Inland Revenue is aware of some historic and current hybrid arrangements, and there is a very high likelihood there are others that relate to New Zealand and will be affected by this regulatory proposal. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the BEPS – hybrid mismatch arrangements Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 2 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 48 of 76 Impact Statement: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final tax policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Evidence of the problem Our analysis has been limited somewhat by our inability to assess the exact size of the hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements problem in New Zealand. Inland Revenue is aware of some mismatch arrangements, but the full extent of the problem is unknown. This is because evidence of the problem pri marily comes from Inland Revenue’s investigations staff. Under current law these staff do not routinely examine offshore tax treatment (and therefore arrangements that lower a group’s worldwide tax obligations) , which is an important part of identifying a hybrid mismatch arrangement under the proposals. Range of options considered Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD’s work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand’s ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis The estimated impact of the options is dependent on the behavioural response of taxpayers to the introduction of some form of hybrid mismatch arrangement rules. Taxpayers may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of any proposed rules, which will have flow-on effects as to efficiency, compliance costs and revenue implications. Beyond anecdotal information learned through consultation, it is difficult to assess the extent and nature of the behavioural response.

BEPS Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinational groups to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole. In October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its final package of 15 recommended tax measures for countries to implement to counter base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Hybrid mismatch arrangements Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when taxpayers exploit inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. The OECD’s BEPS package includes Action 2: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are prevalent worldwide and are an important part of the base erosion and profit shifting strategies used by multinational companies. If no action is taken by the international community to counter these types of arrangements they are likely to continue to be used to avoid worldwide taxation and drive economic inefficiencies and unfairly distributed tax burdens. New Zealand’s BEPS work The New Zealand Government has signalled a willingness to address BEPS issues and has taken tangible action in this regard. New Zealand is a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project to address international tax avoidance and is advancing a number of measures that are OECD/G20 BEPS recommendations. In September 2016 the Government released a BEPS discussion document: Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements which proposed adoption of the OECD Action 2 recommendations in New Zealand and sought submissions on how that should be done. In March 2017 the Government released two further discussion documents: BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules; and BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance. As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand. This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions. At the same time, Cabinet noted that the reforms proposed in the BEPS documents would be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. Cabinet also noted that officials are continuing to develop and consult on all aspects of the BEPS project and that Cabinet approval will be sought for final policy decisions later in 2017. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 4 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 50 of 76 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand’s tax system New Zealand has a broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation framework. This means that tax bases are broad and tax rates are kept as low as possible while remaining consistent with the Government’s distributional objectives. The BBLR framework also means that the tax system is not generally used to deliver incentives or encourage particular behaviours. Company tax and international rules The company tax system is designed to be a backstop for taxing the personal income of domestic investors. Company tax is deducted at 28%, but New Zealand based investors can claim imputation credits for tax paid by the company when the income is taxed upon distribution at the personal level. At the same time, the company tax is designed as a final tax on New Zealand-sourced income of foreign investors and foreign-owned companies earning New Zealand-sourced income. Having a consistent tax framework such as BBLR does not mean that tax changes are unnecessary. An ongoing policy challenge in the area of international tax is to ensure that multinational firms pay a fair and efficient amount of tax in New Zealand. Anti-avoidance rules and base protection measures are important part of ensuring that New Zealand collects an appropriate amount of tax on non-resident investment. At the same time, it is important that New Zealand continues to be a good place to base a business and that tax does not get in the way of this happening. New Zealand relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund domestic investment and, as such, the Government is committed to ensuring New Zealand remains an attractive place for non- residents to invest. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements Businesses can use hybrid mismatch arrangements to create tax advantages through exploiting inconsistencies in the way that jurisdictions treat financial instruments and entities under their respective domestic law. For example, using a hybrid entity or a foreign branch, a single expense may be deducted in two different jurisdictions, potentially reducing the tax payable on two different streams of income. Another example is a payment that is tax- deductible in one jurisdiction with no corresponding taxable income in the jurisdiction where the payment is received. However it is achieved, the result of a hybrid mismatch arrangement is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates when compared with a straightforward arrangement that is seen consistently by both relevant countries. Hybrid mismatch arrangements also have the effect of subsidising international investment relative to domestic investment, which distorts the efficiency of global markets. Since releasing its final recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements, the OECD expanded the scope of BEPS Action 2 to include branch mismatches. Branch mismatch arrangements are a result of countries approaching the allocation of income and expenses between a branch and a head office in different ways. Branch mismatch arrangements can also result in a reduction in the overall taxation of a corporate group, so are similar in effect to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 5 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 51 of 76 It is important to note that the policy problem is limited to circumstances when global tax is reduced as a result of a hybrid mismatch. This project does not address other mechanisms that taxpayers may use to lower their global tax liability, such as the use of low-tax jurisdictions to trap income. Hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand New Zealand has a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) that can, in some instances, neutralise the effects of a hybrid mismatch arrangement. However, the target of the GAAR is arrangements that avoid New Zealand tax. The arrangement must also do so in a manner that is outside Parliament’s contemplation; a classic indicator being that the arrangement gains the advantage in an artificial or contrived way. Although the use of a hybrid mismatch arrangement reduces the overall tax paid by the parties to the arrangement, it is often difficult to determine which country involved has lost tax revenue. Further, the use of a hybrid is not necessarily artificial or contrived in and of itself. Accordingly, the GAAR does not provide a comprehensive solution to counter the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements. New Zealand also has some specific rules in its domestic law that go some way to addressing particular recommendations made by the OECD in relation to hybrid mismatch arrangements. Inland Revenue is aware of a significant volume of hybrid mismatch arrangements involving New Zealand. For example, the amount of tax at issue in recent litigation for a prominent type of hybrid financial instrument was approximately $300 million (across multiple years). In relation to hybrid entities, deductions claimed in New Zealand that are attributable to the most prominent hybrid entity structure results in approximately $50 million less tax revenue for New Zealand per year. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Our analysis has been constrained by the scope and nature of the OECD’s work on hybrid mismatch arrangements. For reasons of international compatibility it would be unwise for New Zealand to design a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This limitation has been mitigated to a certain extent by New Zealand’s ongoing involvement in the development of the OECD recommendations. Consistent with the OECD approach, the analysis has been focused on arrangements between related parties or where a hybrid mismatch has been created through a structured arrangement between unrelated parties. We have also chosen to restrict the policy thinking to cross-border activity. Purely domestic hybrid mismatches (some of which are contemplated by the OECD Action 2 final report) are outside the scope of this regulatory proposal. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Stakeholders Stakeholders of this regulatory proposal are primarily taxpayers (typically multinational businesses that have hybrid mismatch arrangements) and tax advisors. The proposed rules will be applied to taxpayers’ affairs, while tax advisors will assist (taxpayer) clients as to the application of the proposed rules. The proposed rules affect only taxpayers with foreign Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 6 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 52 of 76 connections – that is, foreign-owned New Zealand taxpayers, and New Zealand-owned taxpayers with foreign operations. Another stakeholder of this regulatory proposal is the OECD, which is aiming to eradicate hybrid mismatch arrangements to the extent possible. This goal can only be achieved through countries adopting hybrid mismatch rules of some kind and neutralising the mismatches that arise when different sets of rules apply to the same transaction or entity. In addition, other countries that have enacted or are proposing to enact hybrid mismatch rules (for example, Australia and the United Kingdom) will be interested in the interaction between their own hybrid mismatch rules and any rules that New Zealand introduce into law. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is interested in the regulatory proposal to the extent that it affects bank regulatory capital. Submissions to discussion document There were 20 submissions made to the September 2016 Government discussion document. Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals both in general views and specific coverage. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions of some variety. However, a greater number of submitters were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand. Submissions also covered a number of specific aspects of, and general concerns with, the proposals, including the complexity of the proposals and that New Zealand should not be in the first wave of countries adopting the proposals. Further and ongoing consultation We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers’ Association) in order to discuss specific design issues relating to hybrid mismatch arrangements. We have also consulted with officials representing Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the proposed rules work as intended, and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation. We have also consulted with the Reserve Bank. The Treasury has been heavily involved with the policy development process in their joint role with Inland Revenue as tax policy advisors for the Government. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 7 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 53 of 76 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Four options were considered in the development of this regulatory proposal. These options are mutually exclusive and can be regarded as four points on a decision spectrum measuring how closely (if it all) New Zealand aligns itself with the OECD recommendations in dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements. None of the options (with the exception of the status quo option) are non-regulatory options. This is because our judgment is that the policy problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot be addressed without changing tax rules, and that is something that can only be done through the use of legislation (as per section 22(a) of the Constitution Act 1986). These options are what we consider other countries dealing with hybrid mismatch arrangements will consider in their policy development process. The United Kingdom and Australia can both be said to have chosen their own version of option 2. Some other countries have had rules to deal with hybrid mismatches that predate the OECD’s work in this area. Status quo: No action This option relies on New Zealand’s existing law (including the GAAR) to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements and avoids the increased compliance costs and administrative costs of the other options. The status quo option also contemplates that other countries have introduced or will introduce their own hybrid mismatch rules, some of which will neutralise hybrid mismatch arrangements relating to New Zealand. Option 1: Strict adoption of OECD recommendations The OECD recommendations as set out in its BEPS Action 2 report are a comprehensive set of principle-based rules to counteract all types of hybrid mismatch arrangements. Option 1 is to strictly adopt those recommendations as described by the OECD into New Zealand domestic law. This option would deal with the range of hybrid mismatch arrangements targeted by the OECD to the extent they are found in or affect New Zealand. It would have the advantage of interacting well with other countries that similarly adopt the OECD recommendations into their domestic law. Option 2: Tailored adoption of OECD recommendations Option 2 is to adopt the core principles of the OECD recommendations with suitable modifications and variations to take into account what is appropriate for the New Zealand context. This option bears close relation to Option 1 as it involves introducing OECD- consistent hybrid rules unless there is a compelling reason to depart from the OECD approach. Thus, this option would solve the policy problem while ensuring that particular New Zealand issues are addressed. Option 2 also recognises that there are some instances where New Zealand’s existing tax laws are sufficient (or can be made sufficient with relatively minor amendment) to achieve the effect intended by an OECD recommendation. Option 3: Targeted hybrid rules Option 3 is to introduce targeted hybrid rules that address only the significant hybrid mismatches that the Government is aware of. This option would solve the policy problem by addressing the current hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting New Zealand. It would avoid Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 8 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 54 of 76 enacting rules targeted at arrangements which are not currently seen in New Zealand. Consultation These four options were identified prior to consultation. The September 2016 discussion document proposed adoption of the OECD recommendations (options 1 and 2) and sought feedback on how that should be done. The document stated the Government’s alternative options as option 3 and maintaining the status quo and concluded that they were not the best way forward. Consultation has affected the nature of option 2 in particular and has been helpful for options analysis generally. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible • Neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way • Sustainability – the potential for tax evasion and avoidance should be minimised while keeping counteracting measures proportionate to risks involved In relation to this regulatory proposal, it would be difficult to achieve positive sustainability, neutrality and fairness impacts without some increase in compliance costs and so there are some trade-offs that were and continue to be considered. Through our consultation we have worked with stakeholders to minimise compliance costs as much as possible without sacrificing the benefits of the proposal. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? We ruled out designing a largely unique set of hybrid mismatch rules that departs from the principles that the OECD has advocated for. This is for reasons of international compatibility and to save compliance costs. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 9 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 55 of 76 Section 4: Impact Analysis Status quo: No action Option 1: Strict adoption Option 2: Tailored adoption Option 3: Targeted rules Efficiency of compliance 0 - - Option 1 has a significant compliance burden because some of the OECD recommendations as drafted would not mesh well with New Zealand’s existing tax laws. - Option 2 imposes increased compliance costs on taxpayers and advisors, but is focused on reducing those costs where possible. - Option 3 imposes increased compliance costs on taxpayers and advisors, but by its nature it reduces those costs in proposing rules that only address currently observed exploitation of hybrid mismatches. Efficiency of administration 0 0 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR. 0 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR. 0 We expect the additional costs to Inland Revenue of administering a tax system with hybrid mismatch rules to be balanced by less resources used disputing hybrid mismatch arrangements using the GAAR. Neutrality 0 ++ Option 1 will comprehensively remove the benefit of hybrid mismatch opportunities involving New Zealand. This will provide significant efficiency gains. ++ Option 2 will comprehensively remove the benefit of hybrid mismatch opportunities involving New Zealand. This will provide significant efficiency gains. + Option 3 will remove the tax benefit of currently observed hybrid mismatch opportunities involving New Zealand. This will likely provide some efficiency gains. However, other hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities will remain available. This means that, depending on the extent to which taxpayers respond to an option 3 approach by simply moving into “uncovered” tax-efficient hybrid structures, there will still be some inefficient allocations of investment due to ongoing hybrid mismatch arrangements. Fairness and equity 0 + Option 1 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability. + Option 2 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability. + Option 3 has fairness and equity benefits as it ensures that taxpayers able to use currently observed hybrid mismatch arrangements cannot reduce their tax liability. However, this option’s fairness impact depends on the behavioural effects of introducing these rules to a greater extent than options 1 and 2. Sustainability 0 ++ Option 1 will remove current and future hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities involving New Zealand. ++ Option 2 will remove current and future hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities involving New Zealand. + Option 3 will remove currently known hybrid mismatch arrangement opportunities involving New Zealand. However, this option’s sustainability is limited. It will leave some hybrid mismatches unaddressed, which may be exploited at a later date by opportunistic taxpayers.

We consider that option 2 is the best option for addressing the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements. It is an internationally consistent, proactive option which delivers net benefits to New Zealand greater than that of the other options considered. Option 2 will improve the neutrality of New Zealand’s tax system. Businesses that are able to exploit hybrid mismatch arrangements can currently operate at lower effective tax rates when compared with other businesses. This can result in a ‘hybrid’ business crowding out more productive investment and making international investment decisions based on whether a mismatch is available rather than commercial grounds. In addition, the imposition of higher taxes elsewhere in order to make up lost tax revenue due to the use of hybrid mismatches is likely to be less efficient than imposing more moderate taxes across all economic actors. By eliminating the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements in a comprehensive way, these inefficiencies can be removed. In a related sense, option 2 will help to improve the equity and fairness of the New Zealand tax system. Unintended tax benefits that are streamed to some taxpayers who are able to take advantage of hybrid mismatches means that a greater tax burden must fall on other taxpayers (such as purely domestic firms) who do not have the hybrid mismatch opportunities that cross border businesses do. Accordingly, introducing rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements will restore some fairness to the tax system as those tax burdens will be shared more equally. Option 2 will also have revenue collection benefits. The New Zealand tax revenue loss caused by the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is difficult to estimate because the full extent of arrangements involving New Zealand is unknown and because the behavioural effects of introducing hybrid mismatch rules are difficult to ascertain. However, the tax revenue at stake is significant in the cases that Inland Revenue is aware of. Importantly, the case for New Zealand to adopt the OECD recommendations is strengthened by the fact that other countries have enacted, or are proposing to enact, hybrid mismatch rules. This is because a hybrid mismatch arrangement involving a New Zealand counterparty may still be neutralised by the other country if they have a ‘secondary’ right to counteract under OECD principles. In that case, the tax benefit of the hybrid mismatch would be eliminated, but the tax collected would be by the counterparty country. In these circumstances, New Zealand would be better off having its own hybrid mismatch rules so that it can collect revenue when it has the priority to do so under the OECD recommendations. Whether New Zealand or the counterparty country collects any additional revenue as a result of implementing the rules depends on the actions taken by the affected business. Option 2 is ultimately a balance between the positive impacts described above and the trade- off compliance costs. It attempts to introduce a comprehensive set of rules which is adjusted for the New Zealand tax environment. For instance, we identified early in the policy development process that one of the OECD recommendations would not interact smoothly with New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of the foreign branches of New Zealand companies. The recommendation in question had to be modified under option 2 so that the tax treatment of a simple offshore branch structure of a New Zealand company (which is not part of the policy problem) would be unaffected by the introduction of the hybrid mismatch Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 11 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 57 of 76 rules. We have also recommended a delay to the effective date of an OECD-recommended rule which applies to what are known as “unstructured imported mismatches”. This rule could cause undue compliance costs if it was to come into effect at the same time as the other rules. Delaying its effective date until a significant number of other countries have introduced hybrid mismatch rules means the associated New Zealand-specific compliance costs will either disappear or will be no greater than the costs faced by a multinational group operating in those other countries. Accordingly, the compliance costs of the regulatory proposal are to be minimised to the extent possible, while still introducing a comprehensive set of rules to deal with the range of OECD-identified hybrid mismatches. This is where option 2 shows its advantage over option 1 which we view as having similar efficiency, fairness and revenue benefits. Option 1 would result in relatively higher compliance costs because the OECD recommendations are designed as a general set of best-practice rules and, in regards to their detail, are not necessarily optimal for individual countries such as New Zealand. When compared with option 1, option 2 ensures that the rules are workable and appropriate for the New Zealand tax environment. It is also important to note that the ongoing compliance costs relating to this regulatory issue are expected to be optional in the majority of cases. The proposed rules will apply to taxpayers who use a hybrid mismatch arrangement after the rules become effective. Those taxpayers will generally have the option of incurring one-off costs to restructure into non- hybrid arrangements and remove themselves from the scope of the proposed rules. Any higher tax payments resulting from the non-status quo options will make cross border investment less attractive for taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements. However, these taxpayers should not be allowed to exploit hybrid mismatches to achieve a competitive advantage over taxpayers that do not use hybrid mismatch arrangements (such as purely domestic firms). Further, a significant number of New Zealand’s major investment partners have introduced or will introduce hybrid mismatch rules. Other countries adopting these rules means that in many cases the tax efficiency of hybrid mismatch arrangements in New Zealand will be negated through the operation of the other country’s rules on the counterparty, As a result, we believe that any impacts on inbound and outbound cross border investment from introducing hybrid mismatch rules in New Zealand will be low. The status quo option would involve the least complexity and lowest compliance costs. However, similar to the cross-border investment discussion above, taxpayers whose groups deal with New Zealand’s major trading partners that are adopting hybrid mismatch rules would have to understand the impact of those rules. The additional complexity of New Zealand having hybrid mismatch rules would therefore be lessened by the international momentum in this area. Option 3 is an option that was preferred by many submitters to the Government discussion document on hybrid mismatch arrangements. Submitters pointed out that many of the structures considered by the OECD to be problematic have not been seen in New Zealand and therefore do not need to be counteracted. They also argued that the OECD recommendations are complex and have the potential for overreach. We do not think a targeted approach would serve New Zealand well when compared with option 2. The OECD recommendations are a coherent package intending to deal to the problem of hybrid mismatch arrangements exhaustively. Deliberately omitting aspects of the recommendations from New Zealand’s response may cause taxpayers to exploit those remaining hybrid mismatch opportunities (which may even be seen as tacitly blessed). To the extent that happens, the efficiency, revenue, and fairness benefits of option 3 would be eroded. In Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 12 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 58 of 76 addition, other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have introduced or are intending to introduce a relatively comprehensive set of hybrid mismatch rules. If New Zealand does the same it will ensure our rules are internationally comparable and that they interact well with the rules of other countries without significant compliance issues. By favouring option 2, we also have consulted extensively on the OECD recommendations and how they should best be introduced into New Zealand law. This consultation has enabled us to design suitable modifications to the OECD recommendations to reduce complexity and compliance costs, limit overreach, and in some cases, increase the efficiency of the outcomes. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (e.g. ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (e.g. compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Compliance costs: Increased costs from understanding the rules and applying them to taxpayers’ transactions and structures. Or, restructuring costs of transitioning to non-hybrid arrangements to fall outside the scope of the rules.

The actual revenue generated from these reforms may therefore be higher, but this cannot be estimated with confidence. 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? As discussed above, allowing the use of hybrid mismatch arrangements is inefficient and unfair, as it results in uneven tax burdens across different businesses. This is an issue in itself, but it may also weaken taxpayer morale. The perception of unfairness that comes from the reported low corporate taxes paid by taxpayers who can take advantage of hybrid mismatch opportunities (and/or employ other BEPS strategies) is an important issue. This perception of unfairness undermines public confidence in the tax system and therefore the willingness of taxpayers to voluntarily comply with their own tax obligations. This integrity factor is difficult to assign to a particular set of stakeholders as it is something that is fundamental to the tax system itself. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? Yes, option 2 (tailored adoption of OECD recommendations) conforms to the expectations for the design of regulatory systems document. costs Administrative costs Low High Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Regulators Revenue: Revenue collected from tax payable item described above.

The preferred option will be given effect through amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The bill, when introduced, will be accompanied by commentary in order to provide stakeholders with guidance as to the intended application of the provisions. Inland Revenue will also produce guidance on the enacted legislation in its Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Inland Revenue has not identified any concerns with its ability to implement these reforms. The intended application date for most aspects of the regulatory proposal is for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. The major exceptions are: • the proposed rule for “unstructured imported mismatch arrangements”, which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 January 2020; and • the proposed rules applying to New Zealand “reverse hybrids”, which we recommend be delayed until income years starting on or after 1 April 2019. Another exception we recommend is a grandparenting rule that exempts from application of the rules (until the next call date) hybrid financial instruments issued by banks as regulatory capital (in Australian or New Zealand) to third party investors before the discussion document release date of September 2016. Some submitters on the discussion document argued that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these reforms to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We consider an application date of 1 July 2018 (for most of the measures) to be sufficiently prospective when compared with the date of the discussion document release, which is when taxpayers should be regarded to be have been notified of the Government’s intention in this area, and the scheduled date of introduction of the relevant tax bill. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? We do not consider there to be many implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Audit staff will need to familiarise themselves with the proposed rules and how they operate in practice. As with any legislative proposal, there is the risk of technical drafting errors and unintended consequences. If and when these arise, they will be dealt with by remedial amendment. In practice, these reforms will mostly involve changes for taxpayers rather than Inland Revenue. There is a risk that some taxpayers may not be able to restructure their hybrid mismatch arrangements or understand the rules in time to comply with their new obligations. To manage this risk, we are minimising compliance costs where possible under our tailored adoption of the OECD recommendations. For example, and as mentioned above, we have delayed the application date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule contained in the OECD recommendations to acknowledge that it would be significantly more difficult and costly to comply with than the other rules if it applied at the outset. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 15 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 61 of 76 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of tax changes would take place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. Existing investigations functions for monitoring the behaviour of taxpayers will continue to be used for the proposed rules of this regulatory proposal. However, it may be difficult to assess the true impact of this regulatory proposal. This is because many taxpayers using hybrid mismatch arrangements may rearrange their affairs to fall outside the scope of the proposed rules. It will be difficult to measure the full extent of this behavioural effect. Inland Revenue are currently considering the appropriate level of information that should be collected to support the proposed rules for this regulatory proposal and for other BEPS proposals. This may be in the form of a disclosure statement made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or it may form part of existing information gathering tools. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. For example, a post- implementation workshop with stakeholders that participated in policy consultation sessions may be appropriate for these rules. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. If it became apparent that an aspect of the proposed rules is unworkable, or if the rules have created unintended consequences whether tax-related or otherwise, this would justify a review of all or part of the legislation. Regulatory Impact Assessment: BEPS - Hybrid mismatch arrangements | 16 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 62 of 76 Impact Summary: Hybrids/NRWT issue Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Summary, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis This analysis has been limited by the following factors: • The scale of the problem (in terms of its fiscal costs) has not been accurately identified because it will depend on the behavioural response of taxpayers, which may in turn be informed by work currently being undertaken by Inland Revenue. • No consultation with external stakeholders (including those who would be affected by the proposed action). Responsible Manager (signature and date): Paul Kilford Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 22 November 2017 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 1 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 63 of 76 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The problem identified arises only in a very specific set of fact circumstances: • There is a New Zealand branch or “permanent establishment” (PE) of a non-resident company; • That PE borrows money from another non-resident in the same overseas jurisdiction as the PE’s corporate residence; • The borrowing takes place under a “hybrid” instrument which means it is treated as one form of financing (debt) by New Zealand, but another form of financing (equity) by the other country. An example is set out in the diagram below. Pa r en t Subsidiary PE Optional con vert ib le note Australia New Zealand (dividends) (interest) payment The view until now of Inland Revenue and many taxpayers has been that New Zealand can withhold non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on the payments. However, some taxpayers have disputed this view and as a consequence Inland Revenue is currently reconsidering whether it is legally correct. Inland Revenue has sought Crown Law’s advice, and has indicated that it may well decide the law does not permit NRWT to be withheld. This interpretation is based on a view that the payments are dividends for the purposes of our double tax agreements (DTA). Because double tax agreements over-ride domestic law, this view would, if adopted, mean that the taxpayer would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for the payments (because New Zealand treats the payments as interest), but the payments would not be subject to NRWT (because the other country and the DTA treat them as dividends). This is contrary to the intent of the provisions, as deductible outbound interest should always have Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 2 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 64 of 76 NRWT (or its alternative, approved issuer levy (AIL)) withheld unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise. The hybrid mismatch measures already proposed and approved by Cabinet (and covered by the regulatory impact analysis: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps- 20-ria -hybrids-july-2017.pdf) would ensure that payments made under such hybrids could not be both deductible in New Zealand and non-assessable overseas. In some circumstances the measures would still allow a deduction in New Zealand for the payments. However the measures do not cover whether NRWT must be withheld from such payments. Consequently, the currently proposed hybrid measures would still permit payments under a hybrid financial instrument to be deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT. This contrasts with the tax treatment of dividends, which are not deductible. It also contrasts with the tax treatment of ordinary interest, which is deductible but subject to NRWT (or AIL). As a result of this, the currently proposed hybrid mismatch measures would remove the incentive to use these types of hybrids in most, but not all cases. The hybrids could still be attractive if the non- resident was not concerned about the assessability of the payments in its home jurisdiction. For example, if the non-resident had tax losses, was tax exempt, or simply preferred to pay tax in its home jurisdiction (as most Australian companies do due to their imputation system). If no action is taken, Inland Revenue’s changed interpretation could therefore expose the New Zealand tax base to significant risk. It is difficult to estimate the fiscal risk, as it depends in part on taxpayers’ behaviour, and in part on whether section BG 1 would apply to counteract the arrangements (section BG 1 may apply to some arrangements but not others). The risk is in two parts: a risk that $60 million of previously paid NRWT or AIL might be refunded in the near term, and an ongoing risk that $15 million per annum of NRWT or AIL might no longer be payable. Both risks could materialise as a fiscal cost against existing baselines. Addressing the problem will increase baselines by $1 million per annum on a go forward basis, relative to the status quo. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The only taxpayers affected are those that enter into the structure illustrated in the response to question 2.1 above. However, as far as Inland Revenue is aware, many of the taxpayers that use these structures already pay NRWT or AIL in accordance with the policy intent. As a result, for most affected taxpayers, any change in the law to align with the policy intent would only reaffirm Inland Revenue’s pre-existing legal interpretation – and so would not involve the imposition of additional tax or compliance costs compared with their current position. However, the proposed approach would stop some of these taxpayers from claiming a tax refund for the NRWT or AIL they paid in previous years if Inland Revenue’s interpretation changes. It would also stop some of them from ceasing to pay AIL or NRWT in future years. A small number of taxpayers have disputed Inland Revenue’s current legal view and not paid NRWT or AIL. These taxpayers would be affected by the proposed change, as they would now be required to pay NRWT or AIL. However, this is the outcome we want to achieve with the proposed change, as the policy intent is for all taxpayers to be subject to NRWT or AIL Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 3 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 65 of 76 on cross border deductible interest payments (unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise). 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Limitations in respect of stakeholder engagement are set out in section 5, below. The scope of this problem is limited by the extremely narrow fact-pattern identified. The proposed regulatory action has two major interdependencies: BEPS and hybrids The current problem with the NRWT rules only arises for hybrid mismatch arrangements. Hybrid mismatch arrangements are, broadly speaking, cross-border arrangements that create a tax advantage by exploiting differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more countries. The result of hybrid mismatch arrangements is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates. In July 2017 the Government announced that it would comprehensively adopt the OECD’s hybrid mismatch recommendations, with suitable modifications for the New Zealand context. In addition to the regulatory impact analysis referred to in response to question 2.1, the relevant Cabinet papers can be found at: • http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps-13-cabinet-paper- overview-july-2017.pdf (which covers the BEPS package more broadly); and • http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-beps-19-cabinet-paper- hybrids-july-2017.pdf (which is specific to the hybrids proposals). The hybrids work is a relevant interdependency because it establishes that Cabinet wished to “... send the clear message that using hybrid mismatch arrangements should not produce a tax advantage ...” (see paragraph 7 of the hybrids-specific Cabinet paper linked above). Therefore, we consider that addressing the problem identified in this Impact Summary is consistent with bringing into effect the outcome clearly desired by Cabinet for hybrid mismatches. As explained in 2.1 above, however, the existing hybrids measures still allow for cross border financial instruments to carry payments which are deductible in New Zealand, but not subject to NRWT. Accordingly, the proposed measure would supplement the existing hybrids measures by cancelling a further hybrid mismatch tax advantage. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 4 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 66 of 76 NRWT amendments New Zealand has recently reviewed and updated its rules related to NRWT and its alternative, AIL. These reforms were enacted as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. The relevant Regulatory Impact Statement can be found at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016-ris -archcrm-bill/nrwt- related-party-and-branch-lending-nrwt-changes As set out in paragraph 26 of that document, the objective of the reforms was to “... ensure the return received by a non- resident lender from an associated borrower (or a party that is economically equivalent to an associated borrower) will be subject to NRWT and, at a time, that is not significantly later than when income tax deductions for the funding costs are available to the borrower.” In the structure that is the subject of this Impact Summary, the potential outcome is that a taxpayer will (absent the proposed measure) be entitled to a deduction but have no corresponding NRWT liability. This is contrary to the stated policy objective. Accordingly, the proposed measure supplements the previous NRWT amendments by ensuring that NRWT cannot be avoided for deductible interest payments on hybrid instruments. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 5 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 67 of 76 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? We have considered four options, three of which involve addressing the identified problem by ensuring that NRWT applies in all instances where a deduction is allowed in New Zealand for an interest expense and for this outcome to occur notwithstanding the effect of our double tax agreements (the “policy solution”). However, they differ in their proposed application date. The four options are: • Option 1: The status quo, which would allow Inland Revenue to finalise its legal view and allow that view to prevail on all existing and future arrangements. This would likely result in the problem identified in 2.1 continuing. • Option 2: Provide that NRWT or AIL applies to any deductible interest payment with a New Zealand source (the policy solution). The policy solution would have prospective effect. • Option 3: Enact the policy solution retrospectively to the earliest date from which taxpayers can claim refunds for AIL or NRWT overpayments. • Option 4: Enact the policy solution retrospectively to the earliest date from which taxpayers can claim refunds for AIL or NRWT overpayments, but also include a “savings” provision for taxpayers that have already adopted the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable prior to the Bill containing the policy solution being introduced. Currently the potential non-applicability of NRWT or AIL arises under New Zealand’s DTAs. DTAs are incorporated into New Zealand law under the Income Tax Act 2007, which states that DTAs have effect notwithstanding any other provision of that Act (subject to some exceptions). Accordingly, the policy solution would need to expressly override our DTAs in the amending legislation. We note that Australia already has a rule that legislates the policy solution, including an express DTA override. Criteria The four options are assessed in this Impact Summary against the following criteria: • Economic efficiency - t he tax system should, to the extent possible, apply neutrally and consistently to economically equivalent transactions. This means the tax system should not provide a tax preferred treatment for one transaction over another similar transac tion or provide an advantage to one business over another. This helps ensure that the most efficient forms of investment which provide the best returns to New Zealand as a whole are undertaken. At the same time there is a concern that taxes should not unduly raise the cost of capital and discourage inbound investment. • Fairness - the options should ensure that the law is seen as treating people fairly and consistently and should not allow people to avoid their tax obligations (including any foreign tax obligations). • Integrity of the tax system – the options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely fashion while not providing opportunities for tax avoidance or arbitrary tax reductions Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 6 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 68 of 76 Analysis In the following options analysis, an option having a fiscal risk is seen as a negative. However, this will not automatically disqualify the option . There are times when changing the law will have a fiscal cost or risk for the Government, but this is nevertheless desirable because of the gains in one or more of the other assessment criteria. Option 1 – not preferred We consider that the policy solution is preferable to the status quo. The status quo will likely mean that a PE would be entitled to an interest deduction in New Zealand for payments on certain hybrid instruments (as the payments are characterised as “interest” under New Zealand domestic law), but the payments would not be subject to NRWT (as the payments are characterised as “dividends” under the DTA). This is contrary to the intent of the relevant DTA provisions, as outbound interest, which is deductible in determining the profits of a PE, should always have NRWT withheld unless there is a specific exemption providing otherwise (e.g. the sovereign wealth fund exemptions provided in some of our DTAs). It also exposes the New Zealand tax base to a fiscal risk, as it allows a deduction from New Zealand tax for a payment without a corresponding tax liability for the recipient. Accordingly, the status quo negatively affects the integrity of the tax system. The general anti avoidance rule in section BG 1 might still apply to some of the arrangements using these kinds of hybrid instruments, in which case NRWT or AIL would still need to be paid. However, there is a high risk that section BG 1 would not apply to other arrangements we are aware of. In addition, the status quo option negatively affects both fairness and economic efficiency. This is because it would give a competitive advantage to a multinational firm that uses the relevant funding structure over a domestic firm or another, more compliant, multinational. This is contrary to the objectives of the BEPS work more generally and the hybrids project in particular. Under the status quo option , Inland Revenue’s changed interpretation could expose the New Zealand tax base to significant risk. It is difficult to estimate the fiscal risk, as it depends in part on taxpayers’ behaviour, and in part on whether section BG 1 would apply to counteract the arrangements (section BG 1 may apply to some arrangements but not others). The risk is in two parts: a risk that $60 million of previously paid NRWT or AIL might be refunded in the near term, and an ongoing risk that $15 million per annum of NRWT or AIL might no longer be payable. Both risks could materialise as a fiscal cost against existing baselines. Addressing the problem will increase baselines by $1 million per annum on a go forward basis, relative to the status quo. Option 2 – not preferred This option would address the policy issue identified in 2.1. It would also have advantages in terms of fairness, economic efficiency and the integrity of the tax system compared with the status quo option (by eliminating the status quo’s disadvantages in these regards). However, these advantages would only arise for future income years. Taxpayers who used the relevant hybrid structure in previous income years may be entitled to request a refund of the Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 7 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 69 of 76 NRWT or AIL they previously paid. We consider that it would be unfair to allow taxpayers to claim refunds of their previously paid AIL or NRWT in these circumstances. It would also reduce the integrity of the tax system. It is clear that NRWT / AIL was intended to be payable on cross border interest payments. This was also Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the law until now, which was followed by many taxpayers. The ability of some taxpayers to avoid NRWT AIL through the use of a hybrid instrument is a clear loophole in the current rules, and taxpayers aware of the issue would have perceived it as such. Accordingly, we consider there should be no legitimate expectation for taxpayers to obtain a refund for any AIL or NRWT previously paid in respect of these hybrid instruments. We estimate that there is a potential one-off fiscal risk of $60 million under this option. This is because taxpayers that are known to use this structure may be able to obtain refunds of their previously paid AIL/NRWT under this option if Inland Revenue changes its current legal interpretation (and the previously paid NRWT or AIL has been included in the fiscal baseline),. This option would also give rise to a potential $1 m illion per annum fiscal benefit compared with the current baseline. This is because taxpayers in active disputes would be required to pay $1 m illion of NRWT in future tax years if the policy solution was implemented (and this $1 million has not been included in current fiscal baselines). Option 3 – not preferred Option 3 would address the policy issue in 2.1. As a retrospective measure, it would also stop taxpayers from claiming a refund for any previously paid NRWT or AIL. Accordingly, it is preferable to option 2 as it has advantages in terms of fairness, economic efficiency and integrity of the tax system, over the status quo option in respect of both future and past income years. This option also has the lowest potential fiscal risk of all the options (equal with option 4). This option also has the largest potential fiscal benefit. This is because, in addition to the fiscal benefit of option 2 in respect of future income years, this option would also require the taxpayers that have disputed Inland Revenue’s current legal interpretation to pay NRWT in respect of past tax years in the event that Inland Revenue’s current legal interpretation changes. This NRWT has not been included in the current fiscal baselines. Accordingly, this gives rise to an additional potential one-off fiscal benefit of approximately $5 m illion. However, this option would also retrospectively change the law for those taxpayers who have already taken the position that NRWT or AIL was not payable and entered into disputes with Inland Revenue. This would be fair, as different taxpayers in the same position would be treated the same. In addition, excluding taxpayers who have taken an aggressive tax position from the retrospective application of the rules seems to reward them for their aggressive behaviour. However, there is a wider issue of legal certainty involved. If Parliament retrospectively changes a law taxpayers have relied on, then this means taxpayers can never fully rely on the law (as stated at the time) in any dispute with the Government. This would erode the integrity of the tax system from a wider perspective. It would also erode perceptions of fairness, in that the Government might be perceived as misusing its legislative power to win a Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 8 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 70 of 76 dispute with taxpayers. Option 4 – preferred This option addresses the policy problem set out in 2.1. It also has fairness, economic efficiency and integrity of the tax system advantages over the status quo option in respect of both future and past income years. Although this option is slightly less fair than option 3, it best supports the integrity of the tax system. This is because it prevents taxpayers from claiming refunds for previously paid NRWT or AIL, while preserving the legal position of taxpayers that previously adopted the position that NRWT or AIL was not payable prior to the introduction of the Bill containing the policy solution. This option would also give rise to a potential fiscal benefit of $1 m illion per annum compared with current baseline. This is because taxpayers that are still disputing Inland Revenue’s current position would be required to pay $1 m illion of NRWT in future tax years (and this $1 million has not been included in current fiscal baselines). We note that this option does have a smaller potential fiscal benefit than option 3, as it does not require taxpayers disputing Inland Revenue’s current legal interpretation to pay NRWT in respect of past tax years. We estimate the reduced potential fiscal benefit to be approximately $5 million. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? We consider Option 4 to be the best option. This option addresses the policy problem set out in 2.1. It also has advantages, in terms of fairness, economic efficiency and the integrity of the tax system, over the status quo option in respect of both future and past income years. Although this option is less fair than option 3, it best supports the integrity of the tax system. This is because Option 4 prevents taxpayers from claiming refunds for previously paid NRWT or AIL, while preserving the legal position of taxpayers that previously adopted the position that NRWT or AIL was not payable prior to the introduction of the BEPS Bill. Accordingly it addresses the policy problem without the drawbacks of options 2 and 3. Option 4 also has the lowest equal fiscal risk. However, it lacks O ption 3’s potential one-off $5 million fiscal benefit. Even so, we consider the lack of this fiscal benefit is outweighed by the importance of protecting the integrity of the law from a wider perspective. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 9 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 71 of 76 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties The proposed approach removes the ability of taxpayers to avoid NRWT or AIL for future periods. It does not change the previously adopted position for past periods. We are aware of several taxpayers who have entered into the hybrid structure set out in 2.1. We have calculated the fiscal costs based on these taxpayers. If there are further taxpayers, then the impact will be increased. We do not expect there to be other taxpayers with a significant value of such hybrid structures, but we cannot confirm this. We note that many taxpayers already pay NRWT and AIL under the current rules. Accordingly the proposed approach will not increase their costs compared with their current position. However it will deprive them of a future cost saving if compared with the status quo option if Inland Revenue changes its legal view. A potential $16m per annum cost arising from additional NRWT or AIL for future years compared with doing nothing if Inland Revenue changes its legal view. A potential one off $60m cost arising from the denial the NRWT or AIL refunds which taxpayers may be entitled to for past years if Inland Revenue changes its legal view and no action is taken. Regulators No material administrative costs for Inland Revenue. - Wider government No costs. No costs Other parties Not applicable Not applicable Total Monetised Cost For regulated parties, a potential cost of 16m of NRWT or AIL per annum plus a potential cost of $60m in respect of possible refunds for past years compared with doing nothing. Non-monetised costs None we are aware of. None Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 10 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 72 of 76 Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties The regulated parties will be required to pay NRWT or AIL regardless of whether they enter into hybrid structures. This will be a cost for taxpayers that have entered into such structures. However it will be a benefit for other taxpayers, as it will ensure that taxpayers who have entered into such structures cannot obtain a competitive advantage over domestic firms and more compliant multinationals. Accordingly the proposed approach will improve economic efficiency. No monetary value Regulators With the proposed law change, Inland Revenue will not need to consider whether the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 applies to any of the arrangements (other than taxpayers not subject to the retrospective application of the rule). It can be difficult and resource intensive to consider the application of section BG 1. Accordingly the proposed approach will save Inland Revenue administrative costs, and potentially court costs. However these are impossible to quantify at this stage. Too difficult to quantify Wider government The Government will be able to collect NRWT or AIL from all deductible cross border interest payments, in accordance with the policy intent. This will potentially save the Government up to $60m in one off costs for past years (in respect of refunds for previously paid NRWT or AIL), and 16m per annum for future years. A potential $60m one off benefit. A potential $16m benefit per annum going forward. Other parties Not applicable Not applicable Total Monetised Benefit The total monetised benefit for the Government mirrors the total monetised cost for taxpayers. A $60m one off potential benefit for the Government, plus a potential $16m per annum benefit for the Government going forward. Non-monetised benefits Administrative savings, as the Government will not have to consider the application of section BG 1 to most arrangements. Economic efficiency benefits from an equal application of NRWT to all cross border interest payments. Medium Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 11 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 73 of 76 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The proposed approach involves the third explicit override of New Zealand’s DTAs in recent years. Accordingly, it may arouse concern that New Zealand does not respect its DTAs. However, the proposed approach confirms the interpretive approach previously adopted by NZ, and currently adopted by some of our DTA partners and mirrors a rule already in place in Australia. It also closes a clear loophole if Inland Revenue were to change its legal interpretation. Accordingly, we do not expect disagreement over the policy outcome. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Because this problem poses a base-maintenance risk, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have not consulted with the private sector. This means that the problem identification and options have been generated by officials based on the information available. It is recognised that private sector input is an important part of the generic tax policy process. In saying this, it is not unusual for base-maintenance changes to be made without consultation because there is a risk that publicising the existence of a perceived loophole may incentivise taxpayers to take advantage of its existence in the short term. In addition, the measure only leg islatively confirms the tax treatment Inland Revenue has been applying to date. It also closes what would be a clear loophole if Inland Revenue were to change that tax treatment. Further, there will be an opportunity for the public to submit on the measure during the Select Committee process and feedback will be considered at that point. There may be some private sector concern about the amendment, given that it applies retrospectively and will be the third explicit override of our DTAs in recent years. However, we do not expect disagreement over the policy outcome. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 12 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 74 of 76 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposed solution will be given effect by inclusion in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill 2017, which is scheduled to be introduced into the House in December 2017. Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new arrangements. We do not have any concern about our ability to do so. The new arrangements will have retrospective effect, except for taxpayers that have, prior to introduction of the Bill, taken the position that NRWT or AIL is not payable. We consider that this allows sufficient preparation time for regulated parties, as: • the proposed approach will only affect a small number of taxpayers that have disputed Inland Revenue’s current legal interpretation and not settled the dispute; • the taxpayers that have maintained their position that NRWT or AIL is not payable are aware that Inland Revenue historically does not agree, and so are on notice that their current practice may not be acceptable; • many of those currently take the view that NRWT or AIL is payable, and so they will not need to change their current practice. We will mitigate implementation risks by publicising the proposed approach as part of the Commentary on the Bill. We will also inform the taxpayers who currently take the view that no NRWT or AIL is payable of the proposed law change. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 13 Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill Regulatory Impact Assessments Page 75 of 76 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The new arrangements will be monitored through Inland Revenue’s normal risk review and audit function. This will check whether taxpayers are complying with the proposed approach. If any follow-up legislative action is required it will go through the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The proposed approach simply closes a potential loophole and confirms the Government’s intended tax treatment for cross border interest payments. Accordingly, we consider that no specific review of the arrangements is necessary. Stakeholders will have the opportunity to raise concerns during the Select Committee process. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP.
