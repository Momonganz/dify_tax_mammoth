the record-keeping requirements of businesses by making it easier for taxpayers to store records offshore through applications from their data storage providers, and by allowing taxpayers who submit returns electronically to store them electronically. Issue: The form of the record Submission (Matter raised by officials) The words “in an electronic form” should be removed and replaced with “in a form approved by the Commissioner”. Comment Clause 103 allows for a person to hold for taxpayers, records in an electronic form, at places outside New Zealand. The reference to “in an electronic form” should be removed, as although it is highly likely that most applications by a taxpayer or person (on behalf of a taxpayer) will be for records that are in an electronic form, there may be a rare circumstance when the application to the Commissioner will be for records in another form, such as paper or a non-electronic form. The Commissioner should have the flexibility to approve what type of form a record may be kept outside of New Zealand as part of the conditions imposed for authorisation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 4 Issue: Removal of the application of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The cross-reference to section 25 of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002 (ETA) should be removed so that the Commissioner is able to specify the form (e.g. paper or electronic) that the records must be kept outside of New Zealand. In addition, the Commissioner should be able to specify as a condition the way the records are to be accessible to the Commissioner. Comment Clause 103 allows for a person to hold for taxpayers, records in an electronic form, at places outside New Zealand, in a manner consistent with section 25 of the ETA. Although the reference to section 25 of the ETA is incorrect, and it should be section 26, officials consider that the reference to the ETA should be removed. This will allow the Commissioner to specify the form in which the records must be kept overseas. Furthermore, as the ability for the Commissioner to access the records is a key pre- requisite for such authorisation, clause 103 should be amended to provide for this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The conditions for authorisation should also apply to individual taxpayers Submission (Matter raised by officials) The conditions imposed by the Commissioner in new section 22(9) of the Income Tax Act should apply to all taxpayers seeking to keep records offshore under subsection (8). Comment Clause 103 allows the Commissioner to impose reasonable conditions on a person (on behalf of a taxpayer) who applies for the authorisation to keep records outside of New Zealand. However, these conditions do not apply to individual taxpayers who apply for this authorisation under new section 22(8). Therefore to ensure consistency, it is proposed that the conditions apply to all those who apply under subsection (8). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 5 Issue: Protecting the privacy of a taxpayer’s records held outside of New Zealand Submission (Matter raised by the Committee) At the briefing on the bill on 8 February 2012, some members of the Committee expressed concerns about the keeping of tax records offshore and the need for privacy. Comment The changes proposed by clause 103 refer to a taxpayer satisfying their record- keeping obligations and the Commissioner’s discretions, to ensure on-going access to taxpayer records by the Commissioner when required. Ultimately it is the taxpayer’s responsibility to ensure the privacy of their business records. The security risks associated with storing records offshore is a commercial matter for the taxpayer to consider with their offshore storage provider. The privacy of taxpayer information and data held by Inland Revenue is not within the scope of clause 103 and is covered by other provisions such as section 81 of the Tax Administration Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The Commissioner should be restricted from requesting information that is over seven years old Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Commissioner should be restricted, under statute, to the seven-year record- retention period when requesting information from taxpayers in all circumstances. Comment A taxpayer is required to retain records for seven years and, in certain circumstances, for an additional three years if given notice by the Commissioner. However, the Commissioner is not restricted to requesting records or information that is over the seven or 10-year periods if in fact the information exists. Examples of when such a request would be made include when certainty or the reconstruction of income is required or when a taxpayer may be fraudulent, or wilfully misleading the Commissioner. Many older documents may also remain relevant to the tax affairs of taxpayers in more recent periods. Recommendation 6 That the submission be declined. 7 PROFIT DISTRIBUTION PLANS Issue: Policy considerations Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Contact Energy, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislative reforms to profit distribution plans (PDPs) should not proceed for the following reasons:  The underlying policy rationale behind the proposed reform is based on an incorrect view of the legal form and substance of PDPs vis-à-vis dividend reinvestment plans. (Corporate Taxpayers Group)  Economically like investments should be treated the same to ensure the integrity of the tax system. However the proposed changes should not proceed as the key commercial driver for PDPs is to retain capital within the company, and this justifies a different tax treatment. (KPMG)  We support aligning the tax treatment of economically equivalent things, however PDPs are sufficiently different from other (taxable) distribution policies and this warrants a different tax outcome. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants)  Officials’ imputation credit streaming concerns should be addressed through targeted reform rather than a wholesale change to the tax treatment of PDPs (Corporate Taxpayers Group). A better option would have been to debit the company imputation credit account with an amount sufficient to capture the tax liability (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants).  The concern that shareholders may not be taxed at their correct personal tax rate is not sufficient to justify the wholesale tax reform as proposed. (Corporate Taxpayers Group)  The changes are inconsistent with the notion of a dividend: a dividend is a distribution of profit, whereas shares issued under a PDP are a share split that does not alter each shareholder’s underlying interest in the company. (Contact Energy, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants)  The reforms will have the effect of disestablishing a highly effective mechanism for corporates to retain capital and an effective savings mechanism for shareholders. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants)  The changes are contrary to tax simplification and add additional compliance costs on taxpayers. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants)  Eliminating the ability of companies to undertake PDPs is inconsistent with the Government’s focus on helping businesses through the current financial crisis. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 8  The consultation process undertaken by officials was limited and the submission points were rejected for minor reasons. The only comments made to support officials’ position that PDPs should have the same tax treatment as “substitutes” came from the Capital Market Development Taskforce, which did not have the benefit of reviewing private sector submissions. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The proposed changes to the tax treatment of PDPs are consistent with, and an extension of, existing policy around imputation credit streaming and the taxation of bonus issues. Imputation credit streaming New Zealand-resident companies earn tax credits from the payment of their company tax and from the imputation credits attached to dividends they receive from other New Zealand-resident companies. These credits can be attached by the company to dividends paid to its shareholders. This prevents double taxation so that income earned by the company is not taxed in the hands of both the company and its shareholders. It also means that company income is eventually taxed at the personal tax rates of its shareholders if that income has been distributed to the shareholders with full imputation credits attached. The value of imputation credits is not the same for all shareholders. For some shareholders, imputation credits have little or no value. New Zealand-resident shareholders that pay tax can use the credits to reduce their New Zealand tax payable. However, tax-exempt New Zealand shareholders and foreign shareholders who have no New Zealand income tax against which to apply imputation credits do not benefit from imputation credits. This creates an incentive to direct the credits to those shareholders best able to use them – a practice commonly called imputation credit “streaming”. The current tax legislation contains rules that prevent streaming. One such rule requires that imputation credits must be paid out pro-rata to shareholders in relation to their shareholding proportion in the company. Taxation of bonus issues A bonus issue is an issue of shares by the company when nothing is provided in return. A bonus issue can either be taxable or non-taxable. The policy rationale behind treating some bonus issues as taxable and some as non-taxable is to maintain the integrity of the imputation system and ensure that taxpayers ultimately pay tax on company income at their marginal tax rate. Non-taxable bonus issues One example of a non-taxable bonus issue occurs when a company issues new shares to all shareholders on a pro-rata basis, so that all shareholders retain their proportionate shareholding in the company. This is analogous to a share split, where there has been no change in substance, only a proportionate change in the number of shares held by each shareholder. 9 Taxable bonus issues A special provision allows a company to elect to treat a bonus issue that would otherwise be non-taxable as a taxable dividend. The policy rationale behind allowing companies to elect for a bonus issue to be taxable is to allow the company to pass out imputation credits to its shareholders without the need to pay a cash dividend. This policy is consistent with the principle of integration of the tax system and may be advantageous to the company, for example, just before a reorganisation or merger that would result in a breach of continuity and a loss of imputation credits. Bonus issues in lieu A bonus issue in lieu occurs when a company gives its shareholders a choice of whether to receive a bonus issue or money, or money’s worth, and the shareholder elects to receive the bonus issue. Even though a bonus issue in lieu can have the form of a non-taxable bonus issue, the current rules treat it as taxable. This is because it is part of an arrangement that could undermine the policy intention of the imputation system. The bonus issue in lieu arrangement which gives shareholders a choice, rather than making a pro-rata distribution of shares, undermines the policy intention of the imputation system in two ways. First, it can provide a tax rate advantage to shareholders with higher marginal tax rates; secondly, it can allow streaming of imputation credits. If a bonus issue in lieu were not taxable, taxpayers on lower tax rates could opt for a cash payment, which would be treated as a taxable dividend. Since the personal tax on the dividend would be less than the imputation credits attached, the taxpayer could use the excess imputation credits to offset tax on other income, as intended under the imputation system. On the other hand, higher tax rate shareholders may choose to receive bonus shares, which could be sold on-market for cash with no tax payable (provided the shares are held on capital account). By treating a bonus issue in lieu as taxable, this ensures that shareholders must pay the difference between the tax payable at their personal tax rate and the underlying company tax. While there are other arrangements in the tax system when taxpayers are not necessarily taxed at their correct personal tax rates, these have resulted from specific policy decisions being made. No such decision has been made for PDPs. Further, the potential for imputation credit streaming arises because, as noted earlier, for some shareholders, imputation credits have little or no value. In the absence of the rules that tax bonus issues in lieu, those shareholders that are unable to utilise imputation credits (such as foreign shareholders) could elect to receive the bonus shares rather than the monetary amount. If the bonus shares are non-taxable, imputation credits will not be attached, and this preserves the credits for shareholders who can best use them. This defeats the current policy settings that are in place for the imputation system. The PDP arrangement is substantially similar to a bonus issue in lieu as it effectively provides shareholders with a choice of receiving a bonus issue of shares, or a cash amount. Accordingly, a PDP is not analogous to an ordinary (non-taxable) share split. Even though the legal form of a PDP means that all shareholders initially receive a bonus issue, the substance of the arrangement is that the shareholders are effectively given a choice of whether to receive bonus shares or a cash amount. 10 While PDPs have non-tax commercial purposes, such as the retention of cash in the company, officials consider that the proposed extension of the bonus issues in lieu treatment to PDPs does not frustrate these uses. It merely removes an unintended tax subsidy from the arrangement. Alternatives considered by officials Officials have considered alternative solutions to address the concerns with PDPs. In general, these alternative solutions lead to equity and fiscal concerns. One alternative considered was to require companies to reduce their imputation credit account balance by the maximum imputation ratio (ordinarily 28%) of the value of the bonus shares that are retained by recipient shareholders. This option sufficiently addresses the issue related to imputation credit streaming. However, officials have two main concerns with this option. First, there are equity concerns. Under this option, shareholders who retained bonus shares under a PDP would effectively be taxed at a final tax rate of 28%. Individual shareholders on lower tax rates (those on 10.5% and 17.5%) would effectively be taxed at the higher rate of 28% and, unlike the proposed new tax treatment, these shareholders will be unable to use excess imputation credits under this alternative option. It also means that higher-rate individual shareholders (those on 30% and 33%) are effectively taxed at a lower rate of 28%. In addition, the bonus issue income is not counted for social assistance purposes (such as Working for Families entitlements) which may mean that taxpayers receive benefits that they would not receive if the payment was taxable. The second concern is that this option is fiscally negative, with an estimated fiscal cost of $7 million per annum, should there be a tenfold increase in the use of PDPs. This predicted revenue loss is largely due to the expected increased take-up of PDPs if they are given what is effectively a concessionary tax treatment. This is a cost that would be borne by the Government. Officials note that the change to the tax treatment of PDPs is not an ad hoc change to the tax treatment of capital. It is consistent with the policy behind the tax treatment of bonus issues in lieu, and as such, is simply an extension of the current policy on imputation credit streaming. Compliance costs for taxpayers Officials do not consider the changes to PDPs to be contrary to tax simplification. In general, the changes around tax simplification amend the way in which taxpayers file tax returns rather than the income that is included in tax returns. The proposed change to treat bonus shares issued under PDPs as taxable dividends increases compliance costs for taxpayers, however these costs are no higher than if a cash dividend was paid. This is because publicly listed companies generally already have mechanisms in place for withholding resident withholding tax (RWT) or non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends. If RWT is correctly deducted, a resident shareholder will typically not be required to file a tax return, simply because they receive a dividend under a PDP (assuming their total dividend income for the year is $200 or less or they are on the top marginal tax rate of 33%). A resident shareholder will only have to put the dividend in their tax return if they are already 11 filing a tax return for another reason. For these shareholders, due to the rate of RWT on dividends, it is unlikely that the shareholders would face a tax liability as a result of the dividend. Consultation process Consultation was undertaken by officials throughout the policy development process. An officials’ issues paper was released for public consultation in 2009. After the first round of consultation, the Capital Market Development Taskforce reported. The Taskforce was industry-led and comprised a number of individuals from both the public and private sectors. Following the Taskforce’s report, officials consulted on a solution that provided for a more consistent tax treatment across similar transactions. In addition to these two formal consultation rounds, the Minister of Revenue has on a number of occasions announced the progression of work on PDPs, and officials have been involved in a number of discussions with interested parties. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Support for proposed profit distribution plan changes Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The Law Society generally accepts the Government’s rationale for making the tax treatment of PDPs the same as the tax treatment of bonus issues. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Rules for non-cash dividends Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules for non-cash dividends should be reviewed. The existing and proposed laws relating to RWT on non-cash dividends is confusing. There needs to be a review of the application of RWT to non-cash dividends to ensure the rules operate in a clear and user-friendly manner. 12 Comment The clarity of the rules for non-cash dividends has been raised with officials in the past. While officials accept that there is benefit in reviewing the rules, the timing of any such review will depend on the Government’s priorities for the Tax Policy Work Programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Definition of “profit distribution plan” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The definition of a “profit distribution plan” in clause 88(14) requires all shareholders to be notified of the issue of shares. This is an unnecessary requirement. It is not clear that notification of shareholders other than those receiving the shares should be required, nor why failure to notify one or more of those shareholders who are receiving the shares should take the transaction outside the PDP definition. The key element is that the company makes a bonus issue of shares and gives the shareholders an option to have some or all of the shares repurchased or redeemed. Comment As far as officials are aware, in practice PDPs have been offered to all shareholders and all shareholders are notified of the offer. However, officials agree that from a policy perspective, the new rules should apply regardless of whether all shareholders are notified or not. If all shareholders were required to be notified, this would mean companies could easily get around the new rules by simply notifying some, but not all, shareholders. While officials agree with the submission in principle, officials recommend that a different drafting solution to that put forward by the submitter be adopted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 13 Issue: Application date of proposed changes Submissions (Contact Energy, KPMG) If the legislative changes do proceed, Contact Energy seeks a change in the timing of the effective date of the legislative changes from 1 July 2012 to 1 October 2012. This is to allow a reasonable transitional period as the current application date of 1 July 2012 has significant commercial ramifications for Contact Energy. If the legislative changes do proceed, KPMG submits that the application date should be deferred to 1 April 2013. This allows time for replacement capital raising measures to be considered and employed by affected parties, and aligns with the imputation year. Comment There are arguments both for deferring and retaining the 1 July 2012 application date. The application date of 1 July 2012 currently in the bill was originally chosen because it is expected to be soon after enactment of the bill. The change to the tax treatment of PDPs has been well signalled and is an issue that has been discussed with interested parties on a number of occasions since 2009. In officials’ discussions with taxpayers during consultation there have been concerns raised around the need to provide certainty on the tax treatment of PDPs, particularly given the original product ruling issued by Inland Revenue (which provided tax certainty) has expired. Officials understand this uncertainty has led to a number of companies not offering PDPs. The uncertain tax treatment is also a concern for shareholders in companies that offer PDPs. From a shareholder’s perspective, it is important to have certainty around the dividend-paying policies of the company and the resulting tax consequences for them in respect of the dividends they receive. One argument against retaining the 1 July application date is that it may be complex from the shareholder’s perspective because it may mean that they receive two dividends from Contact Energy that have different tax treatments (interim in March and final in September). However, officials consider that from a tax perspective, the complexity is lessened for taxpayers because it means the two dividends that were received in the standard tax year (1April 2012 – 31 March 2013) will be subject to the same tax treatment. Deferring the application date will have a fiscal cost. The PDP change is estimated to result in a fiscal gain for the 2012–13 year onwards of $0.76 million per year. This costing was based on an application date of 1 July 2012. If the application date was deferred, as suggested by the submitters, this would reduce the $0.76 million fiscal gain that was originally reported for the 2012–13 year. The amount of the reduction would depend on how long the application date is deferred. The deferral requested by Contact Energy to 1 October 2012, for example, would reduce the fiscal gain for the 14 2012–13 year by half. The fiscal gain that was reported for years from 2013–14 onwards would be unaffected. On the other hand, the deferral sought by Contact Energy is relatively small. Officials have had further discussions with Contact Energy to clarify the implications it would face if the application date is not deferred as requested. Contact Energy generally carries out two dividend payments per year (March and September). A 1 July application date would affect Contact Energy’s September 2012 dividend payment given that the September dividend is not determined until the results from the financial year ending 30 June 2012 are available. Contact Energy has communicated that it needs approximately four months from enactment of the bill to carry out a number of steps, including confirming the implications of any decision for its non- resident shareholders with foreign jurisdictions, making decisions regarding the form that future dividend payments will take, and communicating the changes to shareholders. These steps cannot be carried out until the date of enactment because of the uncertainty around whether and when the bill will be enacted. While Contact Energy would be able to pay its September 2012 dividend if the 1 July application date was retained, this would involve increased shareholder communications overall because interim decisions would potentially need to be taken rather than decisions about the appropriate distribution mechanism for the medium term. On balance, officials consider that the arguments for a small deferral to the application date favour those over retaining the application date. Therefore, officials recommend that Contact Energy’s submission that the application date be deferred to 1 October 2012 be accepted. Officials recommend that KPMG’s submission that the application date be deferred to 1 April 2013 be declined on the basis that Contact Energy is the only company officials are aware of that is currently using PDPs. This is the only affected party that has put forward a submission on the application date of the PDP changes. Furthermore, while a 1 April 2013 date would align with the imputation year, officials consider that a further six-month deferral may result in increased uncertainty and negative fiscal effects. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, and that the application date of 1 October 2012 be accepted, and the application date of 1 April 2013 be declined. 15 Issue: Shares repurchased under a profit distribution plan Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section CD 23B of the Income Tax Act 2007 stipulates that the amount paid by a company when a shareholder elects to have a share issued under a PDP repurchased by the company is not a dividend. If the changes do proceed, while NZICA supports the proposals in section CD 23B, it submits that the relationship between proposed section CD 23B and CD 22 should be clarified. It also seeks clarity on whether section CD 23B applies to on-market repurchases. Comment New section CD 23B is intended to prevent cash amounts under a PDP from being taxed twice. If a shareholder elects for their bonus shares to be repurchased under a PDP, section CD 23B ensures that the cash proceeds are not taxable under the ordinary dividend rules. That is, it is only the bonus issue that is the taxable event. Section CD 22 generally applies when a company pays an amount to shareholders, other than on liquidation, because of the off-market cancellation of shares in the company. This section allows the available subscribed capital of the company (generally equal to the amount paid to the company to subscribe for its shares) to be returned to shareholders tax-free if certain criteria are met. Section CD 22 is not intended to apply to section CD 23B and officials consider that legislative clarification of this point is not necessary. Section CD 23B applies only to share repurchases under a PDP. Section CD 7B states that shares issued under PDPs are dividends. That section also clearly states that section CD 22 does not apply in relation to a share issued under a PDP and repurchased by the company under that plan. Section CD 23B is not intended to apply to on-market repurchases. Officials consider that legislative clarification is not needed, because as noted in the section heading, section CD 23B is only intended to apply to shares that are repurchased under PDPs and not to share repurchases generally. While officials do not consider that legislative clarification of these issues is required, an explanation of the provisions will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin article following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 Issue: Definition of “bonus issue” Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA seeks clarification on why it is necessary to amend the definition of “bonus issue” given that necessary amendments are already being made to the relevant statutory provisions to ensure PDPs are taxed and RWT tax is deducted. It submits that amending the definition of “bonus issue” risks confusing matters. Comment The definition of “bonus issue” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to clarify that a bonus issue includes the issue of shares under a PDP. Along with the amendment to section CD 8, this amendment is necessary as it clarifies that the issue of shares under a PDP constitutes a taxable bonus issue. This ensures the tax treatment fully aligns with bonus issues in lieu, as intended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Minor technical drafting issues Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The Law Society has identified two technical issues. First, clause 10 proposes to amend the definition of “returns” in section CD 43(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that it includes a new subparagraph (ii) referring specifically to repurchases of shares pursuant to a PDP. This is appropriate in concept, but the drafting is not appropriate. Paragraph (c) already refers to a cancellation of a share. A cancellation of a share is defined to include its acquisition by the issuing company, i.e. a repurchase. Accordingly, all that is required by way of amendment to paragraph (c) is to include a reference to new section CD 23B. The Law Society recommends clause 10 be amended, so that it simply inserts the words “, section CD 23B” after the words “section CD 22”. Secondly, there is a typographical error in the currently proposed subparagraph (i) – after “section CD 24”, “of” should be “or”. 17 Comment As noted by the submitter, the current definition of “cancellation” of a share includes the acquisition by the company. As such, the current drafting is not necessary and officials recommend that the amendment put forward by the submitter be accepted. Officials recommend that the second issue also be accepted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 18 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Clauses 17 and 163 Issue: Ensuring legislative clarity Submissions (New Zealand Computer Society Inc., Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) While supportive of the bill as written, the submitters believe that clause 17 could be improved to provide certainty to taxpayers when a tax deduction is allowed. They suggest various minor amendments to new section DB 40B(1) of the draft legislation. Comment The provisions are intended to provide for expenditure on software that needs further development to become depreciable property. The important distinction is between software that can be depreciated if it is available for use and software that is not able to be used without further development. The provisions make it clear that a taxpayer may claim a deduction for expenditure on software development when the project is abandoned. The term “fit to be used” is referring to the state of development. While “availability” is not an equivalent term, the drafters will take into account the submitters’ suggestions in finalising the drafting of the provision. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: The proposed rule should also apply to software acquired from another taxpayer Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposal should be extended to include situations when a taxpayer acquires partially completed software from another taxpayer. Currently, the proposal is limited to situations when the taxpayer has developed the software or has commissioned the development of the software. Whether a person is allowed a deduction for unsuccessful development should not be determined by whether a person develops the software themselves or whether they acquire it from another person. 19 Comment The original policy applied to software developed in-house for use in a business or when a taxpayer commissioned software development from an external party. Conceptually, a deduction could also be allowed when a person acquires an incomplete software development from another taxpayer if the acquirer should subsequently decide to abandon the project. However, the submitter’s proposal to extend the policy would have a revenue cost to the Crown. Additionally, if the policy were to be extended, officials would also want to consider the current tax treatment of proceeds from the disposal of abandoned software development projects in the hands of the vendor. Accordingly, while this matter should not be progressed as part of the bill, it could be considered for inclusion in a future Tax Policy Work Programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Division of responsibilities within Inland Revenue Submission (KPMG) It is important that Inland Revenue, when reviewing old policy statements, should not only examine what the law is, but also what the law should be. If there is a divergence, there should be a process for resolution that gives taxpayers greater certainty. Comment Inland Revenue tries to ensure that its view of tax law is clear and well understood, and continues to seek improvement in the way that matters are co-ordinated across Inland Revenue to give greater certainty to taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 20 Issue: Correction of application date Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section DB 31B of the Income Tax Act should apply from the 2006–07 income year rather than 2007–08. Comment Officials recommend that the application date be amended to give effect to the policy of ensuring the Commissioner is time-barred from amending an assessment when a taxpayer has previously relied upon the Commissioner’s 1993 policy statement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 21 KIWISAVER Issue: KiwiSaver employer and employee contribution rates Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA supports the increase of the default and minimum employee contribution rates to KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds from 2% to 3%, and the increase in the compulsory employer contribution rate from 2% to 3%. However, it suggests that the application date should be postponed for 12 months, until 1 April 2014, in light of the current economic downturn. Comment The increase in the default and minimum employee contribution rates, and the compulsory employer contribution rates from 1 April 2013 were announced as part of Budget 2011. KiwiSaver members and employers will have nearly two years to plan for the 1% increase in contribution rates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Revision of prospectuses and investment statements Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The current drafting of this clause is not clear on whether prospectuses and investment statements issued on or before the date of the bill’s assent must be revised to reflect the new contribution rates. Comment Officials do not agree that there is any uncertainty here. The first part of the clause gives KiwiSaver providers two months to update any new prospectuses. The second part of the clause removes the need to reissue statements or prospectuses that have already been registered at the date of Royal assent, and so ensures securities allotted under those prospectuses are not void. The drafting is consistent with two other provisions in the KiwiSaver Act relating to previous Government-initiated changes to KiwiSaver. This provision has been discussed with the Financial Markets Authority, which is content with the current drafting. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 Issue: KiwiSaver membership start date for employees enrolled via their employer Submission (Matter raised by officials) The KiwiSaver Act 2006 should clarify the start date for employees who are enrolled in KiwiSaver to their employers, either by being automatically enrolled or by giving their employer an opt-in notice. It is necessary to know the start date in order to calculate minimum membership periods which apply when determining eligibility to make withdrawals from KiwiSaver. Membership should be counted from the 15th of the month in which the employee’s first KiwiSaver contribution is deducted, not the date on which the employee is finally allocated to a KiwiSaver scheme, which occurs approximately three months later. This will ensure that the same start date is used for all employee contribution and interest calculation purposes. Comment The membership start date is relevant for determining certain minimum membership periods in relation to the KiwiSaver withdrawal rules. For example, KiwiSaver funds are locked in until the later of the date on which the member turns 65, or of five years from the start of membership. Under the KiwiSaver Act an employer must automatically enrol new employees into KiwiSaver. Employees can also join KiwiSaver by giving their employer a deduction notice. Using either joining method, the employer then deducts KiwiSaver contributions from the employee’s salary or wages, and pays these to Inland Revenue. These deductions are recorded on the employer monthly schedule (EMS) as part of the standard PAYE process. The Commissioner holds all initial KiwiSaver contributions for a period of up to three months from the date the first contribution is received. For automatically enrolled employees, this is because they may choose to opt out of KiwiSaver between days 14 and 56 of their employment (although later opt-outs may also be permitted in some circumstances). If the employee opts out of KiwiSaver, Inland Revenue will return any employee and employer contributions already received back to the respective parties. Unless the employee or employer has chosen their own scheme, Inland Revenue provisionally allocates employees who enrol via their employers to one of six default KiwiSaver providers during the initial three-month period. This allocation will become final if the employee does not opt out within the timeframe. In either case, it is only after final allocation (three months later) that Inland Revenue sends the employee’s details and initial three months’ worth of contributions to the relevant KiwiSaver provider. 23 However, the employee should be considered to have become a member of KiwiSaver from the month they started making KiwiSaver contributions, not when their allocation to a particular KiwiSaver provider is finalised three months later. To overcome this problem, an amendment to the KiwiSaver Act is proposed, to clarify that the membership start date for an employee who is enrolled into KiwiSaver via their employer is taken from the date on which their first contribution is received by Inland Revenue. All KiwiSaver contributions will be treated as received by Inland Revenue on the 15th of the month in which deduction was made; the date is standardised because of inbuilt time-delays between payroll periods and the filing and processing of the EMS. This will also bring the position of employees closer to that of members who enrol directly with a provider. In the latter case, the membership start date is generally taken from the date the person’s application to a KiwiSaver scheme is accepted. This amendment will clarify the legislative position; for practical purposes this is already an accepted start date for employees that is used by KiwiSaver providers and Inland Revenue. It will also more closely accord with employees’ understanding of when they became KiwiSaver members. The proposed amendment should apply from 1 July 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Process for making KiwiSaver employee contributions after the employee’s end payment date Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is proposed to simplify the process for KiwiSaver members who have reached their end payment date (and so are able to make withdrawals from KiwiSaver) to choose whether or not to have employee contributions deducted by their employer. These members should not be required to apply to Inland Revenue to record their choice, as it is a matter for the employee and employer in the first instance. Comment Most employees who are KiwiSaver members contribute to KiwiSaver via their employer’s payroll. Their employer deducts the employee contributions at the employee’s selected rate (2%, 4% or 8%) from their salary or wages, and pays them to Inland Revenue. The deductions are recorded on the employer monthly schedule (EMS) as part of the standard PAYE process. 24 KiwiSaver members who have reached their “end payment date” – which is the later of the date on which the member turns 65, or five years from the start of membership – have two options. They may either:  withdraw their accumulated funds and close their KiwiSaver accounts; or  keep their accounts open and remain members of KiwiSaver. If they choose to remain in KiwiSaver after reaching their end payment date, members can continue to make contributions to their KiwiSaver scheme. These members will also be able to access their accumulated funds, and officials understand that many KiwiSaver providers intend to allow members to make partial withdrawals after the end payment date, while keeping their KiwiSaver accounts open. Members who have reached their end payment date and are still employed should have the option of continuing to have employee contributions deducted from their salary and wages. 1 Other members will wish to cease making regular employee contributions at this point, because they have access to their KiwiSaver funds. They may cease contributing altogether or choose to make contributions on a more ad hoc basis, directly to their provider. The proposed amendment will simplify the administrative process for employees in choosing whether to carry on making employee contributions after their end payments date, and provide for direct communication of their decision from the employee to the employer. Officials recommend the proposed amendment apply from 1 July 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 1 The requirement for the employer to make compulsory employer contributions ceases at the end payment date, although employers may choose to continue making employer contributions. The entitlement to member tax credits (MTCs) also ceases at end payment date. 25 WORKING FOR FAMILIES Issue: In-work tax credit and ACC survivor spouse payments Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The drafting should make the link between hours worked and ACC income clearer, especially to ensure the surviving spouse’s hours are not overridden. Comment This amendment deals with a drafting issue of who is covered by the “ACC special rule” for hours worked. Currently, a person receiving ACC compensation can claim the hours they previously worked as counting towards the hours test. The rule had been intended to cover all situations when ACC weekly compensation is paid, but the language does not clearly include the situation of a surviving spouse weekly compensation. The amendment seeks to confirm that when the accident compensation received relates to the death of a spouse, the deceased spouse’s prior work hours can be counted towards the hours test of the surviving spouse. Officials consider that the current provision clearly links the hours worked by the deceased spouse to the ACC income being received. Officials will provide amended drafting to make clear that the hours worked relating to the ACC payment are added to any hours worked by the spouse in their own right, and do not override them. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: In-work tax credit and major shareholder employees of close companies Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA supports the amendment but recommends the commencement date be made retrospective to 1 April 2008, when the issue was first raised. This will allow affected people to claim for prior years. Alternatively, a savings provision should be included to prevent people having to repay tax credits inadvertently received for prior years. 26 Comment Making the change retrospective would allow for affected people to reapply for past year tax credits if they can meet the new criteria. The change is not arising from a technical error, omission or dispute but a change in the policy boundary for situations that can qualify for assistance. Additionally, there are unknown fiscal, administrative and compliance costs to making the change retrospective as people revisit previous applications, although the fiscal cost is likely to be relatively small in terms of total spending on the in-work tax credit. The general approach is to make changes prospectively unless there is a strong case for retrospectivity. As this is a policy change there is not a strong case for backdating the change. A savings provision is in effect the same as a retrospective change but limited in this case to those who applied the law incorrectly at the time, and should likewise be used sparingly. The application date could be amended to 1 April 2011 with limited impact on fiscal, administrative and compliance costs for affected persons. This is because applications for an in-work tax credit can be lodged after the end of the tax year to receive payment as a year-end lump sum. Most applications for shareholder- employees would be received after June 2012 or later if tax agents are used. The bill is expected to be passed in July 2012. Shareholder-employees would be able to apply for interim payments from the 2013–14 tax year, if they wish. Recommendation That the submission to have the change apply from 2008 be declined, and that the application date be changed from 1 April 2012 to 1 April 2011. Issue: In-work tax credit and trust owned companies Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment to allow major shareholder employees of a close company to claim the in-work tax credit should be extended to apply also to a full-time earner employed by a close company that is owned by the full-time earner’s family trust. Comment Trust arrangements are far more complicated than arrangements involving companies, where there is a clear and identifiable link between the company and its owners. For example, a trust can have several settlors and beneficiaries, making it unclear if a trust is “the full-time earner’s family trust”. There is insufficient time to consider the implications of extending the provision to unpaid workers of companies owned by a trust established by the worker, for inclusion in this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 27 28 Issue: Excluding repayments from debtors from “Other payments” category Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Family scheme income should exclude repayments of amounts standing to the credit of a person that falls within the ambit of section MB 13(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. In particular, amounts received by company shareholders from current account repayments should be excluded. Comment Section MB 13(1) captures other payments in the nature of family income that a person might receive and use to replace wages or meet their usual family living expenses. Section MB 13(2) sets out types of payments that are excluded from the rule. The rule is not intended to catch payments relating to changes in how assets are held, such as the sale of an asset or taking out a commercial loan. Repayments from debtors of amounts standing to the credit of the person are not specifically excluded, although small amounts may fall under the $5,000 threshold in section MB 13(3). Payments received where the person is in credit appears to be similar in nature to the existing exemption for proceeds from disposal of property. Further consideration is required to consider how to word the exemption to avoid unintended consequences. The Income Tax Act, for example, does not define a shareholder’s current account. Officials will consider the issue for inclusion in a future tax bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Withdrawals from KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA supports the amendment made for KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds (CSFs) which stops withdrawals from these schemes being included in taxable income for the purposes of calculating family scheme income. The amendment should also apply to other superannuation schemes in which members are locked in until retirement and may only exit the scheme in defined circumstances. 29 Comment The existing Working for Families (WFF) rule prevents people from diverting employment income into superannuation schemes (and later receiving it as a tax-free distribution) to maximise their entitlement to tax credits. The rule addresses situations when a person’s taxable income is apparently reduced by channelling income through these schemes. It is of an anti-avoidance nature and is aimed largely at situations in which the employer, employee and scheme are closely connected. The rule applies only when the individual continues to work for the employer after the distribution. Many employer-based superannuation schemes make distributions only after the person has left employment – for example, as retirement or serious (terminal) illness benefits. These distributions are not included in family scheme income under the current rule and so these individuals are not affected by the amendment proposed in the bill. The amendment overrides the WFF rule in order to support early withdrawals that are a deliberate design feature of KiwiSaver – for example, the first home withdrawal facility. Counting distributions made under the first-home withdrawal facility as family scheme income, and thereby reducing WFF tax credit entitlements, is not consistent with the KiwiSaver objective of encouraging home purchase nor the WFF objective of supporting day-to-day living expenses. These early withdrawal features are heavily prescribed in KiwiSaver legislation, and are carefully regulated. Other employer-based superannuation schemes that allow early withdrawals do so in circumstances permitted by their trust deed which may not be as prescribed as those under the KiwiSaver and CSF rules. It is these early withdrawal situations that the WFF anti-avoidance rule is aimed at; restricting this amendment to KiwiSaver and CSFs provides an appropriate balance between the policy intention of WFF tax credits and the KiwiSaver policy for permitted early withdrawals. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 30 GST AND LATE PAYMENT FEES Clause 137 Issue: The changes extend the scope of GST Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed amendment to charge GST on late payment fees should not go ahead. Charging GST on late payment fees is contrary to the policy intent of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, which is to impose GST on the supply of goods and services. Late payment fees are not consideration for the supply of goods and services. Comments New Zealand has a broad-based GST. The over-arching policy behind this broad base is that supplies of goods and services should be subject to GST unless they are specifically excluded. A flat late payment fee can be viewed as the on-charging of administration costs that a business incurs in chasing payment for the underlying taxable supply. In this respect, it is in effect an increased charge for the goods and services provided and should be subject to GST in the same way as the underlying supply. This can be contrasted with interest imposed on an outstanding amount, which represents the time value of the money unpaid. The interest is analogous to interest charged on borrowed money (in this case the money the customer retains rather than paying the bill on time) and is therefore GST-exempt. By defining this boundary with more certainty, the proposed change will afford businesses the clear choice between charging a flat-fee for late payment (with this fee being subject to GST) or charging exempt penalty interest. Which method is chosen will be a business decision that can be made on a clearer understanding of the GST consequences for both the business and its customer base. Charging GST on late payment fees also provides consistency with transactions involving prompt payment discounts – GST being built in as a charge in those transactions if payment is late. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 31 Issue: Application date of the amendment Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal should only apply prospectively. Retrospective application is inequitable as it disadvantages taxpayers who have historically accounted for GST on late payment fees vis-à-vis taxpayers who have not. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The application date of the savings provision should be extended to:  1 April 2013. (Corporate Taxpayers Group)  The start of the taxpayer’s next income year. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants)  The first GST period commencing after the date of enactment. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comments Officials are concerned that making this change prospective could result in numerous back-claims of GST charged on late payment fees over the last eight years. This would result in refunds of approximately $13.8 million for these periods. Unless the businesses concerned were to repay these refunds to the individual customers that are likely to have suffered the GST impost, such refunds will be windfall gains to the businesses at the expense of the Crown. The proposed amendment will confirm that businesses that charged GST did the correct thing, while also saving the position of those businesses that, in good faith, did not charge GST over this period. The savings provision was intended to allow affected businesses the time to update their systems. Officials do, however, accept that the proposed effective date of 1 April 2012 is administratively unworkable, given the likely progression of this bill through the remainder of the legislative process. Submissions seeking a delayed effective date are premised on the basis that businesses will need time following enactment of the bill to update their systems. Officials consider that an effective date of 1 January 2013 would be sufficient lead-in time to address these concerns. Recommendation That the retrospective application date and savings provision remain in place, but the effective date for the proposed amendment (and, correspondingly, the length of the savings provision) be extended to 1 January 2013. 32 Issue: Definition of “late payment fees” and the boundary between “late payment fees” and “penalty or default interest” Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed legislation should explicitly exclude interest charges from late payment fees. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) A specific definition of “late payment fee” is required to remove the ambiguity between such fees and the “penalty or default interest” concept in section 14(3)(a) of the GST Act. (New Zealand Law Society) Guidance on the boundary between the late payment fee clause and penalty or default interest under section 14(3)(a) is required. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment It is not intended that clarifying the GST position of late payment fees will in any way narrow the scope of the penalty or default interest exemption in section 14(3)(a). To the extent that penalty or default interest is charged, it would not be caught by the proposed provision. The key distinction is between interest charges (which are exempt) and other late payment fees (which should be subject to GST). Officials consider this distinction will be obvious in most cases. Attempting to define “late payment fee” could, as with many definitions, create additional confusion. This could particularly be the case when a fee falls outside of any definition proposed but still could not easily be categorised as “interest”. However, in order to avoid confusion, officials recommend that the proposed charging provision in clause 137 of the bill be made explicitly subject to the “penalty or default interest” exemption in section 14(3)(a) of the GST Act. To the extent that there is some confusion between “penalties” and “penalty interest”, officials agree that clarification would be useful. More specifically, there should not be scope for businesses to avoid charging GST on late payment fees simply by labelling them as “penalties” instead. Recommendations That the submissions be accepted to the extent that clause 137 be made subject to section 14(3)(a). Clarification should also be made to ensure that non-interest penalties, however labelled, fall within the scope of the proposed provision. 33 Issue: Late payment fees linked to the underlying supply Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) To be consistent with policy, the legislation should specifically exclude GST from applying to late payment fees when the underlying supply is outside the scope of GST – for example, if the underlying supply is an exempt supply of financial services. Comment Officials consider late payment fees to be, in effect, an increase in consideration for the underlying goods and services to reflect the non-payment of an invoice. On this basis, if the underlying supply does not attract GST, or is zero-rated, the tax treatment of the late payment fee should be consistent with that. The bill should be amended to reflect this. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Time of supply and invoice requirements Submissions (KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group) It is not clear from the draft legislation that a new time of supply will arise, and this should be clarified. (KPMG) There should be no requirement for a separate tax invoice to be issued in respect of the late payment fee. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comments The default position under the GST Act is that a time of supply will arise at the earlier of an invoice being issued or payment received. Officials consider that this default rule should adequately cater for late payment fees. Take, for example, a supplier that charges a late payment fee of $20 plus GST. If a customer fails to pay their bill on time for a month, the late payment fee will presumably be added to their invoice for the following month. The issuing of this subsequent month’s invoice will trigger a time of supply for the late payment fee (unless of course the customer has proactively paid the fee before receiving their invoice). 34 The fact that a subsequent invoice is likely to be provided as a matter of course should also address the issue of whether a separate invoice for a late payment fee is necessary. Therefore, officials do not consider that a legislative exclusion from the invoicing requirements is necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Ease of avoidance and fiscal implications Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Committee asked officials to comment on how easily the proposed rule could be avoided and how the proposed amendment would affect the Government’s fiscal position. Comment As noted by Committee members, GST on late payment fees could be avoided by businesses switching to a penalty interest regime for unpaid amounts (penalty interest being exempt from GST). However, as any GST on late payment fees will ultimately be borne by the customer, businesses may find it easier simply to on-charge the GST on these fees rather than going to the expense and effort of adopting different systems. As officials understand it, the majority of businesses that currently charge late payment fees do so on a plus-GST basis, despite the argument being potentially available that GST is not required to be charged. It is anticipated that the proposed change will clarify for businesses the GST consequences of both options, so their choice can be an informed one. The fiscal impact of the proposed amendment is an estimated increase in GST revenue of approximately $2.5 million per year. As previously noted, making the change retrospective ensures a further $13.8 million is not lost to the tax base through potential windfall gains. Officials acknowledge that a behaviour shift from businesses away from late payment fees towards a penalty interest model will impact on the $2.5 million, but note that the main purpose of the proposed amendment going forward is to provide clarity for businesses and customers rather than raise significant revenue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 35 Issue: Other matters Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) In a business-to-business context, any GST charged on late payment fees will be deducted by the customer. Therefore, there is no revenue risk in that regard. Comment Officials agree with this statement, but note that there is a revenue risk when the GST is charged to non-registered persons. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A lack of clarity around the existing rules is no reason to change the law. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Inland Revenue could clarify the issue by releasing an interpretation statement confirming late payment fees are not subject to GST. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment As previously stated, officials consider that the broad-based nature of New Zealand’s GST rules and their link to an underlying supply of goods and services suggest that late payment fees should be subject to GST. “Clarifying” the law to the opposite effect would therefore be contrary to what is, in officials’ view, the best policy outcome. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 36 LIQUIDATORS AND RECEIVERS CHANGING GST ACCOUNTING BASIS Clause 140 Issue: Fiscal cost does not justify new rule Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The overall fiscal cost (estimated at $2.5 million) of allowing liquidators, receivers and voluntary administrators to switch accounting basis does not justify the new rule which will create an asymmetry in some situations. The policy objective is based on the assumption that there will be a negative impact on the Government’s tax base if GST refunds are paid to liquidators and receivers. The submitter notes that this may not always be the case, as suppliers on the invoice basis should already have accounted for output tax. Therefore, to ensure neutrality in these situations, liquidators and receivers should be entitled to claim GST deductions. Comment If a registered person meets certain conditions – for example, when the total value of taxable supplies for a 12-month period has not exceeded, or is not likely to exceed, $2 million, the registered person may account for GST on a payments basis. The majority of registered persons (approximately 80 percent) account for GST using the payments basis. The GST Act allows registered persons who are accounting for GST on a payments basis to change to the invoice basis by applying to the Commissioner. There are currently no restrictions on registered persons making this accounting basis change. It has become standard practice for liquidators and receivers to adopt the invoice basis for accounting for GST, immediately upon becoming a liquidator or receiver of a registered person that accounts for GST on a payments basis. Moving to an invoice basis allows the liquidator or receiver to claim input tax credits for supplies received for which no payment has been made. A change of accounting basis for insolvent firms will typically give rise to a refund because a firm in this condition will generally have more unpaid suppliers than customers who have not paid them. The current practice does not seem to have a non-tax commercial purpose other than to generate GST refunds. The amendment precludes liquidators, receivers and voluntary administrators switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST; they will still receive a tax credit for any supplies they pay for and therefore GST will not be overpaid. 37 If the supplier is on the invoice basis and has accounted for the sale and writes off all or part of the debt, they can make a credit adjustment in their GST return. This ensures neutrality. Example Cook accounts for GST on a payments basis. Cook purchases goods from Baker. Cook is not entitled to a GST input tax credit until the goods are paid for. Cook cannot pay for the goods because it is insolvent, and a liquidator is appointed. If the liquidator moved Cook to the invoice basis, an input tax credit could be claimed, even though the goods have not been paid for. If Cook remained on the payments basis and paid for the goods, they could claim an input tax credit. Baker is on the invoice basis. Baker has paid output tax on Cook’s purchase to Inland Revenue. If Cook does not pay for the goods and Baker writes off the debt, Baker can claim back the tax from Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amendment results in a “super-preference” for Inland Revenue Submissions (C & C Strategic Limited, Coalition of Insolvency Practitioners, Fisher White and Associates Limited, Gerry Rea Partners, Restructuring Services Limited) The bill adopts a position that Inland Revenue should have a “super-preference” for GST, in priority to all other claims, including employees’ wages and other taxes such as PAYE, cutting across well-established and carefully considered principles of both insolvency and GST law. (Coalition of Insolvency Practitioners) The bill entitles Inland Revenue to GST for all income without offsetting GST on creditors that were used to earn that income. This creates a “super-preference” for Inland Revenue contrary to schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993. It puts Inland Revenue ahead of employees’ final pay, back pay, and holiday pay, denying many employees the chance of a pay-out. The social cost of this is will be borne by the taxpayer and affected families. (Fisher White and Associates) The submitter cannot support the amendment because of the serious effect which the proposed change would have on the equitable entitlements of Inland Revenue, employees and secured and unsecured creditors in liquidations and receiverships. 38 The proposed clause will have the effect of artificially inflating the preferential GST claim of Inland Revenue in liquidations and receiverships of distressed companies which have been returning GST on the payments basis permitted by the GST Act. This will be achieved to the detriment of all other creditors including employees, who will receive a lower distribution than their equitable entitlement under the Companies Act 1993. (C & C Strategic Limited, Gerry Rea Partners, Restructuring Services Limited) Comment A super-preference is not being created. Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993, which sets out the creditors who have preferential claims in cases of liquidation, is not being amended. Approximately 80 percent of registered persons account for GST using the payments basis. It has become standard practice on appointment for liquidators and receivers to adopt the invoice basis allowing the liquidator or receiver to claim input tax credits for supplies received for which no payment has been made. Inland Revenue has no concerns with the fees charged by insolvency practitioners (and if it did, as noted by submitters, there are other avenues for addressing such concerns). Rather, the amendment is aimed at ensuring the GST system is not used to fund liquidations. The amendment maintains the status quo by preventing an insolvent firm changing its GST accounting basis from the payments basis to the invoice basis. These firms have typically been on the payment basis for their entire lifetime and a change is sought only in their wind-up phase. This change seems to have no non-tax commercial basis other than to generate a GST refund. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Funds used to finance liquidations Submissions (Coalition of Insolvency Practitioners, HFK Limited) The clause as drafted is a knee-jerk and disproportionate reaction to an incorrect perception that GST refunds post-insolvency are being used for the purpose of inappropriately funding insolvency practitioners. This perception is without a factual basis. Even if some insolvency practitioners have sought to change the GST basis inappropriately, the issue of whether the amendment is appropriate needs to be carefully thought through, particularly given the regulation of insolvency practitioners that is already proposed in the context of the Insolvency Practitioners Bill. (Coalition of Insolvency Practitioners) 39 If liquidators are unable to access the GST refund to fund their investigations, liquidators will refuse to accept these appointments unless the petitioning creditor agrees to fund the liquidator’s time cost fee for undertaking investigations and taking action against the company or its directors and shareholders. Being unable to access this “fighting fund” may result in liquidators refusing to accept appointments unless funding is provided by their appointer. (HFK Limited) Comment Officials consider that it is not the purpose of the GST system to fund liquidations or receiverships. Liquidations and receiverships have been around long before GST was introduced. Providing a “fighting fund” for liquidators and receivers should not be a by-catch of the GST system. The funding of liquidators and receivers is a separate issue from the administration of GST. The submissions note that more cases will be referred to the Officials Assignee and that petitioning creditors will have to fund liquidations. Officials consider that the funding of liquidations should be transparent – for example, if Inland Revenue is a petitioning creditor, the funding should be directly from Inland Revenue and not via the GST system. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: There may be other reasons for changing the accounting basis Submissions (Coalition of Insolvency Practitioners, HFK Limited, New Zealand Law Society) The amendment draws an artificial line, and one which on particular facts may not be appropriate. There may be genuine commercial reasons for a liquidator or receiver requesting a change in the GST accounting basis. Comment The current practice of changing the GST accounting basis does not seem to have a non-tax commercial purpose other than to generate GST refunds. In many cases liquidators and receivers are dealing with firms who have always been on the payments basis and only when the liquidator or receiver is appointed is a change sought. Officials note the amendment does not alter the ability to obtain a tax credit under the payments basis – that is, if a supplier is paid by a liquidator or a receiver, a GST refund could still arise and GST will not be overpaid. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 40 Issue: Amendment is not necessary because the Commissioner already has a discretion to deny application for change Submissions (HFK Limited, New Zealand Law Society) The amendment may not be necessary as the current wording already provides the Commissioner with the discretion to deny a taxpayer’s application to change their accounting basis. (New Zealand Law Society) Rather than barring all liquidators, receivers or administrators from requesting a change of GST accounting basis, allowing the Commissioner discretion would be a middle ground option. (HFK Limited) Comment The default position for registered persons is that they must account for GST on the invoice basis. However, if certain criteria are met, they can account for GST using the payments basis. Approximately 80 percent (517,000) of registered persons (647,000) use the payments basis to account for GST. Relying on a discretion to stop liquidators, receivers and administrators from switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis would not be a feasible remedy. Officials consider switching the GST accounting basis in such cases should be prohibited. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: No consultation Submissions (Coalition of Insolvency Practitioners, Fisher White & Associates Limited, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The insolvency industry was not consulted about the amendment under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Members of INSOL were consulted. Any INSOL committee members that were approached failed to communicate with membership that the bill existed or that they represented practitioners to Inland Revenue on this matter. Submitters are concerned that a lack of consultation results in the amendment failing to address a number of wider policy issues. (Coalition of Insolvency Practitioners, Fisher White & Associates Limited) This matter should be put out for further consultation and appropriate analysis undertaken by Inland Revenue as part of the Generic Tax Policy Process. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 41 Comment Officials discussed this issue with representatives from INSOL, the industry group for insolvency practitioners. These submissions would require the amendment to be removed from the bill to allow a further consultation. Given the prior consultation that has taken place and the strong policy basis for reform on this issue, officials do not support this suggestion. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Existing invoice basis companies Submission (HFK Limited) The submitter seeks clarification on what is proposed to happen in the situation where the company is already on an invoice basis for accounting for GST at the appointment of the liquidator, receiver or administrator but the company has actually been preparing the GST returns on a payments basis. Is the company still able to get the refund associated with the unclaimed invoices? Comment The normal invoice basis rules would apply. If there were an entitlement to a refund, the refund would be given. However, if there were tax shortfalls in previous periods, the registered person could be liable also for use-of-money interest and, if the taxpayer is culpable, shortfall penalties. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inland Revenue’s debt preference Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The creditor preferences enjoyed by Inland Revenue in the Companies Act 1993 for employer-related debts (other than Child Support) and GST debts should not be available when Inland Revenue applies to the Courts to place a taxpayer company in liquidation. 42 GST should be removed as a creditor preference. If the Select Committee believes that the above submission is beyond its terms of enquiry for the tax bill, NZICA submits that the Committee recommend that the Government consider this at a later time as a matter of priority. Comment Officials note that this submission raises issues that are separate to the issue of change of GST accounting basis by liquidators, receivers and administrators. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 CREDIT CARD SERVICE FEE AND GST Clause 133 Issue: GST should apply to the credit card service fee Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The scheme of the GST Act is that GST applies to all goods and services unless there are valid reasons from departing from this. We do not see a case for departing from the scheme of the GST Act, which the current wording of the bill would suggest. Comment The credit card service fee is not exempt from GST. The current wording of clause 133 “plus any GST” infers that GST does apply, but it is the rate of GST that may vary. For example, an overseas-based taxpayer who opts to pay their income tax debt by credit card will be subject to the credit card service fee plus GST, but because they are not resident in New Zealand, the rate at which GST is charged will be zero. Alternatively, a resident taxpayer who pays their income tax debt by credit card will be subject to the credit card service fee plus GST at a rate of 15%. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Absorption of the credit card service fee Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The fee of 1.42% should be absorbed by the Government. Comment The credit card service is one of many forms of payment options for domestic-based taxpayers. Taxpayers can choose whether to use this service and, in some cases, receive additional benefits (in the form of interest-free periods and travel points from credit card providers). The Commissioner will continue to charge the fee for domestic taxpayers who choose to use this service. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 44 OTHER GST MATTERS Issue: Definition of “land” Clause 135 Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh, Matter raised by officials) The exclusion from the zero-rating rules for certain transfers of interest in land should be contained in the zero-rating provisions themselves rather than being part of the “land” definition. (New Zealand Law Society) Irrespective of where the exclusion is located, there are drafting issues that need to be addressed. In particular, the quantum of payments that triggers the zero-rating rules needs to be clearly set out. (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) Clarifications should be made to ensure that zero-rating applies to payments in respect of the assignment or surrender of a lease. (Matter raised by officials) Comment The clause is designed to ensure that taxpayers cannot circumvent the rules that zero- rate land transfers by making lump-sum payments under non-standard rental agreements. Broadly speaking, the intended effect of the provision is that if an up- front payment of more than 25 percent of the total rental is made in advance, the lease will be zero-rated. Officials and submitters agree that the policy behind the amendment is sound. Officials agree with the New Zealand Law Society that the zero-rating rules should apply to the transfer of interests in leases, because these transactions have the potential to involve large lump-sum payments. For the same reasons, officials submit that the zero-rating rules should be clarified to ensure that they apply to payments made for the assignment or surrender of leases. There is concern that, for example, a taxpayer could enter into a lease transaction and, almost immediately, receive a large payment to assign or surrender that lease. Such an arrangement, if standard-rated, could give rise to the type of arrangement that the zero-rating rules were designed to prevent. Submitters are also concerned that the proposed drafting makes it difficult to be sure what quantum of up-front payment would trigger the zero-rating rules. In particular, there is concern that, under the current drafting, any upfront payment would result in zero-rating. The New Zealand Law Society also submits that the link to 25 percent of the total consideration specified in the lease is difficult to determine – particularly in the case of rolling or periodic leases when the “total consideration” can be unclear at the outset. Their preference is therefore to replace the “total consideration” test with one based on the lesser of a year or the agreed term of the lease. 45 Officials agree that only leases involving lump-sum payments that represent 25 percent or more of the lease payments should be zero-rated. The New Zealand Law Society submission that the threshold be set at 25 percent of annual lease payments (or the total lease if it is shorter than one year) is attractive for its simplicity. However, officials are concerned that such a rule might inadvertently affect commercial arrangements such as the payment of a deposit. To clarify the effect of the provision, officials consider that the 25 percent should relate to the consideration that is the greater of one year’s payments under the lease or the minimum term of the lease as entered into at the outset. For example, if the parties entered into a two-year lease, with an option to extend for a further two years, the “total consideration” should be the first two-year term. Alternatively, if the parties entered into a monthly lease with no fixed term, the lease should be standard rated unless there is an upfront payment of 25 percent or more of what would be the first year’s rental payments. In addition, officials consider that the provision should be clarified so that it only applies to payments that are not themselves regular payments under a lease. For example, if a one-year lease was entered into with quarterly payments, the payments should not be zero-rated, even though each one represents 25 percent of the total consideration. As mentioned above, the zero-rating rules are designed to cover non- standard rental payments that could be seen, at least in part, as the economic equivalent of freehold transfers. Officials agree that the exclusion for lease payments could be moved out of the land definition to provide a distinction between interests in land and transactions involving land. Recommendation That the submission regarding moving the relevant paragraph to the “land” definition be accepted. That the effect of the submissions regarding the clarity of the test be accepted, except the New Zealand Law Society’s proposed annual lease payments test should be varied in the manner set out by officials. Issue: Concurrent supplies Clause 146 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) The proposed drafting still does not clarify how the concurrent use of land rules would apply to, for example, land or common areas that are divided amongst taxable and non-taxable use. 46 Comment Officials agree that there is potential confusion over the application of the concurrent use rules. The situations described in the submission are:  common areas of an activity that is both taxable and exempt, such as communal areas in a residential rest home; and  a building that is divided into taxable and exempt activities, such as a warehouse with an apartment on top. The concurrent use of land rules are not designed to cater for these situations, which are more appropriately dealt with through the general apportionment rules. Instead, the concurrent use rules are in place to deal with a very specific fact situation. Given the level of confusion, officials consider it would be preferable to spell out in the GST Act the scenario at which the provision is aimed: when the same piece of land is used both for the exempt purpose of residential rental while simultaneously being marketed for disposal as part of a taxable activity. Setting this scenario out in legislation should provide the clarity submitters are seeking, while also providing a clearer boundary between the concurrent use of land rules and the general apportionment rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Goods and services acquired before 1 April 2011 Clause 148 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Matter raised by officials) The old apportionment rules should apply to assets that were zero-rated before 1 April 2011 and not adjusted before that date. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 148 and section 21H of the GST Act should be redrafted to clarify when the old and new apportionment rules, respectively, apply to an asset. (Matter raised by officials) Comment Officials agree that supplies that were zero-rated prior to 1 April 2011 and not adjusted before that date should be subject to the old apportionment rules. As a matter of consistency, it can be argued that the new apportionment rules should apply, as the new rules would apply if the supply in question had not been zero-rated but had 47 instead been fully taxable. However, allowing the use of the old apportionment rules is a pragmatic solution that should provide certainty and lower compliance costs for businesses. As drafted, there is potential confusion over the application of section 21H, which is intended to clarify the application of the old and new apportionment rules. Section 21H(1) provides that the section only applies to an asset that has been adjusted under the old apportionment rules. Proposed section 21H(2B) then sets out the treatment for assets that have not been so adjusted. The assets affected by subsection (2B) are not a subset of those set out in subsection (1). As a result, it is possible to interpret subsection (2B) as having no effect. This is not the desired outcome and redrafting section 21H to clearly accommodate both situations is therefore recommended. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: GST groups and information obligations Submission (Russell McVeagh) As currently drafted, it is not apparent how the obligations to provide information for land transactions apply to registered persons that are part of a GST group, but not the group’s representative member. The legislation should specify that the provision or receipt of the necessary information by any group member should be treated as the provision or receipt by the representative member. Comment Officials agree that clarity in this area would be useful. Given that the taxable activity of each group member is treated for GST purposes as if it were carried on by the representative member, it makes sense that the required information should also be treated as being provided or received by the representative member. This will ensure the information is treated as being given and received by the person that is actually registered for GST and will be completing the requisite returns. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 48 Issue: Agents and information obligations Submission (Russell McVeagh) The requirement to provide information as part of the zero-rating for land provisions should apply to all agencies, not just undisclosed agencies. Comment From an administrative perspective, it is generally preferable for the information provided as part of a land transaction to relate directly to the parties who are the actual supplier and recipient of the goods and services. The rules that cater for purchases made by agents for undisclosed principals are a concession from this general position to reflect the commercial reality of these transactions. Officials do not consider that these concessionary rules should be extended to all agency situations. In a “disclosed” agency, the parties should have no objection to the details of the principal, rather than the agent, being provided to the counterparty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax fraction for secondhand goods Clause 145 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The secondhand goods input tax deduction available should be limited to the tax fraction that was in place at the time the goods were acquired. Comment Clause 145 clarifies that a person will be able to claim input tax deductions when they acquire the goods or services before becoming registered and later use those goods or services as part of their taxable activity. This deduction will be available when the person has paid GST on the goods and services under section 8(1) of the GST Act or on the import of goods under section 12(1). Both of these deductions are limited to “tax charged”, being the tax actually paid by the person when they acquired the goods and services. If the goods and services were acquired when the rate of GST was 12.5%, GST at that rate will determine the maximum deduction they can claim. 49 When a secondhand good is brought into a taxable activity, officials consider that the input deduction available should similarly be limited to the tax fraction in place when the goods were acquired. To do otherwise would effectively afford secondhand goods favourable treatment over similar goods that were acquired on a plus GST basis. Officials do not consider this amendment would place an undue compliance costs on businesses, because they already need to have documentary evidence to support any claim for a secondhand goods deduction. Under section 24(7), this evidence must include the date on which the goods were purchased. Given the GST rate has only changed twice since its introduction and on clearly defined dates, identifying the relevant tax fraction should be relatively simple. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of new apportionment rules Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The GST Act should be amended to allow all registered persons to apportion GST for goods and services acquired after 1 April 2011 under the new apportionment rules. Amendments to clarify this should be retrospective. The Income Tax Act should allow small businesses to incorporate the GST apportionment ratio to adjust for private use, rather than having to account for fringe benefit tax. Comment Officials are aware that there is some potential confusion regarding the scope of the new apportionment rules – in particular, their application to non-individuals – and are looking at this as part of an existing item on the Tax Policy Work Programme. Given the timeframe for the current bill and the potential breadth of any changes in this area, officials will continue to review the scope of these rules with a view to including any changes considered necessary in the next available tax bill. The potential for small businesses to use the GST apportionment rules to account for income tax in lieu of using the fringe benefit rules is not a matter being considered in the current bill, but is noted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 50 Issue: GST treatment of land used for taxable and exempt purposes Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Sections 5(15) and 20(3J) of the GST Act should be amended to confirm that the supply of a dwelling included in the supply of land is a separate supply and therefore treated as an exempt or non-taxable supply. Comment This is an interpretative issue that Inland Revenue has not reached a final view on. Once the position under the current provision has been clarified, Inland Revenue will communicate its position and recommend a legislative amendment if required. It is not necessarily the case that the current wording does not achieve the desired policy outcome. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Drafting matters Clauses 141, 145 and 152 Submissions (Russell McVeagh, BDO) The wording of clauses 141 and 152 should be amended to provide more clarity and consistency with other drafting in the GST Act. Consequential amendments to sections 78F(7), 73(3D) and 75(3E) of the GST Act would also aid clarity. (Russell McVeagh) Clause 145 allows input tax claims for certain secondhand goods. However, section 21B(3) of the GST Act should also be updated to refer to the record-keeping requirements for secondhand goods. (BDO) Recommendation Officials agree that the drafting suggested in the submissions would be beneficial and recommend that the submissions be accepted. 51 Issue: Deductible output tax Clause 88(3) Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment is supported but internal processes should be improved to prevent this sort of oversight from occurring. Alternatively a framework should be established to correct these errors more quickly. Comment The recent change to the GST apportionment rules prompted the introduction of a new defined term in the Income Tax Act 2007, “deductible output tax”. As part of the creation of that definition, a type of GST output tax that was deductible under the old rules was not carried over into the new definition. The proposed amendment clarifies that the relevant output tax is deductible and makes the change retrospective to avoid any possible confusion about the correct position in the intervening period. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: GST – secondhand goods input tax credit Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA broadly supports the amendment but proposes a change to the drafting. Comment The provisions in new section 3A(2)(b) of the GST Act are intended to be read together as one provision, and therefore adding the word “not” to the second subparagraph as proposed by the submitter would change the intended outcome rather than correct it. Officials do agree, however, that the provision can be made clearer and will provide alternative wording. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 52 53 Other matters 54 55 APPLICATIONS FOR OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS Clause 91 Submission (Deepavali Charitable Trust) The overseas donee status of the four charitable entities to be added to Schedule 32 should be effective either from 1 April 2012 or from the date of Royal assent. Comment New Zealand organisations that support activities overseas and want their donors to be eligible for tax relief must be listed in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The bill provides that four charitable organisations be added to Schedule 32, with donee status effective from 1 April 2013. Officials consider that the application date of 1 April 2013 is appropriate. Additions to the list of overseas donee status have historically applied from the start of the income year. This is because the tax credit available for charitable donations is based on the donor’s annual taxable income. Officials do not support applying the changes from 1 April 2012 because donations made previously would qualify for donation tax credits, although donation receipts were not issued on that basis. Similarly, if a part-year application date applies, donors would have to identify whether donations were made after the date of Royal assent when claiming a donation tax credit at the end of the income tax year. This exposes donors to the risk of mistakenly claiming tax credits when no legal entitlement exists, and could be particularly problematic if a charitable organisation issues annual donation receipts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 NON-RESIDENT FILM RENTERS’ TAX Clauses 5, 12, 19, 56, 68, 72, 84, 88, 91, 92 and 93 Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal to repeal the non-resident film renters’ tax regime is not remedial in nature and therefore should be deferred pending further consultation through the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The ambit of the non-resident film renters’ tax regime may be wider than the definition of “royalty” in the Income Tax Act 2007. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment This proposal replaces the effective tax rate of 2.8% on income derived by non- resident companies renting films in New Zealand with non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The standard NRWT rate on royalties is 15%; however, the rate applying to most non-resident film renters would be 5% or 10% under New Zealand’s double tax agreements. The proposal was consulted through the GTPP as part of the Government discussion document, New Zealand’s International Tax Review: a direction for change, released in December 2006. Officials have also recently been in contact with those who made submissions on the discussion document about the proposal. The definition of “royalty” in section CC 9 of the Income Tax Act is widely drafted; for example, a payment for an outright sale of property is a royalty if the amount of the payment is based on the use of the property by the purchaser. Therefore, practically all amounts received by a non-resident that are currently subject to the non-resident film renters’ tax regime will come within the “royalty” definition and be subject to NRWT. The treatment of a specific transaction, however, is dependent on its particular facts. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 57 TIMING OF DETERMINING SERIOUS HARDSHIP Clause 131 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should be applied retrospectively to 1 December 2002. Comment The amendment ensures that when a taxpayer applies for serious hardship, the financial position considered by Inland Revenue is the financial position at the date the application for relief is made rather than at the time the tax became due. The debt rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply from 1 December 2002. In the period from 1 December 2002 to the enactment of this bill, there may be cases when serious hardship was determined at the time the tax became due rather than at the time the taxpayer applied for relief. Therefore, officials recommended that the amendment apply from the date of enactment of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 RATE FOR EXTINGUISHING TAX LOSSES WHEN TAX IS WRITTEN OFF Clause 132 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (KPMG) The submitter supports the proposal for Inland Revenue writing off tax losses at 28% (the company tax rate), when the taxpayer is a company. This matches the benefit a company would otherwise receive from use of such losses. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 59 RWT WITHHOLDING CERTIFICATES Clause 105 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter supports the proposal to retrospectively clarify that interest payers can make RWT withholding certificates available on their websites, as long as the recipient agrees to receive the certificate in that way. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 60 RWT EXEMPTION CERTIFICATES Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers who have RWT exemption certificates should not be required to reapply every year. The period that the certificate applies for should be extended. Comment Taxpayers who have been issued with a certificate of exemption are not required to have RWT withheld on their interest or dividend income. Taxpayers can apply to Inland Revenue for a certificate of exemption if they meet certain criteria (for example, if they are a bank, or if they earned over $2 million in their last income year and complied with their filing obligations). In most cases, Inland Revenue does not impose time limits on certificates of exemption. However, in certain limited circumstances Inland Revenue issues certificates of exemption for only one year. These circumstances are:  The taxpayer expects that their income will be above $2 million.  The taxpayer expects to have losses for a specific period of time.  The taxpayer expects to get an RWT refund of over $500 for a specific period of time. Taxpayers are required to provide certain information if they have been issued a certificate of exemption for one of these reasons. If a taxpayer is granted a certificate of exemption on the basis that they expect their income to be above $2 million in the following year, it is reasonable that this is checked by Inland Revenue. (If the taxpayer did in fact earn above $2 million in that year, they would be issued with a certificate of exemption without a time limit.) Inland Revenue can grant a certificate of exemption for a specific period of time if the taxpayer expects to have losses or to get an RWT refund of over $500 for that period. In these cases, the taxpayer is required to show budgeted accounts for the period. Taxpayers generally provide Inland Revenue with budgeted accounts for only a single year, which means that a certificate of exemption can be granted for only a single year. Given the above, officials consider that the current administrative practice is reasonable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 61 EMPLOYER SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION TAX Submissions (Investment Savings and Insurance Association, KPMG) Employers should have the option of applying progressive rates of employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) to employer superannuation contributions made on behalf of past employees. Comment Under the progressive ESCT rate structure, the contributing employer usually calculates the ESCT rate for each employee by reference to their salary or wages from that employment for the previous tax year. The aim is for employer superannuation contributions to be taxed at a proxy rate which is broadly equivalent to the employee’s marginal tax rate on their salary and wage income. In establishing the ESCT rate, the contributing employer does not have to consider any income that is not from that employment – for example, investment income or income from any other employment the employee may have. This is largely for practical and compliance reasons, as it enables the contributing employer to use information it already has available to select the right rate. In its current form, the progressive rate structure cannot be applied to past employees, for whom, by definition, the contributing employer does not have salary or wage information. So if the current method were applied, it would tend to lead to past employees being categorised within the lower ESCT rate bands, regardless of their actual current marginal tax rate. Both submitters refer to employers who have often applied the progressive rates of ESCT to contributions made on behalf of past employees. Officials are aware of some recent approaches to Inland Revenue seeking to adopt a progressive rate approach, but are not aware that it has actually been used in practice. 2 Applying ESCT at a flat rate of 33% to contributions for past employees has been the generally accepted and long-standing practice of employers, practitioners and Inland Revenue. Officials had considered the submitters’ suggestion of linking the ESCT rate to a past employee’s current total income instead. However, this would create a different basis on which to calculate the ESCT rate for contributions made on behalf of past employees vis-à-vis existing employees, for whom non-salary and wage income is ignored. It would require the past employee to provide his or her contributing employer with income information at the start of each tax year, which would impose a high compliance burden on employers and their past employees. 2 To be certain that taxpayers are not disadvantaged by the retrospective nature of this amendment the bill contains a “savings” clause which protects the positions previously taken by taxpayers, in the event that any taxpayers have previously not applied ESCT at this flat rate, or have applied fringe benefit tax (FBT) instead. 62 Using an approach based on the past employee’s total income to determine the ESCT rate creates difficulties when employer superannuation contributions are paid “for the benefit of a past employee”, but under the terms of the superannuation scheme benefit payments are being made to a dependent, such as a surviving spouse. In this situation it would not be possible to take into account the past employee’s income levels, but nor is it appropriate to calculate a progressive rate of ESCT in relation to the employer’s superannuation contributions by reference to the spouse’s current income. The submission suggests involving the superannuation scheme in collecting income information from past employees. Although many schemes will contact members at least annually, this contact is not necessarily reciprocal. Further, ESCT obligations apply to employers not superannuation schemes, so it is not appropriate to involve fund managers or trustees in the collection of this income information. Officials agree with the comment that superannuation contributions in respect of past employees occur almost entirely in the context of a defined benefit scheme. Using a flat ESCT rate will not usually affect the benefits received by scheme members from a defined benefit scheme, as the benefit levels are pre-set. The main reason the employer is required to pay employer superannuation cash contributions for past employees is because there is a scheme deficit in respect of these obligations. That is, insufficient contributions were made during the member’s working life to pay the benefits now due. Officials therefore considered the option of linking an ESCT rate to the member’s previous salary and wage levels, indexed, but this was considered likely to create a heavy compliance burden. Officials also note that, at the request of industry representatives, the Income Tax Act 2007 already has a provision to enable employer contributions made to defined benefit schemes to be taxed at a flat ESCT rate of 33%. This is because such contributions are not often easily allocable to any particular scheme member. Instead, they are generally based on an actuarial calculation of future liabilities to pay benefits to all members. Adopting the same flat rate for past employees assures consistency with this approach for defined benefit schemes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 63 COMMISSIONER’S DISCRETION TO NOT RULE ON SECTION GA 1 Clause 118, new section 91E(3B) Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) The Commissioner already has sufficient powers to decline to rule on any concerns that may arise. Sections 91E(3) and 91E(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 already give the Commissioner a discretion not to provide a ruling, or to preclude him from doing so, if doing so would require him to determine factual matters, or if insufficient information exists. If a ruling cannot be made without an investigation, the reason it is unable to be made is due to a lack of knowledge of factual matters. If the Commissioner is able to determine that an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement, he should also be able to determine the tax advantage to be counteracted. The proposed amendment would impose a blanket rule, effectively denying taxpayers the ability to require the Commissioner to rule on section GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Taxpayers who are prepared to use the rulings process are entitled to a full view of the risk they face if they decide to implement the arrangement. Allowing a discretion on whether to rule on section GA 1 may be detrimental to taxpayers who are denied a ruling and have no way of understanding the consequences of entering into an avoidance arrangement. The status quo should be maintained as it ensures certainty for taxpayers. The proposed discretion is unjustifiable, unnecessary and should not proceed. Comment The purpose of the binding rulings regime is to allow taxpayers who apply for a ruling to obtain certainty on how taxation laws apply to an arrangement disclosed to the Commissioner. In most cases such arrangements will be prospective. However, the rulings regime is not intended be a full-scale audit or investigation of the arrangement and the parties to it. This is a separate process which can result in a tax adjustment by the Commissioner. If the Commissioner rules that an arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement, the Commissioner may currently be asked by the applicant to rule on how section GA 1 will apply. Section GA 1 is the reconstruction provision which allows the Commissioner to adjust the taxable income of a person affected by an arrangement in order to counteract a tax advantage obtained under the arrangement. The proposed amendment would give the Commissioner a discretion to decide not to rule on the application of section GA 1. The proposed discretion is likely to be invoked in a minority of cases because it would require the Commissioner to take a position that an arrangement is avoidance and for a taxpayer (who is still determined 64 to enter into such an arrangement) to seek a ruling on how the reconstruction power will apply. In order to rule on section GA 1, the Commissioner will need to undertake a thorough investigation of the arrangement, including the persons who may be affected by the arrangement, and other likely situations which might have arisen had the tax avoidance arrangement not been entered into. This can often be a lengthy process and rulings are not intended to be investigations or audits, nor is it appropriate or feasible for the Commissioner to handle rulings in that way. Often, because of timing issues, the tax advantage will not have fully crystallised or be able to be properly quantified until a full audit or investigation occurs. A tax avoidance arrangement may affect more than one person. Accordingly, the Commissioner may need to adjust the taxable income of a number of people in order to appropriately counteract the tax advantages obtained. A taxpayer who is not a party to a tax avoidance arrangement can still be subject to the Commissioner's reconstruction power if they have obtained a tax advantage from the arrangement, even though they may not be aware that they have benefited from the arrangement. These matters can be difficult to determine using the binding rulings regime for complex arrangements involving multiple parties (who may not be applicants). This difficulty will be compounded if this involves prospective arrangements. If an applicant for a ruling were able to require the Commissioner to rule on section GA 1, the Commissioner would have to rely on information (if obtainable) provided by the applicant about these other persons. The binding rulings regime is not the most appropriate place to determine what corrective adjustments may be required to be made to all taxpayers who have benefited, or would benefit, from a tax avoidance arrangement. Requiring the Commissioner to make a ruling on section GA 1 may also give rise to a revenue risk should the Courts take a particular view on reconstruction that is less favourable than that obtained by ruling. The binding ruling would still be binding on the Commissioner if the arrangement was entered into, and could still be relied on by a taxpayer. In addition, officials are concerned that a ruling on section GA 1 could be used to attempt to constrain the Commissioner’s ability to argue on the appropriate reconstruction (following an audit and proper investigation) in the context of the tax disputes process. Given the difficulty of arguments regarding counterfactuals and reconstruction, this may be undesirable. Given these difficulties, officials do not consider that it will always be feasible or appropriate for the Commissioner to rule in a definitive and binding manner on the application of the reconstruction power. A discretion (rather than a requirement as submitted) is preferred by officials as, in straightforward cases, the Commissioner would be prepared to rule on the application of section GA 1. The existing powers that the Commissioner has to decline to rule cannot readily be used in the reconstruction context given that the level of enquiry required will be tantamount to requiring an “audit or investigation”. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 65 ADDITIONAL DECLARATION FOR ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENTS Clause 119, new section 91ED(1B) Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed amendment is not required and should not proceed. If Inland Revenue has concerns about the completeness of some advance pricing agreement applications and documentation packages, the Commissioner can ask an applicant for further relevant information, or ask an applicant to attend a meeting to answer questions and clarify any uncertainty. If facts contained in the application are found to be incorrect or if material facts have been omitted, the advance pricing agreement is void, so taxpayers gain nothing from not fully disclosing the relevant background. It is not clear how this provision will be applied in practice. What is the threshold for meeting the requirement that the information disclosed is comprehensive? This may result in applicants wanting to disclose every single aspect of the transaction, whether relevant to the advance pricing agreement or not. Comment The Tax Administration Act 1994 already requires an application for a private ruling to disclose all relevant facts, but in a number of applications the relevant facts are not outlined sufficiently for the purposes of providing a ruling. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to reduce the number of inaccurate or factually incomplete applications. Advance pricing agreements are fact-intensive and tax agents are often as dependent on information received from the taxpayer as Inland Revenue is. The amendment therefore requires the applicant, not the agent, to make the declaration as the person who is likely to have knowledge of the full and complete picture. The applicant will be required to attest that to the best of their knowledge and belief the information which is disclosed for the application is comprehensive. The amendment does not require the applicant to know everything, but is aimed at ensuring the applicant examines the application before it is submitted. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 66 CLASSIFICATION OF CHANGE TO FEES FOR BINDING RULINGS AND DEPRECIATION DETERMINATIONS AS REMEDIAL Clauses 172 and 180 Submission (KPMG) KPMG supports changing the fee structure for binding rulings to a “plus GST” basis. It also notes that Inland Revenue should be able to set its fees for issuing depreciation determinations having regard to current conditions. The classification of the changes to the fees charged for binding rulings and depreciation determinations as remedial items is misleading. It could have material financial consequences for taxpayers (as the cost of getting a depreciation determination will more than double) and may affect whether getting a depreciation determination is a viable option. Comment The binding ruling fees are being increased slightly, mainly to reflect the GST increase to 15% on 1 October 2010. The depreciation determination fees are being raised to reflect more accurately the costs currently associated with making determinations. The fees for depreciation determinations have not been changed since their introduction in 1993 although the costs of providing determinations have risen. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 67 PIE REMEDIALS Issue: Application of the foreign investor tax credit regime to foreign investment PIEs Submissions (KPMG, Fonterra) The foreign investor tax credit (FITC) regime should be made available to investors in foreign investment PIEs. This would allow certain non-resident investors to receive similar treatment on imputed dividends earned through PIEs as they would have received if they had made the investment directly. Comment The FITC rules allow certain foreign portfolio investors that receive imputed dividends from New Zealand companies to claim credits for NRWT in their own country, while ensuring that New Zealand receives an appropriate amount of tax. Officials agree that the FITC regime be made available to investors in foreign investment PIEs. Applying the FITC regime to foreign investment PIEs would align the tax treatment of non-resident portfolio investments made through foreign investment PIEs with that of portfolio investments made directly. Key aspects of the proposal are that:  the FITC mechanism applies at the level of the company paying the dividend to the foreign investment PIE, rather than the PIE;  the foreign investment PIE must supply the company paying the dividend the necessary information in order for the company to appropriately apply the FITC rules;  the FITC mechanism only applies to notified foreign investors that hold less than a 10 percent voting interest in the company paying the dividend and have a tax treaty rate of 15 percent or greater; and  the mechanism is optional for foreign investment PIEs. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and that this change apply from the 2013–14 income year. 68 Issue: Definition of the foreign PIE equivalent Submission (KPMG) The foreign investment PIE equivalent definition should be amended to include an Australian managed investment trust (MIT) as a qualifying entity. Comment Officials agree that the definition of a foreign PIE equivalent should be amended to include a MIT, provided the MIT is not a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. A foreign PIE equivalent is, broadly, a non-resident entity that would be eligible to be a PIE if it were resident in New Zealand. Foreign PIE equivalents are able to hold 100 percent of a New Zealand-resident PIE, and vice versa. This is subject to non-tax regulation, including the requirements of the Overseas Investment Office. MITs are subject to similar or more stringent investment and investor restrictions as New Zealand PIEs and would therefore meet the definition of a foreign PIE equivalent. Further, including MITs within the definition of a foreign PIE equivalent would reduce the continued compliance costs of PIEs monitoring whether entities are foreign PIE equivalents. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Optional look-through rules for PIEs Clause 41 Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) Clause 41 should be amended to ensure that where a retail foreign investment variable rate PIE invests into a wholesale foreign investment PIE the flow-through rules work appropriately. In particular, the drafting of the provision should be amended to refer to “amounts derived by the wholesale PIE” instead of “amounts paid to the wholesale PIE”. In addition, the proposed rule that would allow retail PIEs a deduction for expenditure incurred by the wholesale PIE should be clarified to ensure that it achieves what is intended. 69 Comment The rules are intended to allow retail PIEs to treat amounts that are derived by wholesale PIEs as if they had been derived by the retail PIE. Similarly, the rules are also intended to allow expenditure incurred by the wholesale PIE to be treated as if had been incurred by the retail PIE. Officials agree that the wording of section HM 6B should be clarified to ensure that the rules achieve these results. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and that this change apply from the 2012–13 income year – the start-date for foreign investment variable-rate PIEs. Issue: Investments of foreign investment PIEs Submission (KPMG) The current drafting of section HM 13(6) has greater application than was intended as it may also apply to non-land portfolio investment entities and PIEs. Comment Officials consider that it is clear from the legislation that a foreign investment PIE is able to hold a greater than 20 percent interest in another PIE. This ensures that foreign investment PIEs can invest in wholesale PIEs. Therefore, officials do not agree that an amendment to the legislation is necessary. This policy intention can be confirmed from a release of an item in a Tax Information Bulletin. The submitter has also raised some useful comments in relation to the current rules that place restrictions on the level of ownership a foreign investment PIE can have in other widely held entities. These restrictions are in place as a result of concerns that foreign investment PIEs could find methods to transfer otherwise non-deductible expenditure to an entity it owns that is able to use the deduction. The submitter questions whether these restrictions are appropriate. A comprehensive review of these restrictions is not possible as part of this tax bill, but could be considered as part of a future tax bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 70 Issue: Tax rebates on partial redemptions Submission (KPMG) PIEs should be allowed to trigger a tax event when there is a partial redemption of a PIE interest. Currently PIEs are allowed to make voluntary payments towards their final tax when an investor makes a partial redemption. In these situations the PIE should also be allowed a rebate for any tax losses or excess credits crystallised by the partial redemption. Comment Officials agree. This clarification would ensure that the law reflects existing practice. However, also consistent with existing practice, this treatment should be allowed only if the PIE adopts a consistent approach to partial redemptions. That is, the PIE makes a voluntary payment when there is tax to pay and receives a rebate when there are losses or excess credits. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exit rules for PIEs Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It should be clarified that an entity ceases to be eligible to be a PIE if it fails to satisfy the entity-type requirements in section HM 9 and the rules in section HM 17 that prevent PIEs streaming different types of income to different investors to minimise tax. Comment Officials agree that the provisions should be amended to clarify that a PIE ceases to be a PIE immediately if it fails to meet the requirements in sections HM 9 and HM 17. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 71 Issue: Technical drafting amendments Submitters and officials have technical suggestions that fix a number of errors with the bill and the current PIE rules. Officials agree with these submissions unless otherwise stated. These are outlined below:  Section HM 14(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to refer to a “listed PIE” instead of “a company listed on a recognised exchange in New Zealand”. (KPMG)  Section HM 19C(1) should be amended to replace the reference to “section HM 11(a) and (d)” with “section HM 11(1)(a) and (d)”. (KPMG)  Section HM 19C(2) should be amended to replace the reference to “section HM 12(a) and (b)(iv) and (v)” with “ section HM 12(1)(a) and (b)(iv) and (v)”. (KPMG)  The restriction on availability of a tax credit for a foreign investment PIE in section HM 47(6) should be noted in section HM 55. (KPMG) Officials do not agree that this amendment is necessary. Section HM 47(6) restricts the ability of foreign investment PIEs to have a credit and it is not necessary to repeat this restriction in section HM 55.  Paragraph (a) of the section YA 1 definition of “fixed-rate share” should be amended to clarify that the definition also applies for the purposes of section CX 55(4). (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants)  Schedule 6, table 1B, row 2 should also refer to row 7.  Foreign investment PIEs are not allowed deductions for expenses or credits in relation to “notified foreign investors”. This treatment should also apply to transitional residents who have elected a zero percent tax rate with the PIE. (Matter raised by officials)  The definition of “foreign investment zero-rate PIE”, paragraph (a): should read “... section HM 19B (Modified rules for foreign investment zero-rate PIEs)”. (Matter raised by officials)  The definition of “foreign investment variable rate PIE”, para (a): should read “... section HM 19C (Modified rules for foreign investment variable rate PIEs)”. (Matter raised by officials)  Section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to ensure that foreign investment zero-rate PIEs are not required to file a return with Inland Revenue for exiting investors if the only exiting investors are notified foreign investors. Information relevant to exiting notified foreign investors would be included in the end-of-year return that the PIE is required to provide to Inland Revenue. (Matter raised by officials) 72 DEFINITION OF “HIRE PURCHASE AGREEMENT” Issue: Fundamental change in GST policy Clauses 88(9), (10) and 168 Submission (Brent Gilchrist) There is no drafting error in the definition of “hire purchase agreement” so far as the definition applies to GST land transactions. Generally, a person who buys and sells residential homes can claim GST on purchases and pay GST on sales. However, the proposed amendment will result in a fundamental change in GST policy – the person will be required to pay GST on sales upfront if a tenancy agreement includes an option to buy the property. The issue is more than remedial in nature and should be withdrawn pending proper review of its effect on businesses. Comment Officials note that the proposed amendment to the definition of “hire purchase agreement” in the Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007 is simply intended to correct a drafting error from the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994, so that the definition remains consistent with longstanding case law. The matter raised by the submitter relates to a policy concern about whether the definition should apply to GST land transactions – the GST Act relies largely on the Income Tax Act definition of “hire purchase agreement”. Officials are aware that there are different views on this matter and are currently reviewing the GST policy in this area. As the GST issue relates in part to the definition of “hire purchase agreement”, officials consider that the proposed amendments to that definition, contained in the bill, should be withdrawn so that the policy and drafting issues can be considered together. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 73 Issue: Exclude real property for income tax and GST purposes Clauses 88(9), (10) and 168 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “hire purchase agreement” in the Income Tax Acts 2004 and 2007 should be further amended to clarify that it does not include real property for income tax and GST purposes. Comment The proposed amendments to correct a drafting error are being withdrawn by officials so that the policy issue of whether the definition should apply to GST land transactions and the drafting error can be considered together. Whether the definition should explicitly exclude real property for income tax purposes will also be considered as part of this review. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 74 LOOK-THROUGH COMPANIES Overview of submissions Seven submissions were received on the look-through company (LTC) amendments proposed in the bill and in Supplementary Order Paper 1. Some technical issues were raised on the drafting, particularly in the Supplementary Order Paper. A number of further amendments are recommended by officials to clarify the intent of the proposed legislation. NZICA made two submissions. The first submission contained comments on the loss limitation rules which officials consider were largely addressed by the amendments proposed in Supplementary Order Paper 1, which was tabled on 8 February 2012. NZICA subsequently made a second submission on Supplementary Order Paper 1 which officials have treated as replacing the comments made on the loss limitation rules in their first submission. Several of the submissions commented on the process by which the original LTC rules were introduced by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act in late 2010. This followed the announcement in Budget 2010 that the existing qualifying company and loss-attributing qualifying company (LAQC) rules would be replaced by a full look-through tax treatment. Issue: Approach to transparent taxation provisions generally Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A single set of look-through provisions should apply, rather than a separate subpart for partnerships and for LTCs. Specific restrictions on entry qualifications could be included as needed, depending on the underlying common-law status of the entity involved. The “separate capacity” approach that is used in both the LTC and the partnership legislation is unclear. The interaction between the different statuses of a partnership/partner, or LTC/shareholder, and the partner or shareholder in a personal capacity should be specifically addressed in the various tax provisions. For example, clarification should be provided on the operation of the transparent taxation approach to:  the resident mining companies and resident mining operator rules;  local authority shareholders in LTCs; 3  transactions between a partnership/LTC and a partner/shareholder; 3 Officials note that a local authority cannot be a shareholder in an LTC, as a local authority is neither a natural person nor a trustee (in its capacity as a local authority) so the status issue as set out in the submission could not arise in practice. 75  the financial arrangement rules and the forgiveness of debt; and  the disposal of interests in a transparent entity when deemed to be the disposal of the underlying assets. The legislation should be more comprehensive on the extent of transparent taxation provisions in each circumstance. More guidance should be provided by Inland Revenue on the application of a transparent taxation approach. Comment Officials understand the submissions to be seeking a complete review of the transparent tax rules for partnerships and LTCs. A review of all tax transparency rules would require considerable resources which are not currently provided for in the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme. The submissions raise some very technical aspects about the interaction of a transparent approach with other specific tax provisions – for example, the issue raised on the application of the resident mining companies and resident mining operator rules concerns the specific loss ring-fencing rules that are applied to that particular industry, rather than the transparency provisions in general. Some of these issues arise only with LTCs, because of the underlying existence of a company, but some may apply to limited partnerships (LPs), which also have a separate legal existence, and general partnerships too. At present, officials would not support a comprehensive rewrite of the overall legislative approach to the taxation of partnerships and LTCs. The “capacity” approach used in the Income Tax Act 2007 merely encapsulates key concepts of transparency that have been in place internationally for many decades, primarily in the form of partnerships. For the most part, the current legislation simply codifies or modifies aspects of this capacity approach as necessary. Officials accept there are discrete areas where the interaction of a transparent tax approach with other specific tax provisions could be further reviewed to ensure they operate together more seamlessly. However, outside of these specific technical areas, the general transparent tax approach used for LTCs works well for straightforward, small business enterprises. Officials will consider the comments about providing more guidance by Inland Revenue on the practical aspects of transparent tax treatment for partnerships/partners and LTCs/shareholders. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 76 Issue: Tax transparency and withholding provisions Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The reference to withholding taxes as they apply to LTCs should be removed from the opening language of section HB 1 as it is unnecessary, confusing and potentially harmful. Comment The submission refers to the opening language of section HB 1(1), which ensures that withholding tax obligations are applied to LTCs – that is, it ignores tax transparency. These provisions are necessary to allow payers making payments to the LTC to consider only the status of the LTC. Without them, taxpayers would have to consider the status of each of the underlying shareholders in the LTC, which is not generally feasible. The same outcome is achieved for partnerships by way of specific provisions in the withholding tax rules. Similarly, the opening wording means that the obligation to withhold taxes from payments made falls on the LTC. This is primarily for administrative simplicity as the LTC handles all withholding and paying obligations under these rules. Officials note that there is no risk of economic double taxation of income derived through an LTC and later distributed to shareholders, because the LTC is not treated as paying “dividends” when it makes a distribution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Look-through companies – elections and methods Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendment to clarify that elections and methods relating to an LTC are made by the company should not proceed, as the matter can be addressed through guidance. “Methods” should be a specifically defined term. (KPMG) 77 Comment The amendment clarifies the treatment of tax elections and valuations carried out for tax administration purposes in relation to the assets of an LTC. It is considered necessary to make a specific provision for LTCs because, although they are taxed as transparent entities, and so are akin to partnerships, legally LTCs are separate entities and as such hold legal title to the assets. This is in contrast to a general partnership, where title is held by each partner, usually on a joint and several basis. The partners of a partnership generally have the right to be involved with all of the partnership’s business. The shareholders of an LTC do not have this right in their capacity as a shareholder; the day-to-day operation of the LTC’s business is the responsibility of the LTC’s directors. In some cases a shareholder will also act as a director, but not in all cases. Thus, although the partnership and LTC rules have been deliberately written to mirror each other as far as possible, some variations are inevitable to deal with differences in their underlying legal structure and form. The amendment applies in respect of elections and valuation and timing methods relating to LTC property and income. Although not defined in the Income Tax Act, the terms “election” or “method” are used directly in the relevant sections of the Act, and as such are defined by conventional usage. An example is the valuation of livestock, for which section EC 11 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides three valuation methods. Under the current legislation, the shareholders must agree jointly which valuation method to apply, but then each shareholder is obliged to sign an election for this chosen method. In many cases the shareholder may not be directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the LTC; from an administrative perspective it would be the director or other relevant officer of the company who makes these elections for the LTC’s livestock. The amendment will also ensure that, under the depreciation rules, an election to treat the LTC’s depreciable property as not being depreciable property is made by the LTC and applied by all shareholders, otherwise each shareholder could make a different election in relation to their portion of the same depreciable property. This would create huge compliance complexities and tax return discrepancies. The amendment has deliberately been drafted to exclude “tax positions” that are neither elections nor valuations, because tax positions should be taken by a taxpayer. The LTC is not a taxpayer; the transparency rules mean that its shareholders are the taxpayers. Tax positions include provisions relating to whether an individual is a “cash basis” person (section EW 54(1)), and whether the cost of a person’s attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (FIF) is more than $50,000 (sections CQ 5 and DN 6). Tax positions must take into account a shareholder’s interests outside of the LTC – for example, any attributing interests in a FIF that are held by the shareholder in a personal capacity, as well as their attributed interests via the LTC. Officials note that the full transparent approach applies to tax elections and valuations in relation to LPs. Like LTCs, but unlike general partnerships, LPs are separate legal entities, and limited partners cannot play any active role in the partnership’s business. Officials consider that there may be some merit in reviewing this position to consider when an LTC-style approach might be more appropriate for an LP. This review will take some time to complete, and is subject to available resources. However, it could 78 be carried out separately so as not to delay these LTC amendments, which are helpful to LTC shareholders. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Guidance on the amendments will be released in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin. Issue: Working owners and fringe benefit tax Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A “working owner” of an LTC should have the option to be subject to either the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules or to treat expenditure on the provision of a benefit as private expenditure and so non-deductible. LTCs must comply with the reporting requirements in the Companies Act 1993 and the Financial Reporting Act 1993 to provide a “true and fair view” of the company’s position. If benefits are treated as distributions for income tax purposes, and made non-deductible, the income tax consequences will differ from the position portrayed in the financial statements. The proposed amendment should apply prospectively from the date of enactment and not retrospectively from 1 April 2011. Comment Although a company at general law, a look-through company is a creation of the Income Tax Act 2007 – that is, it “exists” as an LTC for income tax purposes only. It is therefore unavoidable that there will be some divergence between accounts it must prepare as a company under the Companies Act, and the income tax approach and consequences for it and its shareholders resulting from its transparent tax status. An LTC cannot “employ” its shareholders for income tax purposes, because under the principles of transparency, each shareholder is effectively treated as self-employed; they receive the income and the deductions of the business personally. Any money or benefits the shareholder draws from the business are not generally relevant to their tax position. This is exactly the same for a general partner. To simplify administration for an LTC, the Income Tax Act allows a shareholder to choose to be treated as a “working owner”, so that regular payments made to that shareholder can be treated as salary or wages and the LTC can apply the PAYE rules. There is a similar long-standing provision for partnerships and “working partners”. The amendments in the bill do not change the FBT position for working owners. Officials consider that even under the current legislation for LTCs, the FBT rules do not apply. However, the LTC legislation for working owners is drafted differently 79 from the “working partner” legislation. Although there is no particular reason for this difference, it has led practitioners to query the difference in style. The amendments simply ensure that the LTC legislation is written in the same style as the longer- standing partnership legislation, to aid readers’ understanding. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “employer” and “employee” Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The current definitions of “employer” and “employee” in the Income Tax Act 2007 are insufficient. The definitions aim to exclude certain taxpayers from the definition for FBT purposes, which is consistent with the policy of treating such benefits as distributions of profits – for example, it excludes partnerships in relation to their working partners and LTCs in relation to their working owners. However, the current drafting of the definition of “employer” does not appear to exclude partnerships or LTCs if they make PAYE income payments to other employees (employees who are not working partners or working owners). The drafting of the definition of “employee” also does not appear to exclude working partners or working owners if they receive PAYE income payments from another source (other than the partnership or LTC). Comment The parts of the employer and employee definitions referred to in this submission are not being amended by this bill. However, officials do not agree with the analysis of these definitions. Whether a benefit is provided to a person under the FBT rules is established by the relationship between each individual recipient and the provider of the benefit. The fact that a partnership/LTC may have employees who are not working partners/owners does not prevent subparagraph (c)(i) of the definition of employer applying when considering the position of that partnership/LTC and a working partner/owner for FBT purposes. The fact that a working partner/owner may have another employment relationship elsewhere is not an issue that the partnership/LTC has to consider. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 80 Issue: Benefits provided to employee’s associates Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section GB 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure that the provision does not unintentionally apply to fringe benefits provided to working owners who are associated with non-working owner-employees of an LTC, or working partners of a partnership who are associated with a non-working partner employees of a partnership. Comment Section GB 32 applies if a benefit is provided by an employer to a person who is associated with an employee, and would have been a fringe benefit if provided to the employee. This is an anti-avoidance provision. Although this section is not being amended by this bill, officials agree with the points made in this submission and consider the opportunity could be taken to address this issue at the same time that other FBT-related legislation for transparent entities is being re-drafted. The correct outcome should be that, if a benefit is provided to a working owner of an LTC, or a working partner of a partnership, who is associated with an employee (who is not themselves a working owner or partner) of that LTC or partnership, the benefit should not be treated as though it is provided by the LTC or partnership (as employer) to the employee. Instead it should be considered as a distribution to that working partner or working owner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Aggregation of look-through counted owners Submission (nsaTax) The changes to the definition of “relative” will mean that a number of LTCs will cease to qualify as a result of the look-through counted owner test no longer being satisfied, because under the revised relative definition trustee shareholders and their beneficiaries will count as two counted owners, not one. 81 Comment Officials note that the current definition of “relative” does not connect trustees and beneficiaries directly. So under the current legislation, trustees and beneficiaries are not generally considered to be a single look-counted owner under the current rules. Further, all beneficiaries who derive as beneficiary income, income from the LTC will each be regarded as a look-through counted owner. Beneficiaries will only be aggregated and counted as one look-through counted owner to the extent that the beneficiaries themselves are relatives. The LTC rules are intended for closely held businesses, so provide that an LTC must have five or fewer look-through counted owners. For the purposes of determining the number of look-through counted owners however, the shareholdings of relatives (for example, spouses, siblings, grandparents and grandchildren) are aggregated so that together they are treated as one look-through counted owner. An LTC can, therefore, have quite a large number of shareholders within these familial connections. The amendment means that, for the purposes of the LTC rules, the interests of the trustees of a trust are not aggregated with another shareholder merely because that shareholder is a relative of a beneficiary of the trust. This inadvertent connection of trustees with relatives of beneficiaries greatly increases the complexity and scope of the look-through counted owners test. Officials note that in practice there are usually other familial connections between trustee shareholders, trust beneficiaries and any other shareholder that will bring them within the “five or fewer” look-through counted owners requirements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Commencement date of amendments Submission (Ernst & Young) The commencement date for the amendment to section HB 11(7)(a) of the LTC loss limitation rules should not be earlier than 1 April 2011. The proposed 1 April 2011 commencement for any changes to the partnership loss limitation rules in section HG 11(12) needs to be clarified in relation to partners’ prior and current income years and any unfiled returns of income. A savings provisions may be required to protect limited partner taxpayers. Comment The commencement dates referred to are both drafting errors. 82 Officials agree that the commencement date for the amendment to the LTC rules should be 1 April 2011. The commencement date for the majority of changes to the partnership rules was intended to be 1 April 2012, to avoid difficulties with partnership returns already filed using the existing calculations. There are two exceptions when the proposed amendments apply from 1 April 2008, being the start of the limited partnership rules. The first exception is the clarification to the definition of “capital contribution”, which officials consider simply states the existing position more explicitly, for taxpayer ease of use. The second exception is the clarification of the inclusion of excess FIF dividends within the “income” item of the loss limitation formula. This corrects a legislative drafting error to ensure that this provision operates as intended, and delivers the outcome that, in practice, it had been understood to achieve. Both are taxpayer positive. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Look-through company elections and revocations Submission (Ernst & Young) Taxpayers’ decisions on whether to use the LTC rules may have been influenced by the definition of “secured amounts”. These taxpayers should be able to make a late election or revocation of LTC status. Comment Officials do not agree that late elections or revocations should be permitted as it would be impossible to confine these only to the circumstances when the “secured amounts” calculation was the prime motivating factor in a taxpayer’s decision-making process. The majority of the proposed changes to the “secured amounts” definition are to simplify and broaden the application of the rules in line with the original policy intention, and are in the taxpayer’s favour. Officials do not consider that taxpayers would have based their decision to use the LTC rules solely on the basis of the extent of the owner’s basis they could establish by virtue of guarantees provided in respect of the company’s debt. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 83 Issue: Inclusion of dividends from a foreign investment fund as income in the loss limitation formula Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The inclusion of the “difference” between FIF distributions and attributed FIF income does not adequately address situations when there is a FIF loss. Also, when the FIF dividends received are less than FIF income, the inclusion of the “difference” could reflect some double counting. Comment This amendment corrects an error in the original legislation to ensure that this provision operates as intended and delivers the outcome that, in practice, it had been understood to achieve. The policy intention has always been that when a shareholder or partner’s proportionate share of the dividend actually distributed by a FIF is higher than their amount of FIF income as calculated using the shareholder/partner’s chosen FIF calculation method, the difference should be added to their “income” for the purposes of the loss limitation formula, because they are at economic risk for these dividends. In the case of a FIF loss being calculated under the FIF rules but FIF dividends being received, the actual dividend amount should be counted. Officials agree that the drafting should be clarified to confirm that the section applies only when there is an “excess” of FIF dividends received over FIF income, and that when there is a FIF loss only, the positive dividend amount is counted. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Inclusion of capital improvement costs as income in the loss limitation formula Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Capital improvement costs should be reflected in the loss limitation formula because they represent an increase in the asset base of the LTC, and so are an amount for which a shareholder is at risk. 84 Comment The policy objective for the loss limitation formula is to measure an individual’s economic risk exposure – that is, the amount they have personally put in to the LTC (or stand liable for in the case of a guarantee or indemnity for the LTCs debt). Extending this to include capital improvements that are funded by the company would not be consistent with this policy, as these improvements have not increased the economic investment made by, or risk exposure of, the shareholder. The submission draws an analogy with realised capital gains. Realised gains are included in the formula because the shareholder could draw these down as dividends; if the gains remain in the company the individual has foregone access to this money. That is not the case with internal revaluations or expenditure reflected in capital improvements. Officials note that to the extent that capital improvements are funded by the company directly from retained profit, the income that produced that profit will previously have been counted in the loss limitation formula. The realised capital gain/loss items in the formula effectively take into account, at point of realisation, expenditure on capital improvements that would not previously have been recognised for income purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Secured amounts and loans made by a shareholder Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An LTC shareholder can only include a guarantee within their “secured amounts” items if those secured amounts are not accounted for by another person that is another shareholder. It is unclear how a shareholder would know how another shareholder has treated this secured amount for tax purposes. Comment The “secured amounts” definition concerns guarantees made by a shareholder in relation to an LTC’s debt. It excludes a guarantee made by one shareholder (the guarantor shareholder) in relation to a loan given by another shareholder (the creditor shareholder) to the LTC, because that loan amount will be counted by the creditor shareholder directly in determining their owner’s basis. If the guaranteed amount were also included by the guarantor shareholder as a secured amount it would result in the same amount being double counted. It also opens up avoidance opportunities by “reciprocal” loans and guarantees being made by shareholders of the same LTC. 85 Officials do not consider there will be any difficulty with either shareholder knowing about the existence of the loan or guarantee in this circumstance, because the guarantor shareholder will have provided the guarantee to the creditor shareholder. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “guarantor” – LTCs Submissions (nsaTax, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of “guarantor” should aggregate the shareholder, and all their associates who have provided a guarantee for the same debt, as one single guarantor. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) A guarantor means a person who has an effective look-through interest for the LTC. (nsaTax) Comment The new definition of “guarantor” does provide for the aggregation of a shareholder, and all their associates who have provided a guarantee for the same debt, as one single guarantor. Although in most cases this means that a guarantor will be a shareholder, the second part of the definition covers circumstances when there is a guarantee provided by a third party who is neither a shareholder nor an associate of a shareholder. In this situation the denominator figure for “guarantors” by which the amount of debt secured by guarantee is divided recognises this third-party guarantee. The policy rationale is that the presence of this third-party guarantor reduces the economic risk exposure of the shareholders who have provided a guarantee. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 86 Issue: Definition of “guarantor” – partner’s associate Submissions (Ernst & Young, Meridian Energy) Where a limited partner is a company and all guarantors are members of the same wholly owned group of companies as the limited partner, the limited partner and all guarantors should be collectively treated as one guarantor. (Meridian Energy) Companies that are not limited partners but are partly owned by the same group as a company that is a limited partner should also be counted with the single guarantor. (Ernst & Young) Comment The definition of “partner’s associate” as it relates to companies in the same wholly owned group as the partner is not changed by the bill. These will be collectively treated as one guarantor with the relevant limited partner(s). Members of partly owned groups are not currently included in the definition of “partner’s associate”. The definition applies only to companies in the same wholly owned group. Part-ownership means others outside of the company’s economic group are sharing the risk exposure from the guarantee, and so are reducing the economic exposure/risk of the limited partners (and their associates) who have also provided a guarantee. As such, it is consistent with the policy approach to third-party guarantors that these partially owned companies should be reflected as separate guarantors. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Definition of “recourse property” Submissions (Ernst & Young, Meridian Energy, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) “Recourse property” means property to which a creditor has recourse to enforce a guarantee or indemnity for a debt, if the guarantee or indemnity expressly provides recourse to “only” that property. The word “only” should be removed as it implies that the provision will not apply if the creditor has limited surety over two or more properties. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 87 The “secured amounts” definition uses a “lesser of (a) or (b) approach; it is unclear how this approach operates when there is no comparator in (b) – that is, there is no recourse property. It should be clarified whether the amount is “zero” or whether this part of the definition does not apply. Comment The inclusion of the word “only” is pivotal to the definition of “recourse property”. It ensures that the guaranteed amount is restricted in situations when the creditor’s recourse is restricted to identified assets – for example, the terms of a guarantee may be restricted to allow a creditor recourse against the guarantor’s share portfolio and rental bach, but not his family house. If the combined values of that share portfolio and bach are less than the amount of debt guaranteed, the guarantor is only “at risk” up to the value of the share portfolio and bach and so only the value of the share portfolio and bach should be included in the owner’s basis. Officials consider that the word “applicable” in the proposed amendment is sufficiently clear to provide that when there is no recourse property the paragraph of the definition dealing with recourse property is “not applicable”. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Attribution of secured amounts when there is no recourse property – pro rating Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The “secured amounts” definition should pro-rate the amount of the guarantee based on the particular LTC shareholder’s share of the guarantee or indemnity, rather than averaging, as this better reflects their proportion of economic risk. This definition should use the same proportional attribution method used for “recourse property” in situations when more than one shareholder has provided a guarantee for the same debt. Comment In some situations more than one shareholder may provide a guarantee for the same amount of a debt. The amount of the debt that both shareholders have guaranteed is apportioned between each guarantor on an equal split basis. Any debt amounts that are not covered by more than one shareholder’s guarantee will not be apportioned. 88 The total economic risk is only the amount of the debt guaranteed. The policy rationale for an equal split basis is that each shareholder has full and equal exposure under the guarantee to the extent they have guaranteed the same debt amount. Averaging the guaranteed debt amount to each shareholder is the equitable way to account for this shared risk. The shareholders’ respective level of shareholding in the LTC is not relevant to the risk exposure under a separate guarantee. There is no recourse property so the “proportion of ownership interests in the recourse property approach” is not a suitable apportionment mechanism. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Attribution of secured amounts when there is recourse property – clarification Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, nsaTax, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of “secured amounts” should set out how the value of recourse property should be “attributed” to a shareholder. It should particularly set out the position in situations when the recourse property is offered under a guarantee or indemnity provided by an associate so that the shareholder himself or herself has no ownership interest in the recourse property. Comment If the same recourse property is used as security by more than one guarantor making a limited recourse guarantee, then it is their proportional interests in the recourse property that should be attributed to them. For example, a guarantor may provide a guarantee limiting recourse to a piece of land held as tenant-in-common. The guarantor’s economic exposure under the guarantee is reflected by their percentage ownership interest in the land (recourse property), so this should also carry through to be their secured amount. If the ownership interest is on a joint tenancy basis, the “proportion” of a person’s interests in that recourse property will be divided equally by the number of joint tenants who have an interest in that same property. Officials agree that the proportional attribution could be more clearly set out in the legislation. The term “recourse property” is defined by reference to the “relevant debt”, which therefore includes debts for which an associate provides a guarantee or indemnity. These are aggregated together as a single guarantor in the new definition of “guarantor”. The interests of the associate in the recourse property are therefore treated as the shareholder’s interests for these purposes. In the case of more than one association, the interests will be equally shared among all shareholders who have an association with the person providing the guarantee. Officials consider the current 89 drafting achieves this first outcome, but on the second, officials agree that it could be improved to address more explicitly the approach to proportional attribution where an associate of more than one shareholder provides a guarantee or indemnity, if this will help taxpayer understanding. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Application of initial basis provisions Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is uncertainty between the interaction of section HZ 4C(1), which provides that the section applies in the “transitional year”, and section HZ 4C(2) which is to be used when applying sections HB 11 and HB 12 not only in the transitional income year, but also in later years. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendments should be made in section HB 11 – for example, section HB 11(5)(a) should be amended to refer to either the transitional value as determined under subpart HZ or the market value of a person’s shares in the LTC at the time when the person purchases or subscribes for them. Comment Officials do not agree that there is any divergence between subsections (1) and (2) of section HZ 4C. “When” may be used to convey the section’s application “if” there is a situation in which a qualifying company has first become an LTC for the transitional year. Therefore it does not affect the application of section HZ 4C(2) to both the transitional income year and later years, as necessary. In any case, section HZ 4C(2) is specific about when it applies, so there is no doubt about its application Section HB 11 contains the primary loss limitation formula, which applies to all look- through companies, not just those that have transitioned from being a qualifying company. Therefore, the amendments are made not in section HB 11, but to subpart HZ because that specifically deals with these transitioning qualifying companies. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 90 Issue: Calculation of initial basis for a qualifying company using the market value or the accounting book value method Submission (Ernst & Young) Section HZ 4C should not preclude the addition of any further investment amount arising from transactions or events occurring after the start of the transitional year, so that the year-end balance date amounts may be truly representative of a taxpayer’s investment. It should also be clear that year-end amounts are included for items referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of section HB 11(5). The proposed amendments relating to capital gain amounts and capital loss amounts which require any calculations of those amounts to be changed to account for the opening valuation of the “investments” are complex and will lead to uncertainty. Comment The amendments to section HZ 4C relates to investment amounts in section HB 11(5)(a) only in terms of valuing shares on the last day of the income year before the transitional year. Further investment amounts arising from transactions or events occurring after during the transitional year, or any later year, will be included in the formula under the primary provision at section HB 11(5)(a). The amendments mean that section HZ 4C no longer includes items referred to section HB 11(5) (b) or (c) because these are valued when applying the formula on the last day of the transitional income year, and each later year in which the company is an LTC, not before. It is necessary to adjust for the inclusion of values in the initial basis that relate to internal revaluation reserves (both increases and decreases) when these eventually are realised as capital gain or loss amounts, otherwise there would be double counting or under-valuation of an owner’s basis in later years. This does require detailed calculations, but the rules already require a shareholder to calculate and apportion a capital gain or loss on assets when realised, for the purposes of applying the loss limitation formula. Shareholders will also have access to the company records detailing the revaluation of assets before the company transitioned into the LTC rules. This will enable the necessary adjustment to be made to reflect the revaluation adopted in their “initial basis”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 91 Issue: Drafting amendments Submissions (nsaTax, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The drafting of section HB 11(8)(a) should be clarified, to remove the repetition of the expression “by virtue of section HB 1” which serves no useful purpose. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The phrase “net of higher ranking calls” is not defined. (nsaTax) Comment Officials do not consider that these provisions as currently drafted are unclear. The current wording meets the policy intent and no amendment is necessary. Although not a defined term, officials consider that the phrase “net of higher ranking calls” is sufficiently defined by conventional and commercial use; the proposed alternative does not enhance the current drafting. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 92 THE TAX SYSTEM Submission (Andrew Sheldon Crooks) The submitter disagrees with the current system of government in New Zealand and the basis on which tax is levied. Comment The matter raised in the submission is not in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 93 HARDCOPY RETURNS Clause 110 Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The change is supported. (KPMG) The provision should not specify who should sign the return, as this would be more consistent with the rules that apply to paper-based returns. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comments The amendment is to clarify that an agent or a taxpayer can sign the hardcopy of a return filed electronically. Officials agree that there should be symmetry between paper returns and electronic returns whenever possible and are therefore comfortable with the NZICA submission that the signatory need not be specified. Recommendation That the KPMG submission be noted and the NZICA submission be accepted. 94 TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE LIFE INSURANCE TRANSITIONAL RULES Clauses 2(16), 26 and 27 Issue: Support for proposed changes Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The changes to the transitional rules for life insurance are supported, including backdating the changes to the start of the new life insurance taxation rules. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Scope of proposed change Submission (KPMG) The scope of the proposed change should also include the transitional rule that provides that premium increases on pre-1 July 2009 participating policies to meet increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) do not affect the grandparented status of the policy. Comment The transitional rules for profit participation life insurance policies provide for a simpler calculation of taxable income. The simplified calculation applies to participating life policies sold on or before 30 June 2009 – known as “old life policies”. Profit participating life policies sold after that date are taxed using a more comprehensive measure of income as a tax base integrity measure. The proposed change to section EY 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 clarifies that the transfer or sale of old life policies (after the start date of the new rules) does not result in those policies being taxed under the more comprehensive taxation formula applicable for participating business sold after 30 June 2009. Life insurers are concerned that any consolidation or rationalisation of the life industry could create additional tax compliance costs if old life policies are not appropriately grandparented. The concern arises because the life insurer who acquires the old life policies will often issue “new” life insurance policies on the same terms and conditions, including bonus entitlements. Increases to premiums that reflect increases in the amount of life cover may also feature as part of the issue of the “new” policies. 95 Provided that the premium increase is no greater than the higher of the CPI rate or 10 percent (as currently provided for in section EY 28), the life policy should continue to be treated as a continuation of existing business. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 96 TREATMENT OF THE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS RESERVE WHEN GENERAL AND NON-LIFE INSURANCE IS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER INSURER Clause 21B Submissions (KPMG, Matter raised by officials) Technical changes are required to the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify the tax position of insurance companies when there is a transfer of business partway through an income year. (Matter raised by officials) KPMG supports the suggested legislative change and submits that it should have retrospective effect to facilitate the transfer of general and non-life business if the transfer is made to ensure the insurer meets the new licensing requirements under the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010. (KPMG) Comment Under the Income Tax Act, a deduction connected with movements in an insurer’s outstanding claims reserve (OCR) (or income depending on the nature of the actual movement) is calculated on an income year basis. This means that the legislation does not provide an appropriate closing value if the OCR for a particular line of general or non-life insurance business is transferred at a point of time other than at the end of an income year. As a result, a selling insurer can lose its entitlement to deduct the closing value of its OCR. Instead, the tax deduction that would otherwise be available is effectively transferred under the Income Tax Act to the insurer that acquires the business. If the transfer occurs within New Zealand, the tax difference can be resolved by the parties agreeing to adjust the transaction value of the transfer to ensure a tax-neutral outcome. If, however, the transfer involves relocating New Zealand-based insurance business offshore, a permanent tax can be created against the taxpayer. Officials recommend a technical amendment to the Income Tax Act that sets an appropriate closing and opening balance for the OCR when it is transferred from one insurer to another. Application date KPMG, on behalf of Cigna Taiwan Limited, notes that the application date of the amendment is important for their client and submits that the change should be backdated. To meet the regulatory requirements of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010, Cigna Taiwan is restructuring its business. This restructure is likely to be completed before the bill is enacted. As such, the application of current law to Cigna Taiwan would result in it losing its entitlement to a deduction for any movements in 97 its OCR up to the date of transfer. Cigna Taiwan advises that this will create a one- off tax liability of $3 million. Reasons for backdating the suggested amendment are:  The current law creates an outcome that is inconsistent with the policy intent to allow insurers a deduction when they are reasonably expected to be liable for a claim.  The Income Tax Act, in this particular instance, should not create a tax liability in respect of actions to ensure compliance with the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010. In terms of the case against backdating, officials have undertaken limited consultation with two insurance representative groups about the suggested amendment. Both groups supported the change, subject to it applying prospectively and noting that a number of transfers have already been completed on the basis of the current legislation. Backdating the change could disturb these transactions. One group, however, supported the change applying retrospectively on an elective basis if the current legislation has the effect of denying an insurer a deduction. In balancing these competing arguments, officials agree with KPMG’s suggestion that the amendment apply to transfers occurring on and after 1 October 2012, but allow the option for the change to apply retrospectively in following limited circumstances:  The taxpayer elects to apply the rule from a date no earlier than 7 September 2010, being the date the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010 was enacted.  The transfer of the general insurance contracts are to a transferee who is non– resident and does not carry on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment.  The transfer is made by the seller for the purposes of complying with the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. The Income Tax Act should be amended to set an appropriate closing and opening balance for the OCR when it is transferred from one insurer to another. The amendment should apply to transfers made on and after 1 October 2012, or at the election of the taxpayer from a date no earlier than 7 September 2010 if:  the transfer is to a non-resident who does not carry on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment; and  the transfer is made for the purposes of complying with the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010. 98 REWRITE AMENDMENTS Issue: Valuation of livestock Clauses 20 and 165 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Matter raised by officials) The proposed amendments to section EC 1(1) should clarify that, as is currently the case, the livestock valuation rules under sub-part EC will continue to not apply where livestock is used in a dealing business. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) That the proposed amendments to section EC 1(1) should clarify that, as is currently the case, the livestock valuation rules under sub-part EC will continue to not apply where livestock is used in a dealing business. Clause 165 of the bill proposes an amendment to section EC 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004, mirroring the amendment proposed in clause 20 for section EC 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. (Matter raised by officials) Comment Officials agree that the valuation rules in subpart EC should not apply to livestock that is trading stock of a dealing business. This is contemplated by the definition of trading stock in section EB 2, which includes livestock that used in a dealing business. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Trustee income Clause 38 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA (although not considering a legislative amendment necessary) broadly supports a clarification amendment to section HC 25(1). Comment Section HC 25 is a key component of the settlor trust regime. This section ensures that a non-resident trustee of a trust, which has a New Zealand resident settlor (and 99 certain other trusts), is taxable on undistributed income derived from sources outside New Zealand. 100 The Rewrite Advisory Panel noted that section HC 25(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains an ambiguity. The ambiguity could result in the provision applying to income distributed as beneficiary income. This is not the policy intention, and we agree with the Panel that the drafting should be improved. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 101 102 Matters raised by officials 103 104 DEFINITION OF “DOCUMENT” Submission (Matter raised by officials) Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration (Form of Warrant) Regulations 2003 (which is the prescribed form for a warrant under section 16C of the Tax Administration Act 1994) should be updated to refer to “documents”. Comment A new definition of “document” was inserted into the Tax Administration Act by the Taxation (Taxation Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 replacing the old defined phrase “book and document”. The new definition removed references to redundant technology. The words “book and document” throughout the Inland Revenue Acts were replaced with the new term “document”. However, Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration (Form of Warrant) Regulations has not been updated with the new terminology. Schedule 2 of the Tax Administration (Form of Warrant) Regulations should be amended to refer to “documents”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 105 AUCKLAND COUNCIL – INDEPENDENT MĀORI STATUTORY BOARD Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should be amended to deem the Auckland Council Independent Māori Statutory Board to be a “local authority” for the purpose of those Acts. These amendments will mean that the Board is treated in the same way as other advisory-type boards of the Auckland Council. Comment Section 81 of the Local Government (Auckland Council) Act 2009 establishes the Board and sets out its purposes. The purpose of the Board is to assist the Auckland Council to make decisions concerning the promotion of cultural, economic, environmental, and social issues of significance to Māori, and to ensure that the Council acts in accordance with statutory provisions referring to the Treaty of Waitangi. The Board is established as “a body corporate”, separate from the Auckland Council. Consequently, the Board is a separate legal entity that can, and does, act in its own name, including in relation to the acquisition of supplies of goods and services required for its purpose and incurring expenditure in relation to such supplies. In contrast, the Pacific Peoples Advisory Panel and the Ethnic Peoples Advisory Panel established by the Mayor of Auckland Council are not separate legal entities. Their functions are carried out under the Auckland Council umbrella. Under current income tax law, the Board would be taxed as a normal company. Therefore, there is a possibility that the funding that it receives from the Auckland Council could be viewed as income and, therefore, taxable. Officials note that, had the Board’s functions been carried out by the Auckland Council, as are the functions of other similar Boards, there would have been no question about the tax treatment of the funding stream – the funding would not have been subject to tax. Under current GST law, the Board would not be able to register for GST purposes. This is because the funding provided by Auckland Council under the Funding Agreement to carry out its functions does not constitute “consideration” for any “taxable supply” by the Board. It is a grant-type funding that enables the Board to fulfil its statutory role, and does not have the requisite link to any reciprocal supply by the Board to Auckland Council. Therefore, the Board is not carrying on a “taxable activity”. Without any form of taxable activity, the Board cannot register for GST purposes and it cannot claim back the GST content of its expenses (such as fees paid to consultants providing advice to the Board). 106 The question of the tax status of the Board did not arise during policy development on the Local Government (Auckland Council) Act. The general approach adopted for the restructuring was for general tax law to apply to the entities of the Auckland Council restructuring, unless there was significant policy justification for departing from that approach. Officials consider that a departure from the general restructuring approach in relation to the Board is justified. This support is given on the basis that:  the Board is a non-profit body and is carrying out functions similar to other advisory boards of the Auckland Council;  the deemed status is consistent with the current tax treatment that applies to other advisory boards of the Auckland Council. The functions of these boards are carried out within the structure of the Council and, therefore, attract the local authority tax treatment; and  the deemed status would provide certainty of tax treatment and help to minimise tax compliance costs for the Board and funding costs for the Auckland Council. The amendments will ensure that:  the funding provided by Auckland Council to the Board will not be subject to income tax because local authorities are generally exempt from income tax under section CW 38 of the Income Tax Act; and  the Board is able to register for GST purposes and then can claim back the GST content of expenses that it incurs in carrying out its functions. Local authorities are deemed to be carrying on a “taxable activity” under section 6(1)(b) of the GST Act. Officials also consider that the proposed amendments should be retrospective in application and apply from 1 November 2010, the date on which the Board was established. The proposed amendments are taxpayer-friendly, and we do not expect there to be any adverse consequences associated with retrospective application of the proposed amendments for the Board or Inland Revenue. The Auckland Council and the Board support the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 107 UPDATE TO CROSS-REFERENCE IN DEFINITION OF “SUPERANNUATION SCHEME” Submission (Matter raised by officials) There is an out-dated reference to the repealed Social Security Act 1964 in the superannuation scheme definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. This should be replaced with a reference to the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001. Comment This cross-reference was overlooked when the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act was enacted. The reference should be updated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 108 EMISSIONS TRADING Issue: Definition of “forestry business” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “forestry business” should be extended to include forestry activities that exist solely for the purpose of receiving emissions units, rather than the production of timber. Comment A person who carries on a “forestry business” is allowed an income tax deduction for expenditure they incur on forest establishment and maintenance costs. This overrides the general rule denying deduction for capital expenditure. “Forestry business” was previously undefined, and there was some uncertainty over whether a forest grown purely with the objective of creating an entitlement to receive emissions units would fall within it. A new definition of forestry business was inserted in 2009, to ensure that foresters who received emissions units under the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative, a scheme under which harvest was restricted, would be entitled to receive deductions. Some instances have recently emerged of foresters who are registered to receive emissions units under the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), but who are unlikely to harvest. These foresters ought to be entitled to the same deductions as any forester whose objective is to harvest timber. It is consistent with the earlier amendment and the appropriate treatment to extend the definition of “forestry business” to foresters registered to receive emissions units under the ETS. The proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 109 Issue: Tax treatment of allocations of emissions units for removal activities Submission (Matter raised by officials) The accrual accounting rules which apply to industrial allocations of emissions units should be extended to allocation of emissions units for removal activities. Comment The ETS includes a number of categories under which those who carry on economic activity in New Zealand might be allocated emissions units by government. The tax rules for the main categories of allocation are well established. Detailed legislative provisions exist to ensure that income is correctly recognised when businesses have an entitlement to receive industrial allocations of emissions units. These rules deal with two timing issues:  Emissions units are allocated on a calendar year basis, and most businesses have income years which are not calendar years.  Emissions units are allocated sometimes in advance of, and sometimes subsequent to, the additional cost arising for which the allocation is intended to compensate. Similar timing issues arise for allocations for removal activities. However, there are no specific tax rules for allocations to businesses for “removal activities” outside the forestry sector. “Removal activities” are activities which result in greenhouse gases being removed from the atmosphere, including by incorporation into products or export. These timing issues can readily be addressed by extending the existing accrual accounting rules developed for industrial allocations to removal allocations. The proposed change should apply retrospectively from 1 July 2010, which is the date that businesses first became entitled to removal allocations. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 110 TRUSTEES QUALIFYING AS A CASH BASIS PERSON Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section HC 24(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be removed to ensure the legislation better reflects the policy objective that trustees should be able to return income tax in relation to financial arrangements on a cash accounting basis, subject to meeting certain thresholds. Comment Prior to changes made in 2009, only an individual or a trustee of a deceased estate meeting the criteria under section EW 60 could return income tax in relation to financial arrangements on a cash accounting basis (section EW 60 specifies when a trustee of a deceased’s estate is treated as a “cash basis person” for the purposes of the financial arrangement rules). In the Taxation (Business Tax Measures) Act 2009, amendments were made to the financial arrangement rules to allow non-individuals, subject to certain thresholds, to return income tax on a cash accounting basis. These changes included broadening the definition of “cash basis person” to include trustees other than trustees meeting the criteria in section EW 60. However, the requirement in section HC 24(2), that in determining a trustee’s income tax liability, the trustee is not entitled to be a “cash basis person” unless section EW 60 applies, was not removed as part of these amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill Volume 2 Simplifying filing requirements for individuals Requiring taxpayers who elect to file tax returns to file across the previous four years Issues raised by the Committee’s specialist tax adviser Other policy matters May 2012 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and the Treasury CONTENTS Policy matters 1 Simplifying filing requirements for individuals 3 Overview 3 Issue: Amalgamating the income tax forms 4 Issue: There should be a consistent filing requirement for all recipients of Working for Families tax credits 5 Issue: Reducing compliance costs and making use of smart technology 6 Issue: Unique identifying numbers for individuals 7 Requiring taxpayers who elect to file tax returns to file across the previous four years 8 Issue: The four-year filing rule should not proceed 8 Issue: The length of the four-year rule 9 Issue: Refinements to the proposal 9 Issue: Commissioner’s discretion with respect to the four-year filing rule 10 Issue: Excluding certain taxpayers from the application of the four-year rule 11 Issue: Improving the drafting of proposed new section 33AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 12 Issue: Updating the income threshold within new section 33AA 12 Issue: Links between the PIR rules and the return filing rules 13 Issue: The redundancy tax credit 14 Issue: Applying the four-year rule 14 Issue: Application of late payment penalties and interest 15 Issue: Offset of credits and debits within four-year period 16 Deferring the application date 17 Issues raised by specialist tax adviser to the Committee 18 Issue: Requirement to file a return 18 Issue: Tax records being available to meet filing obligations 20 Issue: Circumvention of the four-year square-up rule 21 Other policy matters 24 Shareholder dividend statements and Māori authority distribution notices 26 1 Policy matters 2 3 SIMPLIFYING FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS Overview The bill contains a number of amendments which deal with income tax and Working for Families tax credit return-filing requirements for individuals. The purpose of the changes is to reduce the use of paper forms in administering the tax system, instead moving towards greater use of online services and technology. The effect should be an overall reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers and greater operational efficiencies for Inland Revenue. Under the current rules, income filing obligations for individuals fall into two broad groups. The first group is those taxpayers who are required to file income tax returns. It includes those who earn income that is not taxed at source, such as business income and investment rental income, those who receive income that has been taxed at source such as salary or wages but at an incorrect withholding rate, and those that are entitled to Working for Families tax credits. The second group is those taxpayers who are not required to file a tax return but may choose to do so. It includes those who have earned income subject to tax at source such as salary or wages that has been withheld at the correct rate. Depending on the nature of the income earned, a person files either an IR 3 income tax return or is issued an income statement (also known as a personal tax summary (PTS)). Inland Revenue either issues a PTS or the taxpayer requests one. Taxpayers whose income comprises mainly salary or wages and resident withholding income (such as interest and dividends) may receive a PTS. The bill provides for:  The removal of the requirement for the Commissioner to issue PTSs to certain taxpayers. These taxpayers will now be required to file tax returns. This proposal will remove the distinction between the two major income tax forms for individuals and effectively result in their amalgamation.  The requirement for taxpayers who are not required to file tax returns, but who choose to do so anyway, to file for the previous four years, in addition to the year in which they have chosen to file. This is to prevent taxpayers filing only in the years that they are due refunds (known as “cherry picking”).  The de-coupling of the requirement for a taxpayer to file an income tax return or receive a PTS merely because they receive Working for Families tax credits. These proposals will apply for the 2014–15 and later tax years. Implementation of these proposals will be supported by an Inland Revenue-driven strategy aimed at moving taxpayers to electronic services. 4 As noted in the Minister of Revenue’s letter of 20 March 2012 to the Committee, Inland Revenue officials have been reconsidering whether these proposals could be implemented in a manner that is less resource- and system-reliant. Inland Revenue’s systems are currently under significant pressure and the resourcing of systems changes is constrained. Not proceeding with the “amalgamation” of the individual tax forms proposal will allow a less resource- and system-reliant solution to be implemented while still achieving the policy outcomes being sought. In addition, given that Inland Revenue has a number of significant policy initiatives to implement in the coming years, such as the student loan redesign, child support changes and developing its Business Transformation blueprint and future operating model, deferring the implementation date of the other return filing proposals would provide some flexibility for the Department. This will enable the implementation of these proposals to be integrated with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme and new operating model. Issue: Amalgamating the income tax forms Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposal to amalgamate the two main income tax forms for individuals (the IR 3 and the PTS forms) should be removed from the bill. Comment As previously indicated, Inland Revenue officials have been reconsidering how this suite of proposals contained in the bill could be implemented in a way that is less resource- and system-reliant. Not proceeding with the income tax form amalgamation proposal would allow a less resource- and system-reliant solution to be implemented. The amalgamation proposal would have given rise to administrative benefits and savings which are separately being realised as part of the implementation of Inland Revenue’s e-service strategy. Removing the amalgamation proposal from the bill would not have any impact on the fiscal savings from this suite of proposals. The result will be that the two paper forms, the IR 3 and the PTS, will continue to be used according to current practice. However, in the e-services environment, the distinction will become less apparent as the environment being created will be a more taxpayer-centered return. The practical effect of this submission is that provisions relating to the issue and administration of PTSs will continue to apply. The amendments in the bill proposing to repeal these provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007 will therefore be removed. Recommendation 5 That the submission be accepted. Submission (KPMG) The current system of different tax return forms creates confusion among taxpayers over which form they must file, and a rationalisation of these forms is a welcome change. However, it is important that the replacement form is clear, simple to complete and requires minimal compliance costs. The forms should include as much pre-populated information as possible. Although supportive of the return being web- based, there should be accommodation for those taxpayers unable to or uncomfortable with filing online, and assistance and education should be offered. Comment Officials agree with the tenor of the submission. However, given that officials are recommending not to proceed with the proposal to amalgamate the income tax forms for individuals, there will continue to be different tax forms for individuals. While the intention is to move individuals to online filing, a paper alternative will continue to be available. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: There should be a consistent filing requirement for all recipients of Working for Families tax credits Submission (KPMG) Since some Working for Families tax credit recipients will still be required to file income tax returns, it would be simpler to have a consistent filing requirement for all recipients of the credits. There is concern that a new process will add to the information filing requirements of this group, when instead the process should be further simplified. The Committee should therefore test with officials the rationale for a new information collection process for family assistance recipients, rather than a simplification of an existing or proposed return process. Comment The basis of the proposal in the bill is that the need for a person to determine their annual income tax liability is not required to assess a taxpayer’s entitlement to Working for Families tax credits. What is actually needed to assess entitlement is their income information, not their annual income tax liability. This has become more relevant since the definition of “income” for Working for Families was broadened to include information that is not typically included in an income tax return. 6 The proposal to remove the income tax filing requirement will not add additional filing requirements for any taxpayers, and will reduce the compliance cost of this activity for approximately 75 percent of Working for Families recipients. The remaining recipients will be required to file for reasons other than their entitlement to the tax credits. All recipients will still be required to undertake a year-end “square- up” of the tax credits and income they have actually received, as per the current process. This is necessary to ensure that people received their correct entitlement. Officials do not consider that a general income tax filing requirement is necessary for these taxpayers. In addition, the proposal as it currently stands should significantly decrease the compliance costs placed upon this group. Those Working for Families recipients who are not required to file a return can still choose to file one. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reducing compliance costs and making use of smart technology Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed changes in the bill fail to deliver any material compliance cost savings to businesses. The initiative to develop and make better use of smart technology as outlined in the discussion document and online forum Making tax easier is progressing at glacial pace. Reform is needed with respect to the way in which small businesses calculate and pay their income tax and calculate and account for PAYE, such as making certain types of source-deducted income (income subject to RWT, scheduler payments and royalties for example) subject to a final tax. People who receive income that is subject to source deductions and who also receive social assistance should have their tax liability decided by source deductions. Comment The changes in the bill that relate to PAYE are, for the main part, aimed at reducing compliance costs for individuals. Options to progress Inland Revenue’s use of electronic technologies as the main form of service delivery were outlined in Making tax easier. Many of the submissions noted concern at mandating electronic services, arguing that this form of service delivery may not be suitable for some taxpayers who are uncomfortable about using computers and technology, and who may not have access to the necessary tools in order to comply. The proposals in the bill therefore aim to strike a balance between these concerns, and the need for Inland Revenue to deliver better and smarter services, with greater use of smart technology. 7 In considering the submission on making certain source-deducted income subject to a final tax, officials note that a variant of this was outlined in Making tax easier. The proposal in the discussion document was that taxpayers in steady employment for 11 or more months of the year who derive the bulk of their income from salary and wages should have their PAYE deductions treated as “full and final” and so should be unable to file an income tax return. The submissions received on this point were, for the most part, in strong disagreement with it. Submitters argued that taxpayers have a right to seek any over-deductions of income, particularly given the potential for this. However, as PAYE withholding becomes more accurate, there may be a case for revisiting this proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Unique identifying numbers for individuals Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) All taxpayers should have a single unique identifying number for dealing with government. Comment The Government recently announced as part of its Better Public Services programme two result areas that relate to improving interaction with government. These result areas are:  New Zealand businesses have a one-stop online shop for all government advice and support they need to run and grow their business; and  New Zealanders can complete their transactions with the Government easily in a digital environment. A single business identifier is likely to be considered as part of this work. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 8 REQUIRING TAXPAYERS WHO ELECT TO FILE TAX RETURNS TO FILE ACROSS THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS Issue: The four-year filing rule should not proceed Submission (KPMG) Although there is asymmetry from being able to file for a refund while not being required to file when tax is owed, the result is a fiscal risk to the Government and a foreseeable consequence of the filing reforms of the late 1990s that removed the requirement to file for the majority of taxpayers. Since tax withholding systems collect, on average, the right amount of tax, no further square-up should be required. Requiring taxpayers to file over four additional years will add to compliance and administrative costs, and could be viewed as an attempt by Inland Revenue to restrict access to refunds. Comment The reforms of the 1990s did not anticipate the practice of “cherry picking” refunds and the extent to which it occurs. The rate at which personal tax summaries are requested by taxpayers has increased very significantly in recent years. Approximately 200,000 personal tax summaries were requested over a period of five years up to 2008; by 2010 this number was reached in the space of seven months. There has also been a corresponding increase in the rate and quantity of refunds issued over the same period. It is appropriate to address the inequity with the returns filing system that the practice of “cherry picking” has demonstrated. Officials consider that requiring taxpayers who elect to file tax returns across the previous four years does not place an unreasonable compliance burden upon this group. This is because most of this group already either currently files for the four years, or at a minimum, completes the initial steps to determine whether they are due a refund or have tax to pay. The main difference is that they decline to complete income tax filing for those years when they have tax to pay. Therefore, the proposal does not materially increase the compliance burden of income tax filing relative to the tax filing activities that they currently perform. Despite the small increase in compliance costs at the margin, this change is necessary to prevent the significant loss in Crown revenue that occurs under the current rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Issue: The length of the four-year rule Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Although cognisant of the problem of “cherry picking” refunds, the proposed four- year rule is confusing and places a high compliance burden upon taxpayers as it will require them to search back through their records from the previous four years. This is not justified for taxpayers who for legitimate reasons may be required to file. The reforms will increase taxpayer interactions with Inland Revenue due to their complexity. A two-year retrospective filing requirement is more suitable than the proposed four-year period. Comment Officials consider that the proposed four-year filing requirement is not substantially more confusing or compliance-heavy than the status quo. Taxpayers routinely check across the previous four years to identify those years in which they are due a refund and filing for these years is a small extension to this process. The proposal will not apply to taxpayers who are, for whatever reason, required to file an income tax return. The four-year filing requirement will only apply to taxpayers who choose to file a tax return. It allows taxpayers who are not otherwise required to file to choose between low compliance costs, or accuracy of income tax paid. Four years is the current cut-off point for filing personal tax summaries retrospectively. Changing the rule to a two-year retrospective filing requirement is arbitrary and does not align with the existing filing framework. It would also fail to fully address the problem of “cherry picking”, unless there was a subsequent policy change to restrict retrospective filing to the previous two years, which would limit taxpayers’ access to claiming refunds in those additional back years. It should also be noted that taxpayers will still be entitled to view the salary and wage information that Inland Revenue holds about them, and subsequently make a decision regarding filing based on their net position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Refinements to the proposal Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) While broadly in support of the proposal, source-deduction information should be easily obtainable from Inland Revenue, and no late filing penalties should apply in respect of tax returns for prior years filed by taxpayers who had no obligation to file. 10 Comment Individuals are currently able to obtain from Inland Revenue information that it holds on source deductions that have been made from their salary or wage income. Officials agree that as a matter of policy, late filing penalties should not apply to individuals who choose to file but otherwise would not have been required to do so. Under current law, late filing penalties do not apply to persons whose filing obligations are governed by section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Commissioner’s discretion with respect to the four-year filing rule Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers who choose to file an income tax return should be entitled, on application to the Commissioner, to have the four-year filing requirement disregarded, due to the complexity of the rules and potential for taxpayers to erroneously expect a refund as a result of filing. Comment Officials do not consider this discretion to be necessary, as taxpayers have access to the salary and wage source deduction information that Inland Revenue holds about them and can do the necessary calculations to determine whether they are due a refund or instead have tax to pay before they file any returns. Inland Revenue provides online calculators and information to assist with this. Providing a discretion would be difficult to administer, as it would require the Commissioner to make an objective assessment about whether the taxpayer had filed in error or not. It would also potentially increase the number of contacts with Inland Revenue, and require manual interventions to Inland Revenue’s IT systems. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 Issue: Excluding certain taxpayers from the application of the four-year rule Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers who do not work a full tax year and who are due a tax refund should be excluded from the four-year filing requirement. Comment Individuals who do not work a full tax year are likely to have their income over- deducted and therefore be due a refund of PAYE withholdings. This is because the PAYE system calculates the PAYE for a pay-period as if the person will earn that pay-period amount for the full year. Individuals for whom this could apply include people who go on parental leave, and retirees in the year in which they cease employment. However, excluding these taxpayers from the application of the four-year filing requirement would be difficult to administer, as it would substantially increase contacts with Inland Revenue and require, in particular, manual interventions to Inland Revenue’s systems. It also raises the question of whether other taxpayers who are over-deducted for other reasons should be excluded from the coverage of the four- year filing rule, such as taxpayers who receive a pay increase. One option for addressing this concern is to set a level above which refunds could be paid out for a particular year, without requiring the taxpayer to file for the previous four years. This would go some way in addressing the potential for large over- deductions caused by a period of unemployment during a tax year. It also raises the same equity issues mentioned above in relation to other types of over-deductions, and has similar operational issues. The potential impact from applying the four-year rule to taxpayers who do not work for part of the year is that they pay the correct amount of income tax. In that sense, they are not disadvantaged relative to what should have been withheld from their income. Finally, the notion that taxpayers unfamiliar with filing returns will suddenly be required to file for a number of years in order to receive a tax refund for the current year is not a significant concern. Most taxpayers will currently check for refunds in all previous years, choosing not to finish the process for years when tax is payable. There is also a very active industry built around firms completing this process on behalf of taxpayers should they not wish to undertake it themselves. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 Issue: Improving the drafting of proposed new section 33AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Matter raised by officials) Although the proposed new section 33AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is an improvement on the existing section 33A (that it purports to replace), improvements could be made to make it easier to understand. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The drafting improvements included in the new section 33AA should be incorporated into the legislation given that current rules relating to the issuing of personal tax summaries will remain in place. (Matter raised by officials) Comment Filing requirements for individuals begin with the principle outlined in section 33 of the Tax Administration Act, which states that all taxpayers, other than those to whom section 33A applies, are required to file. Section 33A and its redrafted version then goes on to outline which taxpayers do not have to file. As a consequence of the initial broad statement requiring all taxpayers to file, new section 33AA is framed negatively. Although this drafting can appear unintuitive, it is highly important that the initial principle be framed as broadly as possible, in order to apply generally. One of the consequences of not proceeding with the amalgamation of the income tax forms for individuals is that the provisions relating to issuing of personal tax summaries will remain in place. Officials consider that the improvements in drafting made in the new proposed section 33AA should be retained in the bill. Recommendation That the submission from NZICA be noted and the officials’ submission be accepted. Issue: Updating the income threshold within new section 33AA Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The income level of $200 used in new section 33AA (and the current section 33A) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be updated to a higher level, between $500 and $1,000. 13 Comment The $200 income level referred to in this submission is the level of income used generally within the provision to provide the tipping point under which an acceptable level of error can occur before a taxpayer will be required to file an income tax return. An example of this is in relation to taxpayers who earn income that is subject to resident withholding tax. If a taxpayer earns more than $200 of this type of income and this income is taxed at a rate other than their marginal rate, they will be required to file a return. The policy changes in the bill do not extend to a reconsideration of these income levels. Furthermore, any increase in these will have a fiscal cost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Links between the PIR rules and the return filing rules Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The links between the portfolio investment rate (PIR) rules and the return filing rules should be clarified. Portfolio investment entity (PIE) income that is not excluded income is taxable income and should be returned. However, there is no equivalent $200 income threshold as exists for other types of income such as income subject to resident withholding tax (RWT). Comment It is intended that PIE income that is not excluded income is covered by the general $200 threshold in new section 33AA(1)(a)(ii) for income that is not subject to withholding. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: The redundancy tax credit Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The redundancy tax credit or similar relief should be extended to cover loss of earning payments made by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) that relate to prior or multiple years. Comment The policy changes in this bill do not extend to consideration of the redundancy tax credit. The redundancy tax credit was repealed recently with effect from 1 October 2011. However, the issue with payments of this kind is that despite the fact that they may relate to prior years, they are taxed in the year in which they are received, and may be taxed at a higher marginal rate than they would have if the income had actually been received in the year(s) to which it relates. This is because these taxpayers are typically cash-basis taxpayers, and so are taxed on their income at the time they receive it. The tax treatment of ACC back-dated compensation is the same as that for other lump sum payments, such as bonuses and long service leave. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Applying the four-year rule Submission (Matter raised by officials) Under the current drafting of the four-year rule, it is possible that taxpayers could choose to file for one of the previous years in which they are due a refund, and have the four-year rule apply from that year. For example: It is now July 2020 and Sarah is aware she has a credit of $100 for the 2018 year, but a debit in the 2019 and 2020 tax years. 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 (10) (50) 100 20 10 Sarah chooses to file for the 2018 tax year. The four-year rule is triggered and she also has to file for 2017 and 2016, but no further back because of the statute bar. 15 Comment The policy intent of the four-year rule is that the relevant four-year period should start from the most recently ended tax year. The scenario outlined in the example above would be inconsistent with the policy intent. Officials therefore recommend that the four-year rule be clarified to apply from the most recently ended tax year and not from the year for which the taxpayer is choosing to file. So, in the example, if Sarah wanted in 2020 to square up for 2018, she would need to file for 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of late payment penalties and interest Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Matter raised by officials) Late payment penalties and use-of-money interest should not be imposed on tax debts that arise from the requirement to file returns for the previous four years. People should be given a new due date for such debts and late payment penalties and use-of- money interest should apply from that date if payment is not made. Comment Late payment penalties and use-of-money interest typically apply when a taxpayer does not pay their tax by the due date for a particular tax year. Under the proposals in the bill, taxpayers who file for a previous year (due to the operation of the four-year rule) and have a debit, would be subject to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest from the original date that the debit would have been due, had the taxpayer been required to file a return. Officials consider this would be unfair. To apply penalties and interest to amounts arising from tax years when taxpayers were not required to file would effectively undermine the principles underlying section 33A and the proposed section 33AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. To avoid penalties and interest applying, a new due date for payment will need to be set. If payment does not occur by this date, late payment penalties and use-of-money interest will apply from that date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 16 Issue: Offset of credits and debits within four-year period Submission (Matter raised by officials) Any credits and debits that arise during the four-year square-up period should be able to be offset against each other. Comment Under the current tax rules, an income tax refund due for an income year may be offset against any income tax owing from previous income years (that is, tax unpaid after the due date for payment). However, to ensure that taxpayers are not subject to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest for returns required to be filed as part of the four-year square-up rule, a new due date will be set (see above submission). The effect of this will mean that any credits will not be able to be offset against a debit as the debt is not due. The result will be that any refunds will be paid to the taxpayer and tax owing will be payable by the due date. The following example demonstrates this outcome: Sarah is not required to file returns and chooses to file for the 2020 year. As a result she is issued PTSs for the 2016 to 2019 tax years. 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 100 – refund 50 – refund (60) – tax to pay 20 – refund (50) – tax to pay Sarah would be paid refunds totalling $170 and be liable to pay tax of $110 by the new due date (two months after issue of statements). For administrative ease and to prevent the non-payment of any tax due, officials recommend that any credits and debits arising as a result of the application of the four-year square-up rule be able to be offset against each other. That is, any debit for a year should be treated as being due from its original due date for the purpose of offsetting it against any refund due. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 DEFERRING THE APPLICATION DATE Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date of the 2014–15 tax year should be deferred until the 2016–17 tax year, and the application date should be able to be set earlier by an Order in Council. Comment As noted previously, Inland Revenue is under significant resourcing pressure to implement a number of policy changes, such as student loan redesign, child support and the proposals in this bill over the short- to medium-term. Furthermore, the Department is in the process of developing its Business Transformation blueprint and its future operating model. This will lay the foundations for the information technology platforms and business processes it will operate in the future. To provide greater organisational flexibility to implement these proposals, officials propose that the application date be deferred but be able to be set earlier by an Order in Council. We propose that the application date be deferred by two years to the 2016–17 tax year. Furthermore to provide flexibility, we further propose that the implementation date be able to be set by Order in Council if it was decided to implement the proposals from an earlier tax year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 18 ISSUES RAISED BY SPECIALIST TAX ADVISER TO THE COMMITTEE Issue: Requirement to file a return Submission Taxpayers who are not exempt from filing a return or being issued a PTS and who are required by the law to be issued (or request) a PTS may not be aware of their obligations. For example, a person who earns more that $200 of interest or dividends who did not have resident withholding tax deducted at their correct marginal tax rate. Furthermore, this obligation to file applies even when the taxpayer used a higher withholding rate than their marginal tax rate. If a taxpayer is required to be issued (or request) a PTS and does not fulfil this obligation, the taxpayer may be subject to a late filing penalty and prosecution for failing to provide information to the Commissioner when required to do by a tax rule. Comment In practice, Inland Revenue identifies, based on the information it holds, taxpayers who should be issued a PTS. The issue of PTSs by Inland Revenue includes taxpayers who are entitled to Working for Families tax credits, those issued special tax codes and those who earned more than $200 of employment income and used a flat withholding rate (such as the casual agricultural workers’ code or an incorrect secondary tax code). Inland Revenue was provided with some legislative flexibility in the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 to manage the issue of PTSs. In particular, it provided the Department with discretion in selecting who should be issued a PTS. Inland Revenue informs taxpayers of their tax return filing obligations (including the need to request a PTS) in a number of ways. Customer research and feedback shows that just providing the criteria directly to taxpayers in a written format, even on the website, is not effective in supporting compliance. As a result, the “required to file” criteria has been incorporated into two online calculation tools:  one for taxpayers to determine if they are required to file an IR 3 or request a PTS; and  the online “Personal Tax Summary” Calculator tool (most popular online tool for end-of-year tax). These tools are available for the current 2012 tax year and previous years. In mid- 2012 Inland Revenue will be launching these services within its secure online services system as this increasingly becomes taxpayers’ first point of contact. 19 Each year Inland Revenue undertakes an advertising campaign to make sure taxpayers are aware of their end-of-year tax obligations and entitlements as well as services available to support those obligations. In 2012 this campaign includes television, online, radio and magazine advertising as well as a text messaging campaign to selected groups. This campaign directs taxpayers to Inland Revenue’s online campaign pages at www.ird.govt.nz/tax2012. From this page taxpayers can directly access both the “required to file” and “Personal Tax Summary” calculators for the current year, and links to previous years. As part of the communication strategy mentioned above, Inland Revenue has an agreement with payers of RWT and NRWT to incorporate key messages to taxpayers on their annual statements or certificates that the taxpayer may be required to file a return and to refer to our website. We also issue communications to key external parties such as tax agents to advise changes to any products or processes. Tax agents can also access the information and services online. In developing the rules to determine which taxpayers are obliged to file returns or be issued with PTSs, it is important to take into account perceptions of fairness. The current rules are neutral as to whether a person has had tax over- or under-withheld at source. Instead, they focus on the correctness of the rates. If the rules only focussed on placing filing requirements on taxpayers to be issued with PTSs if they were under withheld at source, there could be concern that the filing requirements were biased towards the revenue, despite the fact that a person could choose to file if they were over-withheld. The impact of this would be more pronounced with the implementation of the four-year square-up rule. Officials consider that the current rules strike the appropriate balance. Under current law, a person to whom section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies (and this includes persons who are required to request a PTS) is not liable for the late filing penalty if they do not file or do not file on time. This exclusion will continue to apply given the distinction between IR 3 and PTS filers will continue if, as officials have recommended, the amalgamation of the tax forms does not proceed. While a taxpayer who is required to request a PTS could be prosecuted for not filing a PTS, it is very unlikely. Prosecution action is usually a last resort to ensure that taxpayers comply with their obligations. Furthermore, prosecuting a person who is due a refund is unlikely to promote voluntary compliance by taxpayers in the broader context. The Commissioner is responsible under sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for protecting the integrity of the tax system and the care and management of the Inland Revenue Acts – including promoting voluntary compliance. Prosecuting such cases would generally not be consistent with this statutory responsibility. Officials are not aware of any person being prosecuted for not requesting a PTS. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 20 Issue: Tax records being available to meet filing obligations Submission A taxpayer who is subject to the four-year square-up rule may not hold or have access to sufficient income and tax records to meet their filing obligations. A consequence of not being able to file a correct return could be prosecution for knowingly filing an incorrect return. This could lead to prosecution and the imposition of a fine by the courts. Comment As noted in the Committee’s specialist tax adviser’s report, a person to whom section 33A applies is only required to retain tax records relating to income that has been deducted at source for 12 months after the expiry of the tax year to which they relate. Officials do not consider it is appropriate to extend the record-keeping requirements for such taxpayers to deal with the four-year square-up. Inland Revenue receives salary or wage information from employers and interest and dividend information from payers of resident withholding income. All this information is input into Inland Revenue’s computer system. Any salary or wage income and tax withheld details are pre-populated in a PTS issued (or requested). Inland Revenue’s systems cannot currently pre-populate interest and dividend information held. Furthermore, as only one IRD number is provided to payers of interest and dividends the allocation of income from joint bank accounts is problematic. If a taxpayer requests details of their resident withholding income, Inland Revenue has the ability to access and provide this information. In addition, a taxpayer can access the resident withholding income information from the payer of the income. From discussions with one bank, they would charge a small service fee for providing this information. This expenditure would be deductible for tax purposes as a cost in determining their tax liability. Furthermore, the current provisions relating to PTSs allow a person to ignore including in the return gross income from employment, interest or dividends if that amount is $200 or less. This provision will continue to apply if the amalgamation of returns proposal does not proceed. For the reasons noted above, it is very unlikely that the Department would prosecute a person who is required to file a PTS for filing an incorrect return. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 21 Issue: Circumvention of the four-year square-up rule Submission It is easy for a person to circumvent the four-year square-up rule by ensuring that for a particular year that they think they are entitled to a refund they ensure that they are required to file a PTS. For example, using an incorrect RWT rate if the person receives interest over $200. Comment Officials acknowledge this risk but consider that the risk is quite low. Of those taxpayers who requested a PTS for the 2009–10 tax year, approximately 7 percent of them returned interest and dividends. Officials intend to monitor this risk. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 22 23 24 Other policy matters 25 26 SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND STATEMENTS AND MĀORI AUTHORITY DISTRIBUTION NOTICES Submission (Chapman Tripp) Companies must provide dividend statements to shareholders when they pay a dividend. The Electronic Transactions Act 2002 allows companies to meet this requirement by emailing statements to their shareholders. This should also be made explicit in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment Officials understand that the Electronic Transactions Act allows companies to meet the requirement to provide dividend statements to shareholders by making the statement available electronically to their shareholders (as long as the recipient consents to receiving the statement in that way). Officials agree that this should be made explicit in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for legislative consistency and ease of use. Officials note that the Electronic Transactions Act also permits Māori authorities to meet the requirement to provide Māori authority distribution notices by making the notice available electronically to the recipient, when the recipient consents to receiving the notice in that way. This should also be made explicit in the Tax Administration Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and also extended to Māori authorities.

Introduced in 1992, the New Zealand child support scheme helps to provide financial support for over 210,000 children. Although many parents reach private agreement on their financial contributions and care arrangements, many cannot. The scheme, therefore, provides a back-up for those parents who cannot mutually agree on their financial contributions to support their children. It also applies when the parent who is the primary caregiver receives a state-provided benefit. While the current child support scheme provides a relatively straightforward way of calculating child support liability for the majority of parents, there are concerns that the scheme is now out of date. The amendments in the bill aim to reduce these and other concerns. The changes provide for a revised assessment calculation for child support payments that takes a wider range of individual circumstances and capacities to pay into account. The bill also includes changes to the rules relating to the payment of child support, the imposition of penalties, and the writing-off of penalties. Broadly, the changes in the bill fall into three categories:  a new child support calculation formula;  secondary changes to update the child support scheme; and  amendments to the payment, penalty and debt rules for child support. Revised child support formula The new formula introduced in the bill will provide a more equitable system of financial support in a variety of circumstances. In particular, it will better reflect many of the social and legal changes that have occurred since the introduction of the current scheme, such as the greater emphasis placed on separated parents sharing the care of and financial responsibility for their children. This in turn will increase the incentives for parents to meet their child support obligations. The new formula bases child support payments on:  a wider recognition of care of children, based, in the first instance, on there being care of at least 28 percent of nights in a year;  the income of both parents; and  estimated average expenditures for raising children. 4 Secondary changes to update the child support scheme The bill also includes amendments which affect the operation of the child support formula and scheme more generally. The amendments:  allow Inland Revenue to rely on parenting agreements and orders when establishing care levels;  introduce a Commissioner’s discretion to make it easier for significant daytime care to be recognised for shared-care purposes in addition to nights;  more closely align the definition of ―income‖ for child support purposes with the broader definition of ―family scheme income‖ for Working for Families tax credit purposes;  introduce a Commissioner’s discretion to allow, in certain circumstances, certain payments to be recognised for child support payment purposes;  recognise re-establishment costs, following a separation, as an administrative review ground in certain circumstances; and  reduce the qualifying age of children subject to the child support scheme from under 19 years to under 18, unless they are 18 years and enrolled in full-time secondary education. Changes to payment, penalties and write-off rules The rules relating to payment, penalties and the write-off of child support debt play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support obligations on time. A system that is overly penal and inflexible can lead to very high debt levels that discourage parents from contacting Inland Revenue and arranging payment. The changes in the bill are aimed at encouraging parents to make timely payments of child support. To that end, the bill:  allows for compulsory deductions of child support from the employment income of paying parents;  introduces a new two-stage initial penalty, with the current full 10 percent only being charged if the debt remains unpaid after 7 days;  reduces the incremental monthly penalty from 2 percent to 1 percent after a year of non-compliance;  changes the circumstances in which penalties can be written off, including when a paying parent enters into an instalment arrangement or is in serious hardship, when debt recovery is a demonstrably inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources, or when only a low level of penalty debt is outstanding; and  allows Inland Revenue to write off assessed debt owed to the Crown, in relation to a receiving carer who is on a benefit, on serious hardship grounds. 5 Application dates The amendments proposed in the bill will apply in two phases. The bill currently states that the new child support formula will apply for assessment periods from 1 April 2013, with all other changes to the child support scheme applying from 1 April 2014. It should be noted that these implementation dates are currently under discussion with Ministers, and are due to be considered by Cabinet in late September. Further details will be submitted to the Committee once this consideration has taken place. General theme of the submissions received Sixty written submissions were received on a variety of issues relating to the bill. These ranged from holistic views on all of the changes taken together, to comments on specific proposed amendments. There was no overarching theme that could be gleaned from the submissions received, with views instead ranging from the very supportive, to vociferous opposition. This is not surprising given the inherent potential for divergent views on the subject of child support reform. Nearly half of the submissions either supported the proposed amendments in their entirety or alternatively, elements within the package. Within this group submissions said that either the reforms did not go far enough or that other specific changes should be made. Those who generally did not support the changes in the bill provided a variety of reasons to support their views. This report identifies and provides comment and recommendations on the following matters:  main policy issues raised in submissions (generally raised by a number of parties);  other policy issues raised in submissions;  further policy issues raised by the Social Services Committee during the hearing of oral evidence; and  further policy issues raised by officials. In addition, other technical and remedial legislative issues raised in submissions and by officials are included for the Committee’s consideration. 6 MAIN POLICY ISSUES RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS RECEIVED Issue: Further research should be conducted before any changes to the child support scheme are made Submissions (Matter raised primarily by Auckland Coalition for Safety of Women and Children, Auckland Women’s Centre, Dunedin Community Law Centre, Nicola Gavey, Vivienne Elizabeth, Julia Tolmie, Prue Hyman, the Equal Justice Project, Women’s Studies Association) There is currently a lack of comprehensive data and research on child support issues, in particular in a New Zealand context. No significant changes should be made to the child support scheme until further research is conducted on the effects of any change. Comment In developing the Government’s September 2010 discussion document on child support, Supporting children, officials considered a variety of domestic and international research on child support matters. This included a significant amount of Australian research undertaken as part of similar changes made to the Australian child support formula in 2008. Recent New Zealand research specifically undertaken to inform the discussion document included:  Costs of raising children by Iris Claus, Paul Kilford, Geoff Leggett and Xin Wang; and  What separating parents need when making care arrangements for their children by the Families Commission. The discussion document provided detailed analysis of both the current scheme and options for updating the scheme. As well as consideration of research undertaken and specific submissions received on the discussion document, a dedicated website was established to ask readers to respond to a series of questions based on the options included in the document. There were 2,272 participants in this online consultation, comprising:  834 receiving parents (37 percent);  753 paying parents (33 percent); and  685 ―other‖ parties (30 percent), including those who both pay and receive child support, other family members, members of representative organisations and advocates involved in child support policy such as lawyers and academics. 7 Results based on the proposed formula changes were also modelled and summarised in the regulatory impact statement prepared by Inland Revenue on the child support scheme reforms. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The proposed changes will have a negative effect on caregivers Submissions (Matter raised primarily by Auckland Coalition for Safety of Women and Children, Auckland Women’s Centre, Child Poverty Action Group, Families Commission, Human Rights Commission, Lesley Patterson, Nicola Gavey, Vivienne Elizabeth, Julia Tolmie, Prue Hyman, Women’s Studies Association) The changes in the bill will disproportionately affect those who will be least able to withstand any reduction in income. There is a concern that caregivers, in particular mothers, will be adversely affected to the detriment of their children. Comment The overall objective of the revised child support formula is to achieve an equitable outcome based on up-to-date costs of raising children, both parents’ income and a greater range of care levels. This will encourage more parents to pay their outstanding child support liabilities voluntarily, benefitting the children involved. There are wide-ranging views about what a fairer and more effective scheme might look like and how to achieve this. It will never be possible to design rules to satisfy all concerned as there are too many conflicting interests and points of view. However, if a child support formula were being established for the first time, the principles behind the proposed formula would provide a sound basis for calculating child support payments and entitlements. Officials consider that the proposed formula provides the best opportunity for introducing a revised formula that represents a fair reflection of the expenditure for raising children, the parents’ contribution to care and the parents’ capacity to pay. For these reasons the proposed child support formula is considered a significant improvement over the current one and will benefit, in particular, all parents who become part of the child support scheme after the changes are made. It is recognised that moving from one method of calculating child support to another will, in the short term, have both a positive and negative financial effect for parents already in the scheme, and will have a material financial impact for a minority of parents. It should be noted, however, that as a percentage of parents, those affected adversely are as likely to be paying parents as receiving parents. Overall, it is estimated that approximately 70,500 parents will be better off under the changes (that is, they will receive more or pay less child support) and approximately 62,500 worse off (that is, they will receive less or pay more). 8 For the majority of parents whose child support will be affected, the change in child support received and paid is likely to be between plus or minus $66 per month (plus or minus $800 per year). In addition, for a large percentage of receiving and paying parents (60 percent and 40 percent respectively), the changes to the formula would not result in any change in the amounts received or paid. For approximately 140,000 parents, therefore, there would be no change. This group would consist of some of the most financially vulnerable parents – those who would continue to either receive a sole-parent benefit (and therefore not receive child support payments directly) or continue to pay the minimum contribution because their income level is below the minimum level for child support purposes. The approach taken during the review was to categorise the parents into paying parents and receiving parents. Being a receiving parent is generally indicative of being the primary caregiver, and this can be the mother, the father, or another person. That said, as the majority (but certainly not all) of receiving parents are female, women are more likely to be adversely affected by this change. Taking both female paying and female receiving parents into account, it is projected that approximately 26,000 of these parents would receive more or pay less child support and approximately 31,500 of these parents would receive less or pay more child support. The majority (approximately 83,000) would be unaffected – for example, receiving parents who remain on a sole parent benefit would continue to receive full benefit levels. Taking both male paying and male receiving parents into account, it is projected that approximately 44,250 of these parents would receive more or pay less child support and approximately 30,750 of these parents would receive less or pay more child support. Approximately 56,250 would be unaffected by the proposed formula. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Child support payments should be passed on to beneficiaries instead of being retained by the Crown Submissions (Matter raised primarily by Auckland Coalition for Safety of Women and Children, Auckland Women’s Centre, Child Poverty Action Group, Families Commission, Office of the Children’s Commissioner, Prue Hyman, Women’s Studies Association, Anne Busse) The child support system could contribute to decreasing child poverty if the Crown passed on child support payments to sole parents on state-provided benefits. This would be an effective and efficient method of reducing poverty and increasing income support for affected families. 9 Comment Currently, New Zealand does have a partial system of passing on child support payments in that a receiving parent receives any child support amount paid over and above the benefit they receive. They are, however, guaranteed as a minimum, the benefit amount. Most countries that have introduced a full pass-on system have used it to emphasise the welfare of the children when child poverty and/or poor child support payment rates have been of central concern. Although alleviating child poverty is not a specific policy objective of the proposed measures in the bill, and the Child Support Act more generally, indirectly the measures will assist by encouraging parents to take responsibility for the financial support of their children, by paying their outstanding child support liabilities voluntarily and on time. Child poverty is a wider issue than child support as poverty can also arise when parents live together. While there is some international evidence to show that a child support pass-on system can improve collection rates and help alleviate child poverty in certain circumstances, its introduction would involve a very significant fiscal cost to the Government. This cost would be reduced only if benefits were wholly or partly offset against child support payments received, similar to that which already occurs. The Crown entitlement recapture that has occurred in each of the past six years below shows the potential amounts that could be involved for a full child support pass-on system. Child support year Crown recapture ($m) Proportion collected 100% estimated ($m) 2007 161.0 83.48% 192.9 2008 152.1 80.56% 188.8 2009 152.2 77.57% 196.2 2010 161.2 74.97% 215.0 2011 159.9 72.08% 221.8 2012 155.5 67.01% 232.1 As noted, these amounts would be reduced if the pass-on was in some way restricted, or if associated cost savings arose for the Government from a reduction in other benefits being made at the same time (for example, special needs grants). The amount reduced would depend on the ultimate make-up of any package designed, but the net overall cost would still represent a significant cost to the Government. Offsetting benefit payments against child support received would create uncertainty, and in some cases hardship, for beneficiaries and their children, as the overall amount they received would be dependent on whether and how promptly the other parent paid his or her child support contribution. 10 Pass-on is often cited as a way of encouraging parents to pay their child support payments as the payment goes to the other parent or caregiver, rather than to the Crown. A point to note is that pass-on does not necessarily ensure that child support payments are applied for the benefit of the child and this may, as one submission noted, cause additional tensions between some parents. To the extent that pass-on is used to assist collection, officials note that collection of child support is traditionally high in New Zealand by international standards – with around 89 percent of all core assessment collected over time. Officials note that if further measures were to be considered to help alleviate child poverty, this should ideally be considered in a wider context than just when parents live apart. This work would likely need to be co-ordinated by the Ministry of Social Development, and consider a number of measures. In that context, it should be noted that the Government is soon to release its White Paper for Vulnerable Children. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Guaranteed child support payments (also referred to as the “advanced payment scheme”) Submissions (Matter raised primarily by Office of the Children’s Commission, Lesley Patterson, Prue Hyman, Equal Justice Project, Women’s Studies Association) The Crown should automatically advance child support payments to receiving parents to avoid the instability and delay of payments to parents. The Crown would then recoup any child support payments received. Comment The domestic purposes benefit already effectively guarantees payments for basic necessities to a child’s caregiver. Child support received from a paying parent is only passed on to the custodial parent if it is in excess of a domestic purposes benefit received. When caregivers are not receiving a benefit, child support is only paid to the custodial parent once it is received by Inland Revenue. The child support scheme, both currently and proposed, does not provide any guaranteed payments as its aim is to set out and administer rights and obligations between the parents of a child. Extending the scheme to provide guaranteed payments would require a judgement call to be made in determining basic needs. This is not the role of the child support scheme. More targeted solutions (for example, special needs grants) assessed by the Ministry of Social Development are likely to be more appropriate in such circumstances. 11 A guaranteed payment in all cases where child support was not paid would be a significant risk for the Government and, in many cases, involve undue fiscal cost to the Crown – and, ultimately, for taxpayers. It could also have a negative effect on incentives for paying parents to pay on time. Various measures in the bill, including automatically deducting child support from all salary and wages, should facilitate timely payments to custodial parents. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Incorporating the promotion of child well-being as a core objective of the Child Support Act Submissions (Matter raised primarily by Auckland Coalition for Safety of Women and Children, Child Poverty Action Group, Dunedin Community Law Centre, Families Commission, Human Rights Commission, Law Society of New Zealand, Office of the Children’s Commissioner, Equal Justice Project, Women’s Studies Association) Consistent with Article 3 of UNCROC, the bill should require that the Child Support Act’s objects provision be amended to incorporate a child’s best interests. Comment There was concern in some submissions that the bill proposed removing section 4(c) of the Child Support Act that affirmed the rights of caregivers of children to receive financial support for those children from their non-custodial parents. Although it is proposed that this objective be removed, it is to be replaced by new section 4(fa) in the bill that proposes the insertion of the following objective that is essentially the same, only using updated terms: ―To affirm the rights of carers who provide significant care of children to receive financial support in respect of those children from a parent or parents of the children.‖ It has also been submitted that this should be extended further. For example:  The Human Rights Commission and Law Commission contend that the objects provision should be amended to require that financial arrangements made to support a child reflect and promote a child’s needs and best interests.  The Office of the Children’s Commissioner proposes that the objective should be ―to affirm the right of children to be maintained by their parents and the promotion of their on-going wellbeing and healthy development following parental separation‖ and ―to require that, in all decisions and actions made under the Act, the welfare and best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.‖ 12 Including overarching objectives in the Child Support Act that are specifically centred on the welfare and best interests of the child would not fit well within the Child Support Act and the child support scheme more generally. This is because the Child Support Act is fundamentally about the payment and receipt of child support. While an effective child support scheme that collects and distributes financial support efficiently is undoubtedly in a child’s best interest, making this an explicit objective would place the administrator of the Act, Inland Revenue, in the position of having to establish in each child support case, whether the individual measures in the Act, on their own, achieved that objective. The British example given by the Office of the Children’s Commissioner highlights this point, as the object in that case is limited to ―.... the exercise of any discretionary power conferred by this Act .... shall have regard to the welfare of the child likely to be affected by his decision.‖ While in principle this type of more restricted objective may be desirable, it should be noted that even extending the objectives that far would, implicitly, require Inland Revenue to consider what is in the best interest of the child – an area of judgement that the department may not be best placed to make. To that end, one option that could be considered would be for Inland Revenue to consult with a body better placed to determine the welfare and needs of children (for example, the Children’s Commissioner) before setting any administrative guidelines relating to the exercise of a discretionary power conferred to it under the Child Support Act. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. It is recommended that when Inland Revenue sets administrative guidelines relating to the exercise of any discretionary power conferred to it under the Child Support Act, it should first consult with the Children’s Commissioner. Issue: The 28 percent care threshold at which recognition is given in the proposed child support formula is too low Submissions (Matter primarily raised by Auckland Coalition for Safety of Women and Children, Auckland Women’s Centre, Child Poverty Action Group, Dunedin Community Law Centre, Francis and Julia Quirke, Prue Hyman, Suzanne Edwards) The proposed care threshold at which recognition is first given in the proposed child support formula is too low, and does not take into account that the primary financial burden for many costs remains with the principal caregiver. Comment In proposing the 28 percent level at which care should be recognised for child support purposes, the following criteria were taken into account: 13  the level of regular and shared care that starts to give rise to dual costs;  how the extra costs are borne by each parent;  the degree of complexity that the child support scheme should reasonably bear;  the financial impact of any change, as it affects paying parents, receiving parents, children, and when the child support offsets benefit payments, the Government;  the degree to which the approach encourages paying parents to comply; and  the costs involved in implementing the approach. Various levels of care were considered to provide recognition to those paying parents who provide high levels of care, but who are unable to satisfy the current 40 percent of nights shared-care threshold or ―substantially equal‖ care test. In addition to the option proposed (to recognise, on a tiered basis, care in excess of 28 percent – on average two nights a week), the following options were also considered:  care in excess of 14 percent of care (on average one night a week);  care in excess of one-third of care (to align with Working for Families tax credits); and  retaining the current 40 percent of care threshold. Recognition at 14 percent is the threshold adopted in some other jurisdictions (for example, in Australia and Britain). Although this option would provide recognition to more paying parents who care for their children, it may be seen as too generous, particularly if the majority of everyday and other significant one-off costs are still borne by receiving parents. It would also involve a greater fiscal cost as more child support liabilities would be reduced, thereby further reducing the amount received by the Government to offset benefit payments to receiving parents. Conversely, providing recognition at a higher threshold may mean that parents who incur a significant level of care and its associated costs are not provided with any recognition for the care they provide. There is no one correct level of care, it is instead ultimately a question of judgement based on the criteria noted above. There is general agreement that the costs associated with shared care of a child are higher than when one parent has sole care. The major cause is the need to duplicate housing and related costs, such as utilities, household furnishings, play and study space, toys and play equipment, and additional transport costs. However there is no specific New Zealand data on the differences in costs, and who bears the costs, between shared care levels at 40 percent and 28 percent. Research by Paul Henman for the Australian Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support has helped to provide some insight into the question of how additional costs are likely to be borne. The findings (illustrated below) show that sizable additional costs are likely to arise even when a parent has only a 20 percent share of a child’s care, implying that the shared-care threshold should be substantially lower than the 40 percent of nights currently used. 14 Estimated average shared care costs as proportion of 100 percent care situation in Australia Percentage of estimated average total costs incurred by each parent % of shared care Low Cost Modest Receiving parent Paying parent Receiving parent Paying parent 80:20 62 38 72 28 50:50 50 50 50 50 It is worth noting that the recognition provided to a parent in the proposed formula in the bill does depend on the level of care provided (the recognition being tiered), with 28 percent merely being the lowest qualifying care recognised. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The child support formula should not apply to equal shared-care situations Submissions (Matter primarily raised by Adam Simpson, Mark Richardson, Pam Hulls, Robert Montgomery, Sally Marr, Tim Monck-Mason, Troy Shoebridge) In cases where the care of a child is shared equally (50% each), the child support formula should not apply. 9999 137 159 71 38 87 60 137 143 175 159 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 % of care % costs Modest - one parentLow-cost, one parent Modest - both parentsLow-cost - both parents 205080 15 Comment The submissions received on this point are based on the premise that as the parents are sharing the care of the child and all the associated costs equally, there should be no need for any financial adjustment to be made between parents. This approach ignores the possibility of parents having materially different incomes and, therefore, materially different expenditures to support their children. The essential features of the proposed formula are that:  the deemed expenditure for raising children directly reflects both parents’ income; and  this expenditure is distributed between parents according to their respective share of that combined income and their level of care of the child. The aim of the new formula is to replicate, as far as possible, the financial arrangements that would exist if the parents were living together (notwithstanding that separation often causes a decline in parents’ living standards). Failure to do this may ultimately result in an unfair outcome for the parents and a significant drop in living standards for the children. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Transitional issues for departures Submission (Matter raised by the New Zealand Law Society) It is unclear whether the bill will apply retrospectively if there is a successful application for a departure from an assessment that extends beyond the implementation date for the new formula. The existing departures should remain in place until the order expires or there is a further application for variation or discharge. Comment It is agreed that transitional provisions will be required to deal with existing applications for a departure from an assessment arising from an administrative review that extends beyond the implementation date for the new formula. Although Inland Revenue is currently discouraging departures that go beyond the likely implementation date, some may remain. As noted in the Law Society’s submission, for some parents the departure may no longer be appropriate when the new formula is in place, while for others the rationale for a departure may still be valid. 16 It is therefore recommended that the new formula apply from the implementation date, in the first instance, for departures arising from administrative reviews that extend beyond the implementation date. However, it is also recommended that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be given the discretion to continue, where appropriate, with existing departures that go beyond the implementation date when the departure is based on issues or elements that are not taken into account in the new formula calculation. For court-ordered departures that go beyond the implementation date, it is recommended that these orders should continue until the order expires or one of the parties applies for another departure order or applies to vary the order in some other way. Recommendation That the submission be partially accepted, with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue given the discretion to continue with existing departures arising from administrative reviews that go beyond the implementation date when the departure is based on issues that are not taken into account under the new formula. For court-ordered departures that go beyond the implementation date, it is recommended that these orders should continue until the order expires or one of the parties applies for another departure order. Issue: Privacy and cultural concerns with the automatic deduction of child support from paying parents’ salary and wages Submissions (Matter primarily raised by the Legislation Advisory Committee, Mark Richardson, Sally Marr, Troy Shoebridge) Concerns have been raised about the automatic deduction of child support from paying parents’ salary and wages, which could result in privacy and cultural issues with employers having knowledge of employees’ child support details. Comment Although the Office of the Privacy Commissioner had concerns with the automatic deduction of child support from paying parents’ salary and wages, on balance they concluded that the public benefit (including the desire to prevent people from falling into arrears and debt) appeared to justify the privacy impacts on compliant individuals. Recognising that some employees may rightly have legitimate concerns about employers being informed of their child support affairs, however, it is recommended that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be given the discretion where there are legitimate privacy, cultural or other concerns, and alternative payment options have been provided, not to automatically deduct child support payments from salary and wages. 17 Recommendation That the submissions be partially accepted, with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue given the discretion, where there are legitimate privacy, cultural or other concerns, and alternative payment options have been provided, not to automatically deduct child support payments from salary and wages. Issue: The proposed child support formula is too complex Submission (Matter raised primarily by the New Zealand Law Society) The proposed child support formula is too complex and should be simplified so that it reflects the intentions of a child support scheme – one that is simple, efficient, equitable and transparent. For example, consideration should be given to reducing the split for the percentages of average weekly earnings used in proposed new schedule 2 in the bill to three groupings. Comment Although individual elements of the proposed child support formula could, in theory, be considered in isolation, taking all the elements into account results in a more cohesive and comprehensive change to the formula that incorporates:  estimated average expenditures for raising children;  varying levels of care; and  the income of both parents. Incorporating just one or two of these options would limit the overall impact and effectiveness of any changes and would, in officials’ view, represent a significantly less comprehensive, equitable and transparent solution. Sacrificing this for greater simplicity is not recommended. It should also be noted that 69 percent of respondents to the online consultation undertaken thought that all the factors should be used to determine child support payments. That said, the proposed child support formula is more complex, particularly when a parent has multiple relationships, than the one currently used. However, parents or other affected parties will not be expected to undertake the calculations themselves. Inland Revenue’s systems will undertake all calculations required to determine liabilities and entitlements. For parents and other carers wishing to undertake their own estimations, comprehensive, yet easy-to-use online calculators, will be provided, together with explanations of the principles sitting behind the calculations and worked examples. This will assist transparency, subject to privacy constraints, such as not revealing the income of the other parent. 18 In these circumstances, reducing the split for the percentages of average weekly earnings used in schedule 2, for example, would not make the changes any simpler. Further, the approach proposed is, in officials’ view, preferable to starting from the basis of a more simple formula, and moving on to cater for different circumstances at a later date. Adopting this approach would lead to more confusion for parents, as the law (setting out the basis for child support calculations) would change on a regular basis. It would also lead to significant system and administrative concerns for Inland Revenue in implementing an ever-changing child support scheme. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but it be noted that parents or other affected parties will not be expected to undertake the child support formula calculations themselves. Inland Revenue’s systems will undertake these calculations to determine all liabilities and entitlements. Issue: Ability for parents to enter into binding voluntary agreements Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Currently, voluntary agreements made between parents can be displaced by a successful formula assessment application for child support under the Child Support Act. It is submitted that, if the receiving party is not in receipt of a social security benefit for a child, voluntary and independent agreements made between parents should be binding until the parties or the Family Court agree to vary the agreement. If the recipient becomes a beneficiary, then the formula assessment could be made at that time. Alternatively, consideration should be given to adopting a two-tiered approach which would provide for:  a binding child support agreement only where each party has received independent legal advice; and  a child support agreement that is more flexible and which is designed for parties not ready to bind to a long-term commitment. Comment Officials support the tenet and substance of this submission and agree that wherever possible, it is better for parents to reach a mutually agreeable outcome without redress to the child support scheme. There are, however, some potential questions that would need to be carefully considered before this measure could be implemented – for example, what would constitute a binding agreement for child support purposes, where the boundaries between binding and non-binding agreements would lie, and how such a provision would interact with the Care of Children Act 2004 and the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. 19 Concerns around the ability of one parent to potentially exert undue pressure on another would also need to be dealt with, along with the potential consequences of one party’s situation (for example, their financial position) changing considerably after an agreement has been entered into. Officials support this submission in principle and consider that it is an issue worth considering further, but that further detailed policy work should be undertaken first. To that end, it is recommended that Inland Revenue discuss this matter with the Ministry of Justice with a view to reporting back to Ministers on next steps. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that Inland Revenue discuss this matter with the Ministry of Justice to identify whether further policy work is needed and, if so, report to joint Ministers on next steps. Issue: “Cost of children” calculations for children under five Submissions (Matter primarily raised by Child Poverty Action Group, Maxine Ford, F&J Quirke) The ―cost of children‖ calculations contained in schedule 2 of the bill do not sufficiently cater for children under the age of five, either in terms of the opportunity cost of foregone earnings associated with looking after young children or, alternatively, the high cost of childcare. Comment The table that forms the basis of schedule 2 in the bill endeavours to provide for childcare, and some degree of lost earnings, by applying the higher cost of raising 5 to 12 year olds also to 0 to 4 year olds (given that childcare costs are likely to be highest for very young children). Given data constraints, estimates of the cost of raising children in New Zealand did not separately calculate the costs of raising children in the 0 to 4 year age group. However, we note that the Australian studies undertaken for the purposes of designing their child support formula did include a more detailed age breakdown. Research undertaken in 2005 indicated that, for middle income (A$50,000–$60,000) families, the costs associated with raising a child aged 0 to 4 years was, as a percentage of income, between 4 to 8% lower than the cost of raising a child in the 5 to 12 year old group, as follows: 20 Gross costs of children as a percentage of gross family income Number of children 0-4 age range 5-12 age range 1 10% 14% 2 16% 22% 3 20% 28% 4+ 24% 33% These costs do not include childcare costs or opportunity costs, such as forgone earnings while looking after children. Conversely, they do not take into account childcare subsidies. Given that New Zealand’s study produced broadly consistent results to those of Australia, there is no reason to assume that this lower cost for 0 to 4 year olds would not also exist in New Zealand. The Australian approach taken was to combine the two age bands and apply the percentages of the older group, which are higher, effectively providing some recognition of the costs of childcare that can be faced by the parent who has major care of a child under five and wishes to undertake paid work, and the opportunity costs that custodial parents face when children are very young. This approach has also been followed in the proposed New Zealand changes, in the child expenditure table contained in schedule 2 in the bill. Providing recognition beyond this level for indirect costs such as opportunity costs is a debatable issue given the purpose of the child support scheme is to focus on the direct cost of the child. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 21 OTHER POLICY MATTERS RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS Issue: Providing for a uniform commencement date of the proposed changes Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Currently, it is proposed that the amendments in the bill apply in two phases. All the changes should instead be introduced on the same date, rather than applied across two years (including bringing forward the reduction in the qualifying age for children from age 19 to 18). Comment The bill currently states that the new child support formula will apply for assessment periods from 1 April 2013, with all other changes to the child support scheme applying from 1 April 2014. It should be noted that these implementation dates are currently under discussion with Ministers, and are due to be considered by Cabinet in late September. Further details will therefore be submitted to the Committee once this consideration has taken place. Consideration was given to whether a single implementation would be preferable. Although introduction on a single date could potentially be less confusing, such an approach would be difficult for Inland Revenue to implement, given the significant number of projects it currently has underway. Consequently, split implementation dates continue to be the preferred approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: A parent’s adjusted taxable income should be calculated on the basis of a 37.5-hour working week Submission (New Zealand Law Society) A cap should be placed on the amount of adjusted taxable income so that the level of income available for use in an assessment reflects no more than the primary full-time income for a liable parent calculated on the basis of a 37.5-hour working week. 22 Comment Taking the income of both parents into account reflects the parents’ relative abilities to financially contribute towards the expenditure for raising their children. It also parallels the likely expenditure on the children were the parents living together. Limiting income on the basis of a set working week not only dilutes this principle but would also be less transparent and add a further layer of complexity to the formula. There is already provision in the bill for a parent to seek an administrative review of a child support assessment to take account of re-establishment costs incurred out of income that was earned in accordance with a pattern that was established after parents have separated (for example, from income earned from overtime). This relief, open for a period of three years post-separation, is for up to 30 percent of a parent’s income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: A Māori perspective should be taken into account Submission (New Zealand Law Society) A Māori perspective should be taken into account and included in the objectives of the bill – for example, in relation to questions over who may claim child support. Comment The issue of who may claim child support is worth considering further, but officials believe some further detailed policy work should be undertaken first. Currently, a person can claim child support if they are the sole or principal provider of care for a child (or share that role equally with someone else), but there are conflicting views about who should be able to claim child support. Many of the concerns that arise in this context extend beyond child support and encompass not only Māori issues, but also wider questions regarding child welfare. To that end, it is recommended that Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice and, where appropriate, Te Puni Kōkiri, work together to determine who should be able to claim child support, with a view of reporting back to Ministers on next steps. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and that Inland Revenue discuss this matter with the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice and, where appropriate, Te Puni Kōkiri, to identify whether further policy work is needed on this matter and, if so, to report to Ministers on next steps. 23 Issue: Allowing children to apply for child support in certain circumstances Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Consideration should be given to extending the class of person who may apply for a formula assessment to include children, in certain circumstances. Comment As previously noted, officials agree that some further detailed policy work should be undertaken on who should be able to claim child support. It was recommended that Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Justice work together on this issue with a view to reporting back to Ministers on next steps. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and that Inland Revenue discuss this matter with the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Justice to identify whether further policy work is needed on this matter and, if so, to report to Ministers on next steps. Issue: Factors used when establishing care levels Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Patricia Morrison) New section 15(5), that sets out the factors that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should use for determining proportions of care, should not include matters that fall within guardianship obligations. This is because such obligations tend to represent major decisions affecting a child’s life rather than day-to-day care responsibilities and decisions. The guardianship factors are contained in subsections (c), (d) and (f) and have regard to the education and health of the child, and which parent or carer pays for which expenses of the child. Comment Officials agree that the factors noted in this submission, together with factor (e), do tend to represent major decisions affecting a child’s life, rather than day-to-day care responsibilities and decisions, and should be omitted from section 15(5). It is additionally noted that the financial factors can often be taken into account during the administrative review process. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and also extended to include the factor in section 15(5)(e). 24 Issue: Right of review when determining care cost percentages Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 16 should be amended to provide that a person affected by the decision of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine their care cost percentage should have a right of objection or review. Comment New section 16 merely requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine, on the basis of the proportions of care already established under new section 14, a carer’s care cost percentage. This is done without discretion by applying the table in new schedule 1. It should also be noted that clause 16 of the bill proposes that section 90(1) of the Child Support Act be amended so that ―a decision under section 14 establishing the proportion of ongoing daily care that a carer provides to a qualifying child‖ becomes an appealable decision. This should effectively address the submitter’s point. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Dependent child allowance Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Step-children, foster children and children in whāngai situations should be included in the definition of ―dependent child‖. Comment New section 35 sets out the dependent child allowance a parent is entitled to for each dependent child that he or she is financially supporting. This submission notes that excluding step-children, for example, from the dependent child allowance goes against the objectives of the child support scheme. The approach taken towards foster and step-children is consistent with not including the income of a parent’s new partner when calculating child support. Also, a parent may not, in fact, support a step-child financially. 25 Officials consider that it is preferable to exclude step-children, foster children and children in whāngai situations from the definition of ―dependent child‖. The option of an administrative review remains open to those who feel that a departure from the child support formula assessment is warranted, on the basis that they have a duty to maintain another child or person. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Re-establishment costs Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The drafting in clause 26 should be simplified if possible (for example, the phrase ―a re- establishment costs situation‖ should be replaced with ―re-establishment‖). It is further submitted that:  Consideration be given to allowing a person to claim re-establishment costs even when they have not undertaken extra work, having instead relied on existing income to pay for the re-establishment.  The Commissioner of Inland Revenue be given the power to extend the three-year period in new section 105(2)(d) when it would be just and equitable to do so, and the costs remain actual and reasonable.  Consideration be given to providing a list in the Act detailing basic examples of re-establishment costs. Comment As previously noted, taking the income of both parents into account reflects the parents’ relative abilities to financially contribute towards the expenditure for raising their children, and also parallels likely expenditure on the children. This principle would be diluted if parents were allowed to claim re-establishment costs out of existing income, and would reduce the amount available to provide for children. There is an acceptance that standards of living for both parents will reduce when parents separate, with a period of re-establishment being the norm for both parents. Although noting that the three-year period proposed is necessarily arbitrary, it is preferable to limit the availability for relief to a specific period, otherwise there is a risk that costs for re-establishment will, over time, become everyday costs. On the question of providing a list of basic examples of re-establishment costs in the legislation, officials agree that examples would be helpful but consider that it is preferable that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue instead publish guidelines periodically on the types of expenditure that have generally been accepted as qualifying costs, rather than including less flexible legislative examples in the Act itself. 26 Recommendation That the submission on the drafting in clause 26 be noted, but that the other submissions be declined. Issue: Qualifying payments Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section 131, which gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue discretion to reduce the amount of child support that a parent pays in some circumstances so it takes into account certain direct payments made to other parties, should be amended as follows:  A person affected by the Commissioner’s decision will have a right of objection, and that an agreement reached with the receipt of independent legal advice will create a rebuttable presumption that the agreement will be upheld. Alternatively, legal advice should be a factor that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue takes into account when exercising the discretion.  The Commissioner of Inland Revenue be given discretion to ―recognise‖ payments for more than one child-support year, subject to the ability to reverse the decision when circumstances change.  Section 130(2) and (3) be included in section 131 rather than section 130. Comment Given that the parties involved must reach agreement on the terms of the arrangement in the first place, there appears to be no need for the further ability to object. Officials do, however, agree with the other recommendations. Recommendation That the submission to give a right of objection be declined, but the other submissions accepted. Issue: Non-compliance without reasonable cause with previous payment agreements Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 135AA, which allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to decline to enter into a payment agreement with a liable person when the person has breached a previous agreement, should be amended to give a right of objection to the liable person if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue declines to enter into a payment arrangement. 27 Comment The right of the receiving carer to timely financial support needs to be balanced against a liable parent’s obligations when they have failed to pay their liability in full and on time. Conferring a right of objection to the Commissioner’s refusal to accept periodic payment agreements in the face of a previous failure to adhere to arrangements would restrict the Commissioner’s right to enforce payment by way of lump-sum and/or legal action. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Other “cost of children” issues Submission (Matter primarily raised by Deidre Butler) The ―cost of children‖ calculations do not graduate sufficiently against high income earners. Comment Recent New Zealand research on the costs of raising children – Costs of raising children 1 – measured the expenditure for raising children in New Zealand for the purposes of the proposed formula. It used methodology from equivalent Australian studies, but with New Zealand data. The results show that the average expenditure for raising children in New Zealand varies according to the age of the child, the household’s level of income and the number of children in the household. In particular, higher income households are found to spend more on their children than lower income households, although the proportion of household income spent is lower. These findings are reflected in the cost of children calculations contained in schedule 2 of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 1 Costs of raising children, by Iris Claus, Paul Kilford, Geoff Leggett and Xin Wang. 28 Issue: Living allowances Submissions (Matter primarily raised by Robert Montgomery, Patricia Morrison) The living allowances used to calculate the cost of children are not sufficient and should be increased, in particular if there is equal 50/50 care. Alternatively, it is suggested that both amounts of living allowance be used in all cases (for example, if one parent cannot use their allowance, any remainder should be transferred to the other parent). A (private) submission also recommended that the current system, whereby there are various living allowances depending on circumstances, be retained. Comment A living allowance provides a deduction against child support income for parents, and recognises the living costs for that parent. This is necessarily a proxy, as parents’ true living costs will depend on their circumstances. Under the proposals, the allowance for most people will be equivalent to the amount payable under the domestic purposes benefit to a person with one or more dependent children. Parents receiving a higher domestic purposes benefit for looking after someone sick or infirm will be entitled to a higher allowance. These amounts are higher than the minimum amount provided in the existing child support scheme. There are no specific justifications for increasing the allowance when there is 50/50 care. The new formula separately takes into account the costs of care when care is shared. Also, transferring allowances between parents when one parent does not have sufficient income in order to use their full allowance would run contrary to the principle of apportioning the costs of children between parents according to the relative difference between their respective shares of child support income. It would also be extremely administratively complex, and require square-ups and reassessments. On the question of providing different living allowances depending on a parent’s circumstances, there is no need for this. Under the existing formula, the living allowance varies to reflect the number of dependent children. The dependent child allowance, under the proposed formula, is now separately provided. This allows a further deduction for expenditure associated with other children the parent is financially supporting. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 29 Issue: Determination of income for child-support purposes Submissions (Matter primarily raised by Adam Simpson, Doreen Cleave, Pam Hulls, Paul Raynor, Sally Marr) Several submissions provided comment and suggestions on how income should be determined for child support purposes. There was general approval of the new definition of ―adjusted taxable income‖ that ensures parents are assessed on their true financial capacity to pay when this is not reflected in their taxable income. One submission felt that this went too far and that parents should be able to operate a company on a more commercial basis, retaining profits to help grow their business. Other submissions, however, felt that the definition did not go far enough and that more should be done to ensure that the self-employed cannot shelter income in a company. Other submissions suggested that, rather than using taxable earnings, the basis should instead be on a parent’s ability to earn – thereby preventing parents from choosing not to work to reduce their child-support liability. Other methods proposed for determining child support payable included:  taking the assets of a parent into account; and  using a uniform cost of a child, rather than costs that vary with income. Comment The effect of the proposed ―adjusted taxable income‖ definition will be that the following will be included as income for the purposes of the child support formula:  business and other losses that have been offset against taxable income;  income from a trust and companies owned by trusts when the parent is the settlor;  income kept in a closely held company;  fringe benefits received by shareholder-employees who control the company;  overseas pensions that are exempt from New Zealand tax;  distributions from superannuation schemes that relate to contributions made by a person’s employer within the last two years, when the person has retired early;  PIE income that is not ―locked in‖;  tax-exempt salaries and wages;  50 percent of the value of private pensions/superannuation payments/annuities;  main income equalisation scheme deposits; and  other payments if the total exceeds $5,000 a year (this captures, for example, income received from a trust where the parent is not the settlor). 30 The first four adjustments, in particular, will ensure that it is more difficult for parents to shelter income. An administrative review is also available, including one initiated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, when a child support assessment does not take into account the income, earning capacity, property or financial resources of either parent. This administrative review ground also allows an assessment to be set that is based on a parent’s ability to earn. This is, in officials’ view, a preferable approach to handling situations when a person’s taxable income does not reflect their ability to earn, rather than legislating for a deemed income based on someone’s ability to earn. Likewise, this administrative review ground can also be used when a parent has significant property or financial resources. On the question of using a fixed uniform cost of a child, rather than one that varies with income, although this would be simpler to calculate, it would not reflect the findings of research that the dollar cost of raising children increases with family income (but declines as a proportion of income). It would also likely lead to further issues of equity or a parent’s ability to pay. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Treatment of the income of new partners Submissions (Matter primarily raised by Adam \[no surname provided\], Hayden Hughes, Raymond Porter) The income (or assets) of a new partner should be taken into account in the child support calculations. Comment The income of a new partner is not taken into account in the proposed child support formula. In some cases a new partner in effect becomes a parent, while in others, the parenting of the child in question will remain primarily with the separated parents. It is not possible to reflect this variance in a formula, particularly if the new partner also has personal child support liabilities. The administrative review process is, and will continue to be, available to parents who consider that a parent’s new partner’s circumstances should be taken into account. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 31 Issue: Qualifying age of children Submissions (Matter primarily raised by Andrew Parsons, Human Rights Commission, Dunedin Community Law Centre, Law Society of New Zealand) The provisions of the current Child Support Act whereby child support obligations continue until a child reaches age 19 are inconsistent with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. One submission suggested that child support should remain payable until children make the transition into the paid workforce (or tertiary education). Comment The proposal to reduce the qualifying age of a child from age 19 to age 18 unless the child is still in full-time secondary education is consistent with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. On the proposal that child support should remain payable until children make the transition into the paid workforce or tertiary education, it should be noted that children will still be qualifying children if they remain in full-time secondary education. The student loan and student allowances schemes are available for students in tertiary education. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Liable parents who live outside New Zealand Submissions (Matter raised by The Auckland Coalition for the Safety of Women and Children, the Auckland Women’s Centre) Further bilateral agreements on the recovery of child support, in addition to the existing agreement with Australia, should be entered into with other overseas jurisdictions (for example, with the United Kingdom). Comment A number of factors need to be considered when investigating whether two countries should enter into a reciprocal agreement. For some countries, the relatively small numbers of people involved may be an important factor. New Zealand has had discussions with several countries over the years, but Australia remains the only country with which we have a reciprocal agreement for child support purposes. 32 However, as a member state of The Hague Convention, New Zealand is actively involved in progressing the unification of the rules of private international law. As part of that, New Zealand was a signatory to the Hague Convention for the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention). The Convention, which includes rules on judicial and administrative co-operation, has the potential to improve New Zealand’s ability to assess and collect child support when liable parents are residing in countries that are (or will become in the future) signatories to the Convention. The Hague Convention Permanent Bureau is currently exploring how to implement country profiles electronically and develop a business plan for implementing its proposed system. Once these practical issues have been developed further, a national interest analysis will be produced to identify the pros and cons of the convention for New Zealand, detailing any legislative and system changes that would be required before the convention could be considered for ratification in New Zealand. From an operational standpoint, developing and enhancing partnerships to better address international child support debt and promote proactive compliance management is also a focus of Inland Revenue activity. This has included information-sharing with the New Zealand Customs Service and the establishment of a direct debt team that directly collects international debt from overseas. Recommendations That the submission be noted. Issue: Pass-on of penalties Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Initial and incremental late payment penalties should be passed on to the custodial parent provided that parent is not a beneficiary. This is on the basis that it is the receiving parent and their children that suffer from non-payment of child support, not the Crown. Further, the proposed penalty changes in this bill should be made retrospective to 26 September 2006 (the date the Child Support Amendment Act 2006 came into force). Comment While noting the merits for passing on child support penalties, it should be reiterated that the application of penalties for child support debt has three main purposes – a monetary sanction for not complying, compensation for the lack of use of funds and compensation for the additional administration costs incurred in recovering overdue debts. Currently, penalties help to defray the costs of administrative collection in the first instance. 33 Passing on penalties may create inconsistencies in the treatment between receiving parents, as the approach adopted by Inland Revenue in writing off penalties could affect the amounts actually received. As a result, receiving parents who were in otherwise identical situations could receive different amounts of support, depending on circumstances, resulting in potential equity issues. Further, passing on only a component to the receiving parent would make the child support scheme more complex to administer, and would require an appropriate rate to be passed on to be set (this would also need to be reviewed periodically). On balance, officials therefore recommend not passing on penalties to custodial parents. Officials consider that the penalty changes should not be made retrospective. There is no cohesive policy rationale for doing so, and there would be significant administrative and fiscal implications in backdating any changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of the multi-group cap Submissions (Equal Justice Project, the Women’s Studies Association) The application of the multi-group cap should be improved to better reflect the fact that in multi-group situations there may be no economies of scale. It is therefore proposed that the cap have safeguards that prevent affected children from receiving less financial support than is necessary (for example, by the cap not applying when a paying parent is liable for more than three children living in separate households). Comment It is recognised that in some multi-group situations the income-sharing principle, and the method of calculating the costs of children based on intact families, does not fit comfortably, but it is a matter of balancing this concern with simplicity. Arguably, in such circumstances it could be preferable to treat each receiving parent separately, calculating the liability to such parents using the standard formula, which is in effect what happens with the multi-group allowance. However, doing so would ignore the fact that the paying parent does not live in multiple households supporting each family separately. Hence the multi-group cap applies to limit the overall liability as if all the children lived in one household. Arguably, this is also a contrived result as the children do not live together with the attendant economies of scale. These generous economies of scale that the cap provides to the liable parent are tempered by the fact that the proposed multi-group cap only takes into account the income of the paying parent and therefore the paying parent does not benefit from a reduction in their liability if the income of any of the receiving parents increases. 34 While recognising its limitations, non-application of the cap where a paying parent is liable for more than three children would result in a different set of discrepancies for paying parents. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application of the minimum payment Submission (Stacey Porteus) The minimum payment should apply to each child, rather than to the liable parent. Comment The current scheme provides that there is a minimum amount of child support payable each year per parent. It is recommended that this provision be retained to limit the impact of the changes on low-income recipients. While applying a minimum payment for each child may be a positive outcome in theory, in practice it would either require a reduction to be made to the applicable minimum amount payable per child or alternatively, result in child support liabilities that significantly exceed a parent’s ability to pay when a parent has to support several children (possibly leading to non-payment). Either option is likely to be to the detriment of the children involved. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Child support payments should be linked to contact with children Submission (Peter Douglas Zohrab) Child support payments should be proportionately linked to the amount of contact a liable parent has with their children. 35 Comment While recognising the difficulties associated with care of children problems, and the disincentive that a lack of contact can have on making child support payments, the child support scheme is fundamentally about establishing the amount of financial support that parents living apart have to pay towards raising their children. The two issues are therefore separate. It should be noted, however, that the proposals in the bill will provide a level of recognition to parents who have significant levels of care. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Introduction of a simplified appeal process Submission (Wayne Hulls) A simplified ―small claims court‖-type function should be introduced for child support issues. Comment It should be noted that the administrative review process that is currently in place under the Child Support Act, effectively already serves such a function. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repayments under the student loan scheme Submission (Matter raised primarily by the New Zealand Union of Students’ Association) Repayments under the student loan scheme should be considered as a reduction in income for child support purposes. Comment One of the arguments submitted for taking student loan repayments into account is the fact that student loan repayments are frequently deducted from salary and wages at source. The submission argues that it effectively adds to an individual’s effective marginal tax rate. It is also submitted that deducting loan repayments would be treated in the same way as a loan taken out for a business venture. 36 Income for child support purposes is based on gross income. No deduction is given for taxes. Further, the fact that student loan repayments are deducted directly from salary and wages is not unique. Many people have other deductions at source, such as KiwiSaver contributions. The main factor for determining whether such costs should be deductible is the fact that student loan repayments are made in relation to personal expenses – in that way, they are more akin to mortgage repayments. Using the same analogy, student loan repayments are often just in relation to the loan itself as there is often no interest applied. These repayments are more capital in nature, and would therefore not attract a business deduction. It is worth noting that, in any case, the bill actually proposes adding back business and other losses that have been offset against taxable income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Post-implementation review Submission (Matter raised primarily by the Human Rights Commission) Inland Revenue should conduct a post-implementation review of any changes implemented. Comment Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluation and review of any child support changes would take place under the Government’s generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage. This involves a post- implementation review of legislation and the subsequent identification of any problems that transpire. In practice, any changes identified from a post-implementation review would be added to the Government’s tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP again. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Officials envisage this process being followed for the child support changes included in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted, recognising that post-implementation reviews are part of the GTPP. 37 Issue: Better alignment with Working for Families tax credits Submission (Matter predominantly raised by the Child Poverty Action Group) There should be greater alignment (of the child support reforms) with Working for Families tax credits, in particular with regard to shared-care thresholds and the definition of ―income‖. Comment One of the policy rationales for the proposed lowering of the shared-care threshold is to move it generally closer to the tests used in other areas of social policy. However, child support is separate from Working for Families tax credits and other family-based tax credits and, while it is sometimes simpler to have thresholds that match, it is not always possible, necessary or desirable. Working for Families tax credits has a one-third of time threshold. Consideration was given to a similar threshold for child support but there was concern over the ―cliff effect‖ that would result. To reduce this effect, a series of thresholds is proposed. In the case of the proposed child support shared-care thresholds, these are tiered, commencing from 28 percent of care. The proposed definition of ―income‖ for child support purposes provides a very close alignment with the definition used for Working for Families tax credit purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 38 ADDITIONAL MATTERS RAISED BY THE SOCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE The following matters were raised specifically by the Social Services Committee (the Committee) during the hearing of evidence on submissions, and are not otherwise discussed in relation to the written submissions summarised above. Issue: United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child obligations Submission It was noted that New Zealand has obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee asked, in terms of the proposals in the bill:  What would this mean in terms of New Zealand’s obligations under the convention?  What would New Zealand need to do to ensure it complies with its obligations under the convention? Comment The Human Rights Commission, in its submission on the bill, specifically noted three Articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child that applied. They are:  Article 1, which provides that: ―child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier‖.  Article 3, which provides that: ―In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration‖.  Article 18, which provides that: ―Parties shall use their best efforts to ensure recognition of the principle that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child. Parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians, have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child. The best interests of the child will be their basic concern‖. While recognising that the proposals in the bill are consistent with or enhance New Zealand’s compliance with Articles 1 and 18 of the Convention, the Commission felt that the bill should amend the objects provision of the Child Support Act to require that financial arrangements made to support a child reflect and promote a child’s best interests, consistent with Article 3 of the Convention. (See officials’ earlier comments and recommendation on this submission on ―Incorporating the promotion of child well- being as a core objective of the Child Support Act‖.) 39 Issue: Questions asked by the Auckland Coalition for the Safety of Women and Children and the Auckland Women’s Centre Submission The Auckland Coalition for the Safety of Women and Children and the Auckland Women’s Centre, in addition to their submissions, posed a number of additional questions. Comment Officials’ comments on the questions are as follows: Q1: There is a perception amongst single mothers that the Child Support Agency makes vigorous attempts to enforce payments from liable parents when the other parent is on the DPB, but not when the other parent is not on a benefit. Does the Child Support Agency have any data in this area? A: Inland Revenue does not differentiate according to whether a parent is on a benefit when attempting to enforce child support payments from liable parents. Q2: International research has found that women experience a 30 percent decline in income in the first year after separation, while men experience a 10-15 percent increase (St John, 1995). There is an urgent need for New Zealand research on this topic before the proposed changes are undertaken which will make separated mothers worse off financially. A: Inland Revenue is not aware of other more recent research on this specific issue. In respect of the proposed changes to the child support formula, taking both paying and receiving parents into account, it is projected that approximately 26,000 female parents would receive more or pay less child support and approximately 31,500 female parents would receive less or pay more child support. Approximately 83,000 parents would be unaffected – for example, receiving parents who remain on a sole parent benefit would continue to receive full benefit levels. Q3: We know that when parents make arrangements outside of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), these arrangements provide for considerably higher payments for children than when arranged by IRD. Payments organised outside the IRD are a median of $433 per month, while payments organised with IRD assistance are $241 per month. What are the factors that account for this difference? A: There will inherently be a greater degree of trust and ability to work together when parents are able to make their own financial arrangements. It is not known what the factors are that account for any difference in payments. However, a potential factor could be that the income levels are lower for paying parents in the child support scheme, and these are reflected in lower child support payments. As at 31 March 2011, approximately 42 percent of paying parents in the child support scheme were receiving a Government benefit. 40 Q4: What percentage of parents pay the allowable minimum because they have declared a very low income. (In 1997, it was a considerable 65 percent of the liable parents whose income was assessed by IRD.) A: In 2011, approximately 56 percent of paying parents were required to pay the minimum payment. Q5: The bill claims that in 2006 IRD was given the ability to review a child support assessment if an investigation into a paying parent’s financial affairs shows the assessment does not reflect the parent’s true ability to provide financial support. IRD claims that this is a very useful tool that enables it to counter the use of vehicles such as trusts to shelter income for child support purposes. What data is there to support this claim?” A: Every year approximately 300 cases are reviewed to establish whether a Commissioner-initiated administrative review (CIAR) should be instigated. Every year, this leads to approximately 20 administrative review cases. These typically represent cases when income is sheltered for child support and social policy purposes and does not include cases where the custodian has, for whatever reason, instructed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to stop the CIAR process themselves. Q6: What are the implications for discrimination through implementation of the bill under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and what is the best way to ensure that children and primary caregivers do not suffer from discrimination through existing child support legislation and through any changes to the legislation? We would like to see a report from the Human Rights Commission on this topic. A: The bill has been vetted for New Zealand Bill of Rights Act implications. For further details, please see: http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human- rights/bill-of-rights/child-support-amendment-bill The Human Rights Commission made a submission on the bill, commented on elsewhere in this report. Q7: The bill is based on the belief that fathers provide more caregiving to their children than was the case in 1991. What evidence is there of this? If there is evidence that they do provide more caregiving, what do we know about this caregiving? How much more caregiving do they provide now than in the past? What does it involve? For instance, does it involve taking children to doctor’s appointments? Does it involve paying for extra school activities? A: In 2008 the Families Commission commissioned Colmar Brunton to undertake high-level research into a number of issues relating to separated parents. The Families Commission then released an issues paper entitled What separating parents need when making care arrangements for their children. The research yielded the following information on care and contact arrangements: 41  51.9 percent of parents who pay child support (through voluntary arrangements as well as through the child support scheme) say they see their child at least a few days per fortnight, compared with 41.2 percent of receiving parents who say their child sees the paying parent at least a few days a fortnight (an average of 44.1 percent across both parent groups).  48.3 percent of parents who pay child support (again, through voluntary arrangements as well as through the child support scheme) say their child stays overnight at their house at least a few days per fortnight, compared with 32.0 percent of receiving parents who say their child stays overnight at the paying parent’s home at least a few days a fortnight (an average of 36.4 percent). Care and contact arrangements vary depending on personal circumstances – in particular, based on whether parents can achieve agreement on these arrangements. The type of arrangements made by paying parents include:  taking their child to school and also picking them up from after-school activities (47 percent for parents with voluntary arrangements, compared with 35 percent for those in the child support scheme);  picking their child up from school (45 percent for parents with voluntary arrangements, compared with 36 percent for those in the child support scheme); and  taking care of their child while the other parent meets work commitments (43 percent for parents with voluntary arrangements, compared with 31 percent for those in the child support scheme). The research did not comment on which parents tended to take children to doctor’s appointments or extra-curricular activities, but a significant portion did note that paying parents paid for such things, indicating their involvement. Q8: The bill proposes that the per-child payment decreases when more than one child is involved. Do we know that economies of scale apply to the cost of raising children? A: Research undertaken internationally, including in New Zealand and Australia, (noted elsewhere in this report), shows that economies of scale do apply to the cost of raising children. Q9: The Trapski report (1994) found that the Child Support Act allows wealthy and self-employed liable parents to conceal their income through trusts and other devices, thereby escaping liability for child support payments (McLoughlin, 1995). The report recommended that when the Child Support Agency was looking at the liable parent’s ability to pay it should look not only at taxable income, but also at earning capacity, property and financial resources. In 2006, IRD was given the ability to review a child support assessment if an investigation into a paying parent’s financial affairs showed that the assessment did not reflect the parent’s true ability to provide financial support. Is there an evaluation of whether this has been a useful tool that enables IRD to counter the use of vehicles such as trusts to shelter parental income for child support purposes? 42 A: See the response to question 5 above. It should also be noted that the effect of the proposed ―adjusted taxable income‖ definition proposed in the bill will be that the following will all be included as income for the purposes of the child support formula:  business and other losses that have been offset against taxable income;  income from a trust and companies owned by trusts when the parent is the settlor;  income kept in a closely held company;  fringe benefits received by shareholder-employees who control the company;  overseas pensions that are exempt from New Zealand tax;  distributions from superannuation schemes that relate to contributions made by a person’s employer within the last two years, when the person has retired early;  PIE income that is not ―locked in‖;  tax-exempt salaries and wages;  50 percent of the value of private pensions/superannuation payments/annuities;  main income equalisation scheme deposits; and  other payments if the total exceeds $5,000 a year (this captures, for example, income received from a trust where the parent is not the settlor). Issue: Application of the shared-care formula in shared-care situations Submission If you have a shared-care arrangement, is there a formula that could be used to combine both parents’ incomes to determine where a child would sit relative to the income stream, the total cost of child support, and then how that total cost of child support could be apportioned on a pro-rata basis? If so, how would that child support liability compare with the liability under the current child support calculation? Comment The proposed child support formula in the bill aims to achieve all these objectives, including in shared-care situations. 43 Currently, in shared-care situations (when the 40 percent care threshold is achieved), parents are able to cross-apply against each other. This has the effect of recognising both parents’ income. The proposed formula in the bill, in addition to recognising both sets of income, not only takes into account the level of care provided by each parent, but also reflects up-to-date estimates of the costs of raising children at different income levels. Issue: Household incomes Submission What work has been done on including the income of new partners, and are there jurisdictions which operate on the basis of household bands? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach? Comment Officials are not aware of any jurisdictions that operate an administrative scheme that automatically takes into account the whole income of a household. Instead, it is typical for child support schemes to only take the income of the child’s parents into account, and not that of any new partners the parents may have. As noted in the officials’ comment on submissions on this issue, sometimes a new partner in effect becomes a parent, while for others the parenting of the child in question will remain primarily with the separated parents. The presumption in child support schemes is that the biological parents will generally have the responsibility to support their children. Since it is not possible to reflect such different approaches in a formula, the proposed formula in the bill (and the existing formula) only takes into account the income of parents. It should be noted that the administrative review process is, and will continue to be, available to parents who consider that a parent’s new partner’s circumstances should be taken into account. Again, this approach is consistent with other child support schemes, both of an administrative and court-based nature. Issue: Expenditure for raising children in different family circumstances Submission Does the new system proposed under the bill accurately reflect the expenditure for raising children in different family circumstances in New Zealand? 44 Comment Any child support formula is necessarily a proxy that tries to derive an appropriate cost (expressed as a percentage of income) that represents the assumed expenditure for raising a child. The proposed formula far better reflects that expenditure for raising children in different family circumstances in New Zealand than the current formula. As noted in previous comments on submissions, there is a significant amount of available research into the expenditure of raising children, including recent New Zealand and Australian work undertaken for child support purposes. The proposed system, designed against the backdrop of this research, specifically takes into account:  the combined income of both parents;  the number of children, up to three children;  the age of the children concerned; and  other dependent children. Although there are some inherent limitations – for example, some difficulties exist in larger multi-group situations, these are problems that would be difficult to overcome with any formula assessment. In circumstances where the formula assessment may not be considered to support an appropriate outcome, the option of an administrative review is often available for parents so individual circumstances can be taken into account. Issue: Incentives to pay child support Submission Do the provisions in the bill provide a great enough incentive for payments to be made in order to promote the welfare of the child (in the context of an alternative proposal to provide for guaranteed payments, also described as an ―advanced payment scheme‖)? Comment Some parents have concerns that the current child support scheme does not take into account their particular circumstances, or that the principles on which the scheme is based are now out of date. These concerns, or even perceptions of such concerns, often undermine parents’ incentives to meet their obligations under the child support scheme, to the detriment of the children involved. Other parents are concerned about either the non-payment of child support or the instability of such payments. The proposals in the bill are designed to increase incentives to meet child support obligations. Those incentives include creating a scheme that is seen as a fair reflection of the expenses of raising children, which is well administered and that applies appropriate sanctions for non-payment. Parents are more likely to comply if a scheme is perceived as fair. 45 Various measures in the bill, including automatically deducting child support from all salary and wages, will also help timely payments to custodial parents. In terms of an alternative option to also provide for what is referred in submissions as an ―advanced payment scheme‖, whereby child support payments are guaranteed by the Crown, this could actually have the effect of reducing the incentive to pay. If a parent knows that their child will receive child support regardless of whether they pay or not, this may well reduce their inclination to pay. It would also involve a significant fiscal cost to the Crown. Issue: Administrative effect of the changes on Inland Revenue Submission What are the administrative effects on Inland Revenue of the following:  administering a scheme based on the formula in the bill, including costs associated with informing the public and its clients of the changes and their impact;  costs for training existing call centre staff or hiring new call centre staff;  costs associated with changes to the IT system to ensure that it is able to cope with the changes and capacity demand; and  any other additional implementation costs. Comment A business case incorporating all these issues is due to be considered by Cabinet late September. The information will, therefore, be submitted to the Committee once this consideration has taken place. Issue: Capacity to pay Submission Under what circumstances can a parent’s capacity to pay be taken into account when an administrative review has been applied for, particularly in terms of potential earnings? Comment The Child Support Act provides that an administrative review is available when, ―by virtue of special circumstances ... formula assessment of child support assessment would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child because of the income, earning capacity, property, and financial resources of either parent or the child‖. 46 In practice, once a hearing has been held, the administrative review officer considers all the information given by both parents as well as any information already held by Inland Revenue (including, for example, tax information held). The review officer looks at each case on its own merits and how any decision to depart from a formula assessment might affect the child(ren) and both parents (after establishing that special circumstances to depart from the formula do in fact exist). The ability of a parent to earn more income than they currently do would not necessarily, in itself, justify a departure. Review officers would look at the individual circumstances of each case, and listen to the evidence of both parties, before making a decision. This would involve looking at the evidence of parents’ previous incomes. Issue: How the child support formula works in more complex situations Submission How, in detail, does the proposed child support formula work when more complex and unique situations are involved? Comment The chart below highlights the key steps in determining child support payable for a particular child (referenced to the proposed new sections of the Act). Step 1: Work out each parent’s child support income amount (section 32). This is the parent’s taxable income plus adjustments to take into account a number of other forms of ―income‖ (section 33), less: - a living allowance (section 34); - any allowance for other dependent children (section 35); and - any allowance for other children from other relationships (referred to as child support groups) for whom the parent is financially responsible (section 36) ↓ Step 2: Work out the parents’ combined child support income ↓ Step 3: Work out each parent’s income percentage (section 31) ↓ Step 4: Work out each parent’s and non-parent carer’s percentage of care for the child ↓ Step 5: Work out each parent’s and non-parent carer’s care cost percentage for the child (section 16 and schedule 1) that relates to their care percentage ↓ Step 6: For each parent, subtract their care cost percentage from their income percentage (section 18). If the answer is positive (i.e. the income percentage exceeds the care cost percentage), the parent is a liable parent. If the answer is negative, (i.e. the income percentage is less than the care cost percentage), the parent is a receiving carer ↓ Step 7: Work out the expenditure for the child using the child expenditure table (section 36D), taking into account the combined child support income amounts of the parents, the number of children in the child's child support group; and the age of those children. This expenditure amount is divided by the number of children in the child support group to get a per child amount ↓ 47 Step 8: The annual rate of child support payable by the parent for the child is worked out using the formula (section 29): (parent’s income percentage – parent’s care cost percentage) x expenditure on the child ↓ Step 9: The amount that a carer receives is determined in sections 36A-C. A receiving parent receives an amount calculated applying the formula in step 8, based on their income and care cost percentages. If this is less than the amount that the liable parent pays, the balance is split between any other receiving carers ↓ Step 10: When a parent is paying child support for more than one child support group, the amount may be capped. If the amount calculated at step 8 is more than the amount calculated under the multi-group cap (section 29), the multi-group cap amount applies. This cap ensures the liability is no more than it would be if all the children from the various child support groups were living together ↓ Step 11: The amount payable may also be subject to a minimum annual rate (section 30) More complex or unique situations (and therefore calculations) are likely to arise where there are other dependent children or other child support groups, or alternatively multiple receiving carers or more than two parents. Step 1 notes that a dependent child allowance, where appropriate, can be deducted. A parent is entitled to this in respect of each other dependent child they are a parent of. This allowance is designed to recognise the costs of raising children in new relationships. The dependent child allowance is calculated in the same manner as any other formula calculation, apart from the fact that it is based on the adjusted taxable income, less the living allowance, of that parent alone. Likewise, step 10 sets out the multi-group allowance. This allowance applies to a parent who has more than one child support group. In other words the paying parent is paying child support in respect of at least two relationships. A child support group is all those children of the parent who share the same other parent. A parent's multi-group allowance in relation to one child is the sum of the multi-group costs of all other children who are not in the same child support group as that child. The multi-group cost of a child is worked out according to a formula involving the appropriate amount from the child expenditure table for that child, using the adjusted taxable income of the parent (after deducting the living allowance and any dependent child allowances), and assuming that all the children from the various child support groups are living together. The result from the child expenditure table is then divided by the total number of children of the parent in all his or her child support groups. The purpose and effect of the multi-group allowance is to adjust child support payments to ensure equity between the different child support groups that a liable parent may be paying child support for. It has a similar effect as the dependent child allowance, in that it reduces a parent's child support income amount in recognition of the cost of their children in other child support groups. In such cases, however, the liable parent’s payment is subject to a cap (the multi-group cap). This ensures the liability is no more than if all the other children were living together. 48 FURTHER POLICY ISSUES RAISED BY OFFICIALS Issue: Orders that can be made Submission Proposed section 106(1) of the Act should be amended to allow a court to either vary specific components of the formula, the liability produced by the formula by a certain amount, or alternatively, set another child support liability. Comment Proposed section 106(1) sets out the orders that a court may make following an application under section 104 seeking a departure from a formula assessment. The proposed section allows the court to make an order varying any component, or the application of any component, of an assessment of child support under a formula assessment. Officials recommend that this section be expanded, given the complexity of the proposed formula and the fact that it may be difficult for the courts to work out specifically what components of the formula should best be varied to achieve an intended result. The proposed change will allow a court to:  vary any of the following components of the formula: – adjusted taxable income; – living allowance; – dependent child allowance; – child support income; – child expenditure amount.  vary the liability produced by the formula by a certain amount; or  set a new, alternative, child support liability. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Entitlement of parents to be a receiving carer Submission Although care should still be recognised for formula calculations when care by a parent is between 28 and 34 percent, a carer should not be able to be a receiving carer until their care levels reach 35 percent or more. 49 Comment A receiving carer is defined in proposed section 2 of the bill as a carer of a child in respect of whom child support payments are payable under the Child Support Act by a liable parent. Proposed new section 17(b) states that a parent carer whose income percentage is less than their care cost percentage is a receiving carer. Proposed section 17(c) states that a non-parent carer who provides at least 28 percent of care is a receiving carer. The effect is that it is possible to have up to three receiving carers entitled to child support. However, it also means that it is possible, in certain specific circumstances (for example, when there is a wide disparity in income between parents) for a parent who has only 28 percent of care to be entitled to receive child support from another parent who has the remaining 72 percent of care. This appears to overly compensate the parent who is not the main caregiver in such circumstances. Officials therefore recommend that, although care should still be recognised for formula calculations when care by a parent is between 28 and 34 percent, a carer should not be able to be a receiving carer until their care levels reach 35 percent or more. This is consistent with the approach taken in Australia, which has a formula similar to the proposed new formula in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Social security beneficiaries must apply for a formula assessment Submission New section 9 and other relevant sections in the Child Support Act should be amended to clarify when a social security beneficiary must apply for a formula assessment. Comment New section 9 proposed in the bill states that a social security beneficiary who provides at least 28 percent of care and does not have an existing child support arrangement with or involving all the liable parents of the child must apply for a formula assessment in relation to every parent of the child. A "child support arrangement" is not, however, defined in the bill or the Child Support Act. The intention of this part of the provision is to remove the need for a person going onto a benefit from having to reapply for a formula assessment when a formula assessment, voluntary agreement or court order was already being administered by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 50 The following potential problems arise with the current wording:  It is not clear whether private agreements not administered by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue are included within a ―child support arrangement‖.  Voluntary agreement administered by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for amounts in excess of the formula outcome may be replaced.  If an application for a formula assessment is made when an existing overseas court order is being administered by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, a dual liability would be generated. Officials recommend the bill should be amended to clarify that private arrangements should be excluded from the meaning of ―child support arrangement‖ in this context. Further, it should be made clear in the Child Support Act that any such agreement should be administered by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in relation to the liable parents of the child. Officials also recommend that the Child Support Act be amended to clarify that voluntary agreements administered by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for amounts in excess of the formula outcome can be used instead of a formula assessment. In such cases, however, the Crown recapture of the benefit element should remain in place. The current section 71 of the Child Support Act should be amended to provide that an overseas order is suspended, from the date a formula assessment commences in respect of the same parties and children until the date the receiving parent ceases to be a social security beneficiary. This will ensure consistency between domestic and overseas parents, when the receiving parent is a New Zealand beneficiary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Form of application – third-party carers Submission Proposed new section 10 should be amended to require applications from third-party carers to be made against all the parents of the child, unless there are specific circumstances not to. Comment Officials recommend that proposed new section 10 should be amended to require applications from third-party carers to be made against all the parents of the child, unless there are specific circumstances not to. This ensures that all of the parents’ income is taken into account when calculating their liabilities. For existing third-party carers who are part of the child support scheme currently, this application should be deemed to have been made (on the basis of information available to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue). 51 If carers do not wish to receive entitlements from a parent, however, this should not be enforced. Accordingly, existing section 180 of the Child Support Act should be amended to allow for a revocable uplift of future entitlements. Where exceptional circumstances exist whereby third-party carers will not want to apply against all the parents – for example, if there is risk of domestic violence or if Child Youth and Family considers it inappropriate to apply against the other parent, the carer should not be required to apply against both parents. Inland Revenue will publish guidelines and examples on when such circumstances may arise. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Identity information required Submission Consideration should be given to amending the type of identity information that can be disclosed to Inland Revenue under schedule 1A of the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Relationships Regulations Act 1995. Comment Schedule 1A of the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Relationships Regulations Act 1995 lists what information can be disclosed by the Department of Internal Affairs to specified agencies. The following table shows the information (and its purpose) that is currently disclosed to Inland Revenue: The type of information that can be disclosed to: Purpose IRD Birth information, marriage information, civil union information, and name change To verify the identity of a person to establish— (a) the tax file number of the person: (b) the details of an applicant for child support Death information To identify deceased taxpayers and verify their details Officials recommend that the type of information that can be disclosed by the Department of Internal Affairs be widened for child support purposes, to also include:  the parentage and dates of birth of qualifying children and dependent children; and  death information for qualifying children and dependent children. 52 This will allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to confirm the identity of children for which child support or a dependent children deduction are being claimed (and their relationship to the parties claiming the deduction). From an administrative and compliance point of view this is much simpler, for both Inland Revenue and parents, than contacting parents individually and requiring that they provide such information directly. The Department of Internal Affairs has been consulted and agrees with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Dependent child allowance Submission Proposed new section 35(2) should be amended to ensure that the formula is calculated on the basis of the number of dependent children the parent maintains as a member of their family. Comment Proposed new section 35 sets out the dependent child allowance that a parent is entitled to. It provides for the dependent child allowance to be calculated for each child in the dependent child’s child support group. The policy intent was for it to be calculated on the basis of the number of dependent children the parent is responsible for, which can be wider than just children with the same biological parents. For example, the definition of ―dependent child‖ includes an adopted child. Officials therefore recommend that proposed new section 35(2) be amended to ensure that all other dependent children that a parent maintains as a member of their family are taken into account in the dependent child allowance calculation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Child support income amount Submission Proposed new section 32(2), which sets out child support income when the adjusted taxable income of the parent cannot reasonably be ascertained, be removed to allow for the use of existing default provisions. 53 Comment Proposed new section 32 sets out how a person’s child support income amount for a child is determined. Subsection 2 states that if the adjusted taxable income of a parent cannot reasonably be ascertained, then:  if one parent’s adjusted taxable income is known, that is also used for the other parent; and  if there is more than one parent whose adjusted taxable income is known, an average is used. The effect is that existing default assessments could only be used when both parents’ income cannot reasonably be ascertained. Officials recommend that the existing default assessment process used to find an appropriate income to assess a parent is preferable to the proposed provision in new section 32(2). It is also recommended, however, that the provisions in new section 32(2) are retained as a fall-back if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances that dictate that the existing default assessment process should not be used. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Estimation provisions Submission As existing estimation provisions in the bill or Child Support Act do not adequately deal with the fact that the new formula takes into account both parents’ income (and therefore both parents can now estimate their income), new updated estimation provisions should be included in the bill. Comment Proposed new section 41, together with other existing provisions in the Child Support Act relating to elections that can be made for child support income to be based on estimated taxable income for the current year (as compared with the lagged income used in the formula), do not adequately deal with the new formula. In particular, the new formula now takes into account both parents’ income, so therefore both parents can now estimate their income. It is also now potentially possible for liable parents to become receiving carers, and vice versa, depending on their respective incomes. 54 Estimation provisions should ideally apply for those periods after re-estimates of income have been made, to encourage timely re-estimates and remove the possibility of debt arising on the receiving carer. The current provisions require a re-assessment of the whole year which can mean a receiving parent has a debt when the paying parent’s income has reduced significantly and the paying parent makes the reconciliation late in the year. To address these issues, and other matters of consistency, officials recommend that the bill be amended to ensure that, for parents wishing to estimate their income based on current year information:  Parents need to advise Inland Revenue of their income earned in the year-to-date at the time of their estimate. This information needs to be accurate as it will be used to determine if the estimate will be accepted, and for reconciliation purposes.  The estimated figure for the balance of the year must be for the period from the 1st of the month of the estimation, through to the end of the child support year.  The sum of the estimated figure and the year to date figure must be 85 percent or less of the lagged income to qualify for estimation purposes. It is considered fairer to use the whole year’s income, rather than just income from the date the estimate takes effect to the end of the child support year, as for many people income streams can be uneven throughout the year. Officials also recommend that income estimated for the balance of the year should be annualised in order to calculate remaining liabilities for the child support year being estimated. For parents wanting to subsequently revoke an estimate, this should be permitted but doing so would revoke all previous estimates made during that year, with the result that a parent is assessed on the income that was used prior to the original estimate being accepted. Parents who have estimated their income should continue to be able to have their child support liabilities reconciled to ensure that revised income levels are taken into account. However, this reconciliation should only occur for the future periods that the customer has estimated their income for, not for the whole year as is currently the case. This will help to ensure surety and consistency of payments for all parties. It is recommended that underestimation penalties should apply to both liable parents and receiving parents who estimate their income, with the manner in which the penalty is charged being based on the parents’ own estimates. However, it should be clarified that additional late payment penalties will not be applied to underestimation penalties. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 55 Issue: Living allowance Submission Proposed new section 34, that sets out the living allowance that applies to every person’s child support income amount should be amended to allow for an increased allowance to be available to parents who are in receipt of an invalid’s benefit under section 40 of the Social Security Act 1964. Comment Proposed new section 34 sets out the living allowance that applies to every person’s child support income amount. Under this section, an increased allowance is made available for someone who is in receipt of a domestic purposes benefit payable to a person under section 27G of the Social Security Act 1964 because that person is caring at home for someone who is sick or infirm. This increased allowance should also be available to parents who are in receipt of an invalid’s benefit under section 40 of the Social Security Act 1964, which is currently paid at the same rate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Offsetting liabilities Submission A provision to allow offset of a liable parent’s current liability against entitlements already owing to them by a receiving carer should be included in the bill. Comment Currently, it is not possible to offset a liable parent’s current liability against entitlements already owing to them by the other parent. This can happen in both a domestic and international context. For example, one parent may be owed a significant arrears of entitlement in respect of a child, but then incur a liability if the other parent now instead cares for that child. There is no ability, currently, to offset such liabilities. Officials recommend that the bill include provision to allow offsetting in such circumstances, both for New Zealand domestic cases and also when the liabilities arise in countries that are subject to a reciprocal child support agreement with New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 56 Issue: Write-off when one party dies Submission Proposed new section 180A should be expanded to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to write off financial support owing when a receiving carer or liable parent dies. Comment Currently, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue cannot write off child support debt in circumstances when a liable parent or receiving carer is deceased. As a result, child support debts may remain payable in circumstances where repayment is extremely unlikely – for example:  a liable parent has died with an insolvent estate; or  a deceased payee is owed financial support from a liable parent who is considered unlikely ever to pay (for example, if they have permanently left New Zealand). Under the current rules, such debts will remain payable indefinitely. Officials therefore recommend that new section 180A be expanded to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to write off financial support owed when a receiving carer dies, or to write off the debts of a liable parent if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied there are insufficient funds in the estate to satisfy the liability. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Payment arrangements and relief from incremental penalties Submission Section 135J of the bill should continue to apply to payment arrangements entered into on or after 1 April 2014. Comment The bill amends section 135J of the Child Support Act. This section gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the ability to provide relief from incremental penalties by writing them off when a payment agreement has been complied with during a review period. The bill proposes that this ability will no longer apply to payment arrangements entered into on or after 1 April 2014. 57 Officials recommend that this relief should continue to be available on or after 1 April 2014, in addition to the other penalty write-off provisions in the bill. Doing so will provide additional incentive for parents to continue to enter into and commit to payment agreements where they may not meet the criteria for write-off under serious hardship. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Overpayments to payees Submission Section 151(2) of the Child Support Act should be amended to make the charging of penalties arising from overpayments to payees discretionary. Comment Proposed new section 134C in the bill has the effect that if a payee has been overpaid child support, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must assess the amount that is repayable and penalties will apply as if that amount was financial support and the payee was a liable person. In many circumstances, receiving carer overpayments are outside a payee’s control. It is therefore, in many circumstances inappropriate for a payee to be charged penalties. Officials therefore recommend that section 151(2) of the Child Support Act should be amended to make the charging of such penalties discretionary, rather than compulsory as it is currently. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Qualifying payments Submission In order for the qualifying payments process to be made more effective and efficient, proposed sections 131 and 131A should be amended to extend the criteria for its use. This includes, for example, extending who can qualify and reducing certain limitations on when qualifying payments can be recognised. 58 Comment Proposed new sections 131 and 131A provide for a new payment method for some of the child support for a child. It allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide recognition for qualifying payments made for a child’s benefit. In the interests of making the process more effective and efficient, officials recommend sections 131 and 131A be amended to extend the criteria of its use – for example, extending who can qualify and reducing certain limitations on when qualifying payments can be recognised. A number of mostly administrative changes to the way qualifying payments are to operate, in order to make this method of payments available to more parents who agree to its use, are recommended. These include the following main proposed changes (together with other associated consequential changes):  Agreement should be in writing between a liable parent and a receiving carer (and not just between parents).  Qualifying payment needs to be for 10 percent or more of their liability for the relevant child for the child support year at the time of the application.  Agreement can be made at any time during a child support year, rather than only before.  A qualifying payment will come into force in the month following the acceptance of application.  Recognition will not be granted until the qualifying payments have been made.  Payments need to have been made within the last 12 months.  No parent or third-party carer of the child can have any child support debt, as a receiving carer or liable parent, at the time of application (however a debt caused by a reassessment, subsequent to acceptance of the application to recognise the qualifying payment, will not disqualify the payments from continuing to qualify).  If a reassessment, subsequent to acceptance of the application to recognise the qualifying payment, causes the total qualifying payment to be less than 10 percent of the liability for the relevant child for the child support year, the total qualifying payment still qualifies (that is, the acceptance should not be revoked). Officials also recommend that current section 206 of the Child Support Act, that concerns direct payments to payees, be amended to reflect the existence of qualifying payments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 Issue: Discretion to write off certain child support debt Submission Proposed new section 180A should be expanded to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to write off some or all of the benefit component of an amount of child support that is payable if collecting it would represent an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources. Comment Proposed new section 180A enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to write off some or all of the benefit component of an amount of child support that is payable by the liable person to the Crown if recovery would place the liable parent in serious hardship. Officials recommend that this should be expanded to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to also write off some or all of the benefit component if collecting it would represent an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 60 61 Other matters 62 63 REMEDIAL MATTERS RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS RECEIVED Issue: Definition of “care order or agreement” in clause 5(2) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The definition of ―care order or agreement‖ in clause 5(2) of the bill, which contains definitions of relevant terminology, should be amended by replacing the word ―proportion‖ with ―division‖. Comment Officials agree that using the word division better reflects common usage, and that it should be used in the bill when considering care. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Proposed section 33(5)(b) should be amended to indicate in more detail the “particulars” to be taken into account by the Commissioner Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 33(5)(b) should indicate in more detail the ―particulars‖ to be taken into account by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue when determining a person’s taxable income when that income has not yet been assessed. Comment Officials do not consider that it is appropriate to limit the use of any particulars that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may (or may not) hold about a person in such circumstances, when trying to assess a person’s likely taxable income. There are many and varied reasons why a person’s adjusted taxable income may not be known at the time an assessment is required to be made. Although most are likely to be cases where a return of income is overdue, there will be others where a person is not required to file an income tax return or request an income statement and so will not be required to have their income ―assessed‖ as such. 64 It is considered appropriate that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be able to gather whatever information may be available (for example, returns from associated entities that will contribute towards the parent’s income adjustments, historical income assessment information adjusted to account for the time elapsed, or a declaration that no income was earned). The potential range of reasons for adjusted taxable income figures not being available at the required time and the variety of appropriate sources of information detailing the ―particulars‖ may unduly limit the factors the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may take into account in determining the appropriate level of income to use in an assessment. This may lead to an inferior assessment, to the detriment of the parent. Further, if a parent or receiving carer disagrees with the amount used, remedies are available to them under the Child Support Act – ranging from filing the required income returns or providing evidence to support a proposed alternative, formal objection and/or administrative review. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ability of a liable parent to apply for a formula assessment Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 8 in clause 9 of the bill should be amended to make it clear that a liable parent can apply for a formula assessment. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Any parent and/or other carer should be able to apply for an assessment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 65 Issue: Number of parents of child Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It is not clear from clause 9 of the bill, which inserts new section 7B, what the rationale is for assuming that a qualifying child has two parents. The section should be amended to provide that one or both parents are carers or, alternatively, the section should be removed from the bill. Clarification should also be given as to what modifications the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can make when this assumption is shown to be incorrect. Comment The bill is broadly written based on the assumption of two parents, otherwise the legislation would be necessarily convoluted. However, cases arise when there are more than two parents. Proposed new section 7B allows flexibility in the bill to accommodate situations when a child has more than two parents (for example, when a person is declared a step- parent). There is the potential for this to become more common over time as the variety of parenting relationships change (for example, through surrogacy or same-sex couples). Section 7B gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to modify the way the formula is applied to take more parents into account. The modifications required would be to adjust relevant formulas to ensure that any change in parenting circumstances would not negate an assessment in relation to other parents and receiving carers. Any adjustments would be expected to maintain a fair assessment of liability and entitlement, and would be open to the usual remedies (objection or administrative review). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deemed application by beneficiary Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 12 should be amended to make it clear whether a social security beneficiary must apply for a formula assessment or whether they are simply deemed to have applied (new section 9). 66 Comment Consistent with the current law, a social security beneficiary must apply for a formula assessment (under new section 9). New section 12 states that ―the Commissioner is deemed to have received from the beneficiary a properly completed application for a formula assessment for child support, as required by section 9 ....‖. Section 12 is concerned with timing, ensuring that any liability under a formula assessment arises immediately after the liability under a voluntary agreement ceases. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Backdating of assessment commencement dates Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New sections 13 or 19 should be amended to enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to backdate the liability to pay child support to the date of the filing of an application, whether that application is properly completed or not. Concerns have been raised that parents may face a delay in their entitlement if, for example, they cannot obtain information relating to third parties. Comment The effect of new section 13 is merely to ensure that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must notify all parents of the receipt of an application for child support that affects them. New section 19, on the other hand, establishes when the liability to pay child support begins. It states that the liability starts from the day on which the properly completed application is received by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The application will only require information that is available to the applicant, therefore no unnecessary delays will arise. An existing rule, whereby the start date can be backdated when a paternity order is made after the properly completed application is received, will remain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 Issue: How the Commissioner establishes proportions of care Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 15(1) should be amended to state that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ―must‖, rather than ―may‖ rely on the contents of the care order or agreement when establishing the proportion of on-going daily care that a carer provides to the child. Further, new section 15(3) should also be amended to ensure that a parent, as well as a carer, can rebut this presumption in new section 15(1). Comment Officials agree that the changes should be made, to address inconsistencies in the new section and provide further clarification. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Identification of liable parents and receiving carers Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 17 should be amended to provide that both parents may be identifiable as liable parents and receiving carers, depending on their cost/care percentage. Comment Parents’ incomes and care levels are taken into account in the proposed formula assessment, and in identifying who liable parents and receiving carers are in proposed new section 17. The current ability to cross-apply in a shared-care situation (whereby liabilities are netted off) effectively applies automatically under the new formula. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 68 Issue: Effect of being a liable parent or receiving carer Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 18, which describes the effect of being a liable parent and a receiving carer, should be amended to address a situation when a liable person may only be a carer rather than a parent. Comment Although it is possible for a non-parent carer to be a receiving carer, it is not possible for them to be a ―liable parent‖ under new section 17. This reflects the fact that non-parents do not have a responsibility for the financial upkeep of a child they care for. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Child expenditure tables Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 36D should be amended to provide that the child expenditure table for the current and previous child support year (if applicable) is available not only on an internet site maintained by or on behalf of Inland Revenue, but also in a hard copy form if requested. Comment Officials agree that hard copies should also be available on request. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “access” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The word ―access‖ should be changed to ―contact‖ in amended section 105(2)(b)(i) and (3) to reflect the more up-to-date terminology used in the Care of Children Act. Further, the phrase ―access \[contact\] (of any kind and for any purpose)‖ should be amended to clarify that it includes all contact, including where care levels are less than 28 percent. 69 Comment Officials agree that the recommended changes would better reflect terminology used in the Care of Children Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Automatic deduction Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section 129(1) should be amended to give guidance on when it would be considered ―inappropriate‖ for financial support not to be paid by automatic deduction. Further, the phrase ―automatic deduction person‖ in new section 129(2) should be amended so it is a less cumbersome phrase, and subsections (2) and (3) of section 130 should be moved to section 131. Comment As noted in the comments on the main submissions on automatic deductions, it is recommended that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be given a specific discretion, when there is legitimate privacy, cultural or other concerns, and alternative payment options have been provided, not to automatically deduct child support payments from salary and wages. In the context of new section 129(1), on the other hand, it is anticipated that ―inappropriate‖ refers to situations when it is administratively inappropriate to deduct child support at source. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 REMEDIAL MATTERS RAISED BY OFFICIALS Issue: Commissioner-initiated administrative review Submission Section 96Q of the Child Support Act should be amended, together with any other associated sections, to reflect the fact that a liable parent may want to elect to become a party to a Commissioner-initiated administrative review (CIAR), where appropriate. Comment During a Commissioner-initiated administrative review, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may wish to review the financial resources of any parent involved in a formula assessment. Section 96Q of the bill states that the parties are to be:  the parent who is the subject of the CIAR review; and  any receiving carer, whether a parent or non-parent of the child, who elects to become a party. Officials recommend that section 96Q should be amended, together with any other associated sections, to reflect the fact that a liable parent may also want to elect to become a party to a Commissioner-initiated administrative review, where appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Establishing proportions of care identified in an application Submission The words ―identified on the application‖ should be removed from new section 14 of the Child Support Act in case not all carers, in fact, are identified on an application. Comment New Section 14 states that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must establish the proportion of care that each parent and non-parent carer identified on the application provides. To correctly establish the proportion of care that a person provides, consideration must also be had to anyone else who may also have care, whether or not they are identified on the application. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 71 Issue: Notification by Commissioner of application Submission New section 13 should be amended to clarify that notification by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of an application can occur if the relevant facts have already been ascertained. Comment New section 13 of the Child Support Act states that on receiving a properly completed application for a formula assessment in respect of one or more qualifying children, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must notify the applicant, and every parent and carer identified in the application, that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has received an application for a formula assessment and will therefore ascertain certain facts. To allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue flexibility on when parties are notified, given that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may have already ascertained who the liable parents or receiving parents are, officials recommend that new section 13 be amended to clarify that notification can occur if the relevant facts have already been ascertained. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Suspension of other agreements Submission New section 19(2), which states that if a parent becomes liable under a formula assessment, existing liabilities under any other agreement in relation to that child are suspended, should be amended to clarify that the suspension only applies to a liability under a voluntary agreement. Comment New section 19(2) states that if a parent is liable under a formula assessment, existing liabilities under any other agreement in relation to that child are suspended. However, in this context ―any other agreement‖ is only intended to cover voluntary agreements, not court orders (consistent with section 20 of the current Child Support Act, which the new provision is designed to replicate). Officials therefore recommend that new section 19(2) be amended to clarify that it only applies to the suspension of liabilities under voluntary agreements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 72 Issue: Form of application Submission The reference to an ―application form‖ in new section 10(3) should be clarified so that it applies to different forms of application (such as online applications). Comment New section 10(3) states the application for formula assessment, and every document accompanying it, must be verified as specified in the application form. Officials recommend that ―as specified in the application form‖ be clarified so that it applies to different forms of application (such as online applications). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Details in notices of assessments Submission New section 88A(3)(f) should be amended so that ―child expenditure notice‖ should instead read ―child expenditure table‖. Comment New section 88A(3) lists the things that need to be on the notice of entitlement for a non- parent carer. Subsection (f) states ―the expenditure on each child from whom the carer provides care, as determined by the relevant child expenditure notice‖. Officials recommend that ―child expenditure notice‖ in this regard should instead read ―child expenditure table‖. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 73 Issue: Notification by Commissioner to other payers and payees Submission New section 89(2)(c) should be amended to reflect the fact that the requirement to supply the name of each child does not apply to domestic maintenance cases. Comment New section 89(2) states that the notice must set out a number of things, including the name of each child for whom payment is to be made. Officials recommend that as the name of each child does not apply to domestic maintenance cases, subsection (c) should be amended to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Notice of assessment of formula assessment of child support Submission New section 88(2) should be clarified to make it clear that notices of assessment can contain both details of the amount of child support a liable parent is liable to pay to each receiving carer and the amount of child support receiving carers will receive from each liable parent. Comment New section 88(2) states that the notice of assessment must set out, as a minimum, the relevant matters in section 88A, but in no case may a notice of assessment reveal any more detail about another person who is a parent or carer than:  the person’s name (unless it is unsafe to do so);  the person’s proportion of care; and  the person’s cost care percentage. Officials recommend that new section 88(2) be clarified to make it clear that notices of assessment are able to contain the following information:  details of the amount of child support a liable parent is liable to pay to each receiving carer; and  details of the amount of child support that child support receiving carers will receive from each liable parent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 74 Issue: Dependent child allowance Submissions Parents claiming the dependent child allowance should be required to provide an IRD number for a child, or alternatively the information to enable an IRD number to be allocated, when claiming a dependent child allowance for that child for the first time. The definition of ―dependent children‖ in new section 35(3)(c) should be amended to exclude children that a person is liable to pay child support for under an Act equivalent to the Child Support Act in an overseas jurisdiction. Comment The bill does not currently specify any information requirements that must be provided to Inland Revenue for a parent to be eligible for the dependent child allowance. To ensure that dependent child allowances are only granted where appropriate, parents should be required to provide an IRD number for a child, or alternatively the information to enable an IRD number to be allocated, when claiming a dependent child allowance for that child for the first time. This is similar to the requirement for ―qualifying children‖ under proposed new section 10(2)(d)). Officials also recommend that the definition of ―dependent children‖ in new section 35(3)(c) should also be amended to exclude children that a person is liable to pay child support for under an Act equivalent to the Child Support Act in an overseas jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Overseas children Submission New sections 5(a)(ii) and 35 (3)(b)(ii), that define ―qualifying children‖ and ―dependent children‖, should be amended to cover 18 year old children still enrolled in overseas secondary schools. Comment New sections 5(a)(ii) and 35 (3)(b)(ii) state that both a ―qualifying child‖ and a ―dependent child‖ need to be under 18, or aged 18 but still enrolled at a registered school (as defined in section 2(1) of the Education Act 1989). 75 The reference solely to the Education Act 1989 prevents children who are aged 18 and enrolled in a secondary school overseas from meeting the criteria. To ensure that children overseas are not excluded, officials recommend that the definition of ―qualifying children‖ and ―dependent children‖ be amended to include equivalent Acts in overseas jurisdictions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Children aged 18 who are still enrolled at secondary school Submission When children aged 18 stay at secondary school for all of the academic year, then the child should be treated as having stayed at school until the 31 December of the year they left school. Comment New section 5(a)(ii) states that a ―qualifying child‖ needs to be under 18, or aged 18 but still enrolled at a registered school (as defined in s 2(1) of the Education Act 1989). Officials recommend that when children aged 18 stay at secondary school for all of the academic year, then the child should be treated as having stayed on at school until the 31 December of the year they left school. This would be more efficient from an administrative standpoint, as the end of the academic year varies slightly between schools. In the absence of such a provision, Inland Revenue would have to establish what school each child was at and contact that school to find out when the academic year finishes. A similar provision already operates for Working for Families tax credit purposes, and also for certain benefits. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Identification of liable parents and receiving carers Submission Proposed new section 17 should be amended to reflect the policy intent that a parent whose income percentage is greater than or equal to their care cost percentage should be a liable parent. 76 Comment Proposed new section 17 currently identifies liable parents and receiving carers as follows:  a parent whose income percentage exceeds their care cost percentage is a liable parent of the child;  a parent carer whose income percentage is less than their care cost percentage is a receiving carer of the child, and  a non-parent carer who provides at least 28% of ongoing care is a receiving carer. Following this definition, if a person’s combined living allowance, dependent child allowance and multi-group allowance exceeded their adjusted taxable income, they would not be a liable parent (as their income would be nil, and therefore does not exceed their care cost percentage, even when this is also nil). It was not the policy intention that parents should not be a liable parent merely on the basis that they have a low income. The policy intent was that if a parent’s income percentage less care cost percentage was nil, and the proportion of ongoing daily care was less than 28 percent, they should be a liable parent and therefore be subject to the minimum payment. Parents whose care is 28 percent or more are considered to be incurring sufficient costs to warrant the waiving of the minimum payment. Officials therefore recommend that proposed section 17 of the Child Support Act be amended to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Formula for assessing annual amount of child support Submission New section 29 should be clarified to make it clear that if section 36A applies, then the liable parent’s liability is the amount calculated as per section 36A. Comment Proposed new section 29 sets out the formula for assessing a liable parent’s child support liability. New section 29(2) states that if a liable parent is entitled to a multi-group allowance, the annual amount of child support for a child is the lesser of:  the amount determined by the formula in section 29(1); or  the amount determined under the multi-group cap in section 29(3). 77 New section 29 does not, however, state that if new section 36A applies, and the amount determined in section 29(1) or (3) is higher than section 36A, then the liability is the amount calculated under section 36A. New section 29 should therefore be clarified to make it clear that if section 36A applies, the liable parent’s liability is the amount calculated according to section 36A. If section 36A applies, but the liable parent is liable for the minimum amount for this case, then the minimum amount applies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Rounding Submission All rounding relating to daily, monthly and annual liabilities should be done to the nearest 10 cents, with rounding to a whole dollar only applying in relation to values applied to and included in the child expenditure table and in the charging of late payment penalties. Comment Sections 136 and 237 of the Child Support Act currently provide for daily and monthly amounts to be rounded to the nearest 5 cents and annual liabilities to the nearest dollar. As New Zealand’s lowest denominated coin is now 10 cents, all rounding relating to the formula should be done to the nearest 10 cents, including for annual liabilities. Section 237 of the Act currently includes a list of when rounding does not apply to the nearest dollar. This section should also be amended to state instead when rounding should apply to a whole dollar, namely:  all values applied to and included in the child expenditure table; and  in the charging of late payment penalties. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 78 Issue: Child support income amount Submissions Proposed new section 32 should be clarified to state that if a parent’s child support income amount is a negative, then it should be deemed to be nil. Comment Proposed new section 32 provides that a parent’s child support income amount is their adjusted taxable income minus their living allowance, dependent child allowance, and multi- group allowance. Officials recommend that this section should be amended, in order to provide greater clarity, that if a parent’s child support income amount is a negative, then it should be deemed to be nil. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirements for estimating income Submissions The requirement to make and revoke estimations of income in writing under sections 40 and 42 of the Child Support Act should be relaxed so that they can also be made in other approved formats. Further, the requirement to provide information and evidence of the revised income to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be relaxed so that this evidence, although still required, would only need to be submitted upon request by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Comment It is currently a requirement under section 40(1) of the Child Support Act that estimates of income must be provided in writing. To make it easier for parents to estimate their income, officials recommend that this requirement for the estimate to be made in writing be removed. This would allow estimations to be made via other approved channels. Section 40(2)(c) of the Child Support Act currently also states that the estimate must be accompanied by information and evidence to support the estimate. Officials recommend this requirement be relaxed so that the information and evidence, although still required, would only need to be submitted upon request by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 79 Finally, officials recommend that any revocation of an estimate of income (under section 42(1) and (2) of the Child Support Act) should not need to be in writing. This would allow revocation to be made via other approved channels. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Overseas income Submission Proposed new section 33 should be clarified to make it clear that, for a person residing outside New Zealand, adjusted taxable income includes all income, whether taxable in their country of residence or not. Comment Section 39A of the Child Support Act currently allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, in making a formula assessment, to take into account any income the parent has derived in a country outside New Zealand that is taxable in that country (if that income can be ascertained). It also states that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may apply the provisions of the Act with such modifications as may be necessary. The bill proposes to amend section 39A(1) so that the income no longer has to actually be taxable in that country. However, the bill is not clear in proposed new section 33 (in relation to adjusted taxable income) that, for a person residing outside New Zealand, that adjusted taxable income includes all income, whether taxable in their country of residence or not. Officials therefore recommend that proposed new section 33 be clarified to make this clear. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “child support group” Submission The definition of ―child support group‖ should be amended to exclude children who are not covered by the Child Support Act. 80 Comment The new definition of ―child support group‖ included in the bill is currently worded widely enough so that it could include children who are not covered by the Child Support Act. However, the policy intent was that it should only include children within the New Zealand child support scheme, and not private arrangements. Officials therefore recommend that the definition of ―child support group‖ be amended to exclude children who are not covered by the Child Support Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Discretionary relief for residual incremental penalty debt Submission Proposed new section 135GA should be amended to clarify that when section 180A applies, any residual penalties in relation to the debt in question may also be written off at the same time. Comment Proposed new section 180A allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to write off the benefit component of a child support debt if the receiving carer is or was a social security beneficiary and recovery would place the liable person in serious hardship. Officials recommend that proposed new section 135GA be amended to clarify that when section 180A applies, any residual penalties in relation to this debt may also be written off at the same time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Initial late payment penalty Submission Proposed new section 134(3) should be clarified to reflect that the second initial late payment penalty of 8 percent charged seven days after the due date under this section is calculated by reference to the financial support outstanding before the first initial late payment penalty of 2 percent charged under section 134(2) was applied. 81 Comment Proposed new section 134 provides for the application of penalties for late payment of financial support debts. Officials recommend that proposed new section 134(3) be clarified to reflect the intention that the second initial late payment penalty of 8 percent under this section, payable seven days after the due date, be calculated by reference to the financial support outstanding before the first initial late payment penalty of 2 percent under section 134(2) was applied. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Relief from ongoing incremental penalties if payment agreement in force Submission Proposed new section 135N(1)(c) should be clarified to reflect that when a deduction is made from a liable parent but an employer fails to pay the deduction to Inland Revenue, the liable parent can still be eligible for relief from on-going incremental penalties. Comment Proposed new section 135N(1) provides relief from on-going incremental penalties if a deduction notice is in force. The intention of section 135N(1)(c) is that the deduction should be made from a liable parent’s wages. Officials recommend that proposed new section 135N(1)(c) should be clarified to reflect that when a deduction is made from a liable parent but an employer fails to pay the deduction to Inland Revenue, the liable parent is still entitled to relief from the on-going incremental penalties. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: How the Commissioner establishes proportions of care – rounding Submission Proposed new section 15(6) should, for clarity, provide the method of rounding to be used. 82 Comment Proposed new section 15(6) states that when establishing proportions of care the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must use only whole percentage figures. Officials recommend that, for further certainty, the bill also states the method of rounding used. The method adopted would be one whereby:  if the proportion of care is greater than 50 percent, then the rounding should go up (57.1 percent is rounded to 58 percent); and  if the proportion of care is less than 50 percent, then the rounding should go down (13.9 percent is rounded to 13 percent). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Parents and receiving carers to advise Commissioner of changes Submission Proposed new section 82 should be amended to provide greater clarity when both parents provide notification. Comment Proposed new section 82, which provides for the effective dates of changes advised to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, does not operate consistently for all shared-care cases. Section 82 provides that when a liable parent informs Inland Revenue about a reduction in their care levels outside of the 28-day period, Inland Revenue makes the change from the date of the event. However, if the receiving carer informs Inland Revenue about a liable parent’s reduction in care, Inland Revenue makes the change from the date of notification. A potential conflict therefore exists if both provide notification on the same day. Officials recommend that proposed new section 82 should be amended to clarify the outcome if both parents provide notification. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 83 Issue: Care cost percentage table Submission Proposed new schedule 1 in the bill should be amended to reflect that when using care cost percentages, only whole percentages should be used, to make it easier to understand. Comment Proposed new schedule 1 in the bill contains the new care cost percentage table. Officials recommend that consideration be given to amending this table to reflect that when using care cost percentages, only whole percentages are to be used. This may make it easier to understand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: How the Commissioner establishes proportions of care Submission Proposed new section 15 in the bill should clarify that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, when establishing proportions of care, can reflect care arrangements made for periods in excess of a year. Comment Some care arrangements run for periods in excess of a year. Officials therefore recommend that section 15 should be amended to clarify that different time-periods can be used. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 84 Issue: Offsetting of child support liabilities Submission Proposed new section 152B in the bill should be amended so that offsetting of liabilities can apply in split-care cases (this is allowed under section 34 of the current Child Support Act, but this section is proposed to be repealed by the bill). Further, the ability to offset should not only be available to offset domestic New Zealand liabilities, but also be extended to situations when split-custody arrangements are in place in a trans-Tasman context – that is, when liabilities between two parents exist that are potentially subject to the reciprocal child support agreement between New Zealand and Australia. Comment Proposed new section 152B in the bill provides for the offsetting of child support payments between parents. It states that if two parents of a child are each liable to pay the other an amount payable under a formula assessment for child support, then the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may offset one liability against the other. As the proposed new formula inherently caters for offsetting in a shared-care situation, this section is no longer needed in a domestic context. However, the bill also repeals current section 34 of the Child Support Act which deals with offsetting liabilities when there are split-custody situations (where the custody of two or more children is split between two parents.) As it would be beneficial for both parents and Inland Revenue, it is still preferable to offset liabilities in such cases. Officials therefore recommend that section 152B be amended so that it applies in split-care cases. Officials further recommend that the ability to offset should not only be available to offset domestic New Zealand liabilities, but also be extended to split custody arrangements in place in a trans-Tasman context, where liabilities between two parents exist that are subject to the reciprocal child support agreement between New Zealand and Australia. For offsetting to be effective, enabling legislation in Australia will also be required in due course. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 85 Issue: Use of the phrase “shared care” Submission Consideration should be given in the bill to changing the use of the phrase ―shared care‖ to ―recognised care‖, when appropriate, for greater clarity. Comment Several submissions appeared to be under the misconception that 28 percent ―shared care‖ represented equal care, rather than the level of care at which point some recognition is provided to parents for the costs they have incurred in providing a significant degree of care for their children. In that context officials recommend that consideration be given in the bill to changing ―shared care‖ to ―recognised care‖. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Care orders and agreements Submission Consideration should be given to changing the phrase ―care orders or agreement‖ to ―care agreement or orders‖ in the Child Support Act so there is an increased focus on the making of voluntary care agreements between parents. Comment The bill currently refers to ―care order and agreement‖ (for example, in proposed new sections 2 and 15). Officials recommend that consideration be given to reversing the wording to ―care agreement or order‖ in the Child Support Act so that there is an increased focus on the making of voluntary care agreements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 86 Issue: How the Commissioner establishes proportions of care Submission Proposed new section 15(3), that provides that a carer of a qualifying child may challenge the application of section 15(1) and (2), should also apply to a parent (who may not be a carer). Comment Proposed new section 15(3) states that a carer of a qualifying child may challenge the application of section 15(1) and (2) in establishing proportions of care. A parent (who is not a carer) should also be able to make such a challenge. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Income criteria for long-term prisoner exemption Submission Current section 89D and 89F of the Child Support Act should be amended to provide that an exemption from child support should still be provided when certain income is earned prior to a prisoner being imprisoned, but received afterwards. Comment Current section 89D of the Child Support Act provides that a long-term prisoner can be eligible for an exemption from the payment of financial support while they are imprisoned. Section 89F prevents such an exemption from applying if, at any time during a child support year, certain income criteria are not met. These include a requirement that the prisoner must not receive certain income after they are imprisoned. Due to payments often being made in arrears, many beneficiaries and employed liable parents who are imprisoned in actual fact receive their final benefit payments or wages on or after the date they are imprisoned. As soon as such payments are received, the exemption noted above is not available for that child support year. Officials therefore recommend that the Child Support Act be amended to provide that an exemption from child support should still be provided when certain income is earned prior to a prisoner being imprisoned, but received afterwards. This will help increase prisoner compliance levels, as they will not be burdened with outstanding debts upon their release. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 87 Issue: Requirements where there are no liable parents or receiving carers Submission It is recommended that the notification and other requirements be clarified in circumstances where there may not be any liable parents or receiving parents identified as a result of the application of the Child Support Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting errors Submission The following minor drafting errors should be amended:  Proposed new section 180A(1) should read ―unpaid and in arrears‖ rather than ―unpaid and in arrear‖.  The consequential amendment to the existing section 105(2)(b)(i) which changes the term ―qualifying custodian‖ to ―receiving carer‖ is not required as clause 26 in the bill repeals and substitutes this section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

The bill introduces three major changes:  Losses will be excluded from the calculation of income for student loan repayment purposes and, as a consequence of this change, the pay-period assessment policy will be extended to the salary and wage earnings of all borrowers.  Inland Revenue will be able to receive details of a borrower’s contact person from StudyLink, which manages student loan applications. Every new loan application will have to include a contact person as a condition of accessing a student loan.  The repayment holiday will be reduced from three years to one. Borrowers will be required to apply for their repayment holiday and provide the name of a contact person when they do so. In addition, during the implementation of the reforms included in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, officials have identified a number of other minor amendments that need to be made to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. The amendments proposed are intended to bring the legislation up-to-date with changes in the IT systems used to implement the reforms, and to ensure that the legislation achieves its original policy intent. The student loan reforms were originally based on Inland Revenue implementing a new computer system to administer student loans. However, during the passage of the bill, it became apparent that Inland Revenue would not be able to implement the reforms in a new system in time and therefore the reforms were implemented in the existing FIRST computer systems. Reverting to the original system to implement the student loan reforms resulted in a number of changes being made to the bill at the Select Committee stage, and the deferral of the application date of some provisions until 1 April 2013. At the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s meeting with officials on 8 February, the Committee raised a number of questions on the student loan scheme. Officials’ responses to these questions are in the section at the end of this report. 2 3 Matters raised in submissions 4 5 PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE CONTACT DETAILS Clause 7 Submission (National Council of Women) The bill does not require borrowers to supply details of a contact person as a prerequisite to accessing a loan, so there is still potential for losing contact with borrowers. Comment The Ministry of Social Development, through its StudyLink service, provides information on student loan entitlements, assesses applications for student support and makes student loan payments. Inland Revenue manages the collection of loan repayments through the tax system and this is governed by the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Loan eligibility is assessed by StudyLink and is authorised in cabinet minutes. As a condition of accessing a student loan, StudyLink will require the borrower to provide alternative contact details. The proposed amendments contained in this bill allow those details provided to the loan manager (StudyLink) to be received and used by Inland Revenue once the loan is transferred. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 6 USE OF ALTERNATIVE CONTACT DETAILS Clause 29 Submission (National Council of Women) A contact person’s rights and duties should be clearly defined, so as not to find themselves inadvertently liable for another’s debt. The “contact person” should be just that – and have no other responsibilities. The administration fee could escalate and interest might then be charged on it. Comment Clause 29 inserts new section 193A authorising the Commissioner to request a borrower’s contact person to assist where the borrower is in default and cannot be located. The Commissioner may only request the contact person to:  provide the borrower’s address details; or  ask the borrower to contact Inland Revenue. There is no ability for the contact person to inadvertently be liable for the borrower’s student loan debt. Currently, the bill prescribes that Inland Revenue may only communicate with the contact person when the borrower is in default. As noted below, officials recommend that Inland Revenue be given the ability to pro-actively communicate with the contact person to notify the individual that they have been nominated and to explain what is required of a contact person if and when Inland Revenue contacts them. This ability will assist in ensuring the contact person understands that they will only be called upon for very specific information. This change is not expected to increase the administration fee. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 7 EXCLUDING LOSSES FROM THE CALCULATION OF INCOME FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PURPOSES Clauses 8–16 Submissions (National Council of Women, Lenore Bamfield) Women often cluster in small business enterprises, and the move to exclude business losses in calculating liable income may stifle entrepreneurship or contribute unnecessarily to small business failure. Women may therefore be more disadvantaged by this change. (National Council of Women) The proposal to remove business and investment losses from the assessment base of New Zealand-based borrowers’ student loan repayment obligations should not proceed. (Lenore Bamfield) Comment Amendments in the bill exclude investment and business losses, such as rental losses, from the calculation of net income for student loan repayment purposes. The purpose of the amendment is to maximise repayments from New Zealand-based borrowers and ensure fairness across the student loan scheme. The policy rationale is that although such losses may reduce an individual’s economic income, the Government should not provide for the ability to gain a student loan repayment benefit as a consequence of offsetting those losses against income. In addition, denying the ability to offset both business and investment losses is consistent with other social assistance programmes – for example, claiming Working for Families’ tax credits. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 8 APPLYING FOR THE REPAYMENT HOLIDAY Clause 17 Submissions (National Council of Women, Lenore Bamfield) Requiring a borrower to apply for the repayment holiday, and to supply details of a contact person in New Zealand as part of the application, is long overdue. However, there is concern expressed by the Ministry of Education that reducing the time of the repayment holiday will not be effective in encouraging repayments, and could even have the opposite effect. Shortening the repayment holiday may delay the return of some borrowers. The three-year repayment holiday should be retained but tailored to each borrower’s circumstances. Comment Officials acknowledge that there are uncertainties when anticipating behavioural responses to policy change. However officials note that recent research undertaken by the KEA Foundation surveyed 15,600 New Zealanders living abroad and asked participants about the factors that influence their decision to live overseas. 1 The survey found that economic factors were the primary factor, followed by family and lifestyle considerations. Student loan debt was not raised as a factor. Inland Revenue’s own research conducted in 2011 corroborates these findings. For borrowers who do not meet their obligations, the reduction in the repayment holiday will likely increase their indebtedness. However officials do not believe that the reduction will lead to more borrowers defaulting on their obligations. The current automatic three-year holiday is generous and can result in borrowers not resuming repayments when the repayment holiday comes to an end. The application process, combined with the requirement to supply a New Zealand-based contact person, seeks to address this behaviour and signals to borrowers the importance of repaying their loan when the repayment holiday comes to an end. To the extent that borrowers can still choose whether or not to apply for a repayment holiday, the policy allows an element of tailoring to suit a borrower’s individual financial situation. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 1 A copy of the research is available at: http://www.keanewzealand.com/sites/default/files/Every\_Kiwi\_Counts\_2011\_Kea\_NZ\_final.pdf 9 OVERSEAS-BASED REPAYMENT OBLIGATION Submission (Lenore Bamfield) The repayment obligation for overseas-based borrowers should be set at levels to ensure that:  the amount that overseas-based borrowers are required to pay is fair compared with what New Zealand-based borrowers are required to pay; and  the loan is repaid in a reasonable timeframe. Comment The bill does not change the policy on the calculation of the repayment obligation for overseas-based borrowers; therefore the submission is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 11 Matters raised by officials 12 13 OFFSETTING A SIGNIFICANT OVER-DEDUCTION AGAINST UNPAID AMOUNTS Clause 12 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should be amended so that a significant over-deduction may also be offset against an unpaid amount prior to being refunded. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2012. Comment When a borrower has both a significant over-deduction for one period and a significant under-deduction for another period, the bill allows the two significant deductions to be offset against each other. Officials have identified situations when a borrower has a significant over-deduction and an unpaid amount. Such borrowers should not receive a refund of the over- deduction while still leaving a debt due to Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 14 MEANING OF “REPAYMENT OBLIGATION” FOR DETERMINING EXCESS REPAYMENTS Clause 22 Submission (Matter raised by officials) To correct an oversight, officials recommend that the bill amend the excess repayment legislation to provide that whatever repayment deductions are made from salary and wages satisfies the borrower’s repayment obligations from that income. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2012. Comment For a borrower to have an excess repayment, and therefore qualify for the excess repayment bonus, they must have made repayments in excess of their repayment obligations for the year. In determining whether a borrower has met their repayment obligations for the purposes of calculating excess repayments and the bonus, the policy intent was that whatever repayment deductions were made from salary and wages would satisfy a borrower’s repayment obligations. If there is an under-deduction then there are other mechanisms available to collect the debt. However, the legislation does not achieve this outcome. Instead, the excess repayment legislation incorrectly refers to repayment obligations from salary and wages being what should have been deducted not what was actually deducted. The result is that if a borrower has an under-deduction, whether significant or not, they will not have met their repayment obligations in relation to their salary and wage income and their bonus entitlement will be reduced or cancelled. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 15 DATE PAYMENT CREDITED FOR CALCULATING INTEREST Submission (Matter raised by officials) To ensure consistency between the student loan administrative system and the legislation, officials recommend that the legislation be amended to provide that for the purposes of calculating interest, payments are treated as being received on the day after payment was made. Comment Under the student loan scheme, the loan balances of New Zealand-based borrowers are interest-free. Only overseas-based borrowers are subject to interest on their loan balances. For overseas-based borrowers, the system imposes interest on outstanding loan balances up to and including the date of payment. For example, if an overseas- based borrower repays his or her loan in full on the 10 th of August, interest is imposed on the outstanding loan balance up to and including the 10 th of August. However, the legislation does not reflect this practice, and instead imposes interest up to the date of payment being 9 th August, not including the date of payment on 10 th of August. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 16 DECLARATION OF WORLDWIDE INCOME Submission (Matter raised by officials) With the enactment of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, a legislative oversight has resulted in one of the obligations that need to be fulfilled before an overseas borrower can qualify for an interest-free loan under special exemption criteria being omitted from the new Act. Officials recommend that a borrower who qualifies for one of the exemptions be treated as physically in New Zealand and be required to file a declaration of worldwide income to qualify for the exemption or continue to qualify for the exemption. This amendment should apply from 1 April 2012. Comment A borrower who goes overseas but meets one of the exemption criteria can still be treated as physically in New Zealand for determining their New Zealand-based status. The exemptions include when the borrower is working for an approved overseas charity, undertaking full-time study overseas (including study at undergraduate or post-graduate level), or living in Niue, the Cook Islands, Tokelau or the Ross Dependency. Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, a borrower had to meet a number of requirements to qualify for the exemptions, including the requirement to file a declaration of their worldwide income and do so in future years to continue to qualify. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 TREATMENT OF NEW ZEALAND-BASED BORROWERS WHO ARE NON-RESIDENT Submissions (Matters raised by officials) Officials recommend that an amendment be included in the bill to enable New Zealand- based borrowers who are non-resident to apply for an extension of time to file their information, and for the Commissioner to have the discretion to provide an extension of time when satisfied that the borrower would not be able to provide the information by the original due date, being 7 July. The late filing penalty provisions also need to be consequentially amended to ensure that the penalty is only imposed on New Zealand-based borrowers (including those non- resident and those with pre-taxed income) when the extended time to file a declaration or provide information has expired. This amendment should apply from 1 April 2012. Officials also recommend that the legislation be amended to ensure that New Zealand based borrowers who are non-resident be required to pay their annual repayment obligation on the same remaining payment dates that apply to borrowers with other income. This amendment should apply from 1 April 2012. Comment Two problems have been identified in relation to New Zealand-based borrowers who are non-resident. The first relates to the provision of an extension of time to file information and the second relates to the due date for payment of remaining repayments. The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 requires a New Zealand-based borrower who is non-resident, such as a borrower studying overseas or working for an overseas aid agency, to provide the Commissioner with information on the borrower’s annual gross income and annual total deductions. This information must be provided in the same timeframe as New Zealand-based borrowers who are required to file an IR3 tax return or declaration of pre-taxed income. For most borrowers, this is 7 July. Extension of time for New Zealand-based borrowers who are non-resident While New Zealand-based borrowers who reside here are able to apply for an extension of time to file their income tax return, no similar extension of time applies to the provision of income and deduction information of New Zealand-based borrowers who are non-resident. Due date for payment of remaining payments Once a New Zealand based borrower who is non-resident provides information on their annual income and deductions to the Commissioner, the Commissioner then assesses the borrower’s repayment obligation for the year. The policy intent was that the borrower’s repayment obligation would be payable on the same dates that New Zealand resident borrowers with other income pay their remaining repayments. 18 However, a legislative oversight has resulted in the policy intent not being reflected in legislation. Recommendation That the two submissions be accepted. 19 USE OF THE SPECIAL REPAYMENT CODE (STC) Submission (Matter raised by officials) A change is required to reflect the current administrative practice of using the standard income tax and student loan repayment codes, for example “M SL”, when only student loan repayments are at a non-standard rate. The use of the “STC” repayment code should be reserved for situations when there is a special deduction rate for both income tax and student loans or only income tax. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2012. Comment The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 enables a borrower to apply for a special deduction rate to take account of an unused repayment threshold on their main source of salary or wages, or to reflect a lower repayment obligation – for example, due to hardship relief. When a special deduction rate (a rate other than 10%) applies to student loans only, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 requires the borrower to use the “STC” repayment code in conjunction with their income tax code, for example “M STC”. This treatment was designed in anticipation of Inland Revenue having a new computer system to deliver student loans. However as the current FIRST computer system will be retained, an amendment is required to reflect current administrative practices. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 20 DATE STUDYLINK CEASES CHARGING INTEREST Submission (Matter raised by officials) A change is required to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to change the date StudyLink cease charging interest from 1 January 2012 to 1 April 2012. Comment Currently, both StudyLink and Inland Revenue charge interest on loan balances. StudyLink charges interest while the borrower is studying and Inland Revenue continues this once the loan is transferred to Inland Revenue for collection. When the borrower is a New Zealand-based borrower, the interest charged is written off by Inland Revenue, leaving interest charged on overseas-based borrowers. With the introduction of the student loan reforms, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 provides that StudyLink will cease charging interest with effect from 1 January 2012, and Inland Revenue will begin charging interest from that date. However, it would be more administratively efficient for both agencies if StudyLink ceased charging interest from 1 April 2012 rather than 1 January 2012. For the three-month period from January to March 2012, StudyLink will continue to charge interest and Inland Revenue will delay charging interest until 1 April 2012. Officials therefore recommend that the Act be amended to delay the date StudyLink will cease charging interest, and Inland Revenue will start charging, from 1 January to 1 April 2012. The change will not adversely affect borrowers. As the bill will be enacted after January 2012, this amendment should apply retrospectively from 1 January 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 21 KEEPING ALTERNATIVE CONTACT DETAILS UP-TO-DATE Submission (Matter raised by officials) The obligation on the borrower to keep details up-to-date should also apply to the alternative contact person details provided to StudyLink and transferred to Inland Revenue as part of the loan application process. The bill currently does not require the borrower to keep the details held by Inland Revenue up-to-date. Comment When a borrower applies for a repayment holiday, the bill states that whenever the contact person’s details change, the borrower must notify the Commissioner of the changed details. There is no similar obligation for borrowers to keep contact details up- to-date when Inland Revenue receives contact details from StudyLink through the student loan application process managed by StudyLink. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 22 COMMUNICATING WITH AN ALTERNATIVE CONTACT PERSON Submission (Matter raised by officials) There should be a provision allowing the Commissioner to notify an individual that they have been nominated as a contact person for a borrower. Inland Revenue can then explain that the department may contact them if the borrower has an unpaid amount and they may be asked to provide a contact address or to ask the borrower to contact Inland Revenue as prescribed by section 193A(2) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Comment Currently, the bill provides that Inland Revenue can only communicate with a contact person when the borrower is in default. There is no ability for Inland Revenue to proactively communicate with the contact person advising them that they have been nominated by the borrower to explain what it means to be a contact person. This ability will assist in ensuring the contact person understands that they will only be called upon for very specific information. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 23 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR DETERMINING DUE DATE FOR PURPOSES OF IMPOSING LATE PAYMENT INTEREST Submission (Matter raised by officials) To ensure that borrowers are not disadvantaged, officials recommend that late payment interest for both interim payments and remaining repayments for the 2012–13 tax year apply from the final instalment date onwards. Comment The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 changes the way late payment interest is imposed from 1 April 2013. However, payments for the 2012–13 tax year (both interim payments and remaining repayments) occur both before and after 1 April 2013. Having different late payment interest rules for repayment obligations that relate to the same tax year depending on when the payment is due will cause confusion and be difficult for borrowers to understand and comply with. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 24 25 Minor technical matters 26 27 MINOR TECHNICAL MATTERS Issue: The order in which deductions and payments are offset against the consolidated loan balance Submission (Matter raised by officials) Two corrections are proposed to the provisions in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 that deal with the order in which payments are to be offset against a borrower’s consolidated loan balance. The first correction relates to a legislative oversight whereby the section that deals with overseas-based borrower deductions satisfying their repayment obligations (section 117) incorrectly overrides the general ordering rules (section 194) from 1 April 2012. The second correction relates to an error whereby from 1 April 2013 section 117 incorrectly overrides sections 194 to 194D instead of only overriding section 194A(1) and (2). Officials recommend that amendments be included in the bill to correct these two errors. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: How interest is calculated, charged and compounded Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 provides that for the 2012–13 tax year, interest on outstanding loan balances is calculated each day, charged and compounded annually. Although interest is only charged annually, the current administrative practice is for statements issued to borrowers to show the amount of interest that has been calculated and accrued up to the date of the statements. This practice is not reflected in the legislation and officials recommend that for the 2012–13 tax year, the Act be amended to provide that interest be accrued on a daily basis. The way interest on outstanding loan balances is charged and compounded will change from the 2013–14 tax year onwards. Therefore there will be no need to accrue interest from that point. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 28 Issue: Student loan repayment codes Submission (Matter raised by officials) There are two problems relating to student loan repayment codes. The first is that the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 incorrectly refers to a tax code instead of a repayment code. Although the Tax Administration Act refers to tax codes, the Student Loan Scheme Act refers to a repayment code. This error occurs in three places, sections 38 and 39, and clause 1 of schedule 2. Officials recommend that this error be corrected in the bill and that the amendments apply from 1 April 2012. The second problem relates to income-tested beneficiaries who do not have to have repayment deductions made from their benefit. The Student Loan Scheme Act requires these borrowers to apply the “SL” repayment code even though they do not have student loan deductions made from their benefit. To ensure that both the Ministry of Social Development and beneficiaries do not incur costs in complying with this requirement, officials recommend that the legislation be amended to remove the requirement for income-tested beneficiaries to advise the Ministry of Social Development to apply the “SL” tax code. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2012. Recommendation That these submissions be accepted. Issue: Notification period for significant over-deductions Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 provides that where a borrower considers that a significant over-deduction has been made, the borrower can ask the Commissioner to investigate within six months of the date the borrower identifies the significant over- deduction. This gives the borrower an unduly long period to seek an investigation. What was intended was that the borrower would have six months from the date on which the significant over-deduction occurred to request the Commissioner to investigate the over-deduction. Officials recommend that the bill be amended accordingly and that the amendment apply from 1 April 2012. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 29 Issue: Repayment obligations of overseas-based borrowers Submission (Matter raised by officials) An overseas-based borrower’s repayment obligation for a year is based on the size of their consolidated loan balance at the end of the previous income year, increased by the annual administration fee and reduced by the amount of the excess repayment bonus. Because of the way the legislation is drafted it could be construed that the excess repayment bonus is added to the borrower’s loan balance instead of being subtracted from it as intended. Officials recommend that an amendment be included in the bill to ensure that the excess repayment bonus is subtracted from these loan balances for the purpose of calculating the repayment obligation for overseas-based borrowers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Information to be provided by the loan manager Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 16 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 requires the loan manager (StudyLink) to notify Inland Revenue of all persons who become borrowers and to provide the information set out in the section and any further information specified in subsequent regulations. The bill inserts a new section 16A, requiring the loan manager to notify Inland Revenue of the contact details of an alternative contact person provided by the borrower. There is no requirement to provide Inland Revenue with any further information specified in regulations. This appears to be a drafting oversight. Therefore, officials recommend that a similar requirement be included. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 30 Issue: Issuing an additional deduction rate or a special assessment to collect a significant under-deduction Submission (Matter raised by officials) Where a significant under-deduction has occurred because of an employer error or an error or omission on the part of a borrower, the Commissioner can issue an additional deduction rate for the recovery of the under-deducted amount. If the Commissioner cannot obtain the additional deductions the Commissioner can issue a special assessment to the borrower. In implementing the reforms, Inland Revenue has identified a risk that the additional deduction rate and special assessment provisions would not apply in situations when the employer omitted or deliberately intended not to make a deduction, as this is not an employer “error”. This was not the policy intent as the special assessment provisions should be available for all situations when significant under-deduction occurs. Officials therefore recommend that an amendment be incorporated into the bill to enable the additional deduction and special assessment provisions to apply to significant under- deductions when an employer has omitted or deliberately intended not to make a deduction. Officials also recommend that a minor amendment be made to the provision for issuing an additional deduction rate notice to clarify that when the Commissioner issues an additional deduction rate notice, that notice replaces all previous notices issued to that employer in relation to a borrower. This amendment would overcome the situation where a notice issued to one employer could replace all previous notices issued to all employers of the borrower, which was not intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transitional provision for small amounts of unpaid and uncollected repayments obligations Submission (Matter raised by officials) When changes were made to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to defer the application date of some of the reforms for a year, a legislative oversight resulted in the transitional provision relating to small amounts of unpaid repayment obligations applying from 31 March 2012 instead of 31 March 2013. Also, the provision incorrectly referred to one of two legislative references, omitting the reference to section 139(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act which applies to small amounts of late payment interest. 31 Officials recommend that the bill be amended accordingly and that the amendments apply from the date of assent of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 32 33 Matters raised by FEC 34 35 At the Committee’s meeting on 8 February the Committee raised a number of questions about the bill. Officials’ responses to these questions are outlined below. Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee asked how the student loan repayment threshold is set. Comment The student loan repayment threshold is currently $19,084 and set by the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. The threshold applies for the tax year commencing on 1 April 2012. The threshold can be changed by way of a legislative amendment or by regulation. Until the 2005–06 tax year, the student loan repayment threshold was set relative to the Domestic Purposes Benefit rate for a sole parent with two children. The threshold was then inflation-adjusted based on the movement in the Consumer Price Index until 2009. The Government has decided to hold the repayment threshold at the current level of $19,084 until 2015. The rationale for retaining the current threshold was to increase repayments and increase the value of the interest-free Student Loan Scheme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee asked for further clarification on how excluding losses from the calculation of income for student loan repayment purposes will impact on borrowers, and specifically on a borrower who is in business for the first six months, who makes a loss, and then derives salary and wages during the last part of the year. Comment The bill proposed two changes to the way repayment obligations are calculated for borrowers who have income other than salary, wages and New Zealand-sourced investment income (“other income”). First, a borrower who has a loss from a business or investment activity will not be able to use that loss to offset other income and thereby reduce their repayment obligation. 36 When a borrower undertakes two or more similar or related businesses or investment activities – for example, a landscaping business and a lawn-mowing service, or a café and a catering business, the activities can be combined and treated as a single endeavour. This would mean that losses could be offset against income earned from similar or related activities. This provision is also found in the legislation that excludes losses from the calculation of income for Working for Families. Secondly, borrowers who receive “other income” as well as a salary or wage will no longer have their salary or wage repayment obligations calculated on an annual basis. Instead, they will shift to pay-period assessments. From 1 April 2012 student loan borrowers with salary, wage and New Zealand-sourced investment income only (87 percent of New Zealand-based borrowers), will not have an end-of-year square-up of student loan deductions taken from their salary and wages. Rather, the amount to be paid will be assessed against a weekly, fortnightly or monthly repayment threshold. This policy is known as “pay-period assessments” and was introduced in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Pay-period assessments work on the principle that student loans should be repaid in periods when a person has the ability to do so. The following example compares pay- period assessments with the existing end-of-year square-up. Example Jane is paid an annual salary of $72,000. She is paid monthly and receives $6,000 each pay-period. The monthly student loan repayment threshold is $1,590. Monthly income liable for student loans: $6,000 – $1,590 = $4,410 Monthly student loan deductions: $4,410 x 10% = $441 She works for six months during the 2011–12 tax year but stops working at the end of September. She has earned $36,000 and had $2,646 deducted for her student loan. Under pay-period assessments, the amount deducted from monthly salary satisfies her repayment obligations. There is no further amount to pay or refund. Under the end-of-year square-up, Jane’s repayment obligation would be assessed by taking 10c out of every dollar over the annual threshold of $19,084. Annual income liable for student loans: $36,000 – $19,084 = $16,916 Annual repayment obligation: $16,916 x 10% = $1,691.60 Jane can request a refund of $954.40, the difference between her annual obligation and her deductions. A borrower who has a business loss in the first part of the year and then earns salary and wage income in the second part of the year will be affected by both of the repayment obligation changes contained in the bill. This is illustrated by the following example. 37 Example Joe has a small business which he operates from 1 April 2012 to 30 September 2012. He incurs a $10,000 loss during this time. During this period Joe does not have the ability to make repayments. From 1 October 2012 to 31 March 2013 Joe is employed at an annual salary of $60,000. He receives $30,000 during this time and has the ability to make loan repayments. He has $2,046 deducted for student loans. Under the current legislation, Joe’s repayment obligation would be assessed by taking 10c out of every dollar over the annual threshold of $19,084. His annual income would be $20,000 ($30,000 wages minus his $10,000 loss) so his annual repayment obligation would be $20,000 – 19,084 = $916 x 10% = $91.60. Joe would be able to receive a refund of $1,954.40, the difference between his annual obligation and his deductions. Under the pay-period assessment approach, Joe’s repayment obligation would reflect his ability to pay at different points in time. While Joe is in business he incurs a loss and does not have the ability to repay his loan. However when Joe goes into employment he has the ability to make repayments. Under the changes proposed in the bill Joe would not be able to offset his business loss against his wage income, so his liable income would remain at $30,000. His repayment obligation for the period he was earning wage income would be equal to the deductions withheld. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee asked officials to provide examples of how borrowers can structure their affairs in order to reduce their student loan repayments. Comment Currently, borrowers are able to structure their affairs in order to reduce their student loan repayments liability. As part of Budget 2011, the Government asked officials to report to Ministers on options to address this issue. Officials are in the process of developing proposals and will shortly be reporting to Ministers. Two examples of how borrowers can structure their affairs are outlined below. Trustee income Currently, the income of a trust can be taxed as trustee income at a final rate of 33% and the trust can later distribute this income to beneficiaries of the trust tax-free. While beneficiary income is taxable at the beneficiaries’ level, and therefore included for student loan purposes, the distributed trustee income is not included in the taxable income of beneficiaries. 38 For example, Rachel is a borrower who earns $40,000 per annum working for Rachel’s Contracting Company (the Company). Rachel is also a sole director of the Company. The Company is wholly owned by a family trust (the Trust). Rachel is both the settlor and a trustee of the Trust. Rachel’s family are discretionary beneficiaries of the Trust. The taxable income of the Company is $200,000, on which it pays $60,000 tax. The Trust receives a $140,000 imputed dividend from the Company. The Trust then distributes $120,000 (which has already been taxed as trustee income) to Rachel’s family. The family receives $152,790 ($32,790 salary after tax + $120,000 distribution from the Trust) excluding WFF tax credits, but the distribution from the Trust is not counted for student loan purposes. As a result Rachel’s repayment obligation does not match the income she has had available to meet her loan obligations. If the business income of the Company were included in Rachel’s income, she would have a much higher repayment obligation. Unlocked PIE income Income from portfolio investment entities (PIEs) is currently not counted for student loan purposes. This exemption is appropriate for PIEs that are mainly intended to provide retirement benefits and cannot be easily accessed. However, the exemption may not be appropriate for unlocked PIE investments which are readily available. Unlocked PIEs are where the funds are not sufficiently locked-in until a person’s retirement. Examples include cash PIEs, which are akin to on-call bank accounts, PIEs that are unregistered superannuation schemes and listed PIEs. A borrower who chose to invest in a savings account would face repayment obligations on this income if they earned enough. A borrower who invested in an unlocked PIE would not. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee asked why borrowers cannot have the repayment holiday entitlement reset once they pay off their loan and get a new repayment holiday if they take out another loan. Comment Government policy is that the repayment holiday is available once, rather than repeatedly. 39 Taking a repayment holiday tends to increase, rather than decrease, a borrower’s lifetime loan obligations, so a further entitlement to a repayment holiday would not necessary advantage borrowers over their lifetimes. It would also increase the cost to government by extending the term of the loan. The repayment holiday enables people who leave New Zealand briefly, such as for an “OE”, to prevent penalties increasing their loan balances due to missed payments while they holiday or set themselves up overseas. However, interest charges continue to apply during the repayment holiday, so that loan balances will continue to increase if the borrower makes no payments during a repayment holiday. There is no repayment holiday for borrowers who remain in New Zealand, so if the policy was changed to provide a further entitlement to a repayment holiday, the change could be seen as inequitable to people who remain in New Zealand and have no temporary break from making loan payments. Changes to the repayment holiday in Budget 2011 reinforce that the break from making compulsory repayments is a privilege rather than a right, and increase equity between borrowers who remain in New Zealand (and do not have any repayment holiday) and people who move overseas. These changes include the reduction in length of the repayment holiday, and the requirement to apply for the repayment holiday and provide a contact person. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee asked what the impact of the three-year repayment holiday has been on borrower compliance since its introduction, and has there been enough time to properly gauge the impacts. Comment The Government considered that the current three-year repayment holiday provided to overseas-based borrowers was generous compared with New Zealand-based borrowers who contribute to New Zealand society and who are required to make repayments as soon as their income exceeds the repayment threshold. It therefore seemed reasonable for overseas-based borrowers to begin making repayments after a 12-month period away from New Zealand. The first group of borrowers to come off a 3-year repayment holiday occurred in the 2010–11 tax year. These borrowers would have had a repayment obligation due in that year. 40 In 2011 Inland Revenue undertook research to evaluate the provision of the repayment holiday. The research concluded that the repayment holiday was not seen to have any significant influence on whether borrowers would start repaying their student loans at the end of their holiday or on whether they return to New Zealand. It also found that borrowers involved in the research had generally travelled and had casual work in the first 12 to 18 months of their “OE”, but after this they aimed to gain professional overseas experience and to remain in the one city, and have steady employment. Other research has also shown that around three quarters of overseas borrowers have income above NZ $30,000 per annum. A recent study undertaken by KEA foundation of approximately 15,000 New Zealanders living overseas found that the major factors influencing borrowers’ decision to live overseas were the economic factors and family lifestyle. Having a student loan was not seen as significant. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee asked what the revenue impact of the proposals is? What are the valuation impacts/cost of lending and what are the assumptions? Comment The extension of pay-period assessments is estimated to lead to an additional $5 million per annum collected through student loan deductions, which is 8 percent more than would be required for these borrowers under the current end-of-year square-up policy ($65.6 million). These estimates are based on 2010 tax year data from borrower returns and employer monthly schedules. The change to exclude losses from the calculation of repayment obligations affects approximately 13,000 borrowers and will increase student loan repayment obligations by an estimated $9 million per annum. This estimate is based on 2010 tax year data from borrowers’ returns and has been adjusted for the anticipated impact of the Budget 2010 changes to depreciation which is expected to reduce losses incurred in some sectors. 41 The overall impact of the Budget 2011 package on the cost of lending was calculated at the time of Budget 2011 to reduce the cost of lending from the current level of 45.25 cents to 43.74 cents in the dollar, once the package is fully implemented. The impacts on the operating balance for the initiatives included in the bill are forecast to be as follows: Table A: Operating impact of the student support package Proposals Operating ($ million) 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 Total Excluding (adding back) losses to income for student loan repayment purposes - - (1.400) (1.400) (0.140) (2.940) One-year application based repayment holiday - - - - - - Require a contact person for all new loan applications - 0.284 0.071 - - 0.355 The pay-period assessment was done outside the Budget process and is not included in the above figures. Costing assumptions have been designed to be conservative, so that savings and improvements to the valuation are not overstated. In the case of the repayment holiday and contact person initiatives, that has meant that we have assumed no increase in repayments in the short term. In the case of the initiative to exclude losses from income, that has meant we have assumed the initiative has most impact in its first two years and then has a smaller on-going impact. The valuation of the Student Loan Scheme as at 30 June 2011 assumed no impact on the valuation from these initiatives. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee asked what proportion of women borrowers are in default? Comment Of the total number of borrowers in default, 47 percent are female. The following table provides a breakdown of the number of males and female borrowers in default and the amounts in default by residence status. 42 Number Amount in default NZB Female 15,888 $38,778,074.00 Male 17,535 $62,272,860.00 Undisclosed 15 $54,427.00 OBB Female 21,821 $135,690,211.00 Male 24,871 $175,510,963.00 Undisclosed 78 $618,707.00 Total 80,208 $412,925,243.00 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Finance and Expenditure Committee) The Committee asked what information is held on Inland Revenue’s examination of student loans by English language students that are in default. Comment Inland Revenue does not hold information on courses undertaken by borrowers. We are therefore unable to provide information on the extent to which English language students are in default. There was a significant increase in student loan borrowing by English language students, particularly new permanent residents in older age groups, in 2007. There was a concern that new permanent residents were using student loans as income support. The Government has responded to this increase, including through:  Budget 2010 changes to create a stand-down period of two years for all new permanent residents, consistent with the existing stand-down period for income support; and  Budget 2011 changes to limit student loan borrowing to fees only for people aged over 55 years. Officials are monitoring the impact of these changes. Recommendation That the submission be noted.
Policy Advice Division factsheet July 2012 1 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Taxation of foreign superannuation Why are changes being made? The current rules for taxing New Zealand tax-residents on their interests in foreign superannuation schemes are complex. Tax may be imposed under a number of different regimes, including the foreign investment fund (FIF) international tax rules, the dividend rules, and the trust distribution tax rules. It can be difficult to determine whether the FIF rules or other tax rules apply. Depending on which set of rules applies, your foreign superannuation is taxed either on an annual basis calculated on the value of your investment (under the FIF rules), or at the time you receive the income (for instance, a pension payment, a lump sum withdrawal, or a transfer to another scheme). The application of different rules can lead to differing results across people in similar circumstances. What are the proposed new rules? Under the proposed new regime for taxing your foreign superannuation, as outlined in the officials’ issues paper, the FIF rules would no longer apply. You would only need to consider whether you have New Zealand tax to pay when you receive a pension payment or lump sum, or when you transfer your superannuation to another scheme. If you receive a pension payment, you would be taxed as many always have been – at your individual marginal tax rate (ranging from 10.5% to 33%). A lump sum withdrawal or a transfer to another scheme would be taxed depending on how long you have been in New Zealand before you withdraw or transfer. Only a portion of the lump sum would be included in your taxable income. The remainder would not be taxable. This is called the inclusion rate approach. The proposed new rules are intended to be simple and easy to comply with. What is the inclusion rate approach? Once the necessary legislation is enacted, the inclusion rate approach would apply to lump sum amounts, both withdrawals and transfers to another scheme. Instead of paying tax on your foreign superannuation annually, this approach means that the tax liability on your foreign superannuation is typically deferred until you receive the income. The extent of the lump sum that would be included in your taxable income, on which you apply your marginal tax rate, would depend on how long you have been a New Zealand tax-resident for before you receive the lump sum. The longer the duration, the greater the amount that would be included in your taxable income. The proportion of the lump sum to be included would range from 0% (in the first two years) to 100% (after 25 years). Policy Advice Division factsheet July 2012 2 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz When would the new rules apply from? Once the legislation is enacted, the new rules would apply to income received from a foreign superannuation scheme – including pension payments, withdrawals and transfers to another scheme – on or after 1 April 2011. However, if your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was taxed under the FIF rules in the 2010–11 income year or earlier years, and you declared this income in your tax return by 31 March 2012, you would continue to apply those rules instead. Separate rules may apply to transfers or withdrawals of foreign superannuation made between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2011. These are explained below. I transferred my superannuation to New Zealand several years ago and did not pay any tax on the lump sum amount. What do I do now? In some cases, no tax would have been payable on the lump sum. This is true if you had been properly declaring income on your foreign superannuation under the FIF rules at the time you transferred. You will have no further tax to pay on that lump sum amount. In other situations, the FIF rules would not have applied and so tax on the lump sum may have been payable. If you were not applying the FIF rules to your foreign superannuation at the time you transferred, once the proposals become law you can apply a single low inclusion rate to your withdrawal or transfer. The issues paper proposes that a small portion of the lump sum (such as 15%) would be included in your taxable income, on which you would pay tax at your marginal rate. The remainder would not be taxable. No use-of-money interest or penalties would apply. Alternatively, you can use the relevant tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or transfer, along with use-of-money interest and relevant penalties. This option would be available for transfers and withdrawals between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2011. If you choose to apply a single low inclusion rate to your lump sum and the proposals in the issues paper become law, you would need to notify Inland Revenue before 1 April 2014. Details of how to make this disclosure will be provided once the policy has been finalised. I am a transitional resident and want to withdraw my superannuation from the foreign scheme. Do I have to do anything? New migrants who have been away from New Zealand for at least 10 years may qualify as a transitional resident if they arrive after 1 April 2006. Transitional residents are exempt on most types of foreign income, including foreign superannuation, for approximately the first four years of being a New Zealand tax-resident. If you are a transitional resident, your foreign superannuation – including any withdrawals or transferred amounts – is not subject to New Zealand tax as long as you remain a transitional resident. Under existing law, any earnings (such as interest income) on an amount of superannuation that is brought to and invested in New Zealand may be taxable while you are a transitional resident. This tax treatment is not affected by the proposals. Policy Advice Division factsheet July 2012 3 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz I have superannuation in a foreign scheme from when I worked overseas, which I have not yet brought to New Zealand. Do I have to do anything? If your superannuation is still in the foreign scheme, you would not need to do anything under the proposed new rules until you receive a pension or lump sum, or transfer to another scheme. At that point, and once the necessary legislation is enacted, you would either pay tax on your pension or apply the inclusion rate to the lump sum withdrawal or transfer and pay tax on the result. Alternatively, if you previously paid tax under the FIF rules on your foreign superannuation in the 2010–11 or earlier income year by 31 March 2012, you would continue to apply the FIF rules. Any income that you actually receive would not be taxed under the proposed new rules. I ceased being a transitional resident in the 2011–12 income year. In that year, I paid tax under the FIF rules on my foreign superannuation for the first time. Am I able to continue to use the FIF rules? To be able to continue using the FIF rules in future income years, the current proposals would require you to have returned FIF income for the 2010–11 income year by 31 March 2012. As you were not subject to the FIF rules in the 2010–11 income year due to being a transitional resident, once these proposals become law you may not continue to use the FIF rules. When you receive income from your foreign superannuation scheme in the form of a lump sum or pension, you would be taxed under the new rules. Any FIF tax that you have already paid would be refunded to you or used to offset any tax payable on receipt of the income. I have superannuation in an Australian scheme and want to transfer it to New Zealand. How will this be affected? In most situations, foreign superannuation held in an Australian superannuation scheme would not be taxable annually under the FIF rules. Instead, you would need to consider how it would be taxed when you make a lump sum withdrawal or transfer. Under the Australia-New Zealand double tax agreement, if you receive a lump sum amount from Australia under a retirement benefit scheme, or in consequence of retirement, it is not taxable in New Zealand. You would not be taxed under the proposed new rules. If the double tax agreement does not apply, transfers into a KiwiSaver scheme from an Australian superannuation scheme may still be tax-free under an agreement on the portability of retirement savings between Australia and New Zealand. This is not yet in force, but will come into effect shortly after both countries inform each other that the necessary legislation has been enacted. In New Zealand, the relevant legislation was passed in 2010. Once your superannuation has been brought to and invested in New Zealand, any investment gains (such as interest income) will be taxable under existing law. That is, the current tax treatment of such income will be retained.
Fact sheet Elections to exit the herd scheme What is changing? Irrevocable elections Elections to use the herd scheme will be irrevocable except, where then is a change of farming operation to a fattening regime, to which a cost-based valuation regime would more be appropriate. This change will apply from 18 August 2011, the date the officials’ issues paper Herd scheme elections was released. Therefore, elections to exit the herd scheme made since then will not become effective. Associated party transactions The purchaser in associated party transactions will be required to adopt the vendor’s herd scheme elections and base herd numbers. The only exception to this is when there is a complete inter-generational change of ownership. This will apply to associated persons transactions from today, 28 March 2012. Fiscal effect and the application date The application date decision was based on the estimated effect on the baselines of the increased market value of dairy and beef cattle, and sheep, that is currently occurring and early evidence of farmers’ reaction to it – that is, elections to exit the herd scheme are currently being made. The baseline effect of not making this change would be a $275 million decrease in tax revenue over six years starting in the 2012–13 year. This is an estimate, but what is clear is that without this change there would have been a significant reduction in coming years. The 18 August 2011 application date cancels this decrease and reinstates the baselines to what they would have been. The Government is very clear that allowing farmers to access this unintended subsidy is unfair on all other taxpayers as foreshadowed in Budget 2011. Farmers and their accountants were informed about this analysis on 18 August 2011 with the release of the officials’ issues paper. Only the future tax payments in the 2012–13 and subsequent income years are affected by this announcement. There is no effect on tax payments that have already been made, or that have to be made for the 2011–12 income year. Associated persons The definition of “associated person” in relation to this announcement has yet to be confirmed, but the officials’ issues paper suggested it should mean “individuals within two degrees of association, spouses (including civil union and de facto), family trusts and companies, whether owned by the trust or the family directly.” However, where a farmer ceases farming by completely selling the farming operation to his or her children (or grandchildren), it was argued in submissions that the new generation should be allowed a one-off opportunity to exit from the herd scheme. For such an inter-generational sale relief to qualify, the vendor would have to completely dispose of his or her direct and indirect interests in the farm. For example, the vendor could not be a beneficiary of a trust that directly or indirectly owned the farm, or potentially be added to the list of beneficiaries. However, any loans left in on the sale would not count as an interest in the farm. Sharemilkers buying their first farm Submissions were made recommending that sharemilkers be allowed to elect out of the herd scheme when they down-size their herd to buy their first farm. The tax advantage generated by exiting the herd scheme is often part of the funding analysis that leads to the purchase. Merely banking the tax opportunity of the write-down from herd values to national standard costs (NSC) is insufficient reason to allow this. Background There are effectively two ways that farmers value their livestock (mainly beef and dairy cattle, and sheep (but also deer, goats and pigs)), at balance date for tax purposes. The herd scheme treats livestock more as if they were a capital asset by using national average market values (commonly called “herd values”) with changes in values from year to year on tax-free capital account. National standard cost or NSC is similar to a typical trading stock scheme where changes in values from year to year are on tax account. The major difference from a standard trading stock scheme is that on-farm costs for breeding, rearing and growing home-bred livestock are, for simplicity, standardised nationally. As could be expected for a home-bred operation, herd values generally exceed NSC. It is this difference that gives rise to the tax advantage that was the subject of the officials’ consultation paper. This difference is tax-deductible to a farmer who elects to exit the herd scheme, usually over about six years as replacement livestock are home-bred. Further, farmers could elect out of the herd scheme with a short advance notice period. While most farmers have observed the long-term nature of the herd scheme election and have not made elections to exit it, the present high prices for sheep, and dairy and beef cattle has created a tax planning opportunity for farmers who are using the herd scheme to value their livestock to elect to exit the herd scheme by 31 March 2012, effective for the 2012–13 income year. A similar opportunity existed for dairy farmers for the 2008–09 year income year. The implications of this earlier opportunity were illustrated in detail in the officials’ issues paper. An example from that paper is illustrated below. There is evidence that a few dairy farmers have, in the period since 2008, elected out of the herd scheme to derive a tax advantage, then elected back in, and are now electing out again to derive the same tax advantage. This also points to the reason why the election will be irrevocable – the alternative of lengthening the election period still allows choice and merely makes it harder to seek the tax advantage, rather than eliminating the opportunity. However, there can be legitimate reasons for electing out of the herd scheme – any change in a farming regime from, say, beef breeding to a beef fattening regime is an example of this. The new rules will explicitly recognise this. Likely other changes The officials’ issues paper also discussed the general cessation of farming election where the farm is sold to a third party. It noted that the election rules around this produced a bias against the government. During consultation there seemed to be no disagreement with addressing this. During consultation other helpful suggestions were made, such as combining the classes for Jersey and Friesian dairy cattle. These matters will be considered by Ministers over the next month or two. Consultation on detail There will be an opportunity for the private sector to review the technical detail associated with the decision. Given the technical nature of these changes, this will help ensure that the amendments are correct. Example This example is Example 6 (page 15) of the officials’ issues paper. Using a herd of 300 dairy cows (the average herd was about 350 dairy cows) and 120 replacement R 1 and R 2 heifers (60 of each) the tax valuations around this 2008 period are illustrated below. Admittedly this is a worst case scenario and most dairy farmers did not make any of the elections referred to below. The example from the issues paper: Example 6: Election back into the herd scheme Year Valuation election Opening stock Closing stock Tax account Capital account 2008 Herd 473,640 818,580 Nil 344,940 2009 NSC 818,580 745,392 (73,188) Nil 2010 Herd 745,392 521,220 (224,172) Nil The 2006–07 year By the time this tax return would typically have been filed it would have been very clear that the 2008 herd values were going to be high. A number (but nowhere near a majority) of dairy farmers, who were using the herd scheme, elected with their 2006–07 tax return that they would exit the herd scheme effective for the 2008–09 income year. The tax return filing rules allow for this 2006–07 tax return to have been filed as late as 31 March 2008. The 2007–08 year In the farmer’s 2007–08 income year the farmer derived a tax-free write-up of $345,000 from the lower 2007 herd values to the higher 2008 herd values. The herd scheme methodology provides that this is tax-free. There is no policy problem with this. The 2008–09 year The farmer’s opening livestock was valued at the high 2008 herd values and the closing stock was valued using the cost-based NSC. The replacement stock (the heifers born in 2008) would be valued at cost, whereas the stock that was on hand at the start of the year (now the R 2 heifers and the remaining MA cows) would be valued at the opening herd values (and in the case the R 2 heifers a cost for growing them for the year would also be included). The effect is that the difference between the opening and closing values yields a tax deduction of about $73,000. The 2009–10 year If no election was made to re-join the herd scheme in this or future years, further deductions would be available. Over the 2008–09 and subsequent years these deductions would total about $500,000. However, some farmers who elected out for the 2008–09 year elected back in for the 2009–10 year. There is no analysis of how many of the dairy farmers that elected out of the herd scheme for the 2008–09 income year have elected back in for this year. As is illustrated in the table above, the herd scheme values for 2010 fell considerably from their 2008 values and a further write down to these lower herd scheme values resulted in a tax deduction for this year of $224,000.

This report explains these concerns and how New Zealand and other countries are responding. It also provides a brief summary of New Zealand’s existing rules for ensuring multinationals are taxed on activities that they perform in New Zealand. Key points • Expectations that multinationals will pay tax on their business profits somewhere in the world are being thwarted by some multinationals – particularly technology companies and firms with high levels of intangible property (such as patents, IP and brands). • These multinationals don’t pay tax at source – that is, where the income is earned because many countries (including New Zealand and other OECD countries) only tax foreign companies on activities that they actually perform in their countries. • These multinationals also don’t pay tax in the countries where they are headquartered, are owned, or where the activities actually take place, because of deficiencies in domestic laws and the application of tax treaties and EU directives. • The main concern is that these multinationals appear to be not paying tax on their business income anywhere. This raises issues of fairness, tax base protection and efficiency. • This problem is broader than a particular structure, industry or country. It is a global problem which requires a global response which New Zealand will be actively involved in. In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 2 Developments in other countries The OECD is currently developing a BEPS (tax base erosion and profit shifting) initiative to address this issue. Last month Germany, the UK, France and Australia made public announcements backing the OECD BEPS initiative. In addition the Australian government has directed the Treasury to develop a scoping paper that will set out the risks to the sustainability of Australia's corporate tax base from multinational tax minimisation strategies and to identify potential responses. This report will be released for public consultation in mid-2013. Australia is also currently updating their transfer pricing and general anti-avoidance rules to address some problematic court decisions. There is political pressure building in the UK for the multinationals to pay more tax. This has largely been reflected in media reporting and by opposition parties in the UK Parliament. To date, the UK government response has been to issue a statement backing the OECD’s work on this issue and an announcement of additional funding for the revenue department to target avoidance. What should New Zealand do? A co-ordinated global effort will be required to address this issue. At a conceptual level we see the following broad options for tackling this issue. 1. Identifying and addressing gaps in New Zealand’s own base protection rules that apply to non-resident investment into New Zealand. • Like Australia, we believe it is important to give priority to projects which protect source base taxation. For instance, there are still some gaps in our thin- capitalisation rules which we are working to address and you have recently agreed that Cabinet approval be sought for a release of an issues paper to counter this; Officials Issues Paper – Thin capitalisation (T2012/3107; PAD 2012/257). We will also report to you next year on any other proposals to ensure that income earned in New Zealand is subject to appropriate levels of source taxation. • Unlike Australia, New Zealand has so far not had particular difficulties applying its transfer pricing and general anti-avoidance rule. However, Australia’s experience highlights the importance of ensuring these rules are up to date with international developments. 2. Promoting best practice for residence taxation by all countries under their domestic law. • Most countries tax their residents on their worldwide income, so if there are no gaps in residence taxation it will be much more difficult for multinationals to not pay tax anywhere. This in turn will reduce the incentive some multinationals have to minimise taxation in the source countries where the revenue is earned. • This would involve developing a shared focus by countries on promoting best practice for taxing on residence basis; i.e. addressing common gaps in CFC rules and addressing issues relating to hybrid instruments (which may be deductible in In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 3 one country and exempt in another) and hybrid entities (which may be a taxpayer in one country, but disregarded for tax purposes in another country). New Zealand will promote this through our involvement in the OECD BEPS project. • It would also involve continuing efforts to enhance information exchange between tax authorities. 3. Participating in work to update and improve the international tax framework that is reflected in the OECD model DTA and other areas. To quote an OECD paper on the subject, many international tax concepts “were built on the assumption that one country would forgo taxation because another country would be imposing tax. In the modern global economy, this assumption is not always correct, as planning opportunities may result in profits ending up untaxed anywhere.” In the long run this might include looking at the allocation of taxing rights under DTAs, for example; • Are the permanent establishment rules too limited? • Do they apply appropriately to services provided over the internet? • Are the withholding rates in the OECD Model DTA appropriate? • Should the source country still be required to forego taxation if the residence country is not taxing the income? • Effectiveness of treaty abuse rules and domestic anti-avoidance rules to challenge multinationals that try to take advantage of relief that they are not entitled to. More broadly: New Zealand should work with the OECD. We agree with the OECD position that it is important to examine the issue from all angles since it may be that existing tax frameworks and country practices are inadequate for addressing this problem. We believe that New Zealand should actively participate in the work of the OECD work on BEPS. Last week we spoke with the OECD Secretariat on the process going forward and signalled a strong interest in the project. We are also currently identifying data and relevant analyses that can be provided to the OECD to assist them in developing a fuller assessment of the problem. We will be attending the meeting of the Committee of Fiscal Affairs in January and we understand this is an important item on the agenda. New Zealand should coordinate with Australia. We should work directly with Australian officials. We have a similar approach to international tax policy design and tax treaties and it makes sense to work closely with them on possible solutions. We are exploring with the Australian Treasury how we might best work together on this topic at an official level. We will report to you on developments in March 2013. This will include further information on the OECD BEPS project after their initial analysis is published in February 2013.

Recent media coverage in the UK, Australia and New Zealand has drawn attention to the amount of tax paid by large multinational companies. 2. This report explains these concerns and how New Zealand and other countries are responding. It also provides a brief summary of New Zealand’s existing rules for ensuring multinationals are taxed on activities that they perform in New Zealand. Analysis Key Points • Expectations that multinationals will pay tax on their business profits somewhere in the world are being thwarted by some multinationals – particularly technology companies and firms with high levels of intangible property (such as patents, IP and brands). • These multinationals don’t pay tax at source – that is, where the income is earned because many countries (including New Zealand and other OECD countries) only tax foreign companies on activities that they actually perform in their countries. • These multinationals also don’t pay tax in the countries where they are headquartered, are owned, or where the activities actually take place, because of deficiencies in domestic laws and the application of tax treaties and EU directives. • The main concern is that these multinationals appear to be not paying tax on their business income anywhere.

The Australian Treasury is also preparing a scoping paper on this issue, which will be released for consultation in mid-2013. We are exploring with the Australian Treasury how we might best work together on this topic at an official level. 3. These points are elaborated on below. 1 This relates to efficiency of investment decisions from a worldwide perspective as decisions would be driven by tax rather than commercial considerations. In practice, many countries use tax settings to compete for investment -this may maximise national welfare, but reduce global welfare. In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 6 Expectations that multinationals will pay tax on their business profits somewhere in the world are being thwarted by some multinationals. 4. The global international tax framework reflected in tax treaties assumes that multinational corporations will be taxed somewhere on their cross border business income. 5. Specifically, it is envisaged that business income will be taxed either in the state where the income is earned (the source state) or the state where the taxpayer is resident (the residence state). 6. Historically, the primary international tax concern is that both states will assert a taxing right under domestic law resulting in double taxation of cross border income. This is why the focus of international tax treaties is on eliminating double taxation by allocating taxing rights as between residence and source states. 7. The problem is that some multinationals appear to be able to structure themselves so they are not paying tax anywhere. In other words there is no taxation in the state where the income is earned. Nor is there taxation in the residence state where the multinational is headquartered, is ultimately owned or controlled, or where the activities are based. 8. To quote an OECD paper on the subject, many international tax concepts “were built on the assumption that one country would forgo taxation because another country would be imposing tax. In the modern global economy, this assumption is not always correct, as planning opportunities may result in profits ending up untaxed anywhere.” Some multinationals don’t pay tax on a source basis in the country where the income is earned – e.g. in New Zealand 9. New Zealand taxes income of non-residents that is earned (“sourced”) in New Zealand. 10. Whether business income of a foreign multinational is taxable under our domestic law depends on whether the non-resident carries on its business in New Zealand. Whether business is carried on in New Zealand is question of fact. However, the mere fact that a payment for goods or services is made by a New Zealander does not mean the business activity is carried on in New Zealand and therefore does not, by itself, give business income a (taxable) source in New Zealand. 11. There are strong reasons for New Zealand to be in line with international norms on international taxation. Otherwise New Zealand may become an unattractive place to base a business. However, even if we changed our domestic tax laws so that we could tax all business income earned by non-residents from any sales to New Zealanders, our tax treaties would override the new laws. This is because our bilateral tax treaties also require a non- resident business to carry on its business in New Zealand and also have a substantial physical presence in New Zealand (such as employees, offices and factories) in order for New Zealand to tax their New Zealand profits. In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 7 12. This general approach in New Zealand treaties is entrenched in both the OECD and UN model tax conventions and is a core feature of thousands of double tax agreements around the world. 13. The principle underpinning our domestic law and treaties is that a distinction should be drawn between “trading with a country” and “trading in a country”. The result is that traditional exporters of goods and services do not pay income tax on their products in the country where the products are consumed. For example, goods imported into New Zealand (e.g. cars) do not give New Zealand a taxing right over the business income earned by the firm that exported the goods. This works both ways. New Zealand firms that simply export goods to other countries (e.g. meat products) will not be taxed in the foreign country on the business income that relates to the sales of those exported goods. 14. For example, under New Zealand’s DTA with China, New Zealand exporters will not usually be taxed in China on their profits from sales to Chinese customers. However, if the New Zealand exporter had more significant activities in China such as a manufacturing operation, a sales office or customer support services, China would be able to tax any profits associated with those specific activities. 15. This distinction partly reflects the fact that working out what portion of a multinational’s profits relate to sales to customers in a particular country is too complex. In addition, there is an argument that a non-resident who has no substantial presence in a country may not be a significant user of resources or infrastructure supplied by that country. 16. The activities carried out by technology companies can be likened to traditional exporters of goods who trade with a country, rather than in a country. The public concern this raises is that the internet has made it possible to provide an increasing range of services to New Zealand customers from remote locations. As a consequence, businesses that provide online services are able to provide services through offshore entities, such as Irish companies, that have no physical presence in New Zealand. That is, since the bulk of what these companies do, in terms of programming, designing websites, running servers and selling advertising space is done overseas, New Zealand, like other countries, may have very limited taxing rights. These multinationals may not be paying tax on a residence basis either - resulting in no taxation anywhere 17. As explained above, in cases where business income is not taxable in the source country (e.g. New Zealand), the activities will usually be taxed in the country where the beneficial owner of the income is resident (the residence country). 18. The international norm is that residence countries do not tax income earned by foreign subsidiaries (except sometimes passive income) or tax dividends from foreign subsidiaries. This means foreign-sourced income is often never taxed by the residence country (until distributed to ultimate shareholders – but the period of deferral until distribution may be significant and in some cases indefinite). In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 8 19. Media reports that certain multinationals pay very low rates of tax on their worldwide operations suggest that these multinationals are also not effectively taxed in the state where the multinational originated, is owned, or even where the activities of the multinational take place. 20. Whilst New Zealand has rules to guard against profit-shifting (as listed in para 60 and described in annex 3), these rules can only apply when profits are shifted out of New Zealand, they do not usually apply to profits shifted between two foreign countries. 21. Other countries also have rules to tax their residents and guard against profit-shifting, but these rules can have gaps and weaknesses which may make them ineffective. 22. This could be due to the following, or a combination of the following reasons: • Ineffective controlled foreign company rules • Arbitrage between different countries’ domestic law rules • Related party transactions which shift profits from a high tax to a low tax country Ineffective CFC rules 23. A multinational is a firm with a parent company in one jurisdiction with a network of subsidiaries in other countries. Most OECD countries have controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. CFC rules enable countries to tax their own residents on income they earn through offshore subsidiaries they control. They will normally give a credit for foreign tax that is paid by the subsidiary. 24. Normally CFC rules tax only passive income (interest, dividends, and royalties) and not active income (manufacturing) on the assumption that the location of active business is not tax driven and involves no risk to the domestic tax base. 25. One possibility is that standard CFC rules are proving ineffective in situations when they ought to apply. Moreover, there is constant pressure on governments to continue to relax these rules and that has been a significant trend in recent years. For example, the main reason why New Zealand introduced an active income exemption for CFCs in 2009 was that other countries, including Australia, had active income exemptions. This meant New Zealand’s previous approach of taxing CFCs on all of their income created an incentive for New Zealand-based multinationals to shift their headquarters to Australia. This demonstrates the need for some international coordination to address tax structuring by multinationals. Arbitrage between domestic law rules 26. Domestic tax law features may prevent effective taxation of these multinationals on a residence basis. Differences in countries’ domestic law entity classification (including, for instance, the US check-the-box rules which allow limited liability companies to be regarded as part of a parent company for US tax purposes) and differences in domestic law distinctions In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 9 between debt and equity classifications may result in opportunities for cross-border arbitrage. Arbitrage of this nature often leads to double non-taxation (e.g. deduction in one state and exemption in the other). We recently reported to you on cross-border arbitrage using hybrid instruments between Australia and New Zealand – Tax deductions for hybrid instruments issued by New Zealand companies (T2012/2356; PAD 2012/216). Related party transactions 27. In addition, multinational companies can shift profits between countries through intergroup dealings. This typically involves a company in a high tax country making a deductible payment to a related company in a low tax country. Some examples of this are: • Royalty payments for the use of intangible property (patents, IP or brands) • Interest payments in respect of a related party loan • Inflated management or consulting fees for services performed offshore • Purchasing goods or inputs from a related company at an inflated or discounted price. 28. The end result is that there is less profit in the high tax country and more profit in the low tax country and a lower overall tax bill. 29. Depending on the specific facts and circumstances, it may be possible for countries to use transfer pricing and thin capitalisation rules to challenge profit-shifting transactions. Domestic law and treaties rely on transfer pricing methods to ensure transactions between members of a multinational group are conducted at arms’ length. This ensures taxable profit on cross border transactions reflect what would have occurred between unrelated parties. This means that transfer pricing may not be effective in preventing profit-shifting in cases where the price of the cross-border transaction reflects what a third party would actually pay. 30. Another way to combat profit-shifting is through the use of withholding taxes. Most countries impose withholding taxes on interest and royalty payments. However, these withholding taxes are usually reduced or eliminated under double tax agreements or EU directives relating to the free movement of capital. (Note the OECD Model Convention has no withholding tax on royalties.) As a result multinationals may be able to structure their investments to minimise or circumvent withholding taxes. Note that the OECD already has a major project underway on intangible property to address particular concerns in this area. Many structures involve a combination of approaches 31. Many structures involve a combination of the above features. These structures can be difficult to tackle on a unilateral basis as they take advantage of complex interactions between the laws of two or more countries as well as their international tax treaties. 32. For example, it has been reported that some firms employ a structure known as the “Double Irish” or the “Dutch Sandwich”. In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 10 33. This involves an Irish company selling products or services to customers outside of Ireland. The profit from these sales is taxable in Ireland, but the Irish company is required to pay a royalty for the use IP which belongs to a related company. This royalty payment substantially reduces the profits that are taxable in Ireland. 34. The royalty payments are routed through other companies in the Netherlands and Ireland in order to escape withholding taxes. The final result is that the profits ultimately end up in a jurisdiction where little or no tax is payable. 35. This is just one example of a tax minimisation structure. Cracking down on one particular structure may be ineffective if other structures can be used to achieve similar results. Concerns with multinationals not paying tax anywhere on their business income 36. Media comment around the world has focused on the unfairness of the low levels of tax paid by some multinationals. Fairness in a tax system is critical for many reasons, including the promotion of voluntary compliance which underpins modern tax administration. 37. In addition to concerns about fairness, governments have major concerns about the erosion of their tax bases at a time of global fiscal crisis. 38. We note in this regard, that the absence of effective taxation on a residence basis is likely to undermine taxation at source and potentially distort business decisions. 2 39. If a multinational is taxable on a residence basis their decision about whether to locate business activity in a source state will take into account tax considerations such as corporate tax rates. But assuming rates are comparable, decisions on where its activities are performed are likely to be largely determined by commercial, rather than tax considerations. For example if a US headquartered multinational is paying tax on its worldwide income under the US rules, then it would not usually be concerned with minimising the profits which are taxed in New Zealand. This is because New Zealand tax can be credited to offset the US tax, so it would make little difference to their overall tax bill whether tax is paid in New Zealand or the US. 40. But if residence taxation does not apply then this will substantially increase the incentive of the multinational to minimise its taxable presence in the source state. This is because the difference is between source state taxation and no taxation. Continuing the example from above, if a US headquartered company does not face tax in the US, they will have an added incentive to minimise the tax which is payable in New Zealand as the New Zealand tax cannot be used to offset US tax. 2 This relates to the efficiency of investment decisions from a worldwide perspective as decisions would be driven by tax rather than commercial considerations. In practice, many countries use tax settings to compete for investment -this may maximise national welfare, but reduce global welfare. In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 11 This is a global problem that requires a global response 41. The problem is far broader than a particular structure, industry or country. 42. Many of the structures involve complex interactions between the laws of two or more countries as well as their international tax treaties. 43. This means a co-ordinated, comprehensive and global response is likely to be required to effectively address this issue. This response is being developed by the OECD with strong backing from the G20. G20 and OECD 44. Last month Germany and the United Kingdom called on G20 finance ministers to work together to strengthen international standards for corporate tax regimes. Ministers Schäuble and Osborne asked their G20 colleagues to back the OECD BEPS (tax base erosion and profit shifting) initiative. 45. France and Australia have also made public announcements backing this OECD work. 46. On 30 November 2012, the OECD has published a short background brief on this work (attached as annex 1). 47. Inland Revenue officials are actively involved in the OECD work on BEPS. This builds on our existing involvement in related initiatives such as the systematic reviews of country regimes being undertaken by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes and the OECD’s Forum on Harmful Tax Practices. 48. We expect the OECD work will be broad in scope and may include identifying gaps and weaknesses in the following areas: • Base protection rules, such as CFC rules, transfer pricing rules, thin-capitalisation rules and anti-avoidance rules. • Mismatches in domestic law such as hybrid instruments and hybrid entities. • Allocation of taxing rights under DTAs; for example are the permanent establishment rules too limited? • Harmful tax regimes such as low rates and concessions which create an incentive or ability to shift profits. • Effectiveness of other anti-abuse rules in domestic law and in tax treaties. In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 12 Australia 49. The Australian government has directed the Australian Treasury to develop a scoping paper that will set out the risks to the sustainability of Australia's corporate tax base from multinational tax minimisation strategies and to identify potential responses. 50. The paper will be informed by a specialist reference group, chaired by Rob Hefron from the Australian Treasury and made up of 13 other experts including tax professionals, academics, business tax managers and community leaders. 51. The scoping paper will be released for public consultation in mid-2013. A key objective of the work is to develop a common understanding of the problem. 52. Some earlier media reports have focused on a speech made by Australia's Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury that Australia’s tax laws were being revised to ensure that companies pay tax on profits made in the country. We note that the relevant changes are to Australia’s transfer pricing and general anti-avoidance rules. These changes are largely in response to some problematic court decisions in Australia (see annex 2 for more detail). 53. They are important changes to protect Australia’s corporate tax base, but are not a substitute for the international co-operation required to address the broader issue of some multinationals not paying tax anywhere. For this reason, Australia has signalled it strongly supports the OECD work on BEPS. United Kingdom 54. There is political pressure building in the UK for the multinationals to pay more tax. This has largely been reflected in media reporting and by opposition parties in the UK Parliament. Most notably, the UK Parliament’s public accounts committee published a report highlighting the problem. 55. To date, the UK government response has been to issue a statement backing the OECD’s work on BEPS (see para 44 above) and an announcement of additional funding of £77m for the revenue department to target avoidance. What should New Zealand do? 56. New Zealand should work with the OECD. We agree with the OECD position that it is important to examine the issue from all angles since it may be that existing tax frameworks and country practices are simply inadequate for addressing this problem. We believe that New Zealand should actively participate in the work of the OECD work on BEPS. Last week we spoke with the OECD Secretariat on the process going forward and signalled a strong interest in the project. We are also currently identifying data and relevant analyses that can be provided to the OECD to assist them in developing a fuller assessment of the problem. We will be attending the meeting of the Committee of Fiscal Affairs in January and we understand this is an important item on the agenda. Different aspects of the BEPS work are In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 13 also being considered by a number of OECD working parties, which New Zealand is already involved in. 57. New Zealand should coordinate with Australia and work directly with Australian officials. We are exploring with the Australian Treasury how we might best work together on this topic at an official level. We have a similar approach to international tax policy design and tax treaties and it makes sense to work closely with them on possible solutions. 58. We will report to you on developments in March 2013. This will include further information on the OECD BEPS project after their initial analysis is published in February 2013. 59. Finally, we consider that it is important to give priority to projects which protect source base taxation. For instance, there are still some gaps in our thin-capitalisation rules which we are working to address and you have recently agreed that Cabinet approval be sought for a release of an issues paper to counter this; Officials Issues Paper – Thin capitalisation (T2012/3107; PAD 2012/257). We will also report to you next year on any other proposals to ensure that income earned in New Zealand is subject to appropriate levels of source taxation. What existing measures does New Zealand use to ensure multinationals are taxed on activities they perform in New Zealand? 60. New Zealand employs a range of measures to ensure that multinational companies, or their New Zealand subsidiaries, are taxed appropriately on activities that they do perform in New Zealand. These include: • Transfer pricing rules • Thin capitalisation rules • Broader permanent establishment rules in tax treaties • Withholding tax • Exchanging information with other tax authorities; and • The general anti-avoidance rule 61. These measures are described in more detail in the annex 3. In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 14 ANNEX 1: 30 November 2012 The OECD Work on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Background There is a growing perception that governments lose substantial corporate tax revenue because of planning aimed at eroding the taxable base and/or shifting profits to locations where they are subject to a more favourable tax treatment. Civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have been vocal in this respect, sometimes addressing very complex tax issues in a simplistic manner and pointing fingers at transfer pricing rules based on the arm’s length principle as the cause of these problems. Beyond this perception based on a number of high profile cases, there is a more fundamental policy issue: the international common principles drawn from national experiences to share tax jurisdiction may not have kept pace with the changing business environment. Domestic rules for international taxation and internationally agreed standards are still grounded in an economic environment characterised by a lower degree of economic integration across borders, rather than today’s environment of global taxpayers, characterised by the increasing importance of intellectual property as a value-driver and by constant developments of information and communication technologies. For example, some rules and their underlying policy were built on the assumption that one country would forgo taxation because another country would be imposing tax. In the modern global economy, this assumption is not always correct, as planning opportunities may result in profits ending up untaxed anywhere. Political attention The debate over Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) has also reached the political level and has become a very important issue on the agenda of several OECD and non-OECD countries. The G20 Leaders meeting in Mexico on 18-19 June 2012 explicitly referred to “the need to prevent base erosion and profit shifting” in their final declaration. This message was reiterated at the G20 finance ministers meeting of 5-6 November 2012 whose final communiqué states “We also welcome the work that the OECD is undertaking into the problem of base erosion and profit shifting and look forward to a report about progress of the work at our next meeting." On the margins of the G20 meeting in November 2012, the United Kingdom’s chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, and Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, issued a joint statement, since then joined by France’s economy and finance minister Pierre Moscovici, calling for co-ordinated action to strengthen international tax standards and urged their counterparts to back efforts by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to identify possible gaps in tax laws. Such a concern was also voiced by US President Obama in his Framework for Business Tax Reform where it is stated that “the empirical evidence suggests that income-shifting behaviour by multinational corporations is a significant concern that should be addressed through tax reform”. 2 20 November 2012 In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 15 The issue in a nutshell Corporation tax is levied at a domestic level. The interaction of domestic tax systems sometimes leads to an overlap, which means that an item of income can be taxed by more than one jurisdiction thus resulting in double taxation. The interaction can also leave gaps, which result in an item of income not being taxed anywhere thus resulting in so called “double non-taxation”. Corporations have urged bilateral and multilateral co-operation among countries to address differences in tax rules that result in double taxation. Domestic and international rules to address double taxation, many of which originated with principles developed in the past by the League of Nations in the 1920’s, aim at addressing these overlaps so as to minimise trade distortions and impediments to sustainable economic growth. In contrast, corporations often exploit differences in domestic tax rules and international standards that provide opportunities to eliminate or significantly reduce taxation. Broadly speaking corporate tax planning strategies aim at moving profits to where they are taxed at lower rates and expenses to where they are relieved at higher rates. These strategies typically ensure: (i) minimisation of taxation in a foreign operating or source country, (ii) low or no withholding tax at source, (iii) low or no taxation at the level of the recipient, as well as (iv) no current taxation of the low taxed profits (achieved via the first three steps) at the level of the ultimate parent. The result is a tendency to associate more profit with legal constructs and intangible rights and obligations, thus reducing the share of profits associated with substantive operations involving the interaction of people with one another. While these corporate tax planning strategies may be technically legal and rely on carefully planned interactions of a variety of tax rules and principles, the overall effect of this type of tax planning is to erode the corporate tax base of many countries in a manner that is not intended by domestic policy. Key pressure areas In addition to a clear need for increased transparency on effective tax rates of MNEs, key pressure areas include those related to: • International mismatches in entity and instrument characterisation including hybrid mismatch arrangements and arbitrage; • application of treaty concepts to profits derived from the delivery of digital goods and services; • the tax treatment of related party debt-financing, captive insurance and other inter- group financial transactions; • transfer pricing, in particular in relation to the shifting of risks and intangibles, the artificial splitting of ownership of assets between legal entities within a group, and transactions between such entities that would rarely take place between independents; • the effectiveness of anti-avoidance measures, in particular GAARs, CFC regimes and thin capitalisation rules; and • the availability of preferential regimes for certain activities. In Confidence T2012/3250; PAD2012/268: Taxation of multinational companies Page 16 The role of the OECD When implemented effectively, the strategies used to shift profits and erode the taxable base put increased pressure on the rules and on the governments that designed them. This also reflects an important point, namely that BEPS strategies take advantage of a combination of features of tax systems which have been put in place by home and host countries. Accordingly, it may be impossible for any single country, acting alone, to fully address the issue. There is no magic recipe to address BEPS issues, but the OECD is ideally positioned to support countries’ efforts to ensure effectiveness and fairness and at the same time provide a certain and predictable environment for business. OECD member countries share a common interest in establishing a level playing field among countries while ensuring that domestic businesses are not disadvantaged vis-à-vis multinational corporations. Failure to collaborate in addressing BEPS issues could result in unilateral actions that would risk undermining the consensus-based framework for establishing jurisdiction to tax and addressing double taxation which exists today. The consequences could be damaging in terms of increased possibilities for mismatches, additional disputes, increased uncertainty for business, a battle to be the first to grab taxable income through purported anti-avoidance measures, or a race to the bottom with respect to corporate income taxes. In contrast, collaboration to address BEPS concerns will enhance and support individual governments’ domestic policy efforts to protect their tax base while protecting multinationals from uncertainty or double taxation. In this regard, addressing BEPS in a coherent and balanced manner should take into account the perspectives of industrialised as well as emerging and developing countries. Next steps The OECD will deliver a progress report to the G20 in early 2013 on actions to tackle the issue of BEPS, including strategies to detect and respond to aggressive tax planning and ensure better tax compliance. In addition to a clear need for better data and analyses, a reflection on the very fundamentals of the current rules also appears to be warranted. The reflection would primarily focus on issues around whether rules developed in the past are still fit the purpose in today’s business environment, particularly when applied to the increasingly digital economy, or whether there is a need for different solutions, as well as on options to implement reform in a streamlined manner. ANNEX 2: Australia’s domestic law reforms Australia is currently reforming their transfer pricing and general anti-avoidance rules. These changes are largely in response to some problematic court decisions in Australia. In announcing the changes to the general anti-avoidance rule, Australia’s Assistant Treasurer explained; "In recent cases, some taxpayers have argued successfully that they did not get a 'tax benefit' because, without the scheme, they would not have entered into an arrangement that attracted tax," "For example, they could have entered into another scheme that also avoided tax, deferred their arrangements indefinitely or done nothing at all. Such an outcome can potentially undermine the overall effectiveness of Part IVA \[the general anti-avoidance rule\] and so the Government will act to ensure such arguments will no longer be successful. The reforms to the transfer pricing rules were announced in November 2011. A media release accompanying this announcement explained: “A recent court case has highlighted some difficulties for Australia to appropriately assess transfer pricing cases in a way that is consistent with our major trading partners.” The changes will allow Australia to apply the OECD model transfer pricing guidelines when amending related party transactions under their domestic law. (The OECD guidelines and Australia’s DTAs allow a wider range of transfer pricing methods to be used than existed at the time that Australia put in place its domestic law.) The changes included retrospective amendments to confirm the transfer pricing rules in Australia’s tax treaties operated as intended, consistent with OECD best practice. The Australian experience highlights the importance of ensuring tax legislation is up to date with modern international practice. ANNEX 3: Existing measures to ensure multinationals are taxed on activities they perform in New Zealand New Zealand employs a range of measures to ensure that multinational companies, or their New Zealand subsidiaries, are taxed appropriately on activities that they do perform in New Zealand. Transfer pricing rules Transfer pricing rules apply to cross-border transactions between related parties, and substitute a price which would be agreed to if the parties were not related. The aim of these rules is to prevent companies from inappropriately inflating their costs, or minimising their income in order to reduce their taxable profits. The rules, however, focus on ensuring there is a correct price for a transaction. This means that transfer pricing may not be effective in preventing profit-shifting in cases where the price of the cross-border transaction reflects what a third party would actually pay (for example if low-ranking debt is used a high price may be justified, even though there is little risk in related party deals). The OECD publishes detailed Transfer Pricing Guidelines that are followed by New Zealand and other member countries. As mentioned in Annex 2, one reason why Australia is reforming their transfer pricing rules is because of a problematic court decision that made it more difficult for Australia to apply some new methods provided in the OECD guidelines. New Zealand has not experienced any problems in applying its transfer pricing rules. Thin capitalisation rules New Zealand, like many other countries, has thin-capitalisation rules. These rules help guard against profit shifting by denying interest deductions in cases where a multinational group has loaded too much debt into their New Zealand operations. As part of Budget 2010, the Government tightened the inbound thin capitalisation ratio from 75% to 60%. (This means foreign-owned companies are only able to claim tax deductions for interest payments on debt up to 60 per cent of their local asset value. The only exception is if the total multinational group's debt ratio is higher than this.) New Zealand’s thin-capitalisation rules are generally more comprehensive and tighter than rules in other countries. For example, New Zealand’s rules apply to both related and unrelated party debt, and although there is a growing worldwide trend to count both types of debt, many countries still only apply their rules to related party debt. In addition, New Zealand’s 60% ratio is tighter than Australia’s which remains at 75% (Australia consulted on reducing their ratio to 60% as part of a package of changes to fund a business tax cut, but decided against it). However, New Zealand’s thin-capitalisation have some gaps which mean certain investments are not currently subject to the rules. For example the current rules only apply to companies with a single non-resident controller, so don’t apply when several unrelated investors agree to load a very high level of debt into a New Zealand company. You have recently agreed that Cabinet approval be sought for a release of an issues paper to counter these gaps; Officials Issues Paper – Thin capitalisation (T2012/3107; PAD 2012/257). Broader Permanent establishment rules in tax treaties Under New Zealand’s double tax agreements, business income of non-resident companies is only taxable to the extent that it is derived through a permanent establishment (branch or fixed place of business) that the non-resident operates in in New Zealand. Importantly, New Zealand’s treaty policy is to secure a wider concept of permanent establishment than is contained in the OECD model –particularly in relation to services and natural resources. We have obtained this in most (but not all) of our treaties. Most other OECD countries have DTAs with more limited permanent establishment rules. Withholding tax New Zealand’s withholding tax rules impose tax on interest, dividend and royalty payments made by companies in New Zealand. Double tax agreements generally set out limits to the amount of withholding tax that will be deducted from amounts paid to non-residents. While New Zealand’s recent DTAs have reduced withholding tax rates on dividends and royalties this change was driven by a desire to reduce tax barriers to New Zealand businesses that expand offshore. Notwithstanding these recent reductions in rates, New Zealand, unlike most other OECD countries, retains a positive (5% or 10%) rate on royalty payments under our double tax agreements. This reduces the ability of multinationals to use royalties to reduce the profits of their New Zealand operations. It also helps Inland Revenue to identify high-priced royalties and challenge these, if necessary, by applying our transfer pricing rules. Officials have identified several issues that can affect New Zealand’s ability to collect withholding tax, particularly on interest payments. For example, interest is immediately deductible when the expense is incurred, but non-resident withholding tax only applies at the time the interest is actually paid, which may be a very long time after the deduction. We will report further on these issues next year. Exchanging information with other tax authorities Exchanging information with other tax authorities can be a very effective way to combat tax structures which try to take advantage of interactions between the laws of two or more countries. For example, New Zealand may become aware of a structure that appears to minimise foreign tax, rather than New Zealand tax. Sharing this information with the relevant foreign tax authority can help that country to enforce its rules or to identify and address deficiencies in its law. Over the last few years Inland Revenue has established a trans-Tasman financing desk to facilitate real time exchange of information with the Australian Tax Office. It has also taken a leading role in an OECD pilot group on the real time exchange of information on aggressive tax schemes involving hybrid entities and instruments. New Zealand is able to exchange information under our 38 double tax agreements, 21 tax information exchange agreements and the OECD Multi-lateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. The Multi-lateral convention allows New Zealand to automatically exchange information (the foreign country does not need to request the information) with the 42 countries that have signed and more countries will be added over time (so far 10 other countries have signalled their intention to sign). General anti-avoidance rule New Zealand has been successful in applying its general anti-avoidance rule to prevent profit- shifting by multinational companies. A recent example was the banking structured finance cases. The UK is developing a general anti-avoidance rule which will be introduced in 2013. As explained in Annex 2, Australia is looking to update its general anti-avoidance rule to address some problematic court decisions.
¿a- I Regulatory Impact Statement Greater information sharing between I¡rland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development Agency Disclosure Statement This regulatory impact statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options that would enable krland Revenue to more quickly and proactively share information with the Ministry of Social Development. The information would be shared to improve the accr:racy of social assistance payments, and enable Inland Revenue to proactively advise the Minishy of Social Development of suspected benefit fraud. Extensive public consultation was undertaken as part of the legislative process for the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act20l1. The consultation specifically included coverage of Inland Revenue sharing information with the Ministry of Social Development. ln addition, an anon5mrcus sample of 4,000 cases, independent research and consultation with agencies across the public sector were undertaken. The sample, consultation and research were taken into account in developing the approach to information sharing and provide support for the proposal in this regulatory impact statement. Lr sharing infomration in this way, there is a trade-off between the privacy rights of individuals and the need for govemment agencies to provide efficien! high quality services. However, the recomrnended design of the approach would provide considerable efficiencies for the govemment, whilst having a minimal effect on an individual's right to privacy. This is because the Ministry of Social Development would only receive inforrnation that it is lawfrrþ entitled to collect in its own rigþt and hland Revenue would not collect additional information on behalf of the Ministry of Social Development. 'We have not identified any other significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties. The preferred option in this statement does not impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest or override firnda:nental common law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue j 1 27 February 2012 'â STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION l. One of the main policy objectives underlying the Governrnent's Making TÐ( Easier discussion document, released in July 2010, was to bring about efficiencies across govemment agencies that interact with the tax systøn. A key part of this is to enable greater sharing of information across govemment agencies. The ability to share information is subject to the limitations set by privacy and secrecy laws. 2. The social assistance system relies on accvrate information to ensure that recipients receive the correct benefits. Recipients of benefits are required to report any changes in their income, and their benefit entitlements are adjusted accordingly. ln practice, people tend to report their wages after they receive them. This means that there may be a time lag from when wages are received to when the benefit is reduced, which may result in a benefit overpayment. Accurate information also means that benefit fraud can be detected and prevented. 3. In the last financial year, there were $217 million in overpayments, $22 million of which was fraud. In addition, Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development completed an anonymous sarnple of 4000 cases. The data sampling exercise showed that information that Inland Revenue holds would be of use to the Minishy of Social Development to better manage benefit entitlements, increase compliance (and reduce fraud), reduce overpayments (and their value) and assist in the recovery of Crown debt. For example, there were a number of people in the sample who had crurent overpayments with the Ministry of Social Development and were not making repayments, but were receiving income at a level that would require debt repa¡rrnent. 4, Inland Revenue currently shares information with the Ministry of Social Development via the information matching provísions in section S1(a) of the Tax Administration Act. These agreements are expensive and cumbersome to develop and operate. The data matches take a considerable time and the shared data may be out of date by the time the information is received. Also, the Ministry of Social Development is required to initiate the data match, which means that I¡land Revenue is unable to proactively share personal information to assist in the detection of fraud and deter fraudulent behaviours. 5. This regulatory impact statement addresses the problem of how hland Revenue may more quickly and proactively sha¡e information with the Ministry of Social Development in order to improve the accuracy of social assistance payments, and enable krland Revenue to proactively advise the Ministry of Social Development of suspected benefit fraud. 6. The information to be shared would be limited to beneficiaries and those with benefit debt known to Inland Revenue. It would consist of: income details; family details; personal details; parental income for those under the age of 24 applytng for a student allowance; and information krland Revenue has regarding suspected cases of benefit fraud. 2 OBJECTTVE 7. The objective is to provide faster and proactive information sharing from Inland Revenue to the Ministry of Social Development in order to: . improve the accuracy and timeliness of social assistance payments and adjustrnents, and therefore lower debt levels (as beneficiaries with over or under-payments would be identified earlier); and ¡ allow for the proactive sharing of information to increase the detection and prevention ofbenefit fraud. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 8. Inland Revenue has identified th¡ee possible options to meet the objectives: Optíon f.' Use the new information sharing framework in section SIBA of the Ta:r Administration Act. Optíon 2.' Use the information matching provisions in section Sl(a) of the Tax Administration Act. Optíon 3.' Wait for information sharing amendments to be made to the Privacy Act t993. Option 1: Use the new information sharing framework in section 81BA of the Tax AdministratÍon Act 9. Under Option l, an Order in Council under section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act would be made to enable Inland Revenue to proactively communicate information to the Ministry of Social Development. 10. The recently enacted Taxation (Tax Administration and Rernedial Matters) Act 2011 includes a new information sharing framework to facilitate Inland Revenue sharing information with another Government agency. Under the framework, sharing information requires legislative approval by an Order in Council, and is limited to information that the agency already has the legal authority to collect. 11. The advantages of using this new information sharing framework are the proactive nature of the sharing, flexibility, speed and accuracy. Inland Revenue is able to proactively provide information to the Ministry of Social Development without the need for the Ministy to first initiate a request for a data match. 12. Under this option, the impact on privacy is minimised since the Ministry of Social Development would only receive information that it is lawfi¡lly entitled to collect in its own right. Also, Inland Revenue would not collect additional information on behalf of the Ministry of Social Development. 13. Under the proposed arrangement, people providing information to hland Revenue would be notified that their information may be shared with the Ministry of Social Development. The Ministry of Social Development would also advise its clients that it can souroe tax information from Inland Revenue. 14. Option 1 is the preferred option, as officials consider that it provides the greatest opportunity for improvements to government efficiency and the integrity of the tax and benefit systems, while also offering safeguards to protect individuals' privacy rights. ) 3 Oþtion 2: Use the information matching provisions in section 81(4) of the Tax Admínistration Act 15. Under option 2, information matching would be used. Information matching, however, is ill-suited to proactive, timely information sharing between agencies. 16. This is because information matching is designed to identify errors :.ather than to identiff and correct inaccurate benefit payments in a timely way. 17. Further, because information matching requires the Ministy of Social Development to initiate the request, the Ministry must be first aware that the infonnation is required. In a number of cases (as the statistical match highlighted), it is the information that krland Revenue holds that provides the Ministry of Social Development with that initiat awareness. 18. Information matching is also slow and expensive, taking 12 to 18 months to implement. 19. As a result, option 2 does not provide the desired efficiency improvements and is not recommended. ) Option 3: Wait for the Information sharing amendments to the Privacy Act 20. The Privacy (Infonnation Sharing) Bill 2011 is an omnibus bill that amends the Privacy Act and the Tax Administration Act. This bill was introduced in August 2}ll,but at the time of writing has not had its first reading. 21. As option 3 relies on the bill receiving Royal assent, there is potential for considerable delay. 22. Officials therefore do not recommend this option. CONST\]LTATION 23. Public consultation on the concept of greater information sharing between govemment agencies, and specifically Inland Revenue sharing its data with a range of govenrment agencies, was previously undertaken as part of the legislative process for the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011. 24. A discussion document sought submissions on the proposal of Inland Revenue sharing data with the Ministry of Social Development, An online public forum was established for the public to discuss options and vote on proposals. The majority of submitters were in favour of the proposal. Submitters commented that it could increase efficiency and eliminate the need for individuals to provide complex and duplicated infonnation to multiple agencies. Business NZ commented that feedback from their members: "consistently tells us that they view various government departments as 'the Government', so any sharing of information for government purposes is often assumed to take place anyway." 25, A number of submitters saw merit in greater sharing between government agencies but also felt that, in order to protect individual privacy rights, sharing should occur only with the informed consent of the individuals involved. ln response to this, Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development will ensure that the proposed information sharing is well publicised and those applytng for benefits are made aware of the proposed information sharing. 26. Some submitters also wanted to ensure that only relevant information is shared. The requirements of the Order in Council (and related Memorandum of Understanding) under ì r 4 Option I would ensure that the information shared is relevant to the purpose of informatlon sharing. 27. Qualitative research has been undertaken by Victoria University of Wetlington on public attitudes to sharing personal information in the course of online public service provision.l In general, reseaich participants had abenign view of public \*""tã, information sharing intentions and practices. There is a high level of trust in the New Zealand Government sector, a¡rd a perception that the Government is working in the best interests of its residents. In general, participants were'þrivacy pragmatists", that is, they were prepared to provide personal information in return for enhanced public service provision, or other personal or collective benefits. However, they were not unconcerned about their privacy, and clearly pointed to the need for public service agencies to "play privacy by the rules". 28. Inland Revenue has also commissioned independent research2 to investigate the impact of a range of changes on the integrity of the tax system. The research focused on changes such as: developing an all-oÈgovemment approach and providing joined up services; changes to ICT (Information and Communications Technology) and how these might deliver govemment services; and increased information sharing as proposed by the Privacy Act amendments. This research concluded: 'oAs a general rule the public sees potential changes as a positive method of enhancing the way in which Inland Revenue operates in its role of collecting taxes and distributing benefits within the scope of its current role. It will provide a means of improving the status quo. In so doing this will improve the integrity of the tor system." 29. The independent research and public consultation indicate that there is little risk of the proposed Order in Council having a detimental influence on the integrity of the tax systøn or voluntary compliance rates. In general, submitters to the public consultation were in favour of the proposal, and noted that it could increase efficiency and eliminate the need for individuals to provide complex and duplicated information to multiple agencies. 30. Consultation within the public sector has also been undertaken. Officials have consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Ministry of Justice and Treasury. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner supported the aims of increasing the speed, accuracy and administrative efficiency of information exchanges from Inland Revenue to the Ministry of Social Development. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner is broadly comfortable with the proposed information sharing betwee,n Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development. The Of,ficer of the Privacy Commissioner agtees that the initiative would improve the efficiency of an important public service, and should produce significant public benefits. 31. During consultation, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner raised concems regarding limiting the amount of information shared so that only relevant information is shared. This will be resolved through the addition of schedules to that effect within the Memorandum of Understanding between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner raised two further operational issues which the agencies are working through - undertaking an assessment of privacy risks across the entire process, and developing a monitoring and reporting framework. The framework and the outcome of the risk assessment will also be incorporated into the Mernorandum of Understanding.

The Minisûry of Social Development has worked in partnership with Inland Revenue in developing the proposed information sharing and is fully supportive of the proposal. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 33. Officials recommend making an Order in Council to support information sharing under Option 1. V/e consider that this option would enable faster, more proactive information sharing from hland Revenue to the Ministry of Social Development, is consistent with the intent of the new section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act and is consistent with the Government's policy driver of better public services. IMPLEMENTATION 34. The preferred information sharing option (Option 1) does not require Inland Revenue to alter its current information collection practices (other than to inform taxpayers of its ability to share tax information with the Ministry of Social Development). As noted, Inland Revenue would not collect additional information on behalf of the other agency. Inland Revenue would also continue to ensure that the data collected is accurate and secure, and that it remains so once shared. Inland Revenue would establish processes to monitor and audit the use of its databy the Ministry of Social Development, and ensure that Inland Revenue's tax secrecy obligations are maintained. 35. Also, as noted, under the proposed a:rangement the Minisbry of Social Development would only receive information that it is lawfully entitled to collect in its own right. People providing information to Inland Revenue would be notified that their information may be shared with the Ministry of Social Development. The Minisbry of Social Development would also advise its clients that it can source tax information from Inland Revenue. 36. The Ministry of Social Development currently provides beneficiaries with l0 days' notice for most adverse actions that result from an authorised information match (with the exception of the Deparhnent of Corections prison roster match, where benefits are immediately suspended but reinstated if a challenge is made). The Ministry of Social Development will continue to ensrue that information received from hland Revenue is verified with the individual before any adverse action is taken unless verification would prejudice any investigation. This will continue to ensure that information acted on is accurate and certain. 37. It is proposed to take a phased approach to sharing information between the agencies. This will enable continued refinement of the information shared and ensure that the information continues to provide the Ministry of Social Development with the greatest value. At the outset, Inland Revenue will share information for which there is strong evidence of suspected fraud, and income details of beneficiaries who are receiving social assistance and some form of inc¡me. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 38. The new information sharing framework is subject to the review provision in the Tax Administuation Act. The proposed review would be carried out after the new framework has been in operation for five years, and would be tabled in the House of Representatives by the Minister of Revenue, after consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Such a review would allow for consideration of whether the objectives of the new framework have been achieved. Since the review would be made publig it should be transparent as to how the new fra:nework is being applied. l 6
Regulatory Impact Statement Changes to tax credits Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by lnland Revenue. The question in this statement is whether the following three tax credits should be repealed: 1. the income under $9,880 tax credit; 2. the tax credit for housekeeper and childcare expenditure; and 3. the tax credit for the active income of children. The limitation of this question to the repeal of these tax credits is due to: 1. the need for consistency with the general broad-based, low-rate approach that the Government has taken to taxation; 2. the aim of Inland Revenue to improve the efficiency of returns filing; and 3. time constraints (which also meant that this Regulatory Impact Statement was not prepared and tabled with the original Cabinet paper. As such the purpose of this RIS is not to inform Cabinet decision making, but to inform consideration of the budget tax bill). The changes recoÍrmended will allow for the redirection of Government spending into higher valued areas; however, it is not the purpose of this statement to assess where this spending will be redirected to. Generally speaking, the proposed option should not impose any new compliance costs on businesses. However, businesses that employ only school children on very low wages (below 52,340 p.a.) may have to begin withholding PAYE from these employees from 1 April 2013. We expect that very few employers would be in this situation, but due to the inability to consult we have not been able to quantifu this. Also, Inland Revenue data does not allow us to estimate the number of affected employers. úr any case, we expect this change will not represent a significant increase in compliance costs given the other laws that employers must already comply with and the ability of employers to integrate collection of PAYE across all their employees. We also believe that software developers who provide software to employers that automate PAYE processes will have sufficient time to respond to the changes. This is because no changes to payroll systems would be required until 1 April 2013. We also expect that any changes required would be relatively minor. Reforming these tax credits means that some people who currently receive tax refunds will no longer do so. The repeal of the tax credits could also indirectly affect the business of Personal Tax Summary Intermediaries since the tax credits are a major driver of tax refunds, so their repeal should reduce the number of taxpayers who have overpaid tax. Due to the need for Budget secrecy and the short timeframes involved, there was no ability to consult in the usual manner with affected parties. The Treasury and Inland Revenue were the only agencies involved in developing the proposals and carrying out the analysis. 1 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. There are a number of tax credits that sit alongside the core tax system. Three of these tax credits - the income under $9,880 tax credit, the tax credit for housekeeper and childcare expenditure, and the tax credit for the active income of children - were introduced a number of decades ago in response to issues raised at the time. They are considered to be outdated; they are fiscally expensive yet are poorly targeted and do not serve any strong policy objective. Income under 89,880 tax credít 2. The income under $9,880 tax credit provides a credit of $1 1 .76 for a person with an annual income below g6,241for every week they work more than20 hours. The weekly amount of the credit is reduced by $0.0032 for every dollar over $6,240 they earn, meaning it will be fully abated at an income of $9,880. The credit is not available when a household is eligible for'Working for Families tax credits. The credit is received by approximately 49,000 people, averaging $168. It was introduced as part of a 1986 tax reform, which included the introduction of GST and an early version of Working for Families. 3. The tax credit was designed to compensate a small goup of workers who would otherwise have been worse off in the 1986 tax reform package - those without children working full- time and on low incomes. Most workers gained more from the tax credits than they lost in spending power due to the introduction of GST. Those with children gained from the new family tax credit system. However, there was a small goup of workers that would have been worse off. It was to compensate this group of workers that the income under $9,880 tax credit was introduced. 4. The tax credit was designed as a temporary measure to allow time for this group of workers to adjust to the new tax settings (for example by increasing their hours worked or seeking a better paying job). Even ignoring that the credit was intended to be temporary, none of this original group now qualify for the credit. It is now, in practice, only available to those without children and who work in low paying jobs fulltime (i.e. working more than 20 hours a week) for part of a year, the self-employed with low incomes or who can offset their income with business losses. There is no clear rationale why this specific set of people (such as those who work fulltime for a small part of a year) should pay less tax than others with the same income but who earn it in a different way (such as someone who works part-time for the whole year, who would not be eligible for the credit). Ifousekeeper and childcare tøx credít 5. The housekeeper and childcare tax credit, in general terms, is available to: . a working couple to offset childcare costs that arise because of employment; or, . a family where a family member has a disability, to offset either childcare or housekeeping costs. 6. Thecreditcovers33percentofexpenditureuptoamaximumof$310peryear. People are required to send in invoices to prove their expenditure, which involves compliance and administrative costs. The credit is received by approximately 55,300 households and is worth on average 5263. 5 7 . The credit seems to have little justification from a policy perspective. It could be argued that for working couples with children, the credit helps offset the cost of childcare. Holever, there are no deductions or tax credits available for other personal costs of employnent. This reflects New Zealand's broad-based, low-rate approach to taxation. The housekeeper and childcare tax credit is inconsistent with this approach. The primary way that the Government funds childcare costs has also changed over time, reducing the importance of this credit. For example, the Government now provides 20 hours free childcare for children over 3 by funding early childhood education providers directly. In total, the Government spends approximately $1.4 billion dollars on early childhood education. 8. The credit is poorly targeted. According to a2006 taxpayer survey, only 27 percent of working households qualiff for the credit. In addition, the credit does not abate with income and is generally only available to those in work. It is predominantly paid to working and reasonably well-off households. The bottom 30 percent of households make up only around 1 1 percent of the claimants of the credit. It also raises questions of fairness. The credit is only available if both partners in a couple are working; it is not available if one partner is not working. However, sole parents can claim the credit without a work requirement. 9. A small number of the recipients of this credit are families of the disabled, for whom the credit is provided to assist with additional costs (such as housekeeping). As a result of this change, these families will receive smaller (or possibly no) tax refunds. The Government still provides assistance to such families through direct measures, such as Home and Community support provided by the Ministry of Health. For example, as part of Budget 2}ll,the Govemment increased funding to disability support services by $130 million over four years to support people to live independently in the community. Total Government funding for national disability support services, as provided by the Ministry of Health, was $1.035 billion in the 20lll12 year. 10. The Ministry of Social Development also provides financial assistance to people with disabilities such as the Disability Allowance and the Child Disability Allowance. Tax creditfor the active income of chíldren 11. The tax credit for the active income of children allows a childl to earn up to $2,340 of "active" income without being liable to tax. If a child earns more than this, they are entitled to a tax credit of $245.70. The credit is received by approximately 68,600 children, averaging 9240. The tax credit does not apply to income from interest or dividends, meaning a child must pay tax on the first dollar of income from these sources. 12. The children's active income tax credit was introduced in 1978 to partly offset the repeal of another tax credit that effectively provided a tax-free income band income band for all taxpayers. Without the children's active income tax credit, businesses that employed only school children working part time would be required to begin deducting PAYE. At the time, this was a significant compliance cost. In addition, without the credit, school children engaged in part-time domestic work would have been required to pay their own tax to lnland Revenue. 13. Since the credit's introduction, the environment has changed, meaning the credit now serves its original pu{pose rarely. rWith the advent of electronic payroll systems, we expect I The credit is available to a child who is attending secondary or primary school. 4 that most employers apply their normal payroll processes, including deducting PAYE, to all their employees. The credit is now mostly claimed via a child filing a tax return at the end of the year. This means the credit, originally designed to decrease compliance costs, no longer achieves this goal as it drives people to file who otherwise would not need to. Questíon 14. The question in this statement is whether these three tax credits - the income under $9,880 tax credit, the tax credit for housekeeper and childcare expenditure, and the tax credit for the active income of children - should be repealed. 15. The limitation of this question to whether the credits should be repealed is based on the assumption that any options need to be consistent with the general broad-based, low-rate approach that the Government has taken to taxation, and the aim of Inland Revenue to improve the efficiency of returns filing. Reforming the credits, such as widening their scope or tightening the criteria would not change the credits' apparent inconsistency with this broad-based approach. 16. Time was also a constraining factor on the question. There was a need for the analysis to be delivered in time for Budget 2012, which limited the breadth of question that could be asked. OBJECTTVES 17. The key objectives are: a to deliver fiscal savings from low-value programmes - such as prograÍìmes that provide untargeted assistance - allowing the Government to redirect its spending into higher value areas; reduce the need for taxpayers to interact with Inland Revenue; and ensure that the changes are able to be implemented as part of Budget 2012. o REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 18. There were three broad stages of analysis in which options arose. The first was the shape of the reforms themselves - if the status quo should be retained, the credits repealed, or if they should be replaced by something else. The second was the timing of the reforms. The third was what transitional rules should be developed (necessitated by the decision made on reform timing). Shape of the reþrms Income under 89,880 tax credit and the tax credítþr housekeeper and childcare expenses 19. For the income under $9,880 tax credit and the tax credit for housekeeper and childcare expenses, the options considered were repealing the credits or keeping the status quo. 20. Our preferred option is that these credits be repealed because, as described above, they are outdated. The credits were designed to serve a specific purpose which, due to changing 5 Govemment policies and economic conditions, they no longer serve. The credits are also inconsistent with the broad-based, low-rate framework. Their repeal would broaden the tax base and so deliver full-year fiscal savings of $21 million. Further, the credits are a driver of peak-period contacts with Inland Revenue. Repealing the credits removes the need for these contacts, freeing up resources for more highly valued services. The repeal of these credits would be able to be implemented as part of Budget 2012. Tax creditþr the active income of children 21. For the tax credit for the active income of children, a wider range of options were identified. While not directly required to answer the question asked in this statement, these other options are consistent with a broad-based, low rate approach and so could usefully be considered. These other options would also be able to be implemented in time for inclusion in Budget 2012. 22.The options that were identified were: replace the tax credit with a limited tax exemption with the same eligibility criteria, ensuring that children will not need to file a return if they have small amounts of income not taxed at source, but would be fully taxed on income that has tax withheld (preferued); repeal the tax credit with no replacement; or retain the tax credit, and expand the types of income which are considered passive. 23. Our preferred option is to replace the tax credit with a limited tax exemption as it accords with its original policy intent. The option means that children are not able to file to claim a refund of tax that has been correctly withheld, reducing compliance and administration costs. At the same time, the replacement tax exemption means a child is able to earn small amounts of income where there is no withholding obligation (for example, income from mowing their neighbours' lawns), without being required to pay tax on that income, and thus keeping them out of the tax system. 24.The estimated $14 million per year savings come from children who derive income that has a withholding obligation (such as salary and wages) or from children who earn more than 92,340 in income where this is no withholding obligation. The current tax credit generally applies to such income but the new exemption will not. 25. The second option, repealing the credit with no replacement, would mean large numbers of children earning small amounts of income would be pulled into the tax system. This would increase both administration and compliance costs without creating any real benefit. 26. Retaining the tax credit and expanding the types of income that are considered passive is also not preferred. For example, beneficiary income from a trust or income from a welfare benefit could be added to the definition of passive income. Currently the Government provides roughly $14 million per year in tax refunds that have been correctly withheld. There is no strong rationale for this. While restricting the types of income to which the tax credit would apply would help, it does not address the problem directly. As with the other tax credits, it is also a driver of peak period contacts. a a o 6 Timing of reforms 27.Two possible timings were identified for these reforms: they could apply from the 2012- 13 tax year or from the 2013-14 tax year. 28. This is a finely balanced decision and we do not have a preferred option. Obviousl¡ the earlier application date would bring forward the measure and, as a consequence, the fiscal savings of the reforms by one year. This is the key advantage of a 2012-13 application. The reasonably quick application is possible because, by and large, the credits are claimed at year- end, rather than during the year. 29. However, a complication is that it is possible for the income under $9,880 tax credit and the credit for the active income of children to be claimed during the year through the PAYE system. The option requires developing transitional rules and increases the possibility that people may face a tax bill at the end of the year if they do f,rle. These transitional rules will ensure that any transitional compliance costs for businesses are small. 30. A 2013-14 application would not require any transitional rules, as the reforms would have been fully enacted before the beginning of that year. However, it would delay the measure and the consequent fiscal savings by one year. 31. Ministers decided upon the earlier application for these reforms, meaning that the reforms would apply from the 2012-13 taxyear. Transitional rules 32. As described above, a2012-13 application requires transitional rules to guide the treatment of the relatively small number of people claiming tax credits through the PAYE system during the2012-13 tax year. For the active income of children tax credit, the only real transitional rule option was: for employers: allow the employers to continue to take account of the tax credit in determining whether to withhold PAYE from a child employee, up until I April 2013; and a o for child employees: if an employer has been taking the credit into account, not require the child to file a tax retum (and therefore not be required to pay any resulting top-up tax) !f they would not have otherwise been required to file. 33. The lack of other options is due to the mechanism of claiming this credit through the PAYE system. In practice, if an employer expects a child employee to earn less than 52,340, they are able to take account of the credit by not withholding any PAYE. The employer also does not inform Inland Revenue about the child's pay. Due to this, lnland Revenue has no abilityto identiff children whose employers have been taking into account the credit during the year. 34. This approach means that, while such children will generally not be required to file, if they do happen to file they may face an end-of-year tax bill. Nevertheless, this will mean that the child will pay the same amount of tax in total as a child whose employer did not take into account the tax credit during the year. This seems appropriate. 7 35. For the income under $9,880 credit, similar transitional rules for employees and employers would also apply. Employers could continue to take account of the credit when deducting PAYE from their employees, and employees who have been claiming the credit during the year would not be required to file a tax retum if they otherwise would not have been required to file. 36. In addition to these measures, Inland Revenue is able to identifu taxpayers that claim this credit through the PAYE system. This provides some additional options for the treatment of employees. It allows: for Inland Revenue to write a letter to those claiming the credit through the PAYE system, explaining the possible impact of continuing to claim the credit and then filing a tax retum (preferred); or a a have a legislative rule providing that such employees do not lose the benefit of the credit if they file a retum. 37. V/e prefer the first of these options, which is having Inland Revenue write to affected employees explaining the impact of filing. This option means that taxpayers on the same levels of income who file will pay the same amount of tax in total, regardless of whether they claimed the credit during the year or not. It is also consistent with the treatment of those claiming the tax credit through the PAYE system for the active income of children. CONST\]LTATION 38. Due to the need for Budget secrecy and the short time frames involved, there was no opportunity to consult in the usual manner. The Treasury and Inland Revenue were the only agencies involved in developing the proposals and carrying out the analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RE,COMMENDATIONS 39. The recommended option is to: . repeal the income under $9,880 tax credit and the tax credit for housekeeper and childcare expenses; . replace the tax credit for the active income of children with a limited tax exemption; o have these reforms apply for the 2012-13 and later tax years; and . have transitional rules that: o for employers, means they can continue to take account of the tax credits when determining the PAYE deductions for their employees until I April 2073; and o for employees who are claiming the tax credits through the PAYE system, not be required to file a tax return (and pay resulting top-up tax) if they would not have otherwise been required to file. 40. This option is base broadening and delivers substantial fiscal savings from low-value programmes. It also reduces the need for taxpayers to interact with Inland Revenue. The option is able to be implemented as part of Budget 2012. 8 Impacts Government Credit Credit recipients FìscalAdmínístratíve Employers Net Impact Income under $9,880 Minor transitional costs Ilousekeeper and childcare ($21m) $21m None Childrens' active income ($1am) $14m ($l.am) ffansition cost Unquantified but small ongoing savings. Minor transitional costs The ongoing efficiency gains outweigh the small transitional cost for some employers. 41. We also note that changes will result in fewer people being eligible for a tax refund, which may have an indirect impact on Personal Tax Summary Intermediaries (companies that calculate if a person has a tax refund owing and, if so, claim it on their behalf). IMPLEMENTATION 42. The necessary legislative changes will be included in Budget night legislation. 43. Implementing this option requires minor systems changes for Inland Revenue. Implementation risks are being minimised by including the changes in Budget night legislation, which ensures the law is settled before the systems changes begin. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 44. The post-implementation phase of the generic tax policy process will help to identiff and address any remedial issues post-Budget. The Income Tax Act 2007 is also subject to regular review by officials. 9
Regulatory Impact Statement Specified livestock elections Agency I)isclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this RIS is how to prevent the tax rules for specified livestock being used in a way that allows farmers to exit from.the herd scheme for a tax advantage. As a measure to protect the tax base, options therefore remove an unintended tax subsidy. Due to time constraints, this RIS was not prepared and attached to the original Cabinet paper. As such, the purpose of this RIS is to inform consideration of the resultant tax legislation (not to inform Cabinet decision making). Extensive consultation has been undertaken in two rounds in late 2011. The first round involved publicly releasing an officials' issues paper. The second round of consultation involved an Írland Revenue official presenting to over 800 accountants at 19 sites across New Zealand, and engaging in discussions on a range of primary sector issues. This included significant discussion on the matters raised in the officials' issues paper. In preparing this Statement there are two assumptions: 1. farmers decide to switch between specified livestock valuation methods predominantly for tax-driven reasons; and 2. the only situation where a change from the herd scheme method is justified is when farmers are changing their operations to a fattening regime. Other than those stated above, there are no other key gaps, assumptions, dependencies, significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the analysis. The proposed option does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest, or override coûìmon law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 78May2012 I STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The term "specified livestock" refers to dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, deer, goats and pigs. Under the Income Tax Act 2007 there are two main methods that farmers use to value specified livestock. These methods are the herd scheme, and national standard cost. Other (very uncoÍrmon) methods are cost price, replacement price and market value. These other methods are not focussed on in this Statement. 2. The herd scheme method of valuation recognises that specified livestock can have characteristics of capital assets (for example, the ability to produce milk and progeny) and, for tax purposes, should be treated as a capital asset. The herd scheme uses annually announced national avera5e market values to value livestock. The effect of using this method is that gains and losses in value are treated as being of a capital nature for tax purposes and are therefore outside the tax base. 3. The national standard cost method treats specified livestock as trading stock that is held on revenue account. This method uses national average costs (except for livestock purchases, where actual costs are used) rather than farm-specific costs. The effect of using the national standard cost method is that gains and losses in value are treated as being of a revenue nature for tax purposes. 4. Currently, farmers are able to move between these two valuation methods. If farmers choose to enter the herd scherne method they can effectively enter it immediately. If they choose to exit the herd scheme method, they can effectively give as little as one day's notice.l For example, if a farmer who is in the herd scheme files a tax return for the 2006-07 year on 31 March 2008, they can elect to exit the herd scheme for the 2008-09 income year, which for farmers using a 31 March balance date, commences on 1 April 2008. The original policy intent for allowing farmers to switch between these methods was to recognise that when there is a change in the type of farming operation, it may be appropriate to change the valuation method. 5. However, the ability to switch methods effectively allows farmers to time their elections in and out of the herd scheme to maximise the tax-free herd scheme gains and the tax- deductible result of exiting from the herd scheme. 6. The tax-driven behaviour of some farmers is particularly evident when looking at the 2008 peak in dairy cattle prices. From Inland Revenue data, it appears that a number of famers took advantage of the tax result that can be obtained when herd values are high by exiting the herd scheme and using the national standard cost method. For dairy farmers with 300 cows, plus replacements, who exited the herd scheme at the 2008 peak in herd values, the tax deductible write down per farm was in the order of $500,000. 7. If the status quo is retained, some farmers may continue to switch between the two valuation methods to minimise their tax. Officials are aware of a number of farmers who have switched between the methods for no other reason than to secure a tax advantage and there is anecdotal evidence that there were a number of farmers intending to elect out of the herd scheme for their 2012-13 income year. This is not in line with the original policy intent I The legislative requirement is that taxpayers must give notice with the tax retum for an income year that is at least two years before the income year in which the election is fint to apply. 2 of the specified livestock valuation rules. Retaining the status quo in respect of elections being made to leave the herd scheme for the 2012-13 income year could result in an estimated decrease in baselines of $275 million over the next six years. 8. The current rules are unfair to the majority of farmers who apply the specified livestock election rules as intended. Furthermore, the current rules are unfair to other business taxpayers who cannot switch between treating assets as being on Íevenue account in one year and on capital account in another year. OBJECTIVE 9. The objective is to prevent the tax rules for specified livestock being used in a way that allows farmers to exit from the herd scheme for a tax advantage. If this objective is met, it would ensure that the tax rules around valuation methods for specified livestock are fair for all farmers and taxpayers. 10. If the objective is met it will also protect the tax base by preventing a future loss in revenue. This fiscal reason is why the core change is being made as part of the Budget 2012 package. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 11. There are two options that wholly or partly achieve the objective outlined above. These two options were consulted on in 2011. 12. The first option is the preferred option and involves amending the tax rules so that elections to use the herd scheme method are irrevocable. This option would mean that farmers using other valuation methods are able to elect into the herd scheme method, but once they have elected into it, they are unable to change to another valuation method. 13. As part of option one, an exception is necessary to allow farmers to move out of the herd scheme method if they are fundamentally changing their farming operation to a fattening operation. This exception aligns with the original policy intent which recognises that it may be appropriate to change valuation methods where there is a change in the tlpe of farming operation. From the consultation carried out, it appears that a change to a fattening operation is the only exception that the law should allow for. 14. The second option is to lengthen the notice period required for electing out of the herd scheme method. As noted above, the current notice period is very short and farmers can make very informed elections. If the notice period is sufficiently lengthened, it would significantly minimise elections to exit the herd scheme being used for a tax advantage. This is because the outcome of choosing to exit the herd scheme would be so unpredictable as to be a gamble and the election should not be made unless there is a genuine reason for it. 15. Whether option one or two is chosen, a supporting protection measure and exception are necessary to ensure the integrity of the new rules. These are: (a) Associated person buttress: Taxpayers who acquire specified livestock from an associated taxpayer who was using the herd scheme are required to use the herd scheme and the vendor's base herd scheme numbers, and 5 (b) Exception to associated person buttress: The associated person buttress does not apply when there is a complete change in the ownership of the specified livestock from one generation to the next. 16. A summary of the two options is contained in the table below: 17. The economic, fiscal and compliance impacts of the options are outlined in the table above. Neither of the two options has social, environmental or cultural impacts. 18. The disadvantage of option one is that there is only one statutory exception. However, after considering submissions, officials are not aware of any other reasonable arguments for extending this exception. Further, the tax rules already allow an alternative valuation option method to be used by farmers that reduces concems in situations which involve decreasing breeding livestock and increasing other livestock. The alternative valuation option method effectively allows farmers to value extra livestock on a class by class basis2 at cost. 19. A disadvantage of option two (as compared to option one) is that it does not entirely remove the fiscal risk of switching between methods. OptionAdvantagesDisadvantages One: Election to use the herd scheme method be irrevocable \* Exception for changes to a fattening operation + Associated person buttress and exception þreferred option) Meets the objective. May result in efficiency gains as farmers will not have an incentive to restructure their business predominantly for tax reasons. This also makes compliance easier for farmers as it is compulsory. That is, the removal of the ability to move between methods reduces compliance costs because it removes a choice that at least some accountants suggest should be reviewed each year. Protects the tax base by not allowing a fiscal loss in future years. Is fair as it best aligns the tax treatment for farmers with other business owners (who do not get similar tax advantages). The exception for changes to a fattening operation is narrow There will be no provision for changes to other operations even it from a policy perspective, there should be (although we are unaware of any other circumstances where an election to exit would be appropriate). Two: Lengthen the election period for electing out of the herd scheme method + Associated person buttress and exception Partially meets the objective as it can substantially reduce the ease with which farmers can obtain tax advantages. At least partially protects the tax base as it reduces the likelihood that the rules will be used to obtain a tax advantage. Fairer than the status quo. Only partially meets the objective. Farmers may still be able to obtain tax advantages by switching between methods. Compared to option one this results in a fiscal risk. Would be more diffrcult to back- date due to administrative and compliance implications. 2 Fo. e\*ample, beefcows a¡e a different class to steeß. 4 CONSULTATION 20. Extensive consultation has been undertaken in two tranches. An officials' issues paper was released for formal consultation in August 2011. The paper outlined the issues around specified livestock valuation elections and two options were put forward (being options one and two in this Statement). Officials suggested that their preferred option was option one, along with the associated person buttress. Feedback was sought on the preferred suggestion and alternatives (the result of this feedback is set out below). 21. Shortly after the officials' issues paper was released a second round of consultation was carried out from late August to early October 2017. This involved an Lrland Revenue official presenting on the proposed livestock changes (outlined in the officials' issues paper) to over 800 accountants at 19 centres across New Zealand. Each livestock presentation was approximately 90 minutes in length and included significant discussion with the attendees on a raruge of issues raised in the issues paper. All attendees were invited to provide written submissions on the issues paper. 22. During the verbal discussions at the presentations, the vast majority of attendees agreed that the status quo was inappropriate as it provided lax advantages (only two disagreed). The minority (two attendees) provided verbal feedback separately that the status quo should be retained because dairy farmers were essential to the New Zealand economy so the unintended subsidy was appropriate. 23. While the large majority of attendees agreed that the status quo was inappropriate, the preference over which option to recommend was not clear-cut. Approximately half of the attendees considered option one to be the best option, while the other half favoured option two. 24. During the consultation the proposed exception to option one (for changes to a fattening regime) and the exception to the associated person buttress (for inter-generational ownership transfers) were raised. Officials considered there was merit in these two exceptions and have therefore included them in the approach. 25. The closing date for submissions to the officials' issues paper was informally extended to 31 October 2011, to ensure that those attendees at the presentations had a chance to provide a written submission. Overall, officials received 12 written submissions to the officials' issues paper. Two of these were from the pre-eminent industry organisations (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and Federated Farmers), and the rest were from provincial accountants. 26. None of the written submissions received disagreed with the need for a change to the specified livestock election rules. However, a large majority of written submissions considered option two to be the best option, although some of these did have alternatives that proposed option one or amendments to option one. 27. All of the major points that were raised in consultation discussions were also raised in the written submissions. All feedback was taken into account and, as a result, the two exceptions (the proposed exception to option one for changes to a fattening regime and the exception to the associated person buttress for inter-generational ownership transfers) were developed. 28. The Treasury was also consulted and agrees with the preferred solution. 5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 29. Option one is the preferred option because, when implemented along with the supporting rules outlined above, it meets the objective. The disadvantages that are identified for this option can be sufficiently addressed. 30. Option two is not recommended because it does not sufficiently achieve the objective. IMPLEMENTATION 31. Two sets of legislative changes are needed to implement the preferred option (option one): 1. Legislative change to the Income Tax Act 2007 so that an election into the herd scheme method is made irrevocable. It is proposed that this change be made as part of the Budget 2012legislation, and that it apply from 18 August 2011 (being the date that the ofhcials' issues paper was publicly released). 2. Three supporting legislative changes are required to the Income Tax Act 2007. These supporting legislative changes are the exception for changes to a fattening operation, a buttress for transfers to associated persons, and an exception to the associated person buttress for inter-generational transfers. It is proposed that these changes be made as part of the tax bill that is expected to be introduced in mid-20l2, and that they apply from 28 March 2012 (being the date that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue announced the Government's intention to tighten the specified livestock tax rules). Given that these supporting legislative changes are proposed to be in a mid- 2012 tax bill, there will still be an opportunity for submissions to be made on the proposed changes during the select committee stage of the bill. 32. If option one (the preferred option) is adopted, the new rules would be administered by Inland Revenue through existing channels and there would be no other significant administrative issues. 33. Due to the backdated application date, farmers who have elected out of the herd scheme method between 18 August 20ll and the night that the Budget legislation is passed, would have their elections cancelled. This is required to prevent a potential $46 million decrease to the baselines for each year in the forecast period should the status quo be allowed to continue. 34. If option two is adopted, there may be significant administrative and compliance implications. Those farmers who had elected out of the herd scheme between 18 August 2011 and the date of enactment of the new rules and who had complied with the current notice requirements to cancel their election, would need to be given an opportunity to cancel their election because of the increased uncertainty that a longer period would cause. Depending on the number of farmers in this category, the administrative and compliance implications of this could be signif,rcant. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 35. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes under the Income Tax Act 2007 following the changes. This is because the reforms are being carried out for reasons of fairness and for protection of the tax base. The supporting legislative 6 changes (that is, the exception for changes to a fattening operation, a buttress for transfers to associated persons, and an excqltion to the associated person buttress for inter-generational transfers) are intended to be introduced as part of the rrud-2012 tax bill and, as per the norrrral process, there would still be an opportunity for submissions to be made on the proposed changes during the select committee stage of the bill. 36. If any detailed concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process.
Regulatory Impact Statement Primary Sector Businesses: Horticultural removal costs and non-depreciable properfy under the Income Tax Act2007 Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question in this Statement is whether the amortisation rules for primary sector businesses in the Income Tax Act 2007 should be aligned more closely with the general depreciation rules. Officials have discussed these minor issues with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and a selection of accountants (who are also kiwifruit growers) and they are accepting of the preferred options. The Treasury agrees with our analysis. No significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties have been identified in the analysis. The proposed change will not impose any significant compliance costs on taxpayers (minor compliance costs may be incurred). The proposed change does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles. Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 7 I|l4ay 2072 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION l. The kiwifruit Psa (Pseudomonas syringae pv actinídiae) virus has had a significant impact on New Zealand's gold kiwifruit industry, and as a consequerrce) a number of kiwifruit gold orchards have been or will be destroyed. The effect of the virus has highlighted three minor technical issues relating to the tax treatment of horticultural related removal costs, and subsidies giving rise to amortisable assets. Issue I: Removal costs of horticultural plants 2. The Income Tax Act 2007 allows primary sector businesses (farming, horticulture, forestry and aquaculture) to amortise the costs of certain capital expenditure that are not expressly depreciable. This is similar to taxpayers' entitlement to claim depreciation on fixed assets. Specifically, and subject to certain criteria, when an orchardist removes a tree or vine, the orchardist generally receives a deduction for the net tax book carrying value of the tree or vine. 3. However, the extra cost of removing the vines (for example, the cost of hiring a contractor to tear out the vines) is capital in nature and the Income Tax Act 2007 does not explicitly provide a deduction for such costs. In contrast, when a taxpayer with a capital asset (for example, an item of physical plant or machinery) writes that item off, the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for the tax book carrying value, and a deduction for the costs of physically removing the item. 4. In contradiction to the legislation, the general practice has been for taxpayers to claim a deduction for the costs of removing vines and plants. ln the past, this has not been a significant integrity issue given the ad hoc and small amounts involved. However, the scale of the claims in respect of Psa virus has highlighted the lack of legislative provision for the deduction under subpart DO of the Income Tax Act 2007. Issue 2: Removal costs of orchard infrastructure 5. The Psa virus has also highlighted an anomaly in the tax treatment of infrastructure damaged by natural events. For example, if a natural event such as a flood, damaged an orchard's infrastructure, the orchardist would be allowed a deduction for the tax book carrying value of the infrastructure. 6. On the other hand, if an orchardist's infrastructure (for example trellising and wire) is rendered useless due to the Psa virus and they wish to change the crops that they grow, the cost of removing the infrastructure and the tax book carrying value of the infrastructure once it is removed, is considered to be a capital expenditure or loss, and therefore non-deductible. 7. Therefore similar to issue 1, there is no explicit permission under subpart DO of the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow for a deduction for these costs, despite the general practice for taxpayers to claim a deduction in these circumstances. Issue 3: Capital contributíon rules and amortisable assets 8. If a person receives a subsidy (or similar payment) as compensation and the subsidy is used to acquire depreciable property, the receipt is dealt with under the "capital contribution rulss" in the Income Tax Act 2007. The capital contribution rules prevent a person claiming deductions for expenditure for which they have not borne the cost. 2 9. Kiwifruit orchardists affected by the Psa virus may receive non-governmental financial assistance and some of these payments may be used to subsidise the cost of replanting. However, the capital contribution rules do not apply to these receipts. This is because the capital cost of replanting does not result in depreciable property, but rather "amortisable assets". This is not consistent with the policy intent of the capital contribution rules, as the orchardist will be able to claim a full deduction for the expenditure, even though a portion of it was subsidised by another party. Questíon 10. The question in this Statement is whether the amortisation rules for primary sector businesses in the Income Tax Act 2007 should be aligned more closely with the general depreciation rules in order to address the above issues. OBJECTIVE 11. The objective of the proposals in this Statement is to ensure that there is appropriate tax treatment for primary sector business deductions. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS I2.The status quo is not satisfactory because it does not align with the policy intent for the current deductions and capital contribution rules, and is prejudicial against the primary sector businesses due to the specific tax rules for this sector. 13. This means the provisions relating to each issue need to be changed and how these issues may be remedied is addressed separately below. Each of these changes are very minor technical remedies. Option to address issue l: Removal costs of horticultural plants I4.The lack of deduction (status quo) is clearly unintended. The solution officials have identified is to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to explicitly provide a deduction for the cost of removing horticultural plants. 15. This option can be administered within the existing tax system, and would be similar to the tax treatment of costs to remove a capital asset that has been written off therefore resulting in a more equitable tax treatment for the deduction rules for primary sector businesses. 16. The impact of this option on taxpayers will be negligible, as the legislation is being aligned with the current practice and would provide certainty to horticultural plant growers, and their agents. 17. The fiscal cost for this option is very minor. The costs do not factor in any additional tree or vine removal cost deductions that may be taken by other members of the (non-kiwifruit) horticultural industry. However, as noted above the current practice is for taxpayers to claim these deductions, therefore these fiscal costs are likely to be modest, if they exist at all. 18. Officials have not identified any further options to address this issue, as there are no other practical alternatives to deliver the appropriate outcome. Option to address issue 2: Removal costs of orchard infrastructure 19. At present the Income Tax Act 2007 only provides a deduction if the infrastructure has been directly damaged by a physical event out of the taxpayer's control. This is too restrictive. J Although the orchard infrastructure was not directly destroyed or damaged by the virus, it has in some cases nevertheless been rendered useless and effectively written off. Therefore the effect is the same as what is currently provided for under the Income Tax Act 2007, that is, the infrastructure cannot serve the purpose for which it was originally intended and has to be removed. 20. The Psa virus situation was not considered when the write off provisions in subpart DO of the Income Tax Act 2007 were initially proposed. However as the effect is the same as the current write off rules, officials have recommended that the Income Tax Act 2007 be amended to cover these circumstances. This solution would be more in line with the reality primary sector businesses face in an event outside of their control. 21. The fiscal cost and impact for this solution is negligible. The impact on compliance costs for taxpayers will also be minor, as the legislation is being aligned with the current practice. The proposed amendments will provide gteater certainty of the tax treatment of these costs for kiwifruit growers, taxpayers and their agents in general. 22. Simllar to issue 1, officials have not identified any fuither options to address this issue, as there are no other practical altematives to deliver the appropriate outcome. Option to address issue 3: Capital contribution rules and non-depreciable amortisable assets 23. When the capital contribution rules were implemented, officials had not considered capturing contributions towards assets that were amortisable under subpart DO. However, as the Psa virus has highlighted, if the Lrcome Tax Act 2007 allows for a deduction for expenditure that gives rise to an amortisable asset, the result is the same i.e. effectively a tax subsidy. 24.The only option therefore is to amend the Income Tax Act2007 to explicitly provide that the capital contribution rules apply where the relevant asset is amortisable, as well as where it is depreciable, so that taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for costs they have not in fact incurred. 25. Similar to when the capital contribution rules were proposed, the impact of the preferred option will most likely result in a marginal increase in taxpayer's compliance costs. However as the capital contribution rules have only been recently implemented (applies to capital contributions after May 2010) this new increase should be slightly lower than what was expected in 2010. 26. Officials did not identify any other options to address thrs rssue. CONSULTATION 27. Officials have had two meetings with affected kiwifruit growers and their accountants, various accountants who are also kiwifruit growers, as well as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. A tax technical article Kiwifruit PSAv issues and fficts on growers - inþrmationþr agents was published on 28 February 2012 and outlined the issues raised from these discussions and explained in this Statement. 28. All those who were consulted supported the proposed solution relating to the deductibility of removal costs and the retrospective application date. This solution was considered taxpayer friendly, and provided certainty for the tax treatment of this capital expenditure, by aligning the legislation with how these groups were culrently treating these costs. 4 29. Regarding the application of the capital contribution rules, the groups were accepting of the changes, and understood the need to align the treatment of amortisable assets with depreciable property. 30. Officials have also consulted with the Treasury which agrees with our recommendations The Ministry for Primary Industries has also been made aware of the proposals. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 31. The recommended option is to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 to: o provide a deduction for the removal cost of horticulture plants; o provide a deduction for the removal cost of horticulture infrastructure, or tax book canying value of the infrastructure, if the land is used for other purposes due to an event outside of the control of the taxpayer; and o provide that the capital contribution rules apply to receipts which give rise to non- depreciable property that is amortisable under subpart DO of the Income Tax Act 2007. IMPLEMENTATION 32. The necessary legislative change would be included in the tax bill scheduled to be introduced in July 2012, with a retrospective application date from I April2010. 33. Any amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 would have to be backdated to the start of the 2010-11taxyear; the year in which the majority of the Psa virus-related deductions are being claimed. Officials will ensure that kiwifruit growers are awate of any changes when preparing their tax returns. 34. No implementation risks have been identified. Implementation can be managed within existing systems. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIE\\il 35. There are no plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes under the Income Tax Act 2007 following this amendment. This is because the reforms align the legislation with what is generally undertaken in the ordinary course of business by taxpayers. If any specific concems are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Also, the Income Tax Act 2007 is subject to regular review by officia1s. 5
Regulatory Impact Statement Mismatch in tax treatment of certain offshore assets and foreign currency hedges Agency I)isclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question in this statement is whether the tax rules that apply to certain foreign cuffency hedges should be changed so that Ihey are effective in removing the impact of foreign crurency fluctuations both before and after tax. There are no significant Baps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties that have been identified. In preparing this statement we have discussed the issue and potential options with a broad spectrum of representatives from the fund management industry. This consultation helped define the problern, and develop the options and analysis summarised in this statement. In particular, we discovered that the risks of some options were lower than originally thought and that there would be signifrcant practical difficulties in implementing the solution we initially preferred. This led us to change our preferred option. We have consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. The proposed change does not impose any new significant compliance costs on affected taxpayers, as taxpayers would be able to choose whether or not to use the proposed optional rule. Consultation has informed us that the compliance costs are minimal for those who choose to use the proposed rule and that the record-keeping requirements align with standard industry processes. The proposed rule does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override coÍrmon law principles. Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 30 Apil20I2 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. When a person invests in an offshore asset, unexpected changes in exchange rates can significantly impact on the value of the person's investment when it is converted back into New Zealand dollars. Investors often enter into foreign exchange hedges, a type of financial arrangement, in order to protect the value of their investment from these cuffency fluctuations. 2. At present, there is a long-standing tax anomaly for a person who enters into a foreign currency hedge in relation to certain offshore assets. These assets are referred to as "affected assets" in the rest of this statement and comprise assets taxed under the Fair Dividend Rate (FDR) regime and Australian listed shares that are exempt from the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) rules.1 3. The anomaly arises because the affected assets and foreign currency hedges are taxed on a different basis. For example, under FDR changes in an asset's value are not taxed. Instead, FDR assets are taxed on an imputed return of 5Yo of the asset's market value at the start of the year. Conversely, changes in a hedge's value are fully taxed under the financial arrangement rules. This mismatch in treatment means that ahedge, which is effective in removing the impact of unexpected currency fluctuations before tax, will cease to be effective after tax. 4. The issue is perhaps best illustrated by example. Say a person has an offshore asset portfolio worth $10,000 USD and the NZD/USD exchange rate unexpectedly rises from $0.75 to $0.80. The person's asset portfolio is taxed under the fair dividend rate (FDR) regime. In New Zealand dollars, the portfolio's value falls from $13,333.33 to $12,500.00 NZD. If the person had used a foreign cuffency hedge to completely remove exchange rate risk, before tax is taken into account, the hedge will increase in value by $833.33 NZD, exactly cancelling the change in their portfolio's value. The hedge is totally effective before-tax. 5. The story is different after-tax. The offshore assets have lost $833.33 NZD of value. However, under FDR no deduction is given for this decrease. Despite this, the $833.33 increase in the hedge's value is taxable. After-tax, the person has lost $833.33 NZD from their asset portfolio but gained only $600.00 NZD from their hedge; the shortfall of $233.33 is created by the tax payment.2 6. This mismatch creates numerous issues. First, taxpayers expect hedging to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on post-tax income. The mismatch results in hedging being less effective. In turn, this flucfuation in investors' after-tax earnings leads to fluctuations in Government tax revenue. Although tax from offshore investment is a relatively small proportion of total tax revenue, solving this mismatch issue would help decrease volatility in this area. 7. We understand that the mismatch is a particular issue for the fund management industry, although it is likely to also be a problem for other types of investors (e.g. companies and individuals). I These are the main types offoreign asset where the tax mismatch issue arises. The issue may arise with assets taxed unde¡ some ofthe other FIF calculation methods. However, due to the way that these other methods operate, the mismatch is less likely to arise. In addition, it is uncommon for widely-held investment entities to invest in these other types of asset. 2 Io thi, example, the taxpayer is made worse offdue to the tax mismatch. Had the exchange rates moved in the opposite direction the taxpayer would be made better off. 2 8. Some taxpayers are able to address this mismatch issue by "grossing up" the amount that they hedge. In essence, this involves increasing the amount of foreign cuffency a taxpayer hedges to take account of their potential extra tax liability that may arise because of the tax mismatch. This approach of grossing up hedges has a number of problems. First, it is very difficult for Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs), one of the main investment vehicles used in New Zealand, to gross up their hedges because a PIE does not face a single tax rate. Second, even for non-PIE investors, grossing up hedges increases the costs of hedging due to the larger amount of foreign currency that needs to be hedged. Finally, the practice exacerbates fluctuations in Government revenue caused by the tax mismatch. 9. The question in this statement is whether the tax rules that apply to certain foreign currency hedges should be changed so that they are effective in removing the impact of foreign cuffency fluctuations both before and after tax. 10. There are no clear advantages to keeping the status quo. However, solving this issue potentially carries some risk. Foreign cuffency hedges are a financial arrangement and taxed under the financial arrangement rules. These rules take a very risk-averse approach to taxation in order to prevent tax planning. Some solutions to the problem (such as options 1 and 2 below) involve removing some foreign crÍrency hedges from the ambit of the financial arrangement rules. This approach could enable tax planning necessitating other base protection measures to be put in place. Another potential risk with options I and2 is that the effective taxrate that would apply to hedges covered by the new calculation method would be lower than the taxrate applying to other financial arrangements. This is not a concern for genuine hedges, which on average have a nil taxable value. However, it would create an incentive for taxpayers to attempt to classifii profitable financial affangements as eligible for the new calculation method. 11. V/e note that "tax mismatches" can arise in other situations. This statement does not address the mismatches in these other situations. 'We understand that foreign curency hedges made in relation to affected assets is one of the most common situations where the mismatch occurs; other sifuations are less so. Moreover, addressing the mismatch for these other situations would have different risks and require different solutions than those considered in this statement. OBJECTIVES 12. The main objective is to, as much as possible, enable taxpayers to effectively hedge their investments by providing a mechanism that aligns the after-tax change in the value of their foreign currency hedges to the after-tax change in the value of their offshore investment portfolio. A second objective is to minimise the risks of moving away from the status quo. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 13. The options we have identified are: Option 1 (preferred): ueate an optional rule that would allow ataxpayer to calculate the tax on a foreign currency hedge on the same basis as their FDR assets. To reduce the risks of this approach, this rule would be restricted to widely held investment entities and include stringent record-keeping requirements. 3 Option 2; as in option 1, but without rules restricting the type of entity able to use the new rules. Optíon 3: facilitate PIEs to gross up hedges by allowing them to use different investors' tax rates to stream the profits (or losses) from foreign curency hedges. Option 4: retain the status quo. 14. Our preferred option is option 1. It effectively addresses the problem and does so in a manner that is manageable for the managed fund industry. While it does impose costs on the funds that elect to use the new rule, this is not mandatory. For those that elect its use, we have designed the mechanisms of the new rule to ensure compliance costs are minimised. The restrictions on entities able to use the rule and stringent record-keeping requirements ensure there is no undue tax-base risk. 15. Option 1 does not address the tax mismatch problem for non-managed funds (such as companies and individual investors). While option 2 would not have this problem as it applies broadly, it would be a high risk approach. Option I covers widely held funds, which have investment mandates and other documents that disclose investment strategies. As a result of this and their size, their activities are also quite visible. These factors limit the risks. In addition, the fact that investors can generally enter and leave managed funds limits the incentive for such entities to take aggressive tax positions. 16. The final reason we prefer option 1 over 2 is that the benefits of the solution are greater for widely held funds. This is because PIEs, a very large part of the managed fund industr¡ cannot effectively "gross up" their hedges, whereas non-PIE investors can use this approach currently. 17. Before consulting with the fund management industry our preferred option was option 3. From this consultation, we discovered that this option would not be practical. It would very difficult for PIEs to stream the profits or losses arising from a hedge to different investors based on their tax rates. Moreover, it is difficult for a PIE to determine the correct rate to gross up its hedges as many of its large investors (such as companies and other managed funds) will have notified the PIE to tax them at 0%. However, this }Yorate does not necessarily mean that the PIE should not gross up its hedges in respect of these investors. 18. Option 4, maintaining the status quo, is not desirable as is described above. It creates challenges for ofßhore investors and creates unwelcome volatility in Government revenue. 19. None of these options has a fiscal cost since on average the positive and negative impacts of the tax mismatch net out over time. CONSULTATION 20. We have discussed this issue and potential options with a broad spectrum of representatives from the fund management industry. This consultation helped define the problem, and develop the options and analysis summarised in this statement. In particular, we discovered that the risks of some options were lower than originally thought and, as noted, there would be significant practical difficulties in implementing the solution we initially preferred. This led us to change our preferred option. 2l.We have also consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. 4 CONCLUSIONS A¡ID RECOMMENDATIONS 22. The recommended option is to create a new calculation method that gives widely held managed funds the option of having their eligible foreign currency hedges taxed on the same basis as FDR. Under this option the after-tax changes in the value of a taxpayer's offshore investment portfolio should closely match the after-tax change in the value of their foreign cürencyhedges. This would eliminate the tax mismatch. IMPLEMENTATION 23.The necessary legislative changes will be included in the scheduled July 2012 tax bill, applying from the start of the 2013-14 taxyear. 24.Implementing this option does not involve any systems changes for Inland Revenue. Updating Inland Revenue's published advice to reflect this change can be managed within standard business-as-usual processes. As a result, no signifi.cant systems risks have been identified. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 25. The adoption and use of this change by the fund management industry will be monitored as part oflnland Revenue's standard tax assurance process. Ifspecific concerns are raised, we would determine if there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. The Income Tax AcI2007 is also subject to regular review by officials. 5
Regulatory Impact Statement Voluntary Bonding Scheme payments and KiwiSaver requirements Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed is whether the KiwiSaver employee and employer contribution requirements should apply to Govemment payments received under a Voluntary Bonding Scheme (VBS), and if not, how that would be achieved. 'We have consulted with the Ministries of Education, Primary Industries and Health. We did not consult with applicants under the VBS in order to limit the potential take-up of KiwiSaver entitlements for VBS payments before the above question could be answered. The potential number of applicants who will successfully qualify for VBS pa¡nnents over the next few years is not known; nor is it known how many of those will be KiwiSaver members. Based on payments to date, assumptions have been made that relatively few people are currently affected by this issue, but we believe that numbers will grow as applicants become familiar with the process. To date, only one round of VBS payments have been made and KiwiSaver contributions have been paid in respect of a small number of these payments. The preferred solution is prospective only and will not affect paynrents made up until the law is changed. The options considered do not otherwise impose additional costs on businesses, impair other private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. The direct impacts are confined to the paying agencies and the VBS recipients. Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 20 June2072 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Voluntary Bonding Schemes 1. Voluntary Bonding Scheme (VBS) pa5rments are made to encourage recent graduates to work in hard-to-staff specialities and geographical locations. Currently the schemes apply for doctors, nurses, midwives, teachers and veterinarians. They are administered by the Ministry of Education through Teach NZ, the Ministry of Health through Health Workforce NZ and the Ministry for Primary Industries (referred to as the paying agencies). The scheme details can be found on the websites of the paying agencies. 2. The VBS policy framework is that, besides encouraging specific employment outcomes, the VBS payments are used for the repayment of any student loan balances of successful applicants. This reduces their personal debt quickly, and the Government's student loan debt balance. Only amounts over and above any remaining student loan balance will then be paid out in cash to the successful applicant. 3. VBS payments are taxable income. Inland Revenue has recently indicated that if the applicant is an employee, then the VBS payment is an extra pay under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) as it is made in connection with the applicant's employment. This requires the agency making the payment to withhold PAYE and associated deductions in accordance with the ITA and Tax Administration Act 1994. It also has implications for how the KiwiSaver Act 2006 applies. Therefore, while the applicant does not work directly for the paying agency, the paying agency is deemed to be an employer under the various lnland Revenue Acts. KiwiSaver 4. The KiwiSaver Act 2006 (KSA) sets out the requirements for KiwiSaver members and their employers. Under the KiwiSaver policy framework, although KiwiSaver remains voluntary, contributions are encouraged in several ways. For example, employees' contributions are facilitated by being deducted directly from their pay (if the employer receives a deduction notice from the member or from Inland Revenue). Employers are required to make compulsory employer contributions if the member is having employee contributions deducted to help boost savings. This requires active steps by employees to enrol as a KiwiSaver member, to decide what proportion of their pay is diverted to their KiwiSaver account, and to inform their employer. Otherwise, voluntary contributions can be made directly to a KiwiSaver provider by the individual. Additional member tax credits and a 'KickStart' contribution are also available from the Govemment. 5. The KSA definition of wage and salary payrnents includes an extra pay as defined in the ITA. Therefore, it is now recognised that VBS payments do fall under the KSA and the paying agencies are treated as employers. If the member provides the paying agency with a deduction notice, the agency will be required to deduct employee contributions from the VBS payment. In addition the agency willbe obliged to make compulsory employer contributions - currently 2o/o of gross salary and wages, and increasing to 3%o on I April 2013. 6. From 1 July 2012, the costs of employer superannuation contributions for state agencies are to be met from the departmental appropriations of those various agencies, rather than being reimbursed from a central fund administered by the State Services Commission (as is currently the case). This reflects that employer superannuation contributions are considered part of normal staff costs for an employer, including public sector employers. Combined impact 7. The combined impact of these laws is that employees who qualify for the VBS payments and who are KiwiSaver members can choose to provide a deduction notice to the paying agency and trigger KiwiSaver requirements. The paylng agency would be required to: deduct a specified percentage of the VBS payment for referral to the person's KiwiSaver account instead of their student loan account; and pay a KiwiSaver employer contribution. The employer contribution would be met from departmental funding, even though the VBS applicants are not staff members of the paying ageîcy other than in tax law. 8. The application of KiwiSaver requirements to VBS payments results in an unanticipated increase in departmental costs for the paylng agencies through employer contributions, an unanticipated increase in KiwiSaver account balances of some VBS applicants, and a lower than anticipated repayment of student loan balances. While the VBS policy intention of retaining graduates in hard-to-staff areas would not be affected, this would effectively increase the total payrnent through the VBS scheme beyond what was contemplated by Cabinet and beyond the funding provided to the paing agencies for vBS payments. 9. To date, only one round of VBS payments have been made and KiwiSaver contributions have been paid in respect of a small number of these payments. Question to be addressed 10. The question addressed is whether the KiwiSaver employee and employer contribution requirements should apply to Government pa¡rments received under VBS, and if not, how that would be achieved. OBJECTI\\rES I 1. In answering the question, we are seeking to meet two main objectives: a) keep the cost of the VBS scheme within original Government parameters; and b) ensure that VBS is applied to quickly reduce student loan debt balances. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 12. The first question addressed was whether the KiwiSaver employee and employer contribution requirements should apply to VBS paynents. Although the potential number of applicants who will successfully qualify for VBS pa5rments over the next few years is not known, nor is it known how many of those will be KiwiSaver members, we expect this to be an increasingly important question. This is because we believe that numbers will grow as applicants become familiar with the process, even though relatively few people are currently affected by this issue. 13. If KiwiSaver contributions are made in respect of VBS payments (the status quo), the objectives would not be met, namely: a o 2 The cost of the YBS scheme would not be within original Government parameters: Where a person provides a KiwiSaver deduction notice, the paying agencies would be required to pay a KiwiSaver employer contribution. This would increase the total payment through the VBS scheme beyond the limits agreed by Cabinet and beyond the funding provided to the paying agencies for VBS payments. VBS would not reduce student loan debt balances as quickly: If KiwiSaver continues to apply, as under current law, it would reduce the amount being provided towards the repayment of student loan balances, as originally intended under the VBS scheme. This would only occur for those applicants who have decided to join KiwiSaver and who decide to provide the deduction notice before pa¡rment is made. 14. If KiwiSaver contributions are not made in respect of VBS payments, then the objectives are met. 15. .We considered three options for how the objectives could be met, all of which necessarily require legislative change: a) Make the VBS payments tax-exempt. b) Change the way VBS payments are taxed, so that paying agencies are not treated as employers under tax law. Ð Exempt the VBS payment from KiwiSaver. Option (a): Make the VBS payments tax exempt 16. This option is to make the VBS payrnents tax exempt. This would remove the payment from all tax obligations and also exempt the paying agencies from being treated as an 'employer' and the associated obligations. As a result, the payments would not be considered as an extra pay and would not be subject to the KSA requirements. 11. If the payments were made tax exempt, it is likely that the amount paid to the applicants would be adjusted downwards so that the same "after-tax amount" would be paid (dependant on the specific wording of the agreements of the different agencies). This is because the original Cabinet decision sought to pay amounts under the VBS so that student loans would generally be repaid within a short period of time. The amount was calculated by reference to average student loan balances and salaries for each profession, and on the assumption that the payments would be liable to tax. 18. This option would ensure that the full VBS payment is directed towards repaying the student loan balance, achieving the intention of the VBS policy. There would be no additional costs for the paying agencies arising from KiwiSaver requirements. There may also be a reduction in administration costs for some agencies from no longer having to withhold PAYE. However, other agencies could face an increase in costs as they would no longer be able to use existing payroll systems to make the VBS payment. 19. Making the pa¡rments tax exempt would also be contrary to the Government's Revenue Strategy of a broad-base, low-rate tax system that minimises economic distortions. It would also be perceived to be unfair to other taxpayers who are required to pay tax on employment- related earnings. 'We are aware that other employers also make bonding payments, which are taxable. o o 3 20. Making the payrnents tax exempt would also have a wider impact on other government policies that are income-targeted, such as Working for Families Tax Credits. This would provide unintended benefits to VBS applicants, which may be considered unfair in comparison to other recipients of govemment assistance. These income-targeted policies could be adjusted to ensure VBS payments continue to count as income for the purposes of those polices, even if they are tax exempt. This would require considerable legislative and regulatory change and associated administrative and systems costs for a wide range of departments. It also risks unintended consequences arising from changing so many pieces of legislation. Option (b): Change the way YBS payments are taxed so that paying agencies are not treated as employers 2I. This option would continue to tax the VBS payments, but not as income from employment. Instead they would be separately defined as taxable income and so would also be caught for the wider range of social policies. The option would remove the PAYE and associated withholding requirements on paylng agencies. As a consequence, the KiwiSaver employee/employer contribution rules would not apply as VBS payments would no longer be an extra pay. 22. If the paying agencies are no longer responsible for withholding PAYE, then the responsibility to return and pay any tax due would fall on the recipient of the payrnents. It increases the compliance costs for individuals and would increase the likelihood that they are required to file tax returns and pay provision tax payments. It also raises risks that tax owing may not be collected or tax collection would be delayed. This increases their exposure to penalty and interest provisions if tax is not paid on time. 23. There would be additional administrative costs for some paying agencies as they would no longer be able to use existing payroll systems to make the VBS payments. This would also require system changes for Inland Revenue and administrative costs to collect the tax. There are also questions over how to direct the after-tax VBS amount towards the student loan balance while ensuring the applicants receive sufficient payment to meet the tax obligations. As a person's tax obligations depend on their total income (and deductions and cany forward losses) for the year, it can be difficult to determine in advance how much tax to set aside from the VBS payment. Option (c): Exempt the VBS payments from KiwiSaver (preferred option) 24. The third option is to keep the existing tax and social policy treatment, where VBS payments are aî extra pay, but to include a new exemption in the KSA to exempt the payments for the purposes of that Act. That is, the definition of extra pay in the KSA would exclude VBS payments. The KSA already provides exemptions for income from certain government pa¡iments, such as welfare benefit payments. For example, the Unemploynent Benefit is treated as income under the ITA, and the paylng agency (Work and Income) is required to withhold PAYE and make returns as an 'employer'. However, they are not required to make KiwiSaver contributions as welfare payments are specifically exempt from the definition of salary and wages under the KSA. 25. This option does not disrupt other income tax or social policy settings. Paying agencies would continue to ensure payments were subject to PAYE and associated deductions and be treated as an extra pay. No systems changes would be required by the paying agencies or by Inland Revenue to administer this KiwiSaver exemption. 4 26. Because no employee contributions would be deducted, the amount that could be directed to repayment of student loan balances would be maintained; this is consistent with VBS policy. No KiwiSaver employer contributions would be required; this reduces the cost to the paying agencies. CONSULTATION 27. The Ministries of Health, Education and Primary Industries, which administer the VBS schemes, were consulted as part of the review by Inland Revenue of the tax and social policies implications of the VBS payments. The Ministries provided background information on their VBS schemes, the policy framework and objectives, and how they process and administer the paSrments. Along with the Treasury, options were then discussed and issues identified. This lead to the identification of preferred options and the reconìmendations below (which were also discussed with the above Ministries). 28. The Ministries, in particular, provided information on how the various options could impact on the process and costs of administrating the schemes and making pa¡rments to applicants. Concems were raised that there should be a minimal impact on existing processes and that additional unanticipated costs should be avoided or minimised where possible. It was identified as an important objective that the VBS policy continued to be achieved, and that payments not be delayed. Any implementation should not disrupt other government priorities, such as changes to the student loan scheme. 29. We did not consult with applicants in order to limit the potential take-up of KiwiSaver entitlements for VBS payments before the above question could be answered. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 30. Of the options that were considered, option (c) is preferred. It achieves the key objectives and minimises compliance costs and changes to existing systems and business processes for the paying agencies. It uses an existing approach under the KSA, which limits the possibility of unintended consequences. 31. To date, only one round of VBS payments have been made and KiwiSaver contributions have been paid in respect of a small number of these paynrents. The change would apply on the date of Royal assent of a legislative change to implement this option. This will avoid complications that arise with retrospective application to payments that have already been made and not interfere with the past decisions of those who have already received payrnents and made KiwiSaver deductions. IMPLEMENTATION 32. A change to the KSA will be required to exempt the VBS pa¡iments from the definition of extra pay. The change is proposed to be included in the next available taxation bill and apply prospectively from date of Royal assent, and will be implemented immediately. From that date the paying agencies would no longer need to make KiwiSaver deductions and employer contributions from VBS payments. Given that it was not originally anticipated that KiwiSaver requirements would apply to VBS payments, there is no real impact on applicants once the change is enacted; instead they will no longer have the option of receiving an unintended increase in total payments. 5 6
Regulatory Impact Statement Various tax issues arising in the context of the Canterbury earthquakes Agency I)isclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The questions addressed are: 1. Given the unusual situation in Canterbury, and following the damage caused to a significant number of capital assets in the Canterbury earthquakes, how should the tax depreciation rules operate in respect of particular scenarios that have been identified by tax practitioners? 2. Should the tax rules take account of business intemrption insurance payouts received for the purchase on new assets? 3. 'Where an income-earning or business activity has boen temporarily disrupted by the Canterbury earthquakes, how should the tax deduction rules apply to expenses or losses incurred? The questions are limited to particular situations that have been raised with Inland Revenue by tax practitioners in respect of the Canterbury earthquakes. For this reason, the questions and the proposed amendments are focussed on the situation in Canterbury. As noted, the issues addressed were originally identified by tax practitioners, and their suggested solutions have been incorporated into Inland Revenue's analysis. Inland Revenue consulted on the proposed policy responses with these tax practitioners, including all of the large accounting firms and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. Further modifications were made to the final proposals in response to feedback received. Inland Revenue intends to consult on the draft legislation with this same group of practitioners. The fiscal implications of the amendments proposed in relation to the first question could not be quantified. However they do not affect the fiscal baselines because they relate to what would otherwise be an unanticipated windfall tax revenue gain for Government. There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The recoÍrmended approaches to the various issues raised do not impose additional costs on business, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy lnland Revenue 5 June2072 INTRODUCTION 1. This RIS summarises officials' analysis of proposed technical changes to the lncome Tax Act 2007. It addresses issues arising with the current tax rules which, in light of the unprecedented situation facing businesses in Canterbury, aÍe either not working as intended or result in difficult and undesirable outcomes. These issues have largely been identified by tax practitioners, who also suggested possible solutions which were incorporated into Inland Revenue' s own analysis. 2. Each issue, and possible amendment, has been considered in light of the Government's desire to provide earthquake relief and assist in the recovery of the Canterbury region, while ensuring that the revenue base remains sufficiently protected. The focus of the amendments has been to provide temporary, timeJimited earthquake relief and assistance in short-term recovery. They are not designed to address the issue of the overall and longer-term economic recovery of the Canterbury region, although they should not hinder it. 3. Analysis of each of the key issues and options for change is summarised in the table at paragraph36. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 4. As a result of the Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010, and its aftershock, the 22 February 20ll earthquake, a number of urgent changes to tax law were made. These reflected the most immediate and apparent taxation issues arising, and included: o Donations of trading stock: Income tax and gift duty relief for goods donated (or supplied for less than market value) to support Christchurch earthquake relief. o Employee welfore benefits: úrcome tax relief for certain welfare payments and benefits provided by employers within the first two months of each earthquake. . WFF' family scheme income: Ignore support given to people affected by the earthquake in the calculation of family scheme income. o Relief on subsidy payments: Subsidy pa¡rment made on behalf of the Crown not treated as a taxable grant or subsidy for GST purposes. o Redundancy tax credit: Retained and extended credits to redundancy pa¡rments received before 30 September 201 1. o Rollover relief: The deferral of recognition of income from insurance proceeds or depreciation recovered in respect of certain assets, by rolling-over the income tax liability to reduce the acquisition cost of replacement assets if acquired by 2015-16. o Relief from use-of-money interest þr þreign workers: Relief from back-dating of PAYE or provisional tax obligations of contractors if a worker's stay is prolonged. c Extensions of time: Extending deadline for complying with certain tax filing and payment obligations. 5. These changes addressed the most apparent needs facing Christchurch taxpayers in the aftermath of the earthquakes. Since then, as taxpayers have begun to receive insurance or compensation pa5rments, re-establish business or income-earning activities, and utilise some of the relief provisions described above, further issues have been identifred by tax practitioners and Inland Revenue officials working in the field. 6. The main set of issues relates to the application of the tax depreciation rules. These have arisen because of the scale of earthquake damage caused to a significant number of capital assets. This has had a knock-on effect on the way insurance claims are being processed and paid. There are two additional issues concerning the purchase of a new asset under a business intemrption insurance policy and the deductibility of certain expense items when an income-earning or business activity has been disrupted by the earthquakes. Depreciation-related issues 7. Under tax legislation, when capital assets (buildings, plant and machinery) are purchased, there is no income tax deduction for that expenditure. However, depreciation is deductible while the asset is available for business use. Depreciation is an estimate of the decline in value of an asset as it is used to earn income. In addition to depreciation deductions, deductions are also allowed for expenditure incurred on the repair and maintenance of an asset. 8. 'When applied to assets damaged in the Canterbury earthquakes, the tax depreciation rules may lead to results hhat are unfair or harsh, e.g. a taxpayer having an unanticipated tax liability because earthquake damage triggers certain tax disposal rules. 9. As noted at paragraph 4, the 2017 Canterbury relief measures included depreciation roll-over relief which effectively enables owners to defer the recognition of depreciation recovery income in respect of certain assets. This relief recognised the unanticipated windfall gain that would otherwise arise to the Government, and was developed in line with the general objective of not unnecessarily bringing forward future tax liabilities.l 10. Other issues have since been identified with the tax depreciation rules, including technicalities that may prevent taxpayers from accessing depreciation rollover relief as intended. The position under the current law and the issues arising in the Canterbury specific situation are discussed in more detail below (issues 1-6). fssue 7: Insurance payoutsfor repøírøble deprecìøble assets I l. Under the normal insurance model, where an asset is damaged but can be repaired, the insurer either undertakes the repairs or reimburses the insured after they have undertaken repairs. The existing tax law is based on this approach; the repairs expenditure is incurred first, and the expense is taken as a deduction. The insurance proceeds follow and, to the I For a full discussion on the depreciation roll-over relief, see Regulatory Impact Statem ent"Tax reliefþr depreciation claw back - Canterbury earthquake",' prepared by Inland Revenue, 30 March 201 I 2 extent that they recover the earlier repair expenses, the receipts are taxed as income (the "R&M recovery rule"). 12. However, for depreciable assets damaged by the Canterbury earthquakes, it has been colnmon in Canterbury for insurers to make insurance payouts beþre the insured taxpayer undertakes the relevant repairs. It is not clear whether the insurance proceeds are taxable under the R&M recovery rule in this instance ("Issue 1.1") or how the R&M recovery rule operates in terms of the timing of income recognition and expense deductibility ("Issue 7.2"). 13. If the R&M recovery rule does operate, it may lead to income being taxable upfront but expenses being deducted over several years; this may create cash flow difficulties. If the R&M recovery rule does not operate, there will be a reduction in the asset's book value for tax purposes instead. If the insurance payout exceeds the asset's tax book value, then under the depreciation rules the excess is treated as income upfront, without taking into account repairs that may be undertaken subsequently. This too may create cash flow difficulties. Issue 2: Insurance pøyouts for iweparøbly dømaged deprecìable assets 14. In a natural disaster, plant and machinery may be irreparably damaged and buildings2 may be rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income, and demolished or abandoned for demolition. Úr these circumstances, the general rule is that the tax book value of the asset is a deductible loss. However, if the assets are insured, the tax consequences do not follow the general rule. Instead, the assets are deemed to be sold for the amount of the insurance proceeds. 15. Many of the buildings in Canterbury are insured, and often for more than their book value.3 In these cases any depreciation previously deducted over the life of the asset will be fully or partially clawed back; this clawed back depreciation is then taxed as depreciation recovery income.a Although the depreciation rollover relief may provide some assistance in some of these cases, the rules do not provide sufficient clarity in situations where there is uncertainty and a potential time lag of several years between the insurance settlement, and the occurrence of expenses, such as future demolition costs. Issue 3: Depreciøble øssets that are physícally repøírøble, but are uneconomíc to repaír 16. Depreciation roll-over relief applies only to irreparable assets or buildings that are rendered useless for the purpose of deriving income and demolished or abandoned for demolition. In the atypical circumstances in Canterbur¡ the tax definition of "irreparable" or "rendered useless" can be quite narrow and may not align with insurers' decisions about writing off damaged assets or buildings which, although physically repairable, they consider to be uneconomic to repair. 2 lr"lodirrg grandparented structures as defined in section YA 1 of the Income T ax Act2007 . 3 Although Budget 2010 made the depreciation rate on most buildings zero, many buildings in Canterbury witl have benefited from prior depreciation deductions so that their tax book value will be lower than any insurance proceeds. 4 Any i^u\*.t . proceeds received in excess of the original cost (i.e. that exceed the dçreciation deductions previously claimed) are not taxable; they are treated as a capital gain. J 77. An example is a building damaged to the extent that the insurer considers it to be uneconomic to repair, but still able to be used by the person to carry on their business until a replacement building is ready, and the old building can be demolished.s Similar definitional issues also arise where an asset is effectively written off by the insurer but retained by the business and put to another, less productive, use. In these circumstances, the taxpayer is precluded from accessing the roll-over relief for the replacement asset. This is contrary to the general intent for this relief. This is because the taxpayer cannot defer the unanticipated tax liability that may result where insurance proceeds are received in excess of an asset's tax book value. Instead, the excess insurance proceeds are treated as depreciation recovery income rather than rolling over the proceeds to a replacement asset. fssue 4: Amount of ìncome where compensøtíon receìvedfor ø repaírable øsset 18. Insurance or compensation payments are treated differently depending on whether they are received in relation to (a) or (b) below: a) plant and machinery that are treated under the Income Tax Act as "ineparcbly damaged" or buildings6 that are rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income and demolished or abandoned for demolition; or b) plant and machinery that are not treated by the Income Tax Act as "irreparably damaged" because they are physically repairable or still usable or buildings that can still be used for the purposes of deriving income. 19. For insurance payments relating to (a), the treatment is appropriate. 20. In respect of (b), any expenditure incurred in repairing the assets is usually deductible. However, the problem is that any insurance proceeds associated with the cost of these repairs will be taxable to the extent that payouts exceed the cost of any repairs and the asset's tax book value. This means that the rules may end up taxing more than the amount of earlier depreciation deductions allowed with respect to the asset. Issue 5: Assets thøt øre deprecíøted in ø pool 21. The same issues outlined aI paragraphs I I to 17 arise for assets depreciated in a pool. 22. The pool depreciation method allows low-value assets (that each have a value of $2,000 or less where they meet certain criteria) to be grouped together and depreciated in order to reduce compliance costs. Pool assets are subject to their own special rules, rather than the general depreciation provisions that apply to other depreciable assets. 5 This .an uri." where, for example, a building is initially assessed by CERA as useable, but is later re-assessed for eventual demolition, and therefore written offby the insurer as uneconomic to repair. 6 locl.rdiog g.odpa¡ented structures, as defined in section YA I ofthe Income T ax Act2007 4 Issue 6: Allowíng depreciatíon for property that ís temporarþ unøvøíløble for use 23. At present, a deduction for depreciation is allowed only if an asset is used or is available for use by a person during the income year. However, it is uncertain whether the meaning of "available for use" covers an asset that is temporarily unavailable (for example, because it is situated in the Christchurch red zone). If such assets are not covered, they will be deemed to be disposed under the depreciation rules and this may lead to a tax liability for the owner. This outcome is undesirable when the property will subsequently be available for use for income-earning or in a business activity. Other issues Issue 7: Capitøl contríbutíons - busíness ìnterruptíon ínsurance pøyouts for neh) øssets 24. Under the depreciation rules, the amount of an insurance payout that relates to writing off an irreparably damaged asset or repairing a damaged asset is taken into account when calculating the amount of depreciation deduction allowed for the cost of a capital asset. 25. However, the Canterbury earthquakes highlighted a gap in these rules - if a person receives a payment under a business intemrption insurance policy to purchase a new asset to restart or continue their business operations, the pa¡nnent is not recognised in the depreciation rules. Further, the payment is not income of the person because it does not relate directly to income replacement. This means that the person can capitalise and claim full depreciation deductions for the total cost of the new asset even though they did not directly pay for it. This creates a risk to the tax base and is inconsistent with the policy of allowing a deduction for depreciation for the cost of the capital that is borne by the person. Issue 8: Deductíbílity of expenses where there ìs no income-earníng or busíness activíty 26. Generally, a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred by them in deriving their income (income-earning activity) or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving their income (business activity).7 27. As a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, some taxpayers may not be able to deduct their expenses or losses (including depreciation losses) relating to their income-earning or business activity because their activities are so disrupted by the earthquakes that there is no longer a sufficient link between the expenses or losses and their activities. For example, a rental property or business premise, which is situated in the Christchurch CBD red zoîe, becomes untenanted or forcibly closed because the premise is not physically accessible. Given there is no income-earning or business activit¡ on-going expenses such as rates may not be deductible under the general permission, even if the activity subsequently resumes. 7 The general permission in section DA I of the lncome Tax Act2007 5 Questions to be addressed 28. These eight issues raise the three questions to be addressed in this analysis: 1. Given the unusual situation in Canterbury, and following the damage caused to a significant number of capital assets in the Canterbury earthquakes, how should the tax depreciation rules operate in respect of particular scenarios that have been identified by tax practitioners? 2. Should the tax rules take account of business intemrption insurance payouts received for the purchase on new assets? 3. .Where an income-earning or business activity has been temporarily disrupted by the Canterbury earthquakes, how should the tax deduction rules apply to expenses or losses incurred? OBJECTIVES 29. As noted in previous Regulatory Impact Statementss on Canterbury-earthquake related tax amendments, the Government's desired outcome from all tax measures aimed at providing earthquake relief or assisting the recovery on the Canterbury region has been broadly to: o uphold the general direction of tax law and ensure that the revenue base remains suffi ciently protected; o make sure that the tax rules do not unnecessarily bring forward future tax liabilities; . ensure that the tax rules do not produce results that may be seen as unfair in the context of Canterbury; and o provide taxpayers with sufficient certainty as to their tax obligations and liabilities. 30. These broad objectives are relevant to the issues in this Statement. In addition, akey objective to be met in answering the questions at parugraph 28 is that the tax rules assist, or at least do not hinder, the recovery and rebuilding of the Canterbury region, particularly in respect of the timing of tax impacts. 31. These outcomes must be achieved within a relatively short timeframe, because the Government is responding to a devastating event that has akeady occurred. Ideall¡ people should have certainty as to what the tax treatment will be in respect of certain things that have occurred, or things they are contemplating doing as soon as practically possible. 32. Many of the issues covered in this paper are connected in somo rway to the tax treatment of insured assets and insurance receipts. Insurance payouts have started to be made during this current tax year, and taxpayers are beginning to make decisions on how they will use these payments. In doing this, they should be fully informed of the possible tax effects on the damaged assets, their insurance receipts, and any replacement assets that they may acquire. 8 Fo. e\*a-ple see the Regulatory Impact Statement on "?a x reliefJòr wetfare payments by employers - Christchurch earthquake" (17 March 201 1) and,"Tax relieffor deprecíation claw back- Carterbury earthquake (30 March 201 l)" 6 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 33. All eight issues arise from the application of current tax legislation. In light of the unprecedented post-earthquake situation facing taxpayers in Canterbury, the legislation is either not working as intended or results in unanticipated, difficult and undesirable outcomes. Inland Revenue's operational discretion is limited and any response needs to be regulatory. Each regulatory option was considered against the 'status quo' (i.e. whether continuing to apply the existing legislation is a valid approach). 34. Officials' preferred options are generally concerned with ensuring that the correct overall outcome from a tax policy perspective is achieved in light of the situation in Canterbury, raÍher than providing "special relief' targeted at Canterbury. Most of the proposed amendments are Canterbury-specific, with the exception of the recommended solution for issue 1a and issue 7, which have a more generic application. 35. Officials' recommend that all of the issues be addressed in the same bill. In particular, the depreciation-related items are linked and so should be developed together to create a more coherent package. 36. The table below summarises each of the eight issues and the option for change (analysed against the status quo): fssueOptions (against status quo) RIA paragraph Depreciation-related issues fssue l: fnsurønce pøyoutsfor repairable or useøble depreciable øssels 1.1) Uncertain treatment of insurance payouts received upfront l.l) Clarify that insurance payouts relating to deductible expenditure are taxable, irrespective of when insurance payout received. 1.2) Timing mismatch between recognition of insurance or compensation received and expenditure incurred (on repairs etc). 1.2) Matching rule to smooth the timing of income and deductions on damaged assets until end of 2015-16 income year. 38-44 Issue 2: Insurønce pøyouts þr írreparøbly dømøged depreciable øssets Timing mismatch between recognition of insurance or compensation received and loss/costs from disposal ofasset.

Matching rules similar to those for non-pooled assets. 59-6r Issue 6: Allowing depreciatíon for property thøt is temporarily unøvailable for use Depreciation can be claimed only if an asset is available for use; this application is uncertain if assets are capable of being used but because of the earthquakes cannot presently be used. Clarification to ensure "available for use" covers properties that are only temporarily 'unavailable' because of the earthquakes. 62-64 Other issues Issue 7: Cøpìtal contríbutions-insurønce receiptsfor purchøsing new a.ssets A payment under a business intemrption insurance policy to purchase a new asset to restart or continue its business operations is not recognised as income and is not reflected in the cost ofthe new asset. Include in the definition of "capital contribution", so the amount of insurance payment for purchasing a new asset is either included as income of the recipient or reduçes the cost base of the new capital asset. 65-68 Issue 8: Deductíbílíty of expenses where no income-earning or business øclivity Either: Defer expense deduction until the income- earning or business activity resumes (fficial's preferred option). Expenses may not be deductible because the income-earning or business activity has been disrupted by the earthquakes. Or: Allow a deduction when the expense is incurred, but claw back the deduction if the income-earning or business activity does not resume. 69-73 Depreciation-related amendments 37. The regulatory options for each depreciated-related issue are discussed below. Issue 7: Insurønce pøyouts for repøírable deprecìable øssets 38. Officials consider that option lA (covering Issues 1.1 and 1.2) will both clarify the tax position for upfront insurance payouts, and address the timing mismatch that exists under 8 Option 1AMatching rule (fficials' prefened option) (Issue 1.1) Clanfy that insurance payouts relating to deductible expenditure are taxable, regardless of when received. (generic) (Issue 1.2) Optional matching rule to smooth the timing of income and deductions on repairable damaged assets. Rule would match insurance payouts and repair expenditure incurred over several years; the net amount would be recognised either at the point of time the net outcome of the insurance proceeds and expenditure on repairs can be reasonably estimated, or the end of the 2015-16 income year, whichever is earlier. (Canterbury-specific) Status quo Option 1B No change to current legislation. cuffent tax law between deductions for depreciation, expenditure incurred on repairs and maintenance and the recognition of insurance proceeds as income. Consultation undertaken on this issue indicated that there was general support for this approach. The preferred option 1A addresses the fact that insurers in Canterbury have departed from their usual model of paying insurance proceeds after repairs are undertaken and have been paying insurance settlements upfront instead. 39. The proposed application date for the matching rule is the 2010-11 income year, although only a few taxpayers are likely to have received insurance payments in that year. For those taxpayers that do wish to use the matching rule for 2010-11, many have already ananged an extension of the date for filing these retums until 1 October 2012. Any taxpayer who has already filed their 2010-11 retum under the current rules can apply to the Commissioner to amend their assessment to take advantage of the matching rule. There are no significant compliance costs anticipated for amending these few 2010-11 assessments. 40. The proposed matching rule will apply on a per asset basis as opposed to a portfolio basis; this is consistent with the existing approach under the depreciation rules, which apply to individual assets (with the exception of low-value assets). This may mean some taxpayers will face higher compliance costs as they will need to track individual assets for the pu{poses of applying the matching rule. However, the rule is optional for taxpayers to use, which gives them greater flexibility according to their unique circumstances; this flexibility is consistent with the feedback received during consultation. 41. One downside of having an optional rule is that it may be possible for taxpayers to "cherry-pick", i.e. elect in andlor out of the matching rule in relation to an individual asset based on whether it will achieve a more favourable tax outcome. Accordingl¡ to minimise cherry-picking, a taxpayer who elects to use the matching rule must use it for all of their repairable depreciable assets in relation to which they have received an insurance payment due to the Canterbury earthquakes, and apply the rule up to the time of settlement or the end of the fixed time period. 42. There are no implementation issues with option 14, as taxpayers' decision to use the rule will simply be reflected by the tax positions they take in their income tax returns for each year and no earlier notification is required. 43. The matching rule is limited to assets damaged in the Canterbury earthquakes and is also limited in time, to income years before the 2016-17 income year. This is because officials consider that this option is suitable for responding to the unique circumstances arising because of the earthquakes but should not apply more generally, as the existing rules work well ordinarily. 44. Option 1B is to maintain the status quo. This does not address the issue currently arising under the tax rules where, as in Canterbury, insurance payments are received upfront before expenditure is incurred on repairing the relevant asset and the consequent potential unexpected tax liabilities that may fall on taxpayers. It does have the possible advantage of requiring taxpayers to comply with one rule. However, in the context of the Canterbury earthquakes, off,rcials consider that a more flexible approach is required when working out taxable income or losses relating to damaged assets. 9 Issue 2: fnsurønce pøyouts for ìrreparably damaged depreciøble øssets 45. Option 2A will address uncertainty under the current tax rules about when income and expenditure are recognised under the depreciation rules when an insured depreciable asset is either sold or irreparably damaged. Therefore, it will have the advantage of increasing taxpayer certainty. 46. The rule is similar in design and intent to the matching rule proposed for reparably damaged assets atparagraphs 38 to 44 above. Accordingly, the advantages and disadvantages of this option are similar to the ones outlined above. 47. Option 2B is to maintain the status quo. This does not address the uncertainty that exists regarding when income and disposal costs need to be recognised when an insured asset is irreparably damaged. Issue 3: Deprecìable assets that øre physìcally repøìrøble, but øre uneconomìc to repair 48. Option 3A addresses the situation where assets have been damaged to the extent that the insurer considers them to be uneconomic to repair, but the plant is not regarded under tax legislation as "irreparably damaged", or the building is not "rendered useless for deriving income" in the immediate term. The insurance proceeds may include an amount for demolition costs, which will not be incurred by the taxpayer until a future date. Option 2AMatching rule (fficials' preferred option) Introduce a matching ru1e to smooth the timing of income derivation and disposal losses where income and expenses occur over several years, The rule will allow only the net amount of insurance payrnents and disposal proceeds, and the written-off tax book value and disposal costs, to be brought to account for tax purposes. Option 2B Status quo No change to current legislation. Option 3ASame treatment as "irreparably damaged" assets (fficials' preferred option) Extend current roll-over relief rules, to defer any depreciation recovery income. Matching rule to smooth the timing of disposal costs for assets that are uneconomic to repair until end of 2015-16 income year. The effect will be to treat assets deemed "uneconomic to repait''in the same way as assets considered under the tax rules to be "ireparably damaged". Option 3BStatus quo No change to current legislation. 10 49. This option involves applying the same matching rule that is available for irreparably damaged assets (outlined at paragraphs 4547). So these rules will apply, for example, to buildings that: . are considered by an insurer to be uneconomic to repair; o will require demolition before the beginning of the 2016-17 income year; and o the taxpayer intends to acquire a replacement building before the beginning of the 2016-17 income year. 50. Using the matching rule for buildings will have the additional benefit of providing certainty to taxpayers regarding the treatment of demolition costs that they are committed to incur in the future, as the matching rule can be applied to these to bring them to account. 51. Option 3A also has the benefit of allowing depreciation roll-over relief to defer any income tax liability. As well as providing some immediate tax relief, an explicit part of the rollover relief policy was to incentivise rebuilding in Canterbury by refraining from imposing art "extrt' tax on firms that merely want to be able to rebuild their business by replacing assets. The same rationale applies to assets that are not immediately destroyed but are uneconomic to repair (although they are still capable of being used in a different capacity) and to buildings that are uneconomic to repair and must be demolished within the next few years. 52. The disadvantage is that there may be some compliance costs as firms will need to separately track and account for assets where roll-over relief has been taken; this is a feature of roll-over relief in general and not just this particular option. However, this is tempered by the roll-over relief being optional. There may be some incentive to claim that buildings are not economic to repair simply in order to qualify for roll-over relief. Accordingl¡ along with the existing roll-over relief requirements (i.e. the building must be demolished by the end of the 2015-16 income year and there must be an intention to obtain a replacement building), there will be a requirement that the building has been assessed by an insurer as uneconomic to repair. In addition, this option is limited to buildings affected by the Canterbury earthquakes and will only apply for the period of the rollover relief, that is until the end of the 2015-16 income year. 53. Option 3B is to maintain the status quo. This has the advantage of retaining the current clear boundary between assets such as plant that are effectively totally destroyed, and buildings that are rendered useless for earning income and are demolished/ require demolition and other assets that may be damaged but are still able to be used for earning income. 54. Option 3B has the disadvantage of prolonging the current uncertainty regarding the tax treatment of future demolition costs. Úr addition, and contrary to the policy objectives for depreciation roll-over relief, taxpayers may face an unanticipated tax liability being imposed on insurance proceeds, which may affect rebuilding in Canterbury. l1 Issue 4: Amount of íncome where compensøtíon receivedfor ø repøírable øsset 55. As explained at paragaph 20, the current legislation taxes the insurance proceeds received for a repairable asset to the extent that they exceed the cost of any repairs and the asset's tax book value. This means that the rules may end up taxing more than the amount of earlier depreciation deductions allowed with respect to the asset. This may cause problems for taxpayers who do not have a ready source of cash to fund the unanticipated tax liability. 56. Accordingly, capping the amount of depreciation recovery income at the amount of depreciation deductions previously claimed addresses the issue of the taxpayer facing an unexpectedly large tax liability. And as discussed above atparagraph 51, the extension of roll-over relief may mean that the income tax liability that they do incur on depreciation claw back can be deferred. Option 4A will provide indirect assistance in re-building Canterbury. It also has the benefit of ensuring consistency with the tax treatment of insurance received in relation to an irreparably damaged asset. 57. This option will be limited to assets damaged in a Canterbury earthquake and will expire at the end of the 2015-16 income year. 58. Option 4B is to maintain the status quo. This does not address the issue outlined above oftaxpayers facing an unexpectedly large tax bill for insurance proceeds received in relation to assets that are damaged (but not irreparably so) in the Canterbury earthquakes. Issue 5: Assets thøt øre deprecíøted ín a pool 59. Option 5A involves introducing matching rules for pooled assets that work in a similar manner to the ones outlined above atparcgraphs 38 to 43 and 45 to 47 for non-pooled assets. 60. The advantages of introducing the matching rules are that it will provide more certainty and clarity regarding the timing of insurance and disposal proceeds and expenditure incurred for pooled assets. In other respects, the advantages and disadvantages of this option are the discussed above atpangraphs 38 to 43 andparagraphs 45 to 47. 61. Option 58 is to maintain the status quo. This option does not address the issue of taxpayer uncertainty regarding when insurance proceeds and repair and disposal costs should Option 4A Cap on insurance payouts (fficials' preferred option) Cap the amount of income from insurance payouts received in respect of repairable assets to the amount of depreciation deductions previously claimed. Option 4B Status quo No change to current legislation. Option 5A Matching rule for pooled assets (fficials' preferred option) Introduce matching rules (similar to the ones discussed above) to smooth the timing of income derivation, repairs expenses and disposal losses. Option 58Status quo No change to current legislation. t2 be recognised for tax purposes for pooled assets affected by the earthquakes. It does have the advantage of applying the same rules to all pooled assets; however, this does not seem appropriate in the context of the Canterbury earthquakes. Issue 6: Allowing deprecìatíonfor properg thøt ís temporarþ unavaìlable for use 62. Option 6A provides certainty for those affected by the Canterbury earthquakes. The impact of this option is minor as the legislation is being aligned with the current policy of treating properties as available for use even though they are temporarily unavailable (i.e. subject to repair or an inspection). Note that those who cannot deduct their depreciation because they no longer meet the general permission provisione may be required to defer their depreciation deduction until their income-earning or business activity resumes (see officials' preferred option for issue 8 atparagraphs 70-73 below). 63. The application of Option 6A is limited from 4 September 2010 (the day of the first Canterbury earthquake) to the 2015-16 income year. This solution aligns the relief time period with other specific Canterbury earthquakes tax reliefs such as depreciation rollover relief. It would be also inappropriate to treat properties as "available for use" if it does not become available for use by the 2015-16 income year. 64. Option 6B is to maintain the status quo, which may treat the properties that are temporarily available for use as being disposed of under the depreciation rules. This is undesirable where properties affected by the earthquakes will subsequently be available for use for income-earning or business activity. Option 6A Clarif,/ the meaning of "available for luse" (fficials' preferred option) Clarify the meaning of "available for use" to cover properties that are only temporarily 'unavailable' because of the earthquakes. Option 68Status quo No change to current legislation. 9 Setion DA I of the Income Tax Act2007 l3 Other amendments Issue 7: Capítal contrìbutions - busìness intenuptíon ínsurønce payouts for purchasíng new assets 65. Option 7A is to amend the capital contribution rules so that insurance payouts under a business intemrption insurance policy for purchasing new assets are either included as income of the recipient or reduce the cost of the new capital asset. Clawing back the amount of insurance payouts on the new asset, for depreciation purposes, is consistent with the policy to allow a deduction for depreciation for the cost of the capital which is actually borne by taxpayers. Moreover, this solution ensures that the tax base is protected. 66. This preferred option will result in a small unquantifiable increase in tax revenues. Similar to when the capital contribution rules were proposed, the impact of the preferred option would most likely result in a marginal increase in taxpayer's compliance cost. The impact is limited to those who received insurance proceeds under a business intemrption insurance policy for purchasing new depreciable property after the 2011-12 income year (except for those people who filed tax returns before the proposed legislation is introduced, i.e. before the start of the Committee of the whole House stage of the debate on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill). This limited application date allows taxpayers to rely on existing law at the time but prevent a risk to the tax base. 67. Affected taxpayers would be required to either include the insurance receipts as income and spread the amount over 10 years (the default rule) or choose to reduce the cost of the new capital asset, which would limit the amount of depreciation deduction on that capital asset in future. There are no significant administrative implications from this option. 68. Option 7B is to maintain the status quo. This is unsatisfactory as it does not align with the policy intent for only allowing a deduction for depreciation for the cost of the capital asset which is actually borne by taxpayers. When the capital contribution rules were implemented, officials excluded insurance receipts from the capital contribution rules to prevent double counting; insurance receipts relating to depreciable assets are already covered under the depreciation rules. The current gap in the depreciation rules (status quo) is unintended. Option 7AAmend the capital contribution definition (fficíals'prefened option) Include business intemrption insurance payouts for purchasing new asset in the definition of "capital contribution", so the amount of insurance payment is either included as income of the recipient or reduces the cost of the new capital asset. Option 7BStafus quo No change to current legislation. t4 Issue 8: Deductíbility of expenses where there is no íncome-earnìng or busìness actívìty 69. Option 8C is the status quo, which denies deductions for expenses or losses that would otherwise be tax deductible but for the period of disruption caused by the earthquakes. This seems undesirable. Option 8A and 8B would both allow deductions; the main difference between these options is in the timing of the deduction. 70. The preferred Option 8A would defer the deduction by deeming the expenditure or loss to be incurred in the income year when the income-earning or business activity resumes. The benefit of this approach is that it provides certainty around deductibility of expenses or losses for affected taxpayers who intend to continue their income-eaming or business activities. Also, this approach protects the tax base from taxpayers pre-deducting their expenditure or loss and not resuming (or unreasonably delaying) their activity. 71. Option 8A provides a number of benefits. The legislation will provide certainty around deductibility of expenses for those affected by the earthquakes and who intend to continue their income-eaming or business activity. Option 8A also avoids complex notification and tracking processes inherent in Option 8B; for example, identiSring the affected taxpayers intend to carry on their activities and determining whether they actually continue their activities at a future time. There are no significant administrative implications arising from this option as those affected by the earthquakes would simply rely on the law. 12. A drawback with Option 8A over Option 8B is that it leaves taxpayers to bear the expenses or losses temporarily until their activity resumes. However, the cost of delaying the deduction should be balanced with the revenue risk and complex administrative and compliance implications. 73. Option 8A would apply only to those affected by the Canterbury earthquakes, from 4 September 2010 to the 2015-16 income year. This solution aligns the relief time period with other specific Canterbury earthquakes tax reliefs such as depreciation rollover relief. Fiscal impact 74. The fiscal implications of the options for the depreciation related issues discussed under Issues I to 5 þaragraphs 38 to 61) could not be quantified. The measures all relate to the relief of windfall tax revenue gains associated with the treatment of assets damaged in the Canterbury earthquakes, and their subsequent disposal or repair, and are ring-fenced to this event. The proposed matching rules prevent a timing mismatch which would otherwise arise Option 8ADeduction when income-earning or business activity resumes (fficials' preferred option) Defer any expense deduction until the income-earning or business activity resumes. Option 88Deduction when expense incurred Allow a deduction when the expense is incurred, but claw back the deduction if the income- earning or business activity does not resume. Option 8CStatus quo No change to current legislation. l5 between recognising income from insurance payments and allowing deductions for repair or disposal. Since none of these windfall tax revenue gains or timing mismatches have been anticipated in the baseline tax revenue forecasts, the tax measures proposed in this Statement do not affect the fiscal baselines. 75. The options to extend the meaning of "available for use" (Issue 6) mostly clarify existing law and are therefore unlikely to have significant revenue implications. 76. There is a small unquantifiable revenue gain from the amendments to the definition of capital contributions (Issue 7). The amendment to address the deductibility of expenses where there is no income-earning or business activity (Issue 8) would have a small unquantifiable fiscal cost. This cost depends on two factors - the number of affected taxpayers' deciding to continue their income-earning or business activities and the length of their decision-making period. Administrative, compliance and other impacts 77. Compliance costs are minimised with respect to the proposed matching rules (Issues 1, 2 and 5) by not requiring taxpayers to notify in advance of their election into the rule. Instead ataxpayer' s decision to apply the matching rule would be reflected by the tax positions they take in their income tax returns for each year.lO 78. The other measures outlined in this Statement do not have administrative implications for Inland Revenue, and would not impact on Inland Revenue's computer systems. 79. There are no social, environment or cultural impacts to the options considered to address any of these issues. The groups affected by the amendments proposed are taxpayers that have assets damaged by the Canterbury earthquakes, and/or who have suffered disruption to their income-earning or business activity as a result of the earthquakes. CONSULTATION 80. The issues addressed by these amendments were identified by tax practitioners dealing with Christchurch-based clients. These practitioners also suggested solutions to the specific issues they were seeing in Canterbury, which have been incorporated into Inland Revenue's proposed amendments. 81. Consultation was undertaken with a small group of tax practitioners on each of these issues and the proposed solutions, by way of an informal policy paper being circulated to select parties. This group included representatives from all of the large accounting firms, and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants' tax advisory group. V/ritten feedback was received from six firms, and officials also met or held telephone conferences with 10 Fo, ta\*paye.\* who elect to use the roll-ove¡ relief, the existing law requires them to noti! the Commissioner. l6 practitioners. Some modifications were made to the options outlined above in response to feedback received from consultation. Summary of feedback 82. The key feedback received (and Officials' comments) was the need for simplicity, certainty and flexibility in the design of the rules. A number of minor technical issues were raised, which officials have worked through. Inland Revenue intends to consult on the draft legislation with this same group of practitioners. 83 84 Practitioner feedbackOfäcialst comment Applícatíon døteIssue 7.1 A flexible approach is proposed, because the amendment is generic and applies with no time limit. It should apply from the 2010-11 income year for taxpayers who have not taken a tax position for that year yet; and the 20ll-12 income year for those who have. Issues 1.2-8 Will taxpayers be able to re-open tax returns that have already been filed for the 2010-11 year or would be grandparented? Amendments should apply from 4 September 2010 until the last day of the 2015-16 income year (in line with the expiry of the CERA). No relief for tax positions already taken because taxpayers are able to affange to extend the date for filing 2010- 11 year retums until 1 October 2012. fssue 7The amendment should not apply retrospectively. The retrospective application date is consistent with other specific Canterbury earthquakes measures. Also, this application date does not require past assessments to be reopened. Møtchíns rule Issues I and 2 Unanimous support for the matching approach. Differing views on whether the rule should apply in all cases or only when insurance proceeds are received before repairs are undertaken. The matching rule has limited application to Canterbury, and is largely an issue of timing. Offrcials concluded that taxpayers should have the option to use the matching approach, but once selected it should apply to all of their assets. Deductìon rule - claw backIssue I Broadly ag\[ee with the change; concern if expenses were allowed upfront but then clawed back unless the income-earning or business activity does not restart. Officials concluded that the deferral approach (instead of the claw back approach) is preferred when balanced with revenue risk associated with the relief and complex administrative and compliance implications. t7 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 85. Officials have considered the various issues and options outlined above. Although discussed separately, there is some overlap in the solutions recommended to address each issue. Officials consider that implementing the preferred options as a package would provide a holistic approach to best address the identif,red difficulties with the depreciation and deduction rules in the particular situation in Canterbury. The solutions limit the potential cost and risks associated with providing amendments to deal with specific circumstances, while providing appropriate tax relief for taxpayers and businesses affected by the earthquakes in a way that meets the Government's policy objectives. IMPLEMENTATION 86. Given the need for certainty on the tax treatment of these items, many of which started to arise during the 2071-12 tax year, officials consider that the amendments should be legislated in the first available taxation bill. Off,rcials have therefore recommended that any amendments are included in a Supplementary Order Paper to be introduced at the Committee of the whole House stage debate of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 87. The new rules would be administered by Inland Revenue through existing processes; there are no systems implications. The amendments will involve some initial costs for communication and education, which will be covered through Inland Revenue's baseline funding. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 88. The preferred options are targeted to resolve particular technical issues which have arisen because of the specific circumstances in Canterbury resulting from the earthquakes. Several of the proposed approaches are optional and apply only in limited circumstances andlor for a limited time period. Therefore, the potential impacts should be confined to a relatively small group of taxpayers. 89. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTPP"). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, dîy changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax PolicyWork Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 18
Regulatory Impact Statement Thin-capitalisation amendment to address insurance delays relating to the Canterbury earthquakes Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question is whether amendments to the thin capitalisation rules are needed in order to address a tax issue created by the fact that earthquake damage must be recognised immediately for tax and accounting pu{poses, whilst the related insurance proceeds can onlybe recognised at alater date. The question is limited to assets damaged by the Canterbury earthquakes since there are likely to be larger impairments and longer delays in securing insurance proceeds after the Canterbury earthquakes than in other cases. This issue was one of a number of earthquake-related issues outlined by Inland Revenue in a presentation and accompanying paper to the 2011 New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Conference. That paper was published online and asked any affected taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue. So far, only one taxpayer appears to be seriously affected by this problem and we have consulted in detail with this taxpayer. However, given the damage caused by the Canterbury earthquakes, it is likely that other taxpayers are affected, but may not realise that they have a problem. Inland Revenue will consult on the draft legislation with affected parties and other key stakeholders. There are no other significant gaps, constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The recommended approach does not impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Advice hland Revenue 2l }i/.ay 2012 2 PROBLEM DEF'INITION AND STATUS QUO 1. The thin-capitalisation ("thin-cap") rules apply to multinational groups with operations in New Zealand. They help to protect the tax base by limiting the extent to which these groups can place debt in New Zealand in order to generate deductions to reduce their New Zealand income. The rules achieve this by denying further interest deductions in those cases where the New Zealand operations have an excessive ratio of debt to assets (compared to commercially-sensible levels and the multinational's worldwide operations). 2. Some multinational groups have had buildings and other major assets destroyed by the Canterbury earthquakes. There can be significant time delays between this damage being recognised, and the recognition of the related insurance proceeds. As a result of these delays, the thin-cap rules can create additional tax liabilities for multinational groups that would otherwise be regarded to have a reasonable level of debt relative to their New Zealand operations. 3. The status quo leads to inconsistent tax outcomes for a small number of taxpayers. For example, a company with the same debt to asset ratio before the earthquake, and after their insurance is received, could suffer an artificial spike in their ratio because the damage is recognised in advance of the insurance proceeds. Such a spike could lead to some interest deductions being denied by the thin-cap rules. Outcomes will also vary between similar taxpayers with different income years. Multinational groups that end their income year before their insurance proceeds are recognised, could be disadvantaged relative to groups that are able to recognise the damage and insurance in the same income year. 4. In the absence of an amendment, the Govemment would receive a small windfall revenue gain from the Canterbury earthquakes in respect of some multinational companies whose assets have been damaged. Due to lack of information it is not possible to quanti$z this amount, or to confirm exactly how many taxpayers are affected. Example of problem A company's only New Zealand asset is a building which is valued at $6m and is insured for the same amount. The company has $3m of debt. Prior to the earthquake, the company would have been able to claim a tax deduction for the interest payments on its debt. This is because their debt to asset ratio is 50%, which is comfortably under the 60%o safe-harbour in the thin-cap rules (within which interest deductions are not denied). As a result of damage caused by the February 20Il earthquake the building must be demolished. The company's 2010-11 income year ends on 30 March 2011. 3 In June 2011, the company's insurance claim is confirmed by their insurer and they receive a $6m insurance pay-out. From February 2011, the company is no longer able to recognise a $6m building asset. The company cannot recognise the $6m of insurance proceeds until June 2011. As a result, the company has no assets at the end of the 2010-11 income year and their debt to asset ratio goes above 60Yo for that year. The thin-cap rules prevent the company from deducting some of their interest payrnents, which results in an additional tax liability in the 2010-ll income year. In the 2011-12 income year, the insurance proceeds can be recognised as an asset so that the debt to asset ratio retums Io 50%o and the company's interest paSrments become deductible again. In this example, the company does not have an excessive amount of debt relative to the size of their New Zealand operations. This is reflected by the factthat there would have been no interest denial ifthe insurance proceeds could have been recognised in the same income year as the earthquake damage. 5. The question is whether amendments to the thin capitalisation rules are needed in order to address a tax issue created by the facl that earthquake damage must be recognised immediately for tax and accounting pu{poses, whilst the related insurance proceeds can only be recognised at a later date. OBJECTIVES 6. The main objective is to ensure that tax outcomes produced by the thin-cap rules are broadly in line with outcomes arising before the Canterbury earthquakes and those that occur after the insurance proceeds have been recognised. 7. A second objective is that any amendment should not undermine the overall intention of the thin-cap rules, which is to deny interest deductions in cases where a multinational has placed an excessive level of debt in New Zealand relative to the size of their New Zealand operations. 8. Finally, any relief should be limited to assets damaged as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. The severity and widespread impact of the Canterbury earthquakes means there are likely to be larger impairments and longer delays in securing insurance proceeds than in other cases. Taxpayers may be able to deal with smaller impairments or delays by measuring their assets using a daily or quarterly average (these measurement options are avallable under the existing thin-cap rules). The Canterbury earthquakes appear to be the first time this problem has arisen since the thin-cap rules were introduced in 1996. 9. A secondary consideration for limiting relief to the Canterbury earthquakes is that it allows for options that are simpler to apply due to the events occurring in the 4 past. For example, it allows taxpayers to use the value of insurance proceeds as opposed to attempting to estimate them in advance. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 10. Three main options were considered. Consistent with the above objective they are a7l focused on the Canterbury earthquakes. Optíon 7: Temporary exemptíon from thìn cap rules 11. The simplest legislative solution would be to provide a temporary exemption from the thin-cap rules for the affected companies. This would remove the compliance costs associated with performing a thin-cap calculation. 12. However, it would fail the objective of ensuring that multinational groups cannot allocate an excessive level of debt in New Zealandrelative to the size of their New Zealand operations. For example a company which had an excessive debt to asset ratio prior to the earthquakes would have no interest denial during the exemption period. 13. .We have therefore considered how the affected taxpayers should value their assets in the interim period between the asset being written down and the insurance proceeds being recognised for financial reporting purposes. Two main measurement options were considered. Optíon 2: Allow pre-eørthquake asset values to be used 14. We considered allowing taxpayers to continue to use the pre-earthquake value of any assets that had been damaged by the earthquakes. This approach would make sense if the objective was to keep taxpayers in the same position as if the earthquakes had not occurred. It would provide affected taxpayers with more time to adjust to any reduction in assets. 15. However, the problem is not that asset values have declined per se, rather it is that the insurance proceeds are recognised at alater date than the earthquake damage. Allowing historical asset values to be used would be poorly-targeted approach to this timing problem. This is because it would provide relief in respect of assets that no longer exist and that will not be replaced by insurance proceeds. In such cases there is a true reduction in assets and ignoring this reduction would be inconsistent with the fact that the thin-cap rules usually take into account reductions in asset values. 16. Another issue with using the pre-earthquake values is that it could potentially provide relief in cases where an asset had been sold or disposed of, or that had declined in value for reasons not directly related to earthquake danage, such as the general economic downturn. This risk could be reduced by limiting any relief to the amount of earthquake damage. Under this option there would be some additional compliance costs associated with calculating the amount of earthquake damage. 5 Optíon 3 (prefewed optíon): Allow the ínsurønce proceeds to be cawíed-back to the date thøt the dømage occumed 17. A better-targeted approach would be to use the value of the insurance proceeds. Under this approach, the affected taxpayers would be able to go back and recognise these amounts as assets, for the purposes of the thin-cap rules, at the time that the earthquake damage was recognised. 18. One complication is that the future insurance proceeds could be greater than the amount of the earthquake damage. This could be seen to undermine the intention of the thin-cap rules as it could provide relief in cases where the taxpayer had an excessive debt to asset ratio prior to the earthquakes. 19. This problem could be mitigated by limiting the relief to the lesser of the insurance proceeds or the amount of earthquake damage. This would ensure that relief would only be available in cases where a taxpayer had a reasonable ratio of debt to assets prior to the earthquakes, and a reasonable ratio after their insurance proceeds had been received. This would help to protect the tax base and ensure consistency of tax outcomes. 20. Although this option is well-targeted at the timing problem, as with any tax change, there is a small risk of unintended outcomes. This risk will be reduced by having the amendment apply for a limited period and to those taxpayers affected by the timing problem. In addition we will require taxpayers to notify Inland Revenue if they use the amendment. If unintended outcomes arise remedial amendments could be considered to ensure appropriate results. 2I. This option increases compliance costs for those taxpayers that are able to use it as it requires them to make adjustments for insurance proceeds. However, in most cases an adjustment should only be required for a single tax year. We intend to limit these compliance costs by making the provision optional. CONSULTATION 22. This issue was one of a number of earthquake-related issues outlined by Inland Revenue in a presentation and accompanying papsr to the 2011 New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Conference. That paper was published online and asked any affected taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue. 23. So far, only one taxpayer appears to be seriously affected by this problem and we have consulted in detail with this taxpayer. That taxpayer has confirmed that they are unable to resolve the issue by taking a quarterly or daily measurement of assets (these measurement options are available under existing thin-cap rules). The preferred option would address the problem for this taxpayer. 24. Given the damage caused by the Canterbury earthquakes, it is likely that other taxpayers are affected, but may not realise that they have a problem. Inland Revenue 6 will consult on the draft legislation with the affected taxpayer and other key stakeholders. Vy'e will take this consultation into account when designing the final form of the amendment. 25. The Treasury has been consulted on this Regulatory Impact Statement and agrees with the preferred option. The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority has been informed of the issue and the preferred option. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 26. The preferred option is to allow affected taxpayers to count future insurance proceeds at the time that the damage occurred. 27. Compared to the other options, this approach is the most targeted at the timing problem. This helps to protect the tax base and should ensure that the resulting tax outcomes are consistent with those that arose prior to the earthquakes, and those that occur after the insurance proceeds are received. 28. rules The preferred option would make no taxpayers worse off relative to the existing IMPLEMENTATION 29. An amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 would be needed to give effect to the proposed solution. Because the amendment affects past events and is taxpayer favourable it is proposed that it be included in the next available Tax Bill. 30. Any new rules would be administered by Inland Revenue through existing channels. The amendment would involve some implementation and on-going costs for communication, education and monitoring. These costs would be covered through Inland Revenue's baseline funding. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 31. The preferred option is well-targeted at a technical timing problem. Therefore the potential impact should be relatively small, especially considering the amendment would be optional and apply only in limited circumstances and for a limited time period. 32. The preferred option would require taxpayers to notifr Inland Revenue if they choose to use the amendment. This will allow Inland Revenue to monitor the resulting outcomes and ask for further information if required. 33. Inland Revenue officials will make themselves available for discussion with affected taxpayers should any further difficulties arise.
Regulatory Impact Statement Improved Taxation of Controlled Foreign Companies Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by lnland Revenue. The question it addresses is whether taxpayers are taxed on the profits of foreign companies that they control in a fair way. There has been extensive consultation about the options discussed in this statement. The preferred options have the support of the taxpayers that we have consulted and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. As a result of consultation, a preferred option allowing companies to elect for taxation on all of their passive income was extensively modified to reduce compliance costs. This was done by allowing the election to be made only in respect of one or some foreign companies, rather than all of them. There have also been changes to the finer details of preferred options identified in this statement. There are no significant Baps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The proposed option does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest, or override common law principles. Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 7 June2012 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The question this statement addresses is whether taxpayers are taxed on the profits of foreign companies that they control in a fair way. 2. New Zealand owners of foreign companies (Controlled Foreign Companies or CFCs) are taxed directly on the profits of those companies. The purpose of this is to prevent taxable income being artificially removed from the New Zealand tax base. The relevant taxing provisions are in the Income Tax Act 2007. 3. In2009, the taxation of CFCs was changed. Since that time only passive profits have been taxed. This more directly reflects the purpose of the CFC rules. Passive profits are from certain income that may be easily shifted between countries, such as interest or royalties. 4. In contrast, active profits are not taxed. Active profits include profits such as manufacturing income, which is harder to shift because it comes from fixed assets and workforces. Removing New Zealand tax on active CFC income has also put New Zealand multinationals on a more equal footing with their competitors abroad. 5. To reduce compliance costs, there is an active business test. A CFC passes the test if its (gross) passive income is less than 5%o of its (gross) total income. If it passes the test, all income from the CFC is ignored and none of its expenses are tax deductible. That is, the CFC is effectively removed entirely from the tax base. The test can be conducted using general purpose financial accounts or income tax calculations. 6. Two technical problems have been identified with the CFC rules, both of which involve taxing income while not allowing deductions for related expenditure. 7. The first problem arises when an active CFC borrows to fund its business. If the borrowing is in a foreign cuffency, it is possible that exchange rate changes will generate a gain on the borrowing. Such a gain is passive income and may cause the CFC to fail the active business test, so that the gain is taxable. úr contrast, an exchangerate loss would not cause the CFC to fail the active business test and so would not be deductible.l If the exchange rate fluctuated over the course of a loan but ended up where it began, there would be no overall economic income but there would be an overall tax liability. This is overtaxation. 8. The first problem has been observed in practice, and has created significant amounts of income (many tens of millions of dollars) that should not have been taxed, but were subject to tax under the law. A temporary solution was instituted in 2011, with retrospective effect, to relieve the first problem. That solution involves carrying exchange rate losses forward or backwards to cancel out exchange rate gains. However, this solution is limited in its scope and will expire automatically in 2013. Also, it may be ineffective if exchange rcte changes do not even out over a reasonably short period. 9. The second problem arises when an otherwise active CFC spends money in one year to earn passive income in a different year. For instance, a retailer might decide to set up a consumer finance operation that will generate passive interest income. Money spent to set up 1 Tho" is overtaxation even when a CFC is partly active and would not pass the active business test. This is because gains are always fully taxed but losses are only deductible to the extent that the CFC is engaged in passive business. The options discussed in this Statement would address the problem for both wholly and partly active CFCs. 2 the operation (before any income flows in) would be non-deductible because the retailer would pass the active business test. Once financial income starts to be derived, the retailer will fail the active business test and the income will be fully taxed. The effect would be taxation on gross income rather than tax on net profits, and amounts to overtaxation by not allowing tax deductions for relevant expenditure. 10. The potential for overtaxation, caused by both problems, may discourage businesses from entering into sensible, commercially sound affangements. In the extreme, this may prevent the offshore expansion of New Zealand multinationals. More commonly, it will lead to companies using costly or unwieldy structures to avoid the overtaxation. It could also result in higher financing costs and greater expenses paid to accounting or legal professionals. 11. Businesses without access to tax advice and the means to create structures that avoid the current problems, might end up with overtaxation. The outcomes are not intuitive and so are less likely to be anticipated by people without comprehensive tax knowledge. 12. There are also businesses with arrangements that were already in progress when the new CFC rules were introduced. Avoiding overtaxation might involve costly restructuring for those entities, such as breaking fixed-term loans. OBJECTIVES 13. The main objective is to tax the passive profits of CFCs in a fair way. This means including the relevant passive income in the tax base, but also allowing tax deductions for related expenditure. This is in accordance with the general principle, applied in most instances in the Income Tax Act 2007, that taxable income in the case of a business is profit, not gross tumover. t4. rules. A secondary objective is simplicity for taxpayers and tax administrators applying the REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 15. We do not regard the status quo as a viable option because it would arbitranly overtax some taxpayers by a considerable amount. This overtaxation goes back to when the revised CFC rules were introduced in 2009- Any option would need to be rehospectively applied to address this concem. 16. We have identified the following preferred options to resolve each problem: a Preferred optionþr problem l: Tax gains on borrowings, such as exchange rate gains, only to the extent that a tax deduction for losses would otherwise be allowed. Preferred optionþr problem 2: Allow taxpayers to elect out of the active business test. This means tax deductions would be available for all expenditure incurred to earn passive income, but also that all passive income - even small amounts - would be taxable. 17. Both the preferred options provide fairer outcomes than the status quo. They seek to tax income and related expenditure in the same way, and to tax on the basis ofprofits rather than gross turnover. a J 18. The preferred option for problem one would be simpler to apply than the existing temporary solution, and apply in a wider range of circumstances. It should be very simple to apply for active businesses. 19. The preferred option for problem two involves some additional compliance costs for taxpayers. They would have to calculate income and deductions in some years where previously they did not. Efforts have been made in the detailed design of the policy to reduce these costs; for instance, the election not to apply the active business test is allowed on a per- CFC basis, rather than on a per-taxpayer basis (some taxpayers have many CFCs). Alternative solutions for problem L 20. We considered a number of other options for the problem of taxing gains on borrowing. In particular, we considered extending the existing interim solution, ignoring exchange rate gains and losses entirely, and exempting all borrowing-related gains of active businesses. 21. The existing interim solution is very complex. It involves separately identifying the exchange rate components of income or losses, and carrying the components forward or back to offset each other. It also has a narrow scope; that is, to limit side effects that might undermine the Govemment' s revenue. 22. Ignoring all exchange rate gains or losses was rejected as an option because of the unacceptable level of tax avoidance risk. It is a general requirement in our tax system that tax liabilities are to be calculated in New Zealand dollars. This principle was relaxed when CFC rules were first introduced in New Zealand. The result was the generation of artificial tax losses worth several hundreds of millions of dollars through the manipulation of currency gains and losses. The rules were quickly changed to require conversion to New Zealand dollars for all material amounts. 23. Exempting all borrowing-related gains of active CFCs would also not solve the whole problem. This is because even CFCs that do not pass the active business test, but have some active business, are overtaxed under the status quo. They are fully taxed on gains but get limited deductions for losses.2 The preferred option would deal with these cases, and partly tax the gains in the same way as losses are partly deducted. Alternative solutions for problem 2 24. We also considered a number of other options for the problem of there being no deduction for expenditure incurred in eaming active income in another year. We considered following an Australian-style approach. Broadly speaking this would mean calculating tax every year but carrying forward the income or loss in years where a business passes the active business test, rather than requiring the tax to be paid in those years. Úr addition, we considered a version of the preferred option in which ataxpayer, electing to opt out of the active business test, would have to do so for either, all of their CFCs, or none. These approaches were rej ected. 2 Deductions for interest expenditure are based on the proportion ofthe CFC's assets that generate passive income. If, say, 60Yooftheassetsgeneratepassiveincome,ó0%ofinterestdeductionsareallowed. \[ncontrast,withoutachangetothelaw 1 00% of exchange rate gains on a loan would be taxed. 4 25. If applied in a way that was fully symmetrical, an Australian-style approach would require a full tax calculation in each year by every taxpayt for every CFC, which would increase compliance costs significantly. The additional compliance cost could be reduced if a less symmetrical outcome is accepted. But, in the New Zealand context, this would amount to the introduction of an implicit subsidy for outbound direct investment that would be more than the removal of barriers that was intended by the 2009 CFC reforms. 26. An alternative version of the preferred option was initially proposed, requiring taxpayers to make a single election in respect of all of their CFCs. This was to prevent passive losses being shifted into entities that had made the election, while related income accumulated slowly in entities (active businesses) that had not. In consultation, it was indicated that this would be very difficult to comply with. The preferred option allows the election to be made for an individual CFC (or CFCs) and not others, but deals with the risk of loss-shifting by "ring-fencing" the loss to CFCs in respect of which an election has been made. That is, the loss cannot be used except by entities whose entire passive income (even small amounts) is taxable. 27. 'We note that the problems and options discussed in this Statement are likely to affect a relatively small number of taxpayers. These are mostly large corporatetaxpayers who have offshore operations and have taken out foreign currency loans via those operations, or have both active and passive lines of business. We do not envisage any social, environmental or cultural effects ofany ofthe options discussed. 28. The options discussed are summarised in the tables at the end of this document. CONSULTATION 29. There has been extensive consultation about the options discussed in this Statement. This has included consultation with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, through its tax committee, and with taxpayers who are directly affected. 30. As a result of the consultation, changes have been made to some of the options discussed in this paper. Mostly these changes are at the level of fine detail, but the option to allow people to opt out of the active business test was modified significantly because of consultation. In particular,the initial proposal was to require all companies in a group of companies to opt out of the active business test if any one member wished to opt out. This was felt to be impractical, particularly for groups with a large number of CFCs. The option has been changed so that a single CFC can opt out, but the use of the resulting losses is restricted (to the CFC itself or to other entities that have opted out). 31. People we have consulted with support the preferred option in this statement. There remain disagreements on some matters of detail, but those consulted have indicated that they do not wish these concerns to stand in the way of implementing the preferred option. 32. The Treasury agrees with the analysis and conclusions in this Statement. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 33. 'We have considered a number of options for making taxation of CFCs fairer. In partícular, we have looked at options to ensure gains on borrowing of an active business are taxed in the same way as losses on borrowing. 'We have also looked at ensuring that where 5 passive income of a CFC would be taxed, related expenditure would be deductible, even if not incurred in the same year as the income arises. 34. We recommend taxing gains on borrowing only to the extent that losses would be tax deductible. We also recommend allowing CFCs to be fully taxed on all their passive income, even small amounts, so that they can obtain tax deductions for all related expenditure. These options are recommended to be applied retrospectively. They would be fairer, relatively simple, comprehensive and balance additional compliance costs with protection of the Govemment's revenue. They have the support of the taxpaying community. IMPLEMENTATION 35. The options discussed in this paper would need to be legislated for. It is intended that they would be included as amendments to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is currently going through the Parliamentary process. 36. The preferred options could be implemented with minimal administrative implications, other than changes to documentation and training for Inland Revenue staff. They are at a level of detailthat means there would be no systems changes required. 37. Because the changes would be retrospective to prevent overtaxation in past years, there would be a small amount of work required to alter past tax positions. This would involve manual processing, and would be met within existing baselines and workloads. 38. Compliance costs for taxpayers will be reduced, in the case of the first preferred option, relative to the temporary solution that will soon expire. For taxpayers with CFCs engaged in active business, it will be common for no tax calculations to be required at all, even when there are exchange rate gains on borrowing. 39. Direct compliance costs for taxpayers will increase in the case of the second preferred option, but this is balanced against a fairer tax outcome (less overtaxation) and reduced impediments to efficient business structures. Some compliance costs are incurred to claim tax deductions for expenditure incurred and to track those deductions to ensure they are used by the right entity. The tracking is necessary to reduce the risk of the Govemment's tax revenue being undermined. MONITORING, EVALUATION A¡ID REVIEW 40. The options implemented would be monitored through Inland Revenue's normal audit and risk review procedures. 41. There are no plans for formal review of implementation. The changes are minor amendments in the scheme of the controlled foreign company rules. Any concerns about ineffectiveness following implementation could be raised by taxpayers through normal channels, including directly approaching the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue. 6 Table 1: Impacts of status quo and options (gains on borrowing) Yes.

Regulatory Impact Statement Insurance Income of Controlled Foreign Companies Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It addresses the question of whether the insurance business income of controlled foreign companies is being taxed as intended. Given that this is a base maintenance measure, consultation has been very limited to reduce any revenue risk. The limited consultation has not produced issues that have impacted the options considered in this Statement. The policy options identified in this Statement are likely to impose some additional costs on businesses, compared to the status quo. However, these additional costs relate to ensuring that appropnate tax is paid on passive profits derived by a controlled foreign company. It was always intended that such amounts would be taxed, and a change in this area would make the law work as intended. The option for retrospective change would involve the reversal of tax losses already claimed by taxpayers. This reversal of losses is consistent with the intent of the law to tax passive profits of controlled foreign companies. There are no appreciable social, environmental or cultural impacts anticipated. There are no other significant gaps, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The proposed option does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest, or override common law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 29 i0l4:ay 2012 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1 The question addressed in this Statement is whether the insurance business income of controlled foreign companies is being taxed as intended. 2. There is a problem with the taxation of interests in controlled foreign companies (CFCs). The income of CFCs that cany on a business of insurance and use reinsurance to reduce their risk is not fully taxed. To date, the problem has generated approximately $70 million of tax losses that do not represent real economic losses (this corresponds to $20 million in tax foregone). 3. The problem occurs mainly because income of a CFC is taxed only if it is listed in section EX 208 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Reinsurance income is not listed in that section A CFC in the business of insurance is very likely to have some reinsurance. At the same time, insurance claims paid out by the CFC are tax-deductible. 4. Some other types of insurance income of CFCs are also not taxed. 5. If the status quo is maintained, taxpayers would obtain windfall gains since the tax losses would be used to reduce the tax payable on other income. Further tax losses would also arise. OBJECTIVES 6. The first objective is to ensure that the CFC rules work as intended in respect of insurance business income (which is "passive income"). 7. The intent of the CFC rules is to tax the New Zealand owner of a CFC on the CFC's income, at the time it arises. However, only passive income, such as interest income, is taxed in this way. Active income (for example, income from manufacturing or retailing) is not taxed in New Zealand at the time it arises. 8. 'Where passive income is taxed, tax deductions are allowed for expenses incurred in earning passive income. This is to ensure thattaxatton is based on profit arising from passive activities (true income) rather than gross tumover. 2 Example: Overseas Ltd is a CFC that carries on an insurance business It receives premiums of $10 million and, because of a significant event, pays out claims of $50 million. It also pays a reinsurance premium of $5 million and makes a reinsurance claim for $40 million. Before tax, there is a net loss of $5 million ($10 million + $40 million - $5 million - $50 million). Because the reinsurance claim is not taxed, the tax measure of the loss is -$45 million ($10 million - $5 million - $50 million). 9. The second objective, which is related to the first, is to prevent the erosion of the government's revenue by collecting the appropriate amount of tax on CFC income. In the context of the problem that this Statement deals with, the appropriate amount of tax would not be collected if significanttax deductions were available for costs or losses that are not economically suffered. 10. The third objective is to retrospectively amend law only in unusual circumstances in order to give taxpayers certainty about the law whenever possible. In general, taxpayers should be able to rely on the law in force at the time that they enter into transactions or file tax returns. Retrospective changes to the law introduce uncertainty and can be seen as unfair to particulartaxpayers. The degree ofuncertaintydepends onthe scale and scope ofthe change, and the surrounding circumstances. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSTS 11. Two options for dealing with the problem have been identified Option 1 - a prospective law change that would tax all CFC income from a business of insurance; and Option 2 (preferred) - a retrospective law change that would tax all CFC income from a business of insurance. 12. Table I (çtage 5) lists the various impacts of the options, and their ability to meet the objectives stated in the previous section. None of the options would have appreciable social, environmental or cultural effects. 13. The prospective change in option 1 would allow taxpayers to keep windfall gains already obtained, while not allowinE any such windfalls in future. The retrospective change in option 2 would remove the ability of taxpayers to keep windfall gains already obtained and also not allow any such windfalls in future. 14. The retrospective change in option 2 would take away a tax benefit that has already arisen. However, that benefit is a windfall that results from a legislative oversight. It does not represent an economic loss and it is highly unlikely taxpayers would have been relying on the windfall when making investment decisions. In addition, the amount involved is significant (approximately $20 million of tax foregone). CONSULTATION 15. Taxpayers known to be affected were advised of the problem before filing returns. They were also informed of the possibility that the law would need to be changed to correct it. There was some brief discussion of the issues atthat time. The discussion did not give rise to any need to change the options considered in this Statement. 16. Consultation with other taxpayers beyond this group has not been undertaken in order to protect the tax base. 17. There may be further public consultation on the detail of legislative measures if a legislative change is pursued, to prevent unintended consequences. Typically this would a a 3 occur after a general announcement of the change, to limit the opportunity for exploitation of the gap in the tax rules. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 18. Officials recommend option 2, since the legislation would work as intended, government revenue would be protected and there are good policy grounds for a retrospective change that removes windfall gains. IMPLEMENTATION 19. The recommended option would require a legislative change. It is intended that such a change would be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing and Remedial Matters) 8i11, if time permits. 20. There would be minimal implementation required for either of the options. Systems changes should be limited to changes in training material and other documentation for Inland Revenue staff. 21. If the retrospective option is pursued there would be some reassessment of past income tax, which would be a manual exercise. On the basis of current information, this would involve only a small amount of work by Inland Revenue and will be met entirely within existing baselines and workloads. 22. We do not anticipate an appreciable ongoing increase in compliance costs for taxpayers. There may be a one-off cost to deal with the reassessment of past income tax if the retrospective option is pursued. W'e do not anticipatethat this would be significant in the context of other tax work. 23. The proposals for legislative change would ensure existing legislation works as intended. 24. The effectiveness of any change would be monitored through Inland Revenue's normal audit and risk assessment procedures. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 25. As explained in the previous section, the options for change would ensure that the legislation would work as originally intended. Its effects would be monitored through Inland Revenue's normal auditing and risk assessment of taxpayers. There is no intent to have a separate forrnal monitoring or review process for this initiative. 4 Table 1: Impacts of status quo and options Option 2: Retrospective change Yes.YesNo (tax returns, filed based on the law in place at the time, would be amended). $70 million loss will not be in baselines for the 2012 Budget, and forecasts will not include additional losses.Taxpayers will be taxed in line with their actual profit or loss. May discourage voluntary disclosure by taxpayers of unintended tax effects. None anticipated. Option 1: Prospective change Partially (passive profits properly assessed, but only in future). Partially (taxpayers can keep benefit of $70 million of unintended losses, but no more will arise). Yes $70 million loss will be in baselines for the 2012 Bldget, but forecasts will not include additional losses. Taxpayers will have a windfall gain of approximately $20 million. None anticipated None anticipated. Status quo No (passive profits not properly assessed because the reinsurance component of the insurance business is not included). No ($70 million of unintended tax losses not corresponding to real economic losses, and more could arise). N/A. $70 million tax loss will be in baselines for the 2012 Budget. Implicitly, forecasts will include further losses (though much less than $70 million unless there is another major event such as the Canterbury earthquakes). Taxpayers will have a windfall gain of approximately $20 million, and further (likely smaller) windfalls in future. None anticipated. None anticipated. Economic effects Compliance and Social, environmental cultural effects oCFC rules work as intended Revenue protected Retrospective change limited where possible X'iscal effects (note: the revenue effect, if all $70 million of losses were used up against taxable income, would be approximately $20 million). 5
Page 1 5 November 2012 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Changes to the controlled foreign company rules in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 The Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 makes a number of changes to the controlled foreign company rules to help them work as intended. One change brings all income from a business of insurance into the definition of passive income, to prevent unintended loss of revenue. Other changes allow the taxation of passive income and losses to be more symmetric, to prevent over-taxation. This special report provides early information for interested parties and precedes full coverage of the legislation that will be published in the Tax Information Bulletin. Income from an insurance business of a controlled foreign company Sections EX 20B(3)(f) and EZ 32E of the Income Tax Act 2007 Profits from a business of insurance of a controlled foreign company (a CFC) are generally taxable. However, certain types of insurance income, such as reinsurance claims income, were unintentionally omitted from the definition of “attributable income” in section EX 20B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. This means tax losses have arisen even though there are no economic losses. The new Act amends the definition of “attributable income” with retrospective effect, to include income from a business of insurance, however that income arises. Key features The definition of “attributable income” has been amended to include income from a business of insurance or from being an insurer, however that income arises. Where this leads to a retrospective liability for tax, any consequent use-of-money interest charge will be relieved. Detailed analysis Section EX 20B(3)(f) Section EX 20B(3)(f) has been amended to include income from a business of insurance, however that income arises. This includes reinsurance income, third-party recoveries and the like. Page 2 Income from a business of insurance is explicitly supplemented by income received by a person from being an insurer. The income would be included even if the insurer was an insurer for just one person and might not be considered to be “carrying on an insurance business” according to the ordinary meaning of that phrase. Section EZ 32E The change to section EX 20B is retrospective. As a consequence, tax liabilities for past years may arise and use-of-money interest could be imposed. Section EZ 32D relieves such interest if it arises. The interest is relieved if a person took a tax position before the enactment of the amendment, and the enactment results in an additional tax liability. Interest is not imposed on the relevant addition, for the period from the initial due date until the later of 30 June 2012 or a revised due date determined by Inland Revenue for the payment of the interest. Application date The amendments apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009, which corresponds with the application date for the reformed controlled foreign company rules. Amendments to make taxation of controlled foreign companies more symmetric Sections DN 4, DN 8, DZ 19, EX 18A, EX 20C, EX 20D, EX 21B, EX 73, EZ 32C, EZ 32D, IQ 2 and YA 1 (“election commencement year”, “elective attributing CFC”, “elective attributing FIF”) of the Income Tax Act 2007, and sections 21, 37 and 44 of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011. The controlled foreign company (CFC) rules were extensively reformed in 2009. A New Zealand resident with an income interest of more than 10% in a controlled foreign company is taxed on the passive profits earned by that company. Passive profits comprise passive income, such as interest and royalties, and deductions for related expenditure. To reduce compliance costs, there is also an “active business test”: a CFC’s profits are not taxed if the CFC’s gross passive income is less than 5% of its total income. In some cases the reformed rules are not working as they should, and income is being taxed while deductions for related expenditure are not being allowed. In particular:  Some CFCs that take out foreign currency loans to finance their active businesses are being taxed on foreign exchange gains on those loans, but are not allowed deductions if there are foreign exchange losses.  Some CFCs that incur expenditure in a year when they pass the active business test, to earn passive income in another year, are being taxed on the passive income but are not receiving deductions for the related expenditure. The Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act addresses these problems. Page 3 Key features When a CFC borrows money to fund its business, income from the loan will normally be taxable only if deductions would be allowed for expenditure on the loan. (Income from a loan would most commonly be an exchange rate gain on a foreign-currency loan.) A taxpayer may elect not to apply the active business test to a CFC, to enable more deductions to be claimed for expenditure incurred in earning passive income. Restrictions apply to the use of deductions when an election has been made. Application date The amendments apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009, which corresponds with the application date for the reformed controlled foreign company rules. Detailed analysis Section DN 4 Section DN 4 restricts the use of an attributed loss of CFC when the CFC is an “elective attributing CFC”. A CFC is an elective attributing CFC when the taxpayer has elected not to apply the active business test to the CFC under section EX 73. The first year that an election applies in respect of a CFC is called the CFC’s “election commencement year”. The policy principle underlying the legislation is that losses of an elective attributing CFC are tagged with the name of the CFC and the CFC’s election commencement year. The tagged losses may be used to reduce attributed CFC income, but only if the income comes from the same CFC which is still an elective attributing CFC (or FIF), or another elective attributing CFC (or FIF) with the same election commencement year. This condition applies in addition to the other, existing conditions for use of losses, such as jurisdictional ring-fencing. Unused tagged losses of a CFC are forfeited if the election made in respect of the CFC expires or is revoked. A new subsection (1B) has been added to section DN 4, to restrict the use of losses of elective attributing CFCs, in the way just described. Subsection (1) has also been rewritten to apply only to losses that are not from elective attributing CFCs; the effect of the rewritten provision is not intended to be different in any other respect from the original. Page 4 Example – loss of elective attributing CFC A taxpayer has the following amounts of attributed CFC income and loss for the 2015–16 income year: CFC A (United States), loss of $80 million CFC B (United States), income of $60 million CFC C (United States), income of $20 million CFC D (United States), income of $10 million CFC E (United States), loss of $35 million CFC F (Austria), income of $50 million CFC A, CFC B and CFC F are elective attributing CFCs and all have an election commencement year of 2013– 14. CFC D is an elective attributing CFC and has an election commencement year of 2014–15. CFC C and CFC E are not elective attributing CFCs. Subsection (1B) allows the taxpayer to use $60 million of CFC A’s loss, because CFC A and CFC B have the same election commencement year and there is $60 million of attributed CFC income from CFC B. CFC A’s loss may not be used to reduce CFC C’s income (because CFC C is not an elective attributing CFC), CFC D’s income (because CFC D has a different election commencement year), or CFC F’s income (because CFC F is not resident in the United States). The remaining $20 million of CFC A’s loss cannot be used under section DN 4 and must instead be used under subpart IQ. Subsection (1) allows the taxpayer to use $30 million of CFC E’s losses, because CFC E is not an elective attributing CFC, CFC C and CFC D are resident in the United States and the combined income of CFC C and CFC D is $30 million. The remaining $5 million of CFC E’s losses cannot be used to reduce income from CFC F because CFC F is not a United States company, and must instead be used under subpart IQ. Section DN 8 Section DN 8 makes changes having the same effect as the changes to section DN 4, except that they apply to FIF losses rather than attributed CFC losses. Section DZ 19 Section DZ 19 has been repealed retrospectively. It was a temporary measure and has been replaced by other measures in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act. (See changes to section EX 20C.) Section EX 18A Section EX 18A has been amended so that the taxpayer will calculate attributed CFC income or loss for a CFC if the CFC is an elective attributing CFC for the taxpayer. The attribution calculation will be undertaken even if the CFC would otherwise be a non- attributing active CFC under section EX 21B. Page 5 Section EX 20C Section EX 20C has been rewritten to change the tax treatment of a CFC’s income from a loan that provides funds to the CFC. Income from a loan would typically be the result of an exchange rate gain on a foreign-currency loan. In most cases, such income will be included in attributable income only to the extent that expenditure or loss relating to the loan would have been included (if there were any). That is, there will generally be symmetry between included income and included expenditure. Previously, the income was included completely. The rewording of the section is not intended to have any other effects. Subsection EX 20C(2) Subsection EX 20C(2) contains the formula for net attributable CFC income or loss: attributable CFC – apportioned funding income – apportioned funding costs – other deductions “Attributable CFC” less “apportioned funding income” is, generally speaking, the gross taxable income of the CFC. “Attributable CFC” is calculated in the same way as it has always been, but the subtraction of “apportioned funding income” is new. “Apportioned funding costs” and “other deductions” are, generally speaking, tax deductions of the CFC. They are calculated in the same way as they have always been, although some of the terminology in the relevant subsections has changed. Subsection EX 20C(3) Subsection EX 20C(3) defines apportioned funding income, which will not be attributed. Ordinarily, apportioned funding income will be determined by the formula: funding income × funding fraction × (1 – asset fraction) These terms are defined in more detail in subsections (5), (6) and (8). In broad terms, “funding income × funding fraction” is the amount of income from loans the CFC has taken out, after adjusting for any on-lending. Multiplication by 1 – asset fraction determines the portion of the income that relates to funding of active assets. This portion of the funding income is not taxable. In the same way, expenditure on the loan would be non-deductible if it related to the funding of active assets. If a CFC is carrying on a business of banking or insurance or is directly or indirectly controlled by someone who is, there is no apportioned funding income. Page 6 Subsection EX 20C(5) Subsection EX 20C(5) defines funding income, which appears in the equation in subsection (3). Funding income is income from a financial arrangement that provides funds to the CFC – income from a loan the CFC has taken out, in other words. There will not normally be income from a loan, but there can be if, for instance, the loan is in a foreign currency and there is an exchange rate gain on conversion to New Zealand dollars. Note that only income from financial arrangements is included. Contrast this with paragraph EX 20C(7)(a), which includes certain equity instruments as well as financial arrangements. The underlying assumption here is that a CFC will not have accrual income from equity instruments it has issued, though it may have deductible expenditure in some cases. Paragraph (b) prevents income from being funding income if the financial arrangement is expected to generate income. A key characteristic of a loan taken out is that it will result in expenditure, not income, over its term. If income is expected, it will be attributed. Exchange rates can vary significantly, and it is quite likely that there will be income in at least one year of a long-term financial arrangement, even though it is not clear which year. The test in paragraph (b) is not intended to catch such a case. Rather, the test is intended to catch cases in which net income is reasonably expected over a particular period that is predictable in advance, such as the entire term of the arrangement or a specific sub-period of the term. The test is applied when the CFC enters the arrangement and again if the terms of the financial arrangement are altered. It is an objective test. The intentions or expectations of the parties may be relevant, but it is a hypothetical reasonable person’s expectations that are being evaluated. Subsection EX 20C(6) Subsection EX 20C(6) calculates the item “funding fraction”. Funding fraction adjusts the amount of funding income to remove the effects of on-lending. That is, it makes an adjustment if the CFC has provided funding – implicitly out of the CFC’s own borrowings – to an associated CFC. The funding fraction is the proportion of funding which is not implicitly on-lent. It is compulsory to make the adjustment for on-lending when apportioned funding income is being calculated. “Funding fraction” also applies in the calculation of apportioned funding costs, but in that case it is optional to make an adjustment for on-lending. The difference between the cases of income and cost is due to incentives. In the case of apportioned funding costs, there is an incentive to adjust for on-lending. This will often increase the amount of expenditure that is fully deductible. However, taxpayers are given the option to forego the advantages of adjustment if, say, the calculations would be too costly. The risk that tax revenue will be undermined as a result of this choice is limited. Page 7 In contrast, in the case of apportioned funding income, the incentive is not to adjust for on- lending, because that will make more of the funding income tax-free. This would significantly increase the risks of tax revenue being undermined, particularly if choices were made to adjust for on-lending in the case of costs but not in the case of income. Taxpayers can voluntarily avoid different outcomes for costs and income by adjusting for on- lending in both cases. Example – calculation of funding fraction A CFC has taken out a $25 million interest-only loan to fund its active business. In 2013–14 the CFC has $10 million of funding income. Paragraph EX 20C(6)(c) gives a funding fraction of 1, because there is no on-lending (the item “group funding” is nil). In 2014–15 the CFC lends $15 million, also on interest-only terms, to an associated CFC. In 2015–16 the CFC has $10 million of funding costs and the CFC’s New Zealand owner decides to rely on paragraph EX 20C(6)(b) to reduce compliance costs. “Funding fraction” is 1. In 2016–17 the CFC has $10 million of funding income. “Funding fraction” is 0.4. Subsection EX 20C(8) Subsection EX 20C(8) calculates the item “asset fraction”, which is the fraction of the CFC’s assets that generate (gross) attributable income. On-lent amounts (see subsection (7)) are excluded from the calculation if they were excluded in subsection (6), and not otherwise. A similar fraction is used for calculating apportioned funding costs. However, in that case the fraction is modified if the CFC is excessively debt funded, so that the deductions of an excessively debt funded CFC would be more limited than those of another CFC. The intention of the excessive debt-funding limitation is to discourage excessive debt funding. It would be inconsistent with this intention to also limit the taxation of any income arising from the debt. Example – calculation of “asset fraction” In 2015–16 a CFC takes out a $10 million interest-only loan to fund its business. There is no on-lending. There is $1 million of income from the loan, owing to an exchange rate gain exceeding interest expense. By value, 80% of the CFC’s assets are used to derive an attributable CFC amount (passive income) and not to derive an amount that is not an attributable CFC amount. The asset fraction is therefore 0.8. The amount which can be subtracted as apportioned funding income is $200,000 and $800,000 remains attributable. Suppose that instead there was $1 million of expenditure on the loan, and that the CFC is excessively debt funded under section EX 20D with a cost fraction of 0.3. The cost fraction of 0.3 would be used to calculate the apportioned funding costs. Deductions of $300,000 would be attributed and $700,000 would be ignored. Page 8 Section EX 20D Section EX 20D has been amended consequential to the changes made to section EX 20C. Section EX 21B Section EX 21B has been amended so that no active business test is carried out for a CFC when the CFC is an elective attributing CFC for the taxpayer. Section EX 73 Section EX 73 is a new provision allowing the taxpayer to make an election. The taxpayer may elect not to apply the active business test to a CFC in which they have an income interest of 10% or more or to a FIF for which they use the attributable FIF income method. Subsection EX 73(1) A taxpayer may elect that a CFC or FIF in which they hold an income interest is an “elective attributing CFC” or “elective attributing FIF” (terms which are defined in section YA 1). The active business test in section EX 21B is not applied to such a CFC or FIF, and there is a full calculation of attributable income. The election may be made only if the active business test would be applied; that is, only if it is for a CFC in which the person has a 10% or greater income interest, or for a FIF for which the attributed FIF income method is used. Subsection EX 73(2) A CFC or FIF may not be an elective attributing CFC or FIF if it carries on a business of banking or insurance or is controlled by somebody who does. Such entities are in any case extremely unlikely to be non-attributing active CFCs. In addition, a CFC may not be an elective attributing CFC if it qualifies for the Australian exemption in section EX 22. Subsections EX 73(3) and (4) An election under section EX 73 is normally effective from the beginning of the income year following the notice of election. That is, elections must be prospective. This is to minimise the likelihood of elections being made only in cases in which a loss arises. There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, because section EX 73 applies for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009, it is possible to make a retrospective election. A retrospective election must be made by the end of the income year in which the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act receives Royal assent, or at a later time if Inland Revenue allows it. The expectation is that Inland Revenue would allow a late election only in extraordinary circumstances, such as when the taxpayer’s income year ends very soon after the date of Royal assent. When made, the election applies from the beginning of the first income year beginning on or after 1 July 2009, for a CFC or 1 July 2011, for a FIF. Page 9 Secondly, Inland Revenue has some general discretion to allow a late election. The expectation is that this general discretion would be rarely used, such as when a late election was due to factors beyond the taxpayer’s control, and not in circumstances in which the election was made merely because a loss actually arose during the year. Subsections EX 73(5) to (8) An election under section EX 73, once it applies, is effective until it is revoked or expires. If it is revoked by the taxpayer or it expires, it ceases to be effective from the beginning of the income year in which it is revoked or expires. In general, it is not intended that taxpayers will revoke elections. The concern here is that an election will be revoked after attributed deductions have been taken but before the related attributable income arises, leading to under-taxation. However, revocation is possible if it is extremely unlikely that any related attributable income will arise after the revocation. For instance, revocation might be allowed if deductions were taken for exchange rate losses on a bank deposit, and the deposit was subsequently withdrawn and paid out as a dividend. In such a case, it is extremely unlikely that any more attributable income would arise from the deposit. For the revocation to be effective, it must not be made for a purpose or effect of reducing a tax liability, and Inland Revenue must agree to the revocation in writing. With two exceptions, an election expires automatically if the CFC ceases to be a CFC in which the taxpayer holds an income interest of 10% or more or if the FIF ceases to be a FIF for which the taxpayer uses the attributable FIF income method. Note that a FIF that qualifies for the Australian exemption in section EX 35 is no longer a FIF for which the attributable FIF income method is used, which will trigger expiry of the election. Other exemptions from the FIF rules will have the same effect. The first exception occurs when a CFC in which the taxpayer holds an interest of 10% or more becomes a FIF for which the taxpayer uses the attributable FIF income method (for instance, if the taxpayer maintains a holding of 20% in the foreign company but an unrelated non-resident acquires the remaining 80% interest). In that case, the election continues to be effective but is treated as having been made for the FIF. The election commencement date is unchanged. The second exception occurs in the reverse case, when a FIF for which the taxpayer uses the attributable FIF income method becomes a CFC in which the taxpayer has an income interest of more than 10% and which is not a non-attributing Australian CFC. Again, the election continues to be effective, but is treated as having been made for the CFC with no change to the election commencement date. The election also expires automatically if the foreign company carries on a business of banking or insurance or is controlled by someone who does, or if a CFC becomes eligible for the Australian exemption in section EX 22. Page 10 Subsection EX 73(9) Any CFC or FIF losses attributed to a taxpayer who was subject to an election under section EX 73 for the CFC or FIF, and have been carried forward under subpart IQ, are forfeited when the election is revoked or expires. The relevant losses (those implicitly tagged with the name of the CFC or FIF and an election year) are not carried forward from the previous year into the year in which the revocation or expiry is effective. Any losses arising from the CFC or FIF in the year that an election ceases to be effective are either normal attributed losses under sections DN 4 or DN 8, if the losses are required to be attributed, or are not recognised at all. Example – effect of revoking an election In 2013–14 a taxpayer makes an election under section EX 73 in respect of a CFC. There is an attributed loss of $1.3 million in 2014–15, which is carried forward under subpart IQ. In 2015–16 there is attributed income of $0.6 million, which reduces the carried forward loss to $0.7 million. In 2016–17 an attributed loss of $0.4 million would be calculated. Suppose that in 2016–17 the taxpayer sets up a banking business, so that the election expires. The remaining $0.7 million of historical losses are not carried forward to 2016–17. However, the attributed loss of $0.4 million is recognised as an ordinary attributed loss and may be used under section DN 4, including by carrying it forward under subpart IQ via section DN 4(3). Suppose instead that in 2016–17 the CFC becomes Australian resident and qualifies for the exemption in section EX 22. The remaining $0.7 million of historical losses are not carried forward to 2016–17, and the $0.4 million current-year loss is ignored. When one of the exceptions in paragraphs EX 73(7)(a) or (b) applies, the tagged losses of the elective attributing CFC or FIF become tagged losses of the elective attributing FIF or CFC respectively, with no change to the date they were incurred. This is to ensure that if the election does subsequently expire, all losses – whether arising before or after the change from CFC to FIF (or vice versa) – are forfeited. Subsection EX 73(10) After an election is revoked or expired, it will usually not be possible to make another election in respect of the CFC or FIF. This is to prevent CFCs or FIFs from entering and exiting the tax system in a way that would result in recognition of deductions and non- recognition of related income. However, following expiry another election may be made if certain conditions are met, and if Inland Revenue agrees to the new election. The expiry must have been due to an oversight, and notice of the new election must be made within a reasonable period. More importantly, the new election must not be made with a purpose of allowing deductions to be attributed – at any time – without the attribution of corresponding income – also at any time. Page 11 It is not expected that Inland Revenue would agree to a new election in many cases, but there could be unusual cases in which it would be appropriate to be able to make a second election. Example – a second election In 2013–14 a taxpayer makes an election under section EX 73 in respect of a CFC. In 2016–17 the directors of the CFC hold some board meetings in New Zealand while participating in trade shows here. They are unaware of the tax consequences of these meetings, one of which is that the CFC becomes a New Zealand resident. However, this is an isolated occurrence and the company ceases to be New Zealand resident soon after. There is no real change in the activities or balance sheet of the company over its period of residence. In 2017–18 the taxpayer asks to make a second election in respect of the CFC under section EX 73. In deciding whether to agree to an election, Inland Revenue might take into account that: any losses attributed while the first election was active were forfeited; the company was subject to full taxation during its period of New Zealand residence; there was no obvious change in the business of the CFC or its assets or liabilities while it was resident; and the directors were unaware of the tax consequences of the New Zealand meetings. Subsection EX 73(11) Subsection EX 73(11) is an anti-avoidance provision, to prevent multiple elections and revocations or expiries by the transfer of a CFC interest between associated persons. If a person has made an election in respect of a CFC or FIF and the election has expired or been revoked, an associated person will not be able to make an election in respect of that foreign company unless Inland Revenue agrees. Inland Revenue must be satisfied that the election has not been made with a purpose of allowing deductions to be attributed without the attribution of corresponding income. There may be cases in which associated persons quite legitimately make elections in relation to a single CFC. It seems more likely that these would involve individuals rather than companies. Example – election by an associated person A parent makes and revokes an election for a CFC and then, on retirement many years later, transfers the CFC interest to an adult child who was previously not involved in the investment. Acting completely independently, the adult child wishes to make an election for the CFC, and satisfies Inland Revenue that this will not lead to deductions being attributed when corresponding income is not. Page 12 Subsection EX 73(12) Notices of election or revocation under section EX 73 must be made in writing, and provided to Inland Revenue using the prescribed form and by the prescribed means. The current procedure is to send a letter with the relevant details in it to competent.authority@ird.govt.nz. For an initial election, the CFC or FIF in question should be identified, as should the period for which the election is made. For revocations or elections for which agreement is sought, further information will be required to satisfy Inland Revenue that the relevant conditions are met. Section EZ 32C Section EZ 32C, which was a temporary provision to allow certain exchange rate losses and gains of CFC to be offset, has been repealed with retrospective effect. It has effectively been made redundant in any case by the addition of the item “apportioned funding income” to section EX 20C(2). The effect of the retrospective repeal is that section EZ 32C never applies. Section EZ 32D Section EZ 32D is a transitional provision for CFCs that have income from borrowed funds. As a result of changes discussed in this report, income from such borrowed funds may be subtracted from attributable income under section EX 20C(2). However, in calculating the amount of income to be subtracted, usually no account is taken of excessive debt-funding of the CFC. This can lead to a higher proportion of income being attributed but a lower proportion of corresponding deductions being allowed. In most cases this is intentional and designed to discourage excessive debt-funding (see the discussion of amendments to section EX 20C(8) elsewhere in this report). There are some cases, though, in which existing loans were taken out before the new CFC rules came into force in 2009. Under the old CFC rules, it is probable that the income and deductions were treated similarly: either both completely within the tax base or both completely outside of it, regardless of the level of debt. To provide some continuity in such cases, a taxpayer who has taken out loans before 21 June 2012 may take excessive debt- funding into account for those loans. To apply section EZ 32D, the taxpayer effectively undertakes two calculations under subsection EX 20C(3)(b)(ii) for the CFC and adds the results together, instead of undertaking a single calculation under that subsection. The first calculation is for funding income that relates to old funding arrangements – those entered into before 21 June 2012. The calculation under subsection EX 20C(3)(b)(ii) has been modified so that excessive debt-funding is taken into account, by using the item “cost fraction” instead of the item “asset fraction”. Page 13 The second calculation is for the remaining funding income, and uses the item “asset fraction” as normally. Example – transitional rule for excessively debt-funded CFCs A taxpayer has a CFC that took out a $100 million loan in 2007–08. The outstanding balance of the loan in 2013–14 is $US65 million. The CFC takes out another loan in 2013–14 of US$40 million. In 2013–14 there is $6.5 million of funding income from the old loan and $4.0 million of funding income from the new loan. The CFC’s asset fraction is 0.6 but the CFC is excessively debt-funded and its cost fraction under section EX 20D is 0.4. The CFC has not lent money to anybody. Under section EZ 32D, apportioned funding income is calculated in two parts. First, there is apportioned funding income from the old loan of $6.5 million × 1 × (1 – 0.4) = $3.9 million, because the excessive debt funding is taken into account and the cost fraction is used. And secondly there is apportioned funding income from the new loan of $4.0 million × 1 × (1 – 0.6) = $1.6 million, because excessive debt funding is not taken into account and the asset fraction must be used. The total amount of apportioned funding income, which will be subtracted in the attribution formula in section EX 20C(2), is $5.5 million. Section IQ 2 Section IQ 2 has been amended to restrict the use of a CFC loss or a FIF loss when the CFC or FIF is an elective attributing CFC or FIF. Subsection (1) has been rewritten to apply only to losses that are not from elective attributing CFCs or FIFs. The effect of the rewritten provision is not intended to be different in any other respect from the original. Subsection (1BA) has been added to section IQ 2 to restrict the use of losses of an elective attributing CFC or FIF. The amount of loss that may be used to reduce an income tax liability is limited to the amount of attributed income from elective attributing CFCs or FIFs having the same election commencement year as the CFC or FIF. Subsection (1BA), like subsection (1), also requires that the income be from CFCs or FIFs resident in the jurisdiction where the CFC or FIF was resident when the losses arose. Page 14 Example – use of carried forward losses of elective attributing CFCs A taxpayer wholly owns four CFCs: CFC A, United States, elective attributing CFC, election commencement year is 2013–14 CFC B, United States, elective attributing CFC, election commencement year is 2013–14 CFC C, United States, not an elective attributing CFC CFC D, Portugal, elective attributing CFC, election commencement year is 2013–14 Losses are carried forward to 2014–15 under subpart IQ as follows: Losses of elective attributing CFCs: $12 million (United States, CFC A, 2013–14) Other CFC losses: $3 million (United States) And there is CFC attributed income for 2014–15: CFC A, $7 million CFC B, $1 million CFC C, $5 million CFC D, $7 million $8 million of the $12 million loss that came from CFC A may be used to reduce income, because CFC A and CFC B have the same election commencement year as CFC A, are resident in the United States, and generate combined attributed income of $8 million. The remaining $4 million of loss is carried forward as a loss of the elective attributing CFC to 2015–16. The $3 million loss that is not a loss of an elective attributing CFC may be used entirely, because CFC C is resident in the United States and has income of $7 million. (See the discussion of amendments to sections DN 4 and DN 8 for more background information.) Section YA 1 (election commencement year, elective attributing CFC, elective attributing FIF) Section YA 1 defines the terms “election commencement year”, “elective attributing CFC” and “elective attributing FIF”. Their use has been described elsewhere in this report. An elective attributing CFC (or FIF) is an elective attributing CFC (or FIF) only for an interest holder who has made an election under section EX 73. Another holder of an interest in the same CFC who has not made an election does not treat the CFC as an elective attributing CFC. Similarly, the election commencement year of a particular elective attributing CFC is the election commencement year only for the interest holder who made the election.
Page 1 5 November 2012 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Canterbury earthquake-related measures in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 This special report provides early information on several Canterbury earthquake-related amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act enacted on 2 November 2012. This special report precedes full coverage of the new legislation that will be published in a Tax Information Bulletin later this year. Depreciation Sections EE 22, EE 45(8) and EZ 23B to EZ 23G, of the Income Tax Act 2007 Following the February 2011 earthquake in Canterbury, taxpayers have begun to receive insurance or compensation payments, and to re-establish business or income-earning activities. This has highlighted some particular problems, largely relating to the income tax rules for asset depreciation, the taxation of insurance proceeds that are not received or cannot be used in the conventional way, and the repair or abandonment of damaged buildings and other assets. Many of these problems have arisen because of the scale of earthquake damage to a significant number of capital assets, which has affected the way insurance claims are being processed and paid. With some exceptions, the focus of the changes contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters Act) 2012 is to provide temporary, time-limited earthquake relief and assistance, as reflected in the application dates of some of the provisions. Key features Changes to the depreciation rules:  provide optional matching rules to smooth the timing of income and deductions/disposal losses when insurance proceeds have been received for earthquake-damaged depreciable assets;  align the tax treatment of depreciable assets that are uneconomic to repair with the treatment of depreciable assets that have been “irreparably damaged” or are “useless for earning income” for tax purposes; Page 2  limit the depreciation recovery income that arises under the tax rules when insurance proceeds have been received for a damaged asset that is repairable to the amount of depreciation deductions previously claimed for the asset;  address minor technical issues with the pool depreciation rules; and  allow a depreciation deduction in relation to depreciable property when access to the property is temporarily restricted as a result of a Canterbury earthquake. Detailed analysis Consideration when depreciable property is irreparably damaged or rendered useless Section EE 45(8) has been amended to ensure that the amount derived from a depreciable asset that is irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income includes any proceeds from its disposal – for example, any scrap value. Previously, the provision stated that the amount derived from disposal of the asset was the amount of insurance, indemnity or compensation received and did not take into account any disposal proceeds. Application date The amendment applies for the 2011–12 and later income years. This includes taxpayers who have been granted an extension of time for filing an income tax return for the 2010–11 income year under the Canterbury Earthquake (Inland Revenue Acts) Order 2011. Damaged depreciable property that is uneconomic to repair New section EZ 23C provides for the deemed disposal and reacquisition of assets which are damaged in a Canterbury earthquake and uneconomic to repair. The tax depreciation rules do not provide an appropriate outcome when an asset has been damaged in a Canterbury earthquake and the insurer considers it to be uneconomic to repair (and requiring replacement), even though the asset may be physically repairable. This is because the current rules make a distinction between assets that are repairable and those that are irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income. Assets that are uneconomic to repair are generally included in the former category. The consequence is that a taxpayer may face a significant unexpected tax liability when an insurance amount is received, as a result of the application of section EE 52. Section EE 52 treats as taxable any insurance proceeds in excess of an asset’s adjusted tax value and expenditure on repairing the asset. This means that an amount greater than the depreciation deductions previously claimed for the asset may be treated as taxable. By contrast, for an asset that is irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income, the depreciation rules cap depreciation recovery income at the amount of previous depreciation deductions. Page 3 In addition, the depreciation “roll-over relief” rule in section EZ 23B, which was developed last year as a response to the Canterbury earthquakes to give taxpayers the ability to defer any depreciation recovery income, applies only to irreparably damaged assets or buildings that are rendered useless for the purpose of deriving income. Accordingly, amendments have been made to align the treatment of assets that are uneconomic to repair with the existing treatment under the depreciation rules of assets that are irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income. This recognises that assets that are uneconomic to repair in the context of the Canterbury earthquakes are, in substance, very similar to assets that are physically irreparable and therefore should receive similar treatment under the depreciation rules. This objective is achieved through new section EZ 23C which treats assets that are uneconomic to repair as being disposed of for the amount of insurance received for the asset, on the date of the Canterbury earthquake that caused the asset to be uneconomic to repair. This deemed disposal ensures that section EE 48 in the depreciation rules (which applies to irreparably damaged assets) also applies to assets that are uneconomic to repair. The criteria for an asset to be subject to deemed disposal and reacquisition under section EZ 23C are:  The depreciable asset is damaged by a Canterbury earthquake, as that term is defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011.  The owner of the asset is entitled to an amount of insurance or compensation for the damage to the item.  The asset has been assessed by the insurer as uneconomic to repair.  The damage has not caused the asset to be irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income in accordance with section EE 47(4). The term “Canterbury earthquakes” is defined broadly in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 as “any earthquake in Canterbury on or after 4 September 2010, and includes any aftershock”. Accordingly, when assets have sustained cumulative damage through multiple earthquakes and aftershocks, taxpayers can use the date of the earthquake which caused the asset to be damaged to the extent that it is uneconomic to repair as the relevant date of the deemed disposal and reacquisition under section EZ 23C. The asset is treated as being reacquired on the same date as the deemed disposal for nil consideration. This is to ensure that post-earthquake repairs are correctly capitalised (and not treated as deductible expenditure). Roll-over relief for income tax liabilities arising from the receipt of insurance for earthquake- damaged assets has been extended to assets that are subject to a deemed disposal and reacquisition under section EZ 23C by an amendment to section EZ 23B. Section EZ 23C overrides section EE 52, which means that for an asset meeting the criteria for section EZ 23C to apply, section EE 52 will not apply. The deemed disposal and reacquisition under section EZ 23C is not treated as a disposal or reacquisition for the purposes of the land provisions (sections CB 6 to 23). Page 4 Example A building has a cost of $5 million, accumulated depreciation deductions of $4 million and an adjusted tax value (ATV) of $1 million. It is damaged in a Canterbury earthquake and the insurance company decides it has an obligation under the insurance policy to replace it at a cost of $10 million because it is no longer fit for purpose and is uneconomic to repair. The damaged building is retained by the insured party and put to another, less productive, use. The building meets the criteria for section EZ 23C to apply. Therefore, the building is treated as being disposed of and reacquired for nil consideration on the date of the earthquake which caused the asset to be uneconomic to repair. As the building is treated as having been disposed of, the owner of the asset can apply the matching rule in section EZ 23F to smooth the timing of income calculated under section EE 48. Under section EE 48, the result will be: Original cost: $5,000,000 Depreciation deductions: $4,000,000 ATV: $1,000,000 Amount item disposed for (consideration): $10,000,000 Depreciation recovery income: $4,000,000 Capital gain: $5,000,000 Roll-over relief (under section EZ 23B) is available to the building owner for the $4 million of depreciation recovery income. Application date This Canterbury earthquakes-specific amendment applies for the 2010–11 to 2015–16 income years. The Commissioner may exercise the discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend an assessment. Cap on depreciation recovery income New section EZ 23D limits depreciation recovery income calculated under section EE 52 to the amount of depreciation deductions previously taken, when insurance proceeds are received for a repairable damaged asset. Section EE 52 provides that when insurance proceeds are received for damage to a repairable depreciable asset, the proceeds are taxable to the extent they exceed the cost of any repairs and the asset’s adjusted tax value. As noted above, this means that the tax rules may end up taxing more than the amount of earlier depreciation deductions allowed for the asset. In the context of the Canterbury earthquakes, this means that taxpayers may face significant unanticipated income tax liabilities in relation to damaged (but repairable) assets. The cap on depreciation recovery income determined under section EE 52 is confined to depreciable assets damaged by a Canterbury earthquake (as defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011), the damage does not cause the asset to be irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income, and section EZ 23C does not apply to the asset. Page 5 Example A building costing $5 million was damaged in a Canterbury earthquake but is repairable. The building has an adjusted tax value of $1 million, with depreciation deductions of $4 million taken. Insurance proceeds of $7 million are received, with $1 million of the proceeds being spent on repairing the asset. Section EZ 23C does not apply because the asset is not uneconomic to repair. Under section EE 52, the depreciation recovery income would be $5 million. However, section EZ 23D caps the amount of depreciation recovery income at $4 million. The remaining $1 million is treated as a capital gain. Application date This Canterbury earthquakes-specific amendment applies for the 2010–11 to 2015–16 income years. The Commissioner may exercise the discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend an assessment. Optional timing rule for income and deductions when insurance proceeds are received for earthquake-damaged, irreparable depreciable assets New section EZ 23F provides an optional rule to smooth the timing of income and deductions when insurance proceeds have been received for depreciable property that has been irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. The timing rule also applies to depreciable assets that are uneconomic to repair and to which section EZ 23C applies. The rule applies to individual items of depreciable property, in line with the general approach under the depreciation rules. The policy intent is that the matching rule allows the net amount of:  insurance payments  disposal proceeds less  the write-off of the tax book value; and  expenditure on disposing of the asset as determined under section EE 48 to be brought to account for tax purposes by a taxpayer. The timing rule may be used for a depreciable asset when:  The asset is damaged by a Canterbury earthquake as that term is defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011.  The damage causes the asset to be irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income and thus meets the requirements of section EE 47(4) or causes the asset to be subject to a deemed disposal and reacquisition under section EZ 23C.  The owner is entitled to insurance or compensation for the damage.  The owner chooses to apply the timing rule to all their depreciable assets meeting the above requirements. Page 6 The timing rule provides that any income or deductions are recognised at the earlier of:  when insurance proceeds, the cost of and proceeds from disposing of the asset have been derived or incurred or are able to be reasonably estimated; or  the 2015–16 income year. Whether insurance proceeds and other amounts can be reasonably estimated is essentially a question of fact, which will depend on the individual circumstances of each case. However, it is envisaged that some form of documentation would be required – for example, a written quote from an insurer. Section EZ 23F overrides the timing rules in sections EE 1, EE 22 and EE 48. The section can also be applied to assets depreciated in a pool. A person who opts to use the matching rule must use it for all their items of depreciable property that meet the criteria for applying the rule. This is to prevent taxpayers “cherry- picking” the assets to which they apply the rule. A taxpayer’s decision to elect into the matching rule will be reflected in the tax position they take in their return of income for each tax year – no prior notice of election is required. Example Equipment originally costing $10,000 is irreparably damaged in a Canterbury earthquake. The asset’s tax book value is $7,000, with $3,000 of accumulated depreciation deductions. The disposal costs are reasonably estimated to be $1,000 in 2012–13. The insurance proceeds received for the asset are reasonably estimated in 2013–14 as being $9,000. The equipment has a scrap value of $100, which is reasonably estimated in 2012–13. Applying the matching rule, any income or deductions are recognised in the 2013–14 income year, as this is when the insurance proceeds, disposal costs and disposal proceeds can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, in the 2013–14 income year, section EE 48 applies to determine the amount of depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss. Application date This Canterbury earthquakes-specific amendment applies for the 2010–11 to 2015–16 income years. The Commissioner may exercise the discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend an assessment. Optional timing rule for income and deductions when insurance proceeds are received for depreciable property that is damaged but repairable New section EZ 23G introduces an optional rule to smooth the timing of income and deductions when insurance proceeds have been received for a depreciable asset that has been damaged in a Canterbury earthquake but is repairable. The rule is broadly similar to section EZ 23F in design. Page 7 The timing rule may be used for a depreciable asset when:  The asset is damaged by a Canterbury earthquake as that term is defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011.  The asset is not irreparably damaged or rendered useless for earning income and therefore does not meet the requirements of section EE 47(4) and the asset is not subject to a deemed disposal and reacquisition under section EZ 23C.  The owner is entitled to insurance or compensation for the damage.  The owner chooses to apply the timing rule to all their depreciable assets meeting the above requirements. The timing rule provides that any income or deductions are recognised at the earlier of:  when insurance proceeds and the cost of repairing the asset have been derived or incurred or are able to be reasonably estimated; or  the 2015–16 income year. Section EZ 23G overrides the timing rules in sections CG 4, EE 22 and EE 52. The section is also applicable to assets depreciated in a pool. Example Machinery originally costing $100,000 is damaged in a Canterbury earthquake. The asset’s adjusted tax value (ATV) is $60,000, with $40,000 of accumulated depreciation deductions. The insurance proceeds are estimated in 2011–12 as being $110,000. Repair costs are estimated in 2012–13 to be $20,000 and $10,000 is actually incurred in each of 2012–13 and 2013–14. Applying the matching rule, any income or deductions are recognised in the 2012–13 income year, as this is when the insurance proceeds and total repair costs can reasonably be estimated. Accordingly, in the 2012–13 income year, sections CG 4 and EE 52 apply. The repair costs are deductible under the general deductibility rules. Section CG 4 treats $20,000 of the insurance proceeds as taxable, as this is the amount of insurance proceeds which recovers deductible expenditure. Section EE 52 applies to the insurance proceeds as follows: ATV of $60,000 less ($110,000 – $20,000) = ($30,000) Accordingly, the ATV is reduced to nil and depreciation recovery income under section EE 52 is $30,000. Amendments to the pool depreciation rules Section EE 22 has been amended to address some minor technical issues with the depreciation rules for pool assets, arising from the Canterbury earthquakes. Page 8 A new subsection (2B) has been included to ensure that when a person receives insurance proceeds for damage caused to an asset included in a pool, any insurance proceeds that are more than the expenditure the person has incurred in repairing the asset is subtracted from the pool’s adjusted tax value. The rationale is to align the treatment of damaged pool assets more closely with the treatment of non-pool assets under the depreciation rules. Under the general depreciation rules, insurance proceeds received that are more than the repair costs incurred for a damaged asset reduce the asset’s adjusted tax value. Section EE 22(3) has been amended to clarify that insurance proceeds are included as an amount derived from the disposal of an asset included in a pool, and to ensure that any excess of the insurance proceeds over disposal costs or loss is subtracted from the pool’s adjusted tax value on the date of disposal. Again, this aligns the pool depreciation rules more closely with the general depreciation rules. Application date These generic amendments apply for the 2011–12 and later income years. However, for a person who is granted an extension of time for filing an income tax return for the 2010–11 income year under the Canterbury Earthquake (Inland Revenue Acts) Order 2011, the amendments apply for the 2010–11 and later income years. Property that is available for use For an item of property to be depreciated, the item must be used in a business or available for use. It was unclear how this rule should be applied when access to depreciable property was temporarily restricted following a Canterbury earthquake. To clarify the tax treatment in this case, new section EZ 23E treats an item of property as being available for use while access to the property is temporarily restricted due to the effects of a Canterbury earthquake (as defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011), if the following conditions are met:  The item was used or available for use immediately before the restriction was imposed.  The item would be used or available for use in the absence of the restriction.  The income year is the 2015–16 or an earlier income year. This amendment allows businesses to continue to have depreciation deductions for their depreciable property even though it is temporarily unavailable for use as a result of a Canterbury earthquake. Application date This amendment applies for the 2010–11 to the 2015–16 income years. Correction of minor drafting error in roll-over relief provision An incorrect cross-reference in section EZ 23B(2)(b) has been amended. The reference to “subsection (7)” has been changed to “subsection (8)”. Application date This generic amendment applies from 4 September 2010, the date section EZ 23B came into force. Page 9 Timing of insurance receipts for expenditure or loss Section CG 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Previous legislation was developed on the assumption that expenditure incurred on, for example, repairing a damaged asset, would be incurred (and the expense taken as a deduction) before insurance proceeds were received. It was therefore not clear how the legislation would operate if an insurance payout was made before expenditure had been incurred on repairing a damaged asset. Key feature An insurance receipt which recovers deductible expenditure will be taxable irrespective of whether the insurance is received before or after the expenditure has been incurred. Detailed analysis Previous legislation was based on the assumption that expenditure incurred on, for example, repairing a damaged asset, would be incurred (and the expense taken as a deduction) before insurance proceeds were received. This was consistent with the normal insurance model, where the insurer either undertakes the repairs or reimburses the policyholder after they have undertaken repairs on the affected property. However, in the context of the Canterbury earthquakes, it has been common for insurers to make insurance payouts before the policyholder undertakes the relevant repairs. The problem with the previous wording of section CG 4 was that it was not clear if it operated when insurance payouts were made before expenditure is incurred on repairing a damaged asset. If the section did not operate in these situations, it could mean there would be a reduction in the damaged asset's adjusted tax value instead, under section EE 52 of the tax depreciation rules. Furthermore, if an amount of insurance was received that was greater than the adjusted tax value, section EE 52 would treat the excess as taxable income upfront, without taking into account repairs undertaken at a later time. In other words, the compensation payment would be treated as depreciation recovered rather than a recovery of the future expenditure on repairs. Accordingly, the wording of section CG 4 has been amended to resolve this problem. Section CG now provides that an insurance receipt which relates to deductible expenditure is taxable irrespective of whether the insurance is received before or after the repair expenditure is incurred. In cases when insurance proceeds are received before repair costs are incurred, and those costs are incurred in more than one income year, any income from insurance proceeds must be recognised in each income year that the repair costs are incurred. Application date This generic amendment applies for the 2011–12 and later income years. However, for a person who is granted an extension of time for filing an income tax return for the 2010–11 income year under the Canterbury Earthquake (Inland Revenue Acts) Order 2011, the amendment applies for the 2010–11 and later income years. Page 10 Business interruption insurance: timing of derivation Section CG 5B of the Income Tax Act 2007 Under the previous legislation, if a person received an amount of insurance, indemnity, or compensation for an interruption or impairment of business activities following an event, any income arising was allocated to the earlier of the income year in which the amount was reasonably estimated or, in case of interim payments, when they were received. On this basis, if an insurer estimated in an earlier income year a loss of income for a number of future income years, the entire estimated amount would be allocated to that earlier income year. This result is inconsistent with the general tax and accounting practice of allocating income on an accrual basis. Key feature Income derived under a business interruption insurance policy is now allocated to the later of the income year to which the replaced income relates or the income year the amount is reasonably estimated (or, in case of interim payments, when they are received). Detailed analysis Section CG 5B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended so that income derived under a business interruption insurance policy is allocated to the later of:  the income year to which the replaced income relates; or  the earlier of – – the income year in which the amount is received; or – the income year in which the amount is reasonably able to be estimated. The amendment ensures an entire estimated income amount for a number of future years is not allocated to an earlier income year. The income derived under a business interruption insurance policy is allocated to the period the income relates to if the income relates to future income years only. If the income relates to past income years, it will continue to be allocated to the income year in which the amount is either received or reasonably estimated. This is to avoid complex compliance and administrative costs involved in amending past years’ income tax returns. Application date This generic amendment applies for the 2011–12 and later income years. However, for a person who is granted an extension of time for filing a return of income for the 2010–11 income year under the Canterbury Earthquake (Inland Revenue Acts) Order 2011, the amendment applies for the 2010–11 and later income years. Page 11 Business interruption insurance for a replacement property and capital contribution Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Previously, if a person received a business interruption insurance payment for a replacement property to restart or continue their business operations, the payment was not recognised in the person’s taxable income as it is of a capital nature. Also the person could claim full depreciation deductions for the cost of the replacement property even though they had not paid for the replacement property. Allowing the person to capitalise and claim full depreciation deductions for the total cost of the new replacement property was not consistent with the policy to only allow depreciation deductions for the cost of the property which is actually borne by the person. Key feature A business interruption insurance payment that relates to a purchase of a replacement property is now a capital contribution for the purposes of sections CG 8, DB 64 and EE 48. Detailed analysis The definition of “capital contribution” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, for the purposes of sections CG 8, DB 64 and EE 48, has been amended to include a business interruption insurance payment that relates to a purchase of a replacement property. An amount will now be treated as a capital contribution if the amount:  is paid by a person (other than in their capacity of settlor, partner or shareholder of the recipient) to a recipient under an agreement between them;  is not income of the recipient, ignoring section CG 8;  is paid, under the express terms and conditions of the agreement, as a contribution for depreciable property owned or to be acquired by the recipient; and  if the agreement is a contract of insurance, indemnity or compensation, is paid in relation to an interruption or impairment of business activities. A capital contribution, including the business interruption insurance payment that relates to a replacement property, is treated as income of the recipient under section CG 8 unless the recipient chooses to reduce the cost base of the replacement property under section DB 64. Application date This generic amendment applies for the 2011–12 and later income years. There is a savings provision for people who filed returns before 28 August 2012, which is the date on which the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill was first considered by a Committee of the whole House. Page 12 Deductibility of expenses when there is no income-earning activity Section DZ 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007 After the Canterbury earthquakes, some taxpayers were no longer able to deduct their expenses or losses relating to their income-earning activity. Their activity was so disrupted by the earthquakes that there is no longer a sufficient nexus between the expenses or losses and their activity. For example, some rental properties or business premises situated in the Christchurch CBD red zone have become untenanted or forcibly closed because the premises are not physically accessible. Given there is no income-earning activity, on-going expenses such as rates may not be deductible under the general permission in section DA 1 even if the activity subsequently resumes. Key feature A person whose income-earning activity in greater Christchurch was interrupted by a Canterbury earthquake, may receive a deduction for expenditure relating to the income- earning activity in the year in which that activity resumes. This applies only when the income-earning activity is resumed before the 2016–17 income year. Detailed analysis New section DZ 20 provides certainty on the deductibility of expenses or losses for affected taxpayers who intend to continue their income-earning activities. To qualify for this relief, a person must meet all of the following conditions:  the person has an income-earning activity in “greater Christchurch” (as defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011) immediately before a Canterbury earthquake (as defined in that section);  the income-earning activity is interrupted for a period (the period of interruption) as a result of the Canterbury earthquake;  in the current year, during the period of interruption, the person incurs expenditure or loss (the interruption expenditure) in meeting an obligation relating to the income- earning activity;  the interruption expenditure does not meet the requirements of the general permission in section DA 1 but would do so but for the interruption; and  the person resumes the income-earning activity in an income year (the resumption year) before the 2016–17 income year. If all of these conditions are met, the person is allowed to deduct the interrupted expenditure in the year their income-earning activity is resumed. This new section supplements the general permission in section DA 1. The general limitations in section DA 2 still apply. Application date The amendment applies for the 2010–11 to 2015–16 income years. Page 13 Example Victoria carries on a dry cleaning business as a sole trader in the Christchurch CBD. She has a loan for the business that requires a $2,000 monthly interest payment. After the earthquake of 22 February 2011 she was no longer able to access her business premise. She temporarily stopped her business activity while considering whether to continue the business elsewhere. Without new section DZ 20, Victoria would not be able to deduct the interest payments on the business loan since February 2011 because there is no dry cleaning business so there is no longer a sufficient nexus between the interest expenditure and an income-earning activity. In September 2012, Victoria resumes the same dry cleaning business in Hoon Hay. She can deduct $40,000 ($2,000 x 20 months) interest incurred on the business during the interruption period in the 2012–13 income year. Roll-over relief for buildings and land held on revenue account Section CZ 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Section CZ 25 1 was introduced in 2011 to provide special roll-over relief for profits arising from compensation payments received in relation to buildings held on revenue account that were destroyed due to a Canterbury earthquake. The relief did not apply to land, or to buildings that were not demolished, or abandoned for later demolition. If the roll-over relief provision applies, the cost of any replacement building for tax purposes is reduced by \[up to\] the amount of profit made on the destroyed building. The effect is that, in most cases, a tax liability arising from the profit from compensation or insurance received in relation to the destroyed building is deferred until the replacement building is eventually sold. Key features The roll-over relief now also applies to:  land held on revenue account that is damaged as a result of the Canterbury earthquake; and  Crown purchases of buildings held on revenue account. This is intended to address purchases being made under the Government’s “red zone compensation package”, and applies even in situations when the building is not demolished. Detailed analysis New section CZ 25(1)(a)(i) applies the roll-over relief provisions to land held on revenue account that is damaged as a result of a Canterbury earthquake. 1 This roll-over relief provision was originally inserted as section CZ 23 by the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011. Section CZ 23 was already in the Income Tax Act 2007, the newly inserted section CZ 23 was renumbered as section CZ 25 by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Act. Page 14 New section CZ 25(1)(a)(ii) applies the roll-over relief provisions to both land and buildings, if the owner accepts the compensation provided by the Crown’s offer of purchase made in accordance with section 53(1) of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011. In this situation only, the roll-over relief can be claimed regardless of whether the building is destroyed or abandoned for later destruction. The remaining conditions of the roll-over relief, which relate to the replacement building or (now) replacement land, remain unchanged. In summary these are:  The owner must incur, or intend to incur expenditure on replacement building(s) or land in or before their 2015–16 income year.  The owner must hold the replacement building(s) or land on revenue account.  The replacement building(s) or land must be located in the greater Christchurch area (as defined by section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011). Amounts received under a Crown offer of purchase for a building may be used to acquire replacement land and vice versa, as long as the remaining conditions are met. Application date The amendments apply from 4 September 2010, being the same date as the roll-over relief became effective. Disposal of buildings and land within 10 years of acquisition Section CZ 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Under sections CB 6 to CB 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the proceeds from land purchased with the intention or purpose of sale are taxable. Broadly speaking, a seller may also derive income from the disposal of land if it is disposed of within 10 years of purchase or within 10 years of improvements being made to the land, and the seller is, or is associated with, a person in the business of dealing in, developing or building on land, or if there has been non-minor development of the land within 10 years of its acquisition. These provisions could apply to Government purchases of land under its “red zone compensation package”, if the person acquired the land within 10 years of accepting the Government’s offer of purchase. Key features The tax rules relating to disposal of land within 10 years of acquisition, or improvement, or following non-minor development do not apply to Crown purchases of land made under the Government’s “red-zone compensation package”. Page 15 Detailed analysis The context of the Crown’s purchases of buildings and land under section 53(1) of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011, as part of the “red-zone compensation package”, is to recognise that a disastrous event has rendered the buildings and land substantially damaged and unusable. Section CZ 26 ensures that the rules in sections CB 9 to CB 12, which relate to disposals of land with 10 years of the land being acquired, or certain disposals following the development or division of the land, do not apply to Crown purchases of land made under section 53(1) of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011. A person who accepts the Crown’s offer of purchase will not be considered to derive income from the disposal of land under those sections. The exception does not apply to land that was initially acquired with the intention of resale and development. The general rules in sections CB 6 and CB 7 will continue to operate. However the roll-over relief provisions in section CZ 25 may apply in these circumstances. There is no requirement that a person to whom the rules in sections CB 9 to CB 12 would have applied, if they were not excepted by the new section CZ 26, must purchase new land with the monies received under the compensation package. However if they do subsequently acquire new land, the 10-year period provisions in sections CB 9 to CB 12 may start afresh for the newly acquired land. Application date The amendments apply from 4 September 2010. Note: This amendment, and the previous amendment, was developed in part to deal with concerns raised by potential sellers in relation to the Crown’s offer of purchase under the “red zone compensation package” as it applied to residential properties. The amendment may also be relevant to similar issues with the acquisition of non-residential properties and land, as announced as part of the Central Christchurch Recovery Plan. These broader issues are being considered at the moment, as the detail of the plan is developed. Optional adjustment to assets under thin-cap rules Section FZ 7 New section FZ 7 provides an optional adjustment to how group assets are measured for the purposes of the thin-capitalisation rules. The adjustment mitigates a timing problem that arises because insurance proceeds are recognised at a later date than damage caused by the Canterbury earthquakes. Background The thin-capitalisation rules are based on accounting measures of assets. For accounting purposes, damaged assets are immediately impaired or derecognised. In contrast, insurance proceeds cannot be recognised until they are reasonably expected (for example, can be given a confirmed value). Page 16 Section FZ 7 is designed to mitigate this timing difference by allowing certain taxpayers to carry back known insurance proceeds to the date on which an asset was impaired or derecognised as a result of damage caused by the Canterbury earthquakes. The amount that can be carried back is limited to the lesser of the amount of damage or the related insurance proceeds. Key features Before a person can choose to use the optional adjustment, they must first satisfy the conditions in section FZ 7(1). These conditions are that:  an asset of the person’s New Zealand group has been has been damaged as a result of the Canterbury Earthquakes;  the asset has been impaired or derecognised under generally accepted accounting practice as a result of that damage; and  insurance for the damage has been recognised at a later date under generally accepted accounting practice. In such cases, the New Zealand group is able to choose to carry-back the insurance amount and regard this as an asset. The amount that can be carried back is limited to the lesser of the amount of damage or the related insurance proceeds. For impaired assets the damage is measured as the amount the asset has been impaired (as long as the impairment was a result of the earthquake damage rather than other reasons). For derecognised assets the damage is the amount of the derecognised asset (again, as long as the asset has been derecognised as a result of earthquake damage). Section FZ 7(2) provides for this additional asset to exist for a temporary period beginning on the day that the relevant asset is impaired or derecognised and ending on the day that the corresponding amount of insurance is recognised for accounting purposes. Section FZ 7(3) requires that if a person chooses to use section FZ 7(2) to increase the assets of their New Zealand group they must also increase the assets of their worldwide group by the same amount for a corresponding period. This ensures the worldwide group test continues to operate on a consistent basis. A person could receive insurance pay-outs for several different events. In such cases, each insurance pay-out is treated separately and can only be carried back to the date of the related damage. Example A company has $1 million of impairment as a result of an earthquake that occurred during its 2010–11 income year. In its 2011–12 income year there is a further $500k of impairment relating to a different earthquake. It receives $1.5 million of insurance pay-outs for both events in the 2011–12 income year. The company would only be able to claim an asset of $1 million in the 2010–11 income year. Page 17 Under generally accepted accounting practice the insurance may be recognised all at once if it is for a certain amount. Alternatively, if the person is entitled to reimbursement of costs actually incurred in repairing an asset, then the insurance revenue could be recognised gradually as the repair costs are incurred. In cases when the insurance is recognised gradually, the amount that is available under the provision should also be reduced gradually, at the same time that the insurance is recognised. Example A company has $2 million of impairment, $500k of which is repaired and reimbursed by insurance in 2011–12 and the remaining $1.5 million is repaired and reimbursed in 2012–13. In 2011–12 the company can claim $1.5 million of additional assets under section FZ 7 ($2m - $500k = $1.5m) and in 2012–13 all the impairment has been met by insurance so section FZ 7 no longer applies ($2m - $2m = 0). Notification requirement Section FZ 7(4) requires a person who chooses to use section FZ 7(2) to inform the Commissioner that they are applying this rule and to provide some information on its effect, including:  notice to the Commissioner that section FZ 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been applied;  the amount of income that would arise under section CH 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 in the absence of section FZ 7; and  the amount of income that arises under section CH 9 by applying section FZ 7. This information should be e-mailed to competent.authority@ird.govt.nz by the later of 30 November 2012 or the day that the person is required to make a return of income for the corresponding tax year. Application date Section FZ 7 applies for income years ending after 4 September 2010 and before the 2016–17 income year.

At the request of the competent authority of one of the Contracting Parties, the competent authority of the other Contracting Party may allow representatives of the competent authority of the first-mentioned Party to be present at the appropriate part of a tax examination in the second-mentioned Party. 3. If the request referred to in paragraph 2 is acceded to, the competent authority of the Contracting Party conducting the examination shall, as soon as possible, notify the competent authority of the other Party about the time and place of the examination, the authority or official designated to carry out the examination and the procedures and conditions required by the first-mentioned Party for the conduct of the examination. All decisions with respect to the conduct of the tax examination shall be made by the Party conducting the examination.  ARTICLE 7 Possibility of declining a request 1. The Requested Party shall not be required to obtain or provide information that the Applicant Party would not be able to obtain under its own laws for purposes of the administration or enforcement of its own tax laws. The competent authority of the Requested Party may decline to assist where the request is not made in conformity with this Agreement. 2. The provisions of this Agreement shall not impose on a Contracting Party the obligation to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information of the type referred to in paragraph 4 of Article 5 shall not be treated as such a secret or trade process merely because it meets the criteria in that paragraph. 3. The provisions of this Agreement shall not impose on a Contracting Party the obligation to obtain or provide information, which would reveal confidential communications between a client and an attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative where such communications are: (a) produced for the purposes of seeking or providing legal advice; or (b) produced for the purposes of use in existing or contemplated legal proceedings. 4. The Requested Party may decline a request for information if the disclosure of the information would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 5. A request for information shall not be refused on the ground that the tax claim giving rise to the request is disputed by the taxpayer. 6. The Requested Party may decline a request for information if the information is requested by the Applicant Party to administer or enforce a provision of the tax law of the Applicant Party, or any requirement connected therewith, which discriminates against a national of the Requested Party as compared with a national of the Applicant Party in the same circumstances.  ARTICLE 8 Confidentiality Any information received by a Contracting Party under this Agreement shall be treated as confidential and may be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) in the jurisdiction of the Contracting Party concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by this Agreement. Such persons or authorities shall use such information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. The information may not be disclosed to any other person or entity or authority or any other jurisdiction without the express written consent of the competent authority of the Requested Party.  ARTICLE 9 Costs Unless the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties otherwise agree, ordinary costs incurred in providing assistance shall be borne by the Requested Party, and extraordinary costs incurred in providing assistance (including reasonable costs of engaging external advisors in connection with litigation or otherwise) shall be borne by the Applicant Party. At the request of either Contracting Party, the competent authorities shall consult as necessary with regard to this Article, and in particular the competent authority of the Requested Party shall consult with the competent authority of the Applicant Party in advance if the costs of providing information with respect to a specific request are expected to be significant.  ARTICLE 10 IMPLEMENTATION LEGISLATION The Contracting Parties shall enact any legislation necessary to comply with, and give effect to, the terms of this Agreement.  ARTICLE 11 Mutual agreement procedure 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall jointly endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement. 2. In addition to the endeavours referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties may mutually determine the procedures to be used under Articles�5 and 6. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties may communicate with each other directly for the purposes of this Article. 4. The Contracting Parties may agree on other forms of dispute resolution.  ARTICLE 12 ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. The Government of New Zealand and the Government of Niue shall notify each other in writing through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of this Agreement. 2. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the last notification, and shall thereupon have effect: (a) with respect to criminal tax matters for taxable, on that date; and (b) with respect to all other matters described in Article 1 for all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force or, where there is no taxable period, for all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force. 3. This Agreement shall apply to information predating the coming into force of this Agreement. However, with respect to paragraph 2(b) of this Article, this Agreement shall only apply to information predating the coming into force of this Agreement if the requested information relates to a taxable period or chargeable event referred to in that paragraph.  Article 13 Termination 1. This Agreement shall continue in effect indefinitely, but either of the Contracting Parties may, after the expiration of 3 years from the date of its entry into force, give to the other Contracting Party through the diplomatic channel written notice of termination. 2. Such termination shall become effective on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of 6 months after the date of receipt of notice of termination by the other Contracting Party. 3. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall remain bound by the provisions of Article 8 with respect to any information obtained under this Agreement.  IN WITNESS

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES The Government of New Zealand and the Government of Niue, Having regard to the principles underpinning the special relationship of partnership and free association between the two Contracting Parties, and Desiring to facilitate the exchange of information with respect to taxes, Have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1 OBJECT AND SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall provide assistance through exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of the domestic laws of those Parties concerning taxes covered by this Agreement. Such information shall include information that is foreseeably relevant to the determination, assessment and collection of such taxes, the recovery and enforcement of tax claims, or the investigation or prosecution of tax matters. Information shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and shall be treated as confidential in the manner provided in Article 8. The rights and safeguards secured to persons by the laws or administrative practice of the Requested Party remain applicable. The Requested Party shall use its best endeavours to ensure that any such rights and safeguards are not applied in a manner that unduly prevents or delays effective exchange of information. ARTICLE 2 JURISDICTION A Requested Party is not obligated to provide information which is neither held by its authorities nor in the possession or control of persons who are within its territorial jurisdiction. ARTICLE 3 TAXES COVERED 1. The existing taxes which are the subject of this Agreement are: (a) in the case of New Zealand, taxes of every kind and description; and (b) in the case of Niue, taxes of every kind and description. 2. This Agreement shall also apply to any identical or substantially similar taxes imposed after the date of signature of this Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The Agreement shall also apply to such other taxes as may be agreed in an exchange of letters between the Contracting Parties. The competent authorities of the Contracting Parties shall notify each other of any substantial changes to the taxation and related information gathering measures covered by this Agreement. 3. This Agreement shall not apply to taxes imposed by municipalities, local authorities, or possessions of a Contracting Party. ARTICLE 4 DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise defined: (a) the term “New Zealand” means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (b) the term “Niue” means the territory of Niue; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under Niue legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which Niue may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (c) the term “Applicant Party” means the Contracting Party requesting information; (d) the term “collective investment fund or scheme” means any pooled investment vehicle, irrespective of legal form. The term “public collective investment fund or scheme” means any collective investment fund or scheme provided the units, shares or other interests in the fund or scheme can be readily purchased, sold or redeemed by the public. Units, shares or other interests in the fund or scheme can be readily purchased, sold or redeemed “by the public” if the purchase, sale or redemption is not implicitly or explicitly restricted to a limited group of investors; (e) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (f) the term “competent authority” means in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner and, in the case of Niue, the Financial Secretary or an authorised representative of the Financial Secretary; (g) the term “Contracting Party” means New Zealand or Niue as the context requires; (h) the term “information” means any fact, statement or record in any form whatever; (i) the term “information gathering measures” means laws and administrative or judicial procedures that enable a Contracting Party to obtain and provide the requested information; (j) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (k) the term “principal class of shares” means the class or classes of shares representing a majority of the voting power and value of the company; (l) the term “publicly traded company” means any company whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange provided its listed shares can be readily purchased or sold by the public. Shares can be purchased or sold “by the public” if the purchase or sale of shares is not implicitly or explicitly restricted to a limited group of investors; (m) the term “recognised stock exchange” means any stock exchange agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties; (n) the term “Requested Party” means the Contracting Party requested to provide information; (o) the term “tax” means any tax to which this Agreement applies pursuant to Article 3; (p) the term “criminal tax matters” means tax matters involving intentional conduct which is liable to prosecution under the criminal laws of the Applicant Party; and (q) the term “criminal laws” means all criminal laws designated as such under domestic law irrespective of whether contained in the tax laws, the criminal code or other statutes. 2. As regards the application of this Agreement at any time by a Contracting Party, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that Party, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Party prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that Party. ARTICLE 5 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION UPON REQUEST 1. The competent authority of the Requested Party shall provide upon request information for the purposes referred to in Article 1. Such information shall be exchanged without regard to whether the conduct being investigated would constitute a crime under the laws of the Requested Party if such conduct occurred in the Requested Party. 2. If the information in the possession of the competent authority of the Requested Party is not sufficient to enable it to comply with the request for information, that Party shall use all relevant information gathering measures to provide the Applicant Party with the information requested, notwithstanding that the Requested Party may not need such information for its own tax purposes. 3. If specifically requested by the competent authority of the Applicant Party, the competent authority of the Requested Party shall provide information under this Article, to the extent allowable under its domestic laws, in the form of depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies of original records. 4. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that its competent authority for the purposes specified in Article 1 of this Agreement, has the authority to obtain and provide upon request: (a) information held by banks, other financial institutions, and any person acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity including nominees and trustees; (b) information regarding the ownership of companies, partnerships, trusts, foundations, “Anstalten” and other persons, including, within the constraints of Article 2, ownership information on all such persons in an ownership chain; in the case of trusts, information on settlors, trustees, beneficiaries and protectors; and in the case of foundations, information on founders, members of the foundation council and beneficiaries. Further, this Agreement does not create an obligation on the Contracting Parties to obtain or provide ownership information with respect to publicly traded companies or public collective investment funds or schemes unless such information can be obtained without giving rise to disproportionate difficulties. 5. The competent authority of the Applicant Party shall provide the following information to the competent authority of the Requested Party when making a request for information under this Agreement to demonstrate the foreseeable relevance of the information to the request: (a) the identity of the person under examination or investigation; (b) a statement of the information sought including its nature and the form in which the Applicant Party wishes to receive the information from the Requested Party; (c) the tax purpose for which the information is sought; (d) the grounds for believing that the information requested is held in the Requested Party or is in the possession or control of a person within the jurisdiction of the Requested Party; (e) to the extent known, the name and address of any person believed to be in possession of the requested information; (f) a statement that the request is in conformity with the law and administrative practices of the Applicant Party, that if the requested information was within the jurisdiction of the Applicant Party then the competent authority of the Applicant Party would be able to obtain the information under the laws of the Applicant Party or in the normal course of administrative practice and that the information request is in conformity with this Agreement; and (g) a statement that the Applicant Party has pursued all means available in its own territory to obtain the information, except those that would give rise to disproportionate difficulties. 6. The competent authority of the Requested Party shall forward the requested information as promptly as possible to the Applicant Party. To ensure a prompt response, the competent authority of the Requested Party shall: (a) confirm receipt of a request in writing to the competent authority of the Applicant Party and shall notify the competent authority of the Applicant Party of deficiencies in the request, if any, within 60 days of the receipt of the request; and (b) if the competent authority of the Requested Party has been unable to obtain and provide the information within 90 days of receipt of the request, including if it encounters obstacles in furnishing the information or it refuses to furnish the information, it shall immediately inform the Applicant Party, explaining the reason for its inability, the nature of the obstacles or the reasons for its refusal. ARTICLE 6 TAX EXAMINATIONS ABROAD 1. A Contracting Party may allow representatives of the competent authority of the other Contracting Party to enter the territory of the first-mentioned Party to interview individuals and examine records with the written consent of the persons concerned. The competent authority of the second-mentioned Party shall notify the competent authority of the first-mentioned Party of the time and place of the meeting with the individuals concerned. 2. At the request of the competent authority of one of the Contracting Parties, the competent authority of the other Contracting Party may allow representatives of the competent authority of the first-mentioned Party to be present at the appropriate part of a tax examination in the second- mentioned Party. 3. If the request referred to in paragraph 2 is acceded to, the competent authority of the Contracting Party conducting the examination shall, as soon as possible, notify the competent authority of the other Party about the time and place of the examination, the authority or official designated to carry out the examination and the procedures and conditions required by the first- mentioned Party for the conduct of the examination. All decisions with respect to the conduct of the tax examination shall be made by the Party conducting the examination. ARTICLE 7 POSSIBILITY OF DECLINING A REQUEST 1. The Requested Party shall not be required to obtain or provide information that the Applicant Party would not be able to obtain under its own laws for purposes of the administration or enforcement of its own tax laws.

### Address to Accountants and Tax Agents Institute NZ Annual Conference  
Marlborough Convention Centre, Blenheim  
8 March 2013

Good afternoon.

Thank you for inviting me to address you again this year.

I have attended your annual conference for some years now and this is your first under your new name.

I think the change is a good one as it represents your membership more accurately and brings the organisation more in line with your very laudable objectives.

As Revenue Minister I am, of course, particularly pleased to see that you include as objectives, your intention to foster tax knowledge and further tax practice in New Zealand.

It is good for any organisation to be responsive enough to meet a change and be able to adapt accordingly.

The tax system too needs to be adaptable enough to respond to changing conditions.

The 2010 Budget brought much-needed change to the tax system by shifting the taxation focus from income to consumption and aligning the top tax rate and the trustee rates.

By cutting income tax rates and increasing GST as well as removing depreciation deduction on buildings, the government has made the tax system fairer and less open to abuse.

For a system such as ours which relies on voluntary compliance, this is absolutely critical, and I acknowledge the role that tax agents play in assisting with compliance.

The tax switch from income taxes to GST had another effect too.

Taxes on personal income tend to be more distorting than GST.

Taxes intrude on decisions and tend to encourage individuals and businesses to do things that would not be sensible in the absence of tax decisions.

So the tax switch was aimed at making the tax system less distorting which increases the size of the New Zealand economic cake.

The government has an ongoing programme of maintaining a broad-base, low-rate tax system that does as little as possible to distort the decisions of businesses and individuals.

We want New Zealand to be a good place for businesses to locate and for individuals to live and work.

For that we need to continue to maintain the tax system, ensuring that our tax laws continue to be effective and this requires a constant process of tax changes supporting our broad-base, low-rate tax system.

Looking to immediate future, changes on the policy front will be small — no changes are envisioned to the basic tax frameworks as they are fit for purpose.

So the tax policy work will instead focus on improvements within the current framework aimed at supporting the Government’s ambitions for the economy and intention to ensure fairness in the tax system.

There is still plenty of work to do on this and I will talk more about this later.

I would also like to discuss today an area of importance to you and one which will see big changes: our tax administration, as we strive to ensure it provides best possible value for money.

And of course, an area of constant change is the global economy.

I am sure you are aware of the recent media attention paid to whether or not large multinational corporates are paying their fair share of tax.

To help with that, we need to ensure our tax system is adaptable — keeping pace with, if not actually leading international best practice.

Ongoing maintenance of our tax system is important as it is crucial for supporting the Government’s objectives.

### Government’s objectives

The Government aims to lift New Zealand’s economic performance with careful economic management, lifting national savings and encouraging investment.

New Zealand must protect itself from offshore economic turbulence and for that, we need a solid buffer of capital providing businesses with the investment funds they need to grow, provide jobs and contribute to the economy.

As I said before, all taxes are likely to distort decisions and thereby have an impact on the national economy to some extent.

We therefore need to raise taxes in ways which do as little as possible to discourage sensible decisions by individuals and businesses within our broad-base, low-rate framework.

And efficient and fair revenue collection reduces the need for borrowing which is good for the economy.

The focus is on addressing inequities and anomalies in the tax system which strengthens the system while also continuing to collect revenue efficiently.

Changes are already in train, and you may be aware of some of these.

### Policy changes

Some such changes are in a bill currently before the Finance and Expenditure select committee, the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill.

The bill contains a proposal to tighten the rules for deducting costs of mixed use assets such as holiday homes, boats and aircraft that are used by the owner, both privately and to earn income.

It is important to address this situation as there is a fairness question here, as well as the economic efficiency concern of reducing artificial tax biases in the way that people invest, so that New Zealand’s capital is invested more productively.

Retaining the status quo means that the owners of such assets effectively receive a taxpayer-funded subsidy for the asset.

The proposals in the bill address these concerns by limiting the tax deductions that can be claimed on mixed use assets to better reflect the business and private use of the asset.

The apportionment approach that was chosen should be reasonably easy for most people to apply.

The proposals, however, do get more complicated if the asset is held in a company.

This is necessary to ensure that owners cannot claim excessive interest deductions.

The Bill is currently being examined by the select committee and I am confident they will carefully consider whether an appropriate balance has been struck between integrity of the system and complexity.

It is important too that tax does not get in the way of efficient businesses being set up in New Zealand.

Our current GST laws can present an obstacle to that and we need to address this to stay globally competitive.

GST is a tax on consumption—not a tax on business and therefore should be neutral for both resident and non-resident businesses.

The Bill proposes to allow non-resident businesses to register for, and claim back, GST in a broadly similar way to a resident business.

You may also be aware of the proposed salary trade-off changes which will mean that car parks provided to employees (predominantly in Auckland and Wellington CBDs) will be taxed, through the fringe benefit tax rules.

The change will enhance the integrity of the tax and social assistance systems by providing a fairer, more equal, way of treating those who receive non-cash benefits as part of their remuneration compared with those who receive only cash remuneration.

I would like to turn now to matters that could well be much more significant for many here.

### Financial reporting

A current tax policy project concerns taxation requirements for financial reporting.

Presently all companies except shelf companies have to prepare financial reports under the auspices of the Financial Reporting Act.

Medium sized companies have to prepare these reports to GAAP standard.

As part of a much wider set of reforms, Government has agreed that for companies that are not large and that have not borrowed monies from the public, this Financial Reporting obligation will be replaced by a tax administration requirement.

That means that these companies will prepare special purpose financial statements to a minimum level — double entry accrual based, with explicit notes requirements.

Inland Revenue is interested in this because it is the biggest user of financial statements in New Zealand — it uses them both for audit and debt purposes, and in some situations needs them to fulfil its international obligation under tax treaties.

There is a case that all businesses should have to prepare financial statements — Inland Revenue is likely to propose that, subject to a de minimus, all businesses and taxpayers that make significant losses should prepare these financial statements.

I look forward to your organisation’s response to these proposals.

This will be further discussed in the Inland Revenue presentation.

### Transformation

As you know, Inland Revenue aims to transform its business to provide better value for money across the vast range of activities it performs and in line with Government’s expectations for the public service.

The catalyst for change at IRD is the performance of the department’s now rather dated computer system, FIRST which now, in addition to tax, is also called upon to administer Child Support, Student Loans, Working for Families and KiwiSaver.

Each has inevitably placed their own pressures on the system.

At the same time, taxpayers, both corporate and personal, have been calling for a more interactive system to enable them to better manage their tax affairs online, a little like the way we do our banking these days.

FIRST however has restrictions and this has implications for the efficiency and effectiveness of our tax administration, not to mention imposing restrictions on policy development.

But the change being contemplated at Inland Revenue is not merely a technological one.

For a modern tax administration to keep pace with taxpayers’ service expectations, we need more than a new computer, but also fit-for-purpose business processes that lower compliance costs and make it easier for customers to deal with them.

The department will also need to be able to work across government.

My view is that Inland Revenue needs a focus on providing an environment that supports business and to continue to focus on providing value for money.

It will also mean asking “what is the best use of our time” and moving staff from lower value to higher value tasks.

As tax agents you can probably think of a number of areas for improvement and I imagine that through the transformation process, the department will want to hear your views.

Personally I feel that one example would be to improve the PAYE system, with a particular focus on the Employer Monthly Schedule.

This schedule provided to Inland Revenue by all employers is a key payment and data collection mechanism within the overall tax system.

It performs a hugely important function, yet it is inflexible and cannot accommodate changes and more importantly, it is not particularly user-friendly.

A fundamental issue with it is that it is labour-intensive, often requiring double-handling and repeat contacts from IRD, thus making it a significant burden on employers.

Inland Revenue is conscious of this, and makes efforts to help.

By contacting employers with overdue employer monthly schedules, last year they reduced the number of employers with overdue schedules by 24%.

This is good, because it means those businesses have avoided penalties and interest, but this approach is not the solution.

To avoid repeat contacts from Inland Revenue and double-handling, we need a much greater reliance on electronic media and a system which allows accurate, validated information from employers at the first interaction providing near real time confirmation and improved status reporting.

I think that what would be most helpful for employers would be if such a system were integrated as part of their everyday business systems, reducing the amount of time they spend on PAYE obligations and interacting with IRD.

I want this to succeed — I want the best possible tax system delivering the best possible service to taxpayers.

Where tax agents are concerned, I would see this tax system providing:

*   more personalisation, for example, tailored interactions
*   greater certainty through up-front validation of information and tracing interactions with IRD
*   better responsiveness as Inland Revenue’s processing times improve
*   less paperwork through two-way interactions between Inland Revenue’s and tax agents’ systems
*   more time to provide business advice, rather than engaging with Inland Revenue for simple tax administrative matters.

The next few years, will be an exciting time for the department and the tax community and will be your opportunity to influence the shape of the organisation and indeed of the whole of government for generations to come.

I encourage you to take up that challenge, and participate in the process of change.

The Government is concerned that we approach this change programme with careful consideration.

Later this month the Cabinet will consider Inland Revenue’s business case for the overall direction of the transformation programme.

But in the meanwhile, the world keeps turning and events at home and abroad demand a response.

### BEPS

Grabbing headlines recently has been the issue of certain large multinationals who appear to pay no or little tax anywhere in the world.

We are not alone in our need to respond and New Zealand is actively contributing to OECD efforts to identify what needs to be done and how this will be implemented around the world.

Like other countries, New Zealand already uses a range of measures to address the issue, including information exchange agreements with other countries, withholding taxes, transfer pricing rules, thin capitalisation rules and in certain cases, our general anti-avoidance rule.

I might add that our tax rules and their enforcement by Inland Revenue are very well regarded internationally.

Be that as it may, times are changing and the rules need to evolve and adapt to suit.

The problem is that tax rules around the world were largely designed for an industrial world and the rules have had trouble keeping up with new business models and technologies in the internet age where companies are not constrained by location or national borders.

The OECD work will help New Zealand and other countries to identify any weaknesses in their rules and to ensure that international tax frameworks keep pace with new business models.

### Drought relief

From the heady world of the OECD and multinational corporates, I would like to turn to hard reality.

Last week a drought was officially declared in Northland.

And this week, drought was also declared in South Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Hawke’s Bay.

For a country like ours for which farming is the backbone of the economy, this is bad news.

I therefore am pleased that Inland Revenue has been able to offer some assistance to affected farmers by exercising its income equalisation discretions in all of these affected areas.

Those of you with farming clients will be familiar with the Farm Equalisation Scheme which was set up to help farmers cope with fluctuations in their incomes.

The scheme allows farmers to deposit money to be put aside from a better year and withdrawn against a not so good year, and farmers have to make their deposits by a specific date.

Inland Revenue has decided to relax the rules for the cut-off date to allow late deposits from the 2012 income tax year to be made up to 30 April 2013, regardless of when the 2012 tax return is filed or the due date for filing that return.

Also early refunds will be allowed.

What farmers really need is rain and lots of it.

What the tax system offers is some compensation which will better equip farmers to plan their financial response.

It is an example of the tax system being adaptable enough to respond to changing conditions — bringing me full circle to the starting point for my discussion today.

### Conclusion

Tax may be deeply absorbing to many here so I hope that I am not offending anyone when I say that tax is a drag on the economy.

Yet taxes are necessary, and the work that you do in helping with the efficiency of the system is invaluable.

The tax system requires ongoing changes to ensure efficiency; collecting the revenue it should while keeping the burden of compliance costs to an absolute minimum because the Government is focused on supporting businesses to help grow our economy.

Maintaining our broad-based, low-rate tax framework as well as the changes envisioned at Inland Revenue will support this objective.

Your conference programme looks an interesting one, and one in keeping with an organisation striving to lift the knowledge and practice of tax professionals.

I wish you a successful conference, thank you very much.

Ends.

Speech

### Keynote Address to IFA Annual Conference  
Queenstown  
9.15am, Friday 15 March 2013  
 

Good morning.

It is a great pleasure for me to once again address an IFA conference and to have this opportunity to share my thoughts on taxation issues with you.

This is the eighth time I have had this privilege, and certainly I regard this annual event as an important opportunity to outline the taxation work programme and government thinking for the year ahead and beyond.

And I always look forward to learning about your thoughts.

Before I begin, let me say that there is much to learn from the experience and thinking of other countries.

It is why New Zealand has always sought the advice and commentary of outside experts in tax policy.

And we are truly fortunate to have the presence of one such expert, Professor Alan Auerbach, who will also be addressing this conference.

I look forward to hearing about the views he expresses.

Let me also take this opportunity to step back and make some observations about tax policy in New Zealand as someone who has been a privileged participant in the policy process for almost three decades.

I would like to reflect a bit upon where we have been, some factors which make New Zealand special, where we are now and also provide some thoughts on future directions.

In Budget 2010, the Government put in place the most important set of tax changes in twenty years.

The changes were substantially influenced by the deliberations of the Tax Working Group which drew together tax practitioners, academics and tax officials.

For the Tax Working Group, everything was on the table, and I would have to say that a massive amount of very high quality work was produced.

More recently there has been an internal government savings and investment review.

What I would like to do today is summarise what the Government has concluded from these tax reviews and the implications for our tax system in the medium term.

The most important conclusion from these reviews is that the current broad-base/low-rate or BBLR approach to taxation will be maintained.

While we must always be open to change to meet evolving circumstances, the BBLR approach provides significant advantages.

These conclusions been reflected in the revenue strategy adopted by the Government which confirms the BBLR approach.

At the same time, there is continued pressure to lift government revenues to meet our long-term fiscal challenges.

The tax work programme, therefore, contains a number of projects designed to broaden the tax base in economically efficient ways; that is, in a manner that is consistent with the BBLR approach.

As you will have seen in recent times, we are also prepared to react vigorously to combat potential erosion of our tax base.

In that context, I would like to comment a little on an issue that has occasioned much media interest around international tax planning and the work being undertaken at the OECD on Base-Erosion and Profit-Shifting, the so called BEPS project.

I think this is an area where New Zealand has been ahead of the curve; and I would like to put our efforts in this area, domestically and at the OECD, into context.

### Some History

We have not arrived at our current tax settings by accident.

Since the mid-1980s, we have undertaken a series of intensive reviews of our tax system.

Over those same years, New Zealand has also learned the benefits of consultation, although there were times in the early 1990s when consultation did not work well.

Since 1995 under the Generic Tax Policy Process, consultation with interested parties has been an explicit and indispensable part of tax reviews.

GTPP formalised the best of consultation of the previous ten years.

It is worth recalling what tax policy was like in the bad old days.

Our tax system shared the experience of many other countries.

Tax rates were generally high and the tax base was perforated at best, with many special tax breaks.

Personal tax rates went all the way up to 66%.

The company tax rate was 45% and income earned through companies was subject to double taxation.

That is, if the income was in fact subject to tax in the first place.

We had export incentives and a huge number of special breaks for particular activities.

We had no tax on Fringe Benefits.

Not only was the tax system inefficient, but to complete the double whammy, it was very unfair.

The tax breaks, of course, were all well-intentioned.

But the road to anarchy – if not hell – is paved with good intentions.

Tax breaks were brought in to encourage “good things” to happen.

But once you have tax breaks for certain good things, the question arises, why not for other good things as well?

Or, if it is ok to use the tax system for good activities, how far down the path do you want to go of using the tax system to discourage bad things?

We already have certain elements of that, principally for understandable public health reasons, but we are far properly more wary about applying that concept too broadly.

One might think with the high tax rates being levied that the government of the day would have been awash with cash.

But the government was running a deficit of 9% of GDP.

It was like collecting water with a sieve.

Amazingly, sales taxation was probably in an even worse mess than the income tax.

We had an anachronistic wholesale sales tax with multiple rates, ranging from 10 to 60% on different goods.

It applied to only about 27% of household consumption, largely confined to durable items such as motor vehicles and home appliances.

Around one-third of the tax was on business inputs, hobbling New Zealand businesses’ ability to compete on world markets.

As a consequence, the tax system intruded in a hit-or-miss manner on business decision-making.

Tax revenues were subject to unexpected shortfalls.

Tax losses were openly marketed.

As a consequence frequent and unexpected changes were made to the rules.

Both the government and private industry were increasingly blind to the effects of the tax system, with many unintended negative consequences.

The policy process was a mess.

Government and the private sector operated in different silos.

Change happened without warning, making rational, prudent business planning impossible.

It was no way to run a railroad, let alone the single most pervasive lever of government policy.

In saying all this, we were not alone.

By the 1980s many other tax systems internationally were in a similar position.

A wave of reform toward lower tax rates and broader tax bases swept tax systems in developed countries.

New Zealand was in a mood for change and joined the trend with enthusiasm.

I think that it is fair to say we went further and accomplished more than most other countries.

New Zealand tax policy and tax policy making since the 1990s has been driven by two key things.

The first is the broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) tax policy framework.

The second is GTPP.

The tax system that emerged from the reforms of the second half of the 1980s had dramatically lower tax rates and broader tax bases.

Income earned through companies was taxed only once with the introduction of the imputation system.

The wholesale sales tax was swept away and replaced with the GST, which remains one of the most comprehensive and comprehensible sales taxes operating in the world today.

The many problems besetting New Zealand at the time necessitated strong and decisive action.

It is fair to say that the changes were revolutionary.

But revolutions are generally not created by committee and consensus.

Eventually the revolutionary fever resulted in changes that went too far; that did not take proper account of practical real world issues and concerns.

And so, in reaction, the GTPP was introduced in 1995.

GTPP marries good process with the good policy that had opened the decade, but helps to avoid some of the excesses that can occur when reform does not have due regard of practical constraints.

The essence of the GTPP is consultation and dialogue in order to achieve practical and effective outcomes.

Governments must still govern, but the result is certainly better if proposed changes are subject to scrutiny and debate – an issue that some recent political dealings have highlighted! I could not possibly comment!

GTPP recognises the fact that neither tax officials, taxpayers nor their advisors, nor unfortunately even Government Ministers, have a monopoly on wisdom on tax reform.

GTPP also helps ensure that tax reform is suited to New Zealand’s particular situation.

### What makes New Zealand special?

Any tax system must take into account the economic and institutional situation of the country in question.

And aside from having the best rugby team in the world, New Zealand really is special in a number of ways that are relevant to the development of its tax policy.

Unlike most other OECD countries, the top personal tax rate is close to the company tax rate.

When this is combined with our imputation system, New Zealand is able to avoid the structural pressures to recharacterise income that arise when the rates diverge.

This allows immense simplification of the tax system and this is a huge advantage.

Moreover, New Zealand’s tax system strongly achieves its primary purpose.

It brings in the money in a way that is efficient and generally seen as fair.

The top tax rate in New Zealand is one of the lowest in the OECD.

As a consequence the top rate of tax applied to savings income in New Zealand is similar to the “’low’ flat tax rates on capital income found in Nordic countries.

And we have achieved the result without the need for complex systems separating income from capital and labour.

It is interesting to note that since 1985, the total share of personal income taxes as a percentage of tax has fallen from 60% to 37%, while the share of consumption taxes has increased from about 21% to 38%.

Thus there has been considerable rebalancing between the taxation of income and consumption.

New Zealand is geographically isolated and most FDI into New Zealand is in sectors that supply domestic demand.

Accordingly, pressures on our tax system from international factors are likely to be different than for other countries facing regional competition for mobile investments.

Finally, not only capital, but labour can move internationally, and we have certainly seen that in recent years, most notably with the number of New Zealanders now living in Australia.

Indeed, New Zealand has one of the largest percentages of its population working abroad.

### Tax Working Group, Budget 2010 and the Savings and Investment Review

The Tax Working Group work canvassed a wide range of topics and enlisted a cadre of the top tax academics and professionals from around New Zealand and abroad.

In concert with officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury, detailed papers were prepared, conferences held and a final report summarising the work was released.

And the report certainly was not allowed to gather dust.

The working group identified serious problems that had accumulated in the New Zealand income tax system due to the misalignment of the company, trust and top personal tax rates.

In response, as noted above, Budget 2010 moved to better align tax rates and to shift the burden of tax away from income and toward consumption.

Differences among the company, trust and top personal tax rates were substantially reduced to decrease pressures that had existed under the previous rate schedules.

Income tax rates were reduced across the board.

At the same time, the GST rate was raised to tilt the tax take away from income and toward consumption.

The working group also expressed concerns about light taxation of investment in property, accelerated depreciation for equipment as a result of the 20 percent loading, and lax thin-capitalisation provisions.

Budget 2010 also responded to these concerns by a set of measures which helped pay for income tax cuts in a way which was fair.

Treasury has estimated that the overall package of changes was broadly distributionally neutral.

The top third, middle third and bottom third of taxpayers gained similar amounts.

The working group also examined the overall structure of the tax system.

It saw much to commend the New Zealand tax BBLR paradigm, and argued that it should continue to be an underlying framework for the New Zealand tax system.

A further review question that arose was whether New Zealand should pursue reforms in the direction of reducing taxation of capital relative to labour.

There is a lot of support in the academic literature for reforms in this direction, and both the Henry Review in Australia and Mirrlees Review in the UK were sympathetic to that.

This latter question was taken up by the review of savings and investment.

The Government has looked carefully at whether it should initiate a fundamental reform of the tax system in the direction of reduced taxation of capital.

On balance, the Government’s conclusion has been to reconfirm its support for the broad-base/low-rate tax system, which has served New Zealand so well for the last two decades.

A broad definition of income is taxed.

As an important supplement we have a very broad-based and neutral GST.

The Minister of Finance will also discuss the savings and investment work in his speech to this conference tomorrow.

The reaffirmation of our current tax settings does not mean we should rest on our laurels.

We will continue to monitor international developments and be willing to respond as necessary.

We will continue to pursue changes to the tax system consistent with the broad-base/low-rate framework.

That is, we will explore changes that make the tax system fairer and more efficient.

All of which leads naturally to a discussion of the current tax policy work programme.

### The Work Programme

The programme, which was released last year, reflects the BBLR approach and supports the Government’s priorities.

The Government has announced four key priorities:

*   responsibly managing its finances;
*   building a more productive and competitive economy;
*   delivering better public services; and
*   rebuilding Christchurch and the surrounding areas.

Responsibly managing the Government’s finances is obviously central to any tax system.

The key goal of the tax system is to raise tax revenue as fairly and efficiently as possible to finance government spending.

Taxation is one of the Government’s biggest interventions in the economy and in the lives of its citizens.

Economic efficiency in the way tax is collected is central to the Government’s second priority of building a more productive and competitive economy.

The BBLR approach is designed to respond to both of these priorities.

Tax systems with broad tax bases and low tax rates have proven internationally to be the most robust and secure systems for raising tax revenues.

They are much less prone to unexpected shortfalls of revenues.

A BBLR system is also designed to minimise distortions from taxation in the economy.

The pattern of activity is essentially driven by market forces, rather than maximisation of tax benefits.

Over the next ten years there will also be considerable work in Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation space.

The aims include delivering better public services by:

*   reducing systems risk;
*   reducing the time cost of policy change;
*   reducing costs to taxpayers and better delivering the services they want; and
*   by making the administration of the tax system more cost effective.

An important part of this is collaboration across government departments to make the government sector as a whole provide best value for money.

That is no small undertaking, but it is a very important one.

Finally, an on-going task that appears well in hand is ensuring that the tax system is fit for purpose in the Government’s final key priority of rebuilding Christchurch and the surrounding areas.

### Government Revenue Strategy

The Government’s revenue strategy expands on the implication of these priorities on tax policy in New Zealand.

It states: “The Government supports a broad-base, low-rate tax system that minimises economic distortions.

The Government considers these goals are best supported by a tax system that:

*   maintains revenue flows to pay for valued public services and reduce debt;
*   responds to New Zealand’s medium term needs in a planned and coherent way
*   biases economic decisions as little as possible – which allows people to work, save, spend or invest in ways that they believe are best for them
*   rewards effort and individuals’ investment in their own skills
*   has low compliance costs and low administrative costs
*   minimises opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, and
*   shares the tax burden as fairly as possible.

The Government’s revenue strategy is to raise revenue in ways that meet these objectives.”

The tax policy work programme is driven by this revenue strategy.

### Revenue raising options

In principle, there are many tax reforms that could be used to support the Government in its goal of responsibly managing the government’s finances.

Tax rates could be increased or new tax bases introduced.

However, rather than increase tax rates or introduce new tax bases, the Government has focused in recent years on revenue raising options consistent with the overall BBLR framework in order to support fairness and economic efficiency.

Measures have included changes in treatment for mixed use assets, salary sacrifice arrangements, specified minerals and livestock valuation.

### Measures supporting fairness, efficiency and a more productive and competitive economy

It is important to understand the tax system’s role in promoting a more productive and competitive economy.

Normally taxes will detract from economic performance.

Good tax policy is like good medicine – first do no harm.

Taxes can harm economic performance in many ways, for example:

*   by discouraging investment which would earn more than it costs, or
*   by encouraging people to invest in inefficient ways,
*   by discouraging people from saving or encouraging them to save in inefficient ways,
*   by discouraging people from working, up-skilling or from working as long or as hard as they would ideally like or
*   by making New Zealand a less attractive place to base a business.

The problem is that tax reforms which improve things on one margin can often make things worse on another.

Trade-offs are inevitable.

But development of good policy minimises our vulnerability to the law of unintended consequences.

And it is in that light that you will have heard recent concerns around fringe benefit tax and car parks.

I would like to start with the question: what are we trying to do here?

The answer is simple: we are trying to create a fairer and more equal tax system.

We are doing that with issues as diverse as making sure graduates overseas pay back their student loans, and the current work with the OECD on making multinationals pay their fair share of tax.

It is all about fairness.

That has been our approach as a government.

And that has been how we have looked at the tax treatment of car parks.

When all the noise quietens down, the proposed taxing of car parks provided to employees, predominantly in Auckland and Wellington CBDs, under the fringe benefit tax rules is actually about getting a fairer, more equal, way of treating those who receive non-cash benefits and those who just get wages or salary.

That is the reasoning.

Now – as it should be – it is being tested by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee.

And that committee will look at compliance costs.

It will look at the impact on nightshift workers.

That is a vigorous process and I will work with the outcome of the select committee’s deliberations, just as I have already worked with last year’s consultation process.

You would not know it from the media coverage, but this is not actually a new initiative.

It was the subject of an issues paper last year and submissions were made, but interestingly the concerns now being raised by some elements of the business community were not made during the consultation process.

While I am always open to looking at issues and potential pitfalls associated with any tax change – and I will look seriously at the concerns now being raised – I am nevertheless deeply wary of eleventh hour lobbying campaigns from vested interests being taken as a sound basis on which to construct policy.

We all need to look at the pros and the cons; the costs and the benefits.

Back to the broader context, so much of the tax policy work programme is aimed at supporting fairness and economic efficiency and building a more productive and competitive economy.

Work on taxing foreign retirement savings, extending the active income exemption to branches, GST for cross-border issues and mutual recognition falls into this area.

Much of this work will involve ensuring that the tax system remains fit for purpose in a changing world.

If the tax system needs to be examined to ensure it is fit for purpose, the same is certainly true for the tax administration.

### Delivering better public services

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will speak more about her department’s business transformation programme so I will keep my comments on this to a minimum.

An important starting point is the reality that Inland Revenue’s work is markedly different today from twenty years ago.

Then, the department was solely a tax collection agency.

Today it is the government agency most people deal with on matters from child support to Working for Families, to KiwiSaver and student loans repayments, as well as their tax affairs.

In addition, in response to taxpayers’ service expectations, a growing number of those interactions occur online.

In my view, IRD continues to discharge its duties efficiently and effectively, but I know that these factors have combined to put pressure on the department’s computer system, FIRST, which in turn is becoming a significant constraint on the department’s operations.

To illustrate this, I am told that it is taking longer to implement the current changes to the child support scheme than it took to implement the original scheme in FIRST in 1991.

We need to change the revenue system through business process re-engineering supported by new technology.

An important part of the business transformation programme is to make interactions with Inland Revenue as simple as possible.

Delivering this programme will inevitably take time.

This means that over the next few years, Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver policy changes quickly will be especially constrained by complex systems implications.

That is not great - but it is the reality we are faced with.

Unless there are overwhelming other reasons, tax policy will generally try to ensure that tax rules are as simple and consistent as possible and minimise “special cases”.

The Cabinet will consider the department’s business case for the overall direction of its transformation programme later this month.

I will be making more announcements on this in the weeks to come.

### Information sharing

In discussing delivering better public services, there is one policy area I will touch on that needs to change significantly and quickly.

That is how Inland Revenue engages with the wider public service. Central to this is the ongoing reconsideration of tax secrecy.

I am committed to maintaining confidentiality of information provided by taxpayers but I also want Inland Revenue using the skills and information it has to support other agencies in achieving their roles.

In the middle of that is a practical and sensible balance that can be struck.

Work to date has resulted in Inland Revenue working more closely with, and providing more information, to the Ministry of Social Development.

Work is currently progressing well on how Inland Revenue can contribute to preventing serious crime.

The focus is also on how Inland Revenue can support the Government’s business outcome goals.

Much of this work will be service-focused but will also consider how tax information can support business regulatory agencies achieve their goals.

### OECD Base-Erosion, Profit-Shifting Initiative

Shifting further afield, an area which is much in the news these days is international tax avoidance.

The OECD has recently launched a project on so-called Base-Erosion and Profit-Shifting, known by the slightly melodic acronym of BEPS.

Let me begin by saying that the issues addressed in BEPS are not new.

Tax systems have increasingly grappled with issues of international tax avoidance over the last two decades, as production and distribution systems have become globalised and multinational.

Media discussion, however, has involved, and sometimes confused, two related issues.

The first is that arrangements by multinational firms can sometimes lead to a situation where income escapes taxation entirely.

That is, there can be double non-taxation of some income.

The second, is that changes to the way international business operates, for example in the digital economy, can cause a strain around the edges of how countries tax businesses operating across borders.

The Government has a two-pronged approach to this issue.

Domestically it is continuing to respond vigorously against international tax arrangements designed to reduce New Zealand’s domestic tax base.

Second, it is an active participant in the OECD’s BEPS work, to keep informed of international trends and to shape the policy development.

With regard to the first issue, New Zealand has always sought to protect its taxation rights.

Some people in this audience might even think that we have been too enthusiastic.

But I will not apologise for that.

Taxes from companies as a percentage of total taxes in New Zealand are among the highest in the OECD.

This is simultaneously a sign of both our success and our vulnerability.

The Government has acted both through changes to tax policy and through tax administration.

On the policy side, actions include introducing the bank minimum equity rules, recharacterisation of stapled stock, elimination of conduit, and tightening the thin capitalisation rules.

And we continue to propose changes where necessary, as with the recently released Officials’ Issues Paper on thin capitalisation.

On the administrative side, Inland Revenue has successfully pursued avoidance cases related to international tax arrangements.

The use of anti-avoidance rules can raise potential concerns.

One of the goals of our tax policy and administration is to provide certainty for businesses in making business decisions.

This means that as much as possible, tax consequences should be set out in the legislation rather than be resolved through litigation and anti-avoidance provisions.

But we do not live in an ideal world.

The complexity of business arrangements and New Zealand’s tax system, especially as it interacts with the tax systems of other countries, means that it is impossible to develop rules which deliver the full intention of government policy in all cases.

With BEPS, these efforts move to the international scene.

This has a potential upside and also a potential downside.

It is in no one’s interest to have double non-taxation resulting from a more or less random application of taxation on international transactions.

New Zealand has moved to address this issue in its domestic law. Some other countries have been less effective in doing so.

An international focus on eliminating double non-taxation is supported by this Government.

Accordingly, we are very active in OECD discussions on this issue.

On the other hand, there is a risk that the public discussion gets ahead of both the nature of the problem and the ability to achieve practical solutions.

We all want to avoid hasty, poorly targeted knee-jerk reactions to alarmist reports.

Looking at no media in particular!

But at the same time, as we have shown, we are prepared to act if necessary.

Some issues can be addressed unilaterally.

Others however, raise complex issues, such as which country gets to tax what income.

These issues require multilateral changes, where different countries will have different economic interests in the outcome.

Such multilateral issues will be much more difficult to progress.

Work will likely proceed on a number of fronts.

Many of the areas being examined are intended to help countries more effectively exercise their taxing rights.

For example, ensuring that CFC rules apply appropriately to prevent the offshoring of domestic income is important.

Special provisions, such as effective thin capitalisation rules can protect the domestic tax base.

The OECD could have a role in helping to identify and promote international best practice in these areas.

Other areas, such as taxing the digital economy, raise fundamental issues.

It has been a cornerstone of international taxation that simply exporting goods to a country should not expose a company to income taxation by the importing state.

On the other hand, in some cases it could be argued that a firm is effectively carrying on a business in a country and should be taxed.

On a similar note, the growth of online shopping is also beginning to affect New Zealand’s GST base.

Although fundamentally many people agree that goods and services purchased online from off-shore retailers should attract GST, a system that collects this revenue efficiently and effectively is difficult to attain.

Nevertheless I have asked officials to consider the options.

This is hard stuff.

They are big and complex issues with no easy solutions or quick fixes.

But we must be prepared to think outside the box in coming to solutions.

One area that has been raised in Australia and abroad is publishing the tax paid by companies operating in a country.

Obviously, there are many complex issues involving taxpayer confidentiality that would need to be carefully examined before we were to go down this path.

And the amount of taxes paid, on its own, would provide a misleading picture of a company’s affairs within a country.

Taxes may be high or low for many reasons completely unrelated to international tax avoidance.

On the other hand, compliant companies might find it advantageous to promote their image as good corporate citizens by spontaneous release of this information.

This is an area where caution is important.

We will continue to follow developments abroad with considerable interest.

I would also be most interested in your views on the issues that this approach would raise.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I would like to thank you again for this chance to address you.

I believe that it is important that you have an opportunity to hear some background on the underpinnings of our tax policy.

But I also believe it is equally important that I hear from you.

Good policy, as ever, will lie in the middle.

Over the last few years there has been a considerable amount of soul-searching, both inside and outside of government on the best direction for tax policy.

I think that the conclusion that we should stick with our BBLR framework reflects an appropriate and pragmatic balancing of the many issues which underlie tax system design.

I hope that this also allows you to see the work programme in its broader context, rather than simply as an ad hoc grab bag of issues.

It most certainly is not that. I can assure you that there is method in the madness!

Finally, as always I invite your questions and comments to prove it! Thank you.

Ends.

### Tax info-sharing may help fight crime

The Government is seeking public feedback on proposals for Inland Revenue to share some information with other government agencies to help fight serious crime, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne, Justice Minister Judith Collins and Police Minister Anne Tolley announced today.

Inland Revenue holds certain information, such as income or tax history, or business connections, that could help other government agencies investigating serious crimes punishable by four or more years’ imprisonment, and ranging from violent crime to wildlife smuggling, to investor fraud or immigration scams.

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne says valuing and protecting tax secrecy remain top priorities.

“However, we also want common sense outcomes that will benefit society in areas where there is a general consensus that information sharing would be useful.

“We are seeking public feedback on the proposal through an online consultation as well as the standard consultation processes, to allow the fullest possible public participation.

“People can have their say online with five scenarios showing how Inland Revenue might share information related to serious crime. People can agree or disagree with each scenario, and post their views or reply to others’ comments,” Mr Dunne says.

“It’s important for the Government to get the public’s views on sharing individual’s tax information between government agencies.

“We want to know what concerns people may have, and the safeguards people might want in place before any changes are made.

“Protecting people’s rights to privacy and confidentiality are critical,” Ms Collins says.

Police Minister Anne Tolley says the proposals will put Police in a better position to fight serious crime.

“The Government is looking for a balanced approach that protects a taxpayer’s right to privacy, but at the same time making sure offenders are held to account when evidence of serious wrongdoing is held by Inland Revenue.

The proposals make it clear that information can only be shared with other government agencies when probable serious crime is likely to be uncovered.

She says the Government is looking for a balanced outcome.

A detailed discussion document is also available online at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](/publications/2013/2013-dd-targeting-serious-crime)
.

If people prefer, they can make a formal written submission.

Speech

### Keynote Address to EMA Annual Payroll Conference

Rendezvous Hotel, Auckland  
9.15am, Tuesday 9 April 2013

Good morning

Thank you for inviting me to join you once again.

It is a pleasure to be here as I always find your conference programme very informative.

There is a direct link between tax policy and the work that you do and this gives me confidence in the way that we develop tax policy in New Zealand.

The policies that I announce as Minister of Revenue will (all going to plan) in due course become law and people come together here to discuss their implementation.

So you are clearly interested in getting to grips with tax legislation.

In fact, I see that the session immediately following my address is concerned entirely with tax changes, though I venture to suggest that you should probably update the programme to exclude mention of car parks!

But that raises an interesting point: how does the Government develop tax policy?

What safeguards are in place to ensure that the tax policy we develop is in the best interests of the New Zealand taxpayer?

I would like to explain to you today, the process whereby an idea becomes a proposal and then makes its way into law.

My starting point is perhaps the obvious: the Government has a keen interest in ensuring that we have good tax policy and all New Zealanders have an important role to play in the process.

### Government’s objectives

At the same time, New Zealand must prepare itself to deal with economic shocks — whether they arise from offshore as in the case of the Global Financial Crisis or domestically as with the Christchurch earthquake and the current drought.

For example, the Finance Minister has estimated that the cost to the economy of the drought could be as much as $2 billion.

To absorb such blows it is important that the government maintains a strong balance sheet, which means we must have a robust revenue base to finance government spending.

It is also important that taxes are levied as fairly and efficiently as possible.

We achieve this by raising taxes in ways which do as little as possible to discourage sensible decisions by individuals and businesses.

In New Zealand that means a tax system that has a broad-base, low-rate framework, where taxes are applied at a low rate, but widely and evenly.

Now, fuelled no doubt by some recent events, some political commentators have suggested that the Government is scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to get every last dollar.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

If that were the case, the Government would simply raise tax rates and introduce exotic new taxes, such as the financial transactions tax which some Euro zone countries and others are contemplating.

But we are not doing that.

Instead we are addressing inequities and anomalies in the tax system to strengthen the system while also continuing to collect revenue efficiently.

In other words, our focus is on ensuring that the taxes which currently exist are applied fairly and equitably.

It is in this context that officials develop tax policy which supports the Government’s objectives.

### GTPP

By and large, our tax policy formation process is widely recognised as good, open and consultative.

But it has not always been the case.

It used to be that the tax policy development process was not formalised.

Some tax policy was effectively designed in a vacuum, while other proposals were extensively consulted on; the introduction of GST springs to mind.

Businesses were sometimes taken by surprise by tax proposals — the infamous entertainment tax announced on Budget night 1992 is a prime example of this.

It came as a surprise and I would venture to suggest not a pleasant surprise either.

That type of approach understandably left the business community in quite some uncertainty as to the direction of tax policy and even the thinking behind policy changes.

I imagine payroll people had to scramble to keep up with tax changes.

This patchy approach to consultation was inefficient and consequently produced tax policy of variable quality.

The Review chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson, and known thereafter as the Richardson Review – not to be confused with the Minister of Finance of the time – was formed in reaction to these concerns.

It recommended a more formalised approach to the way that tax policy is developed in New Zealand.

Firstly the Review addressed the issue of practicality of tax proposals and recommended that the tax collection agency have a more prominent role in developing tax policy.

It meant that tax policy could be developed in the context of real world considerations for the practicalities of implementing law changes.

Along with that change came the introduction of what is known as the Generic Tax Policy Process (or GTPP to insiders).

The principal feature of GTPP is public consultation – allowing the public to have a say on proposals early in the development process to try to ensure that tax policy is workable and that compliance costs are kept to a minimum.

The new approach recognised that the best policy was produced when there was adequate consultation.

There are times when certain tax policy proposals are not subject to consultation prior to any amending legislation being introduced into Parliament.

For example, on occasion the Government may need to act swiftly to close a loop hole however businesses will usually have the opportunity to express their views through the select committee process.

Looking back since that period, I would say that the tax landscape has had a sense of continuity about it, across successive governments.

Of course each new government has its own aspirations for the country and the economy and the tax system is a means for achieving that, yet despite that, we have had remarkable stability, and I think that your contribution has been a part of that.

Today New Zealand’s generic tax policy process is upheld as an example of how to do good tax policy and is emulated by other countries.

Even so, very few countries today run as open and transparent a process for developing tax policy, where taxpayers can have real influence over the design of a policy.

### Consultation

Typically in New Zealand, formal consultation runs for six weeks.

After that period officials assess feedback received and will, if necessary check back with submitters to clarify points.

Frequently the draft proposal is amended in response to feedback.

The proposal is then written into draft legislation.

Once it is referred to the Parliamentary select committee, submitters have a second opportunity to comment by providing evidence directly to the select committee.

The vast majority of tax proposals go through the generic tax policy process and by the time they reach Parliament as draft legislation, interested parties such as payroll professionals, the general public and tax professionals have been consulted and had an opportunity to comment and provide input.

Major concerns will have been considered and reported on to Ministers.

While there will always be areas of disagreement on policy changes, there will have been ample opportunity for the legislation to have been modified to take account of concerns that have been raised in consultation and to ensure that the proposals are more workable.

So GTPP has transformed the tax policy process and provided certainty and good, fit-for-purpose tax policy.

However, the process is only as good as the response to it – it is a bit like the old story of leading the horsed to water, but not being able to make him drink.

If businesses and taxpayer groups do not take advantage of the GTPP, it becomes a little difficult to sustain subsequent complaints and criticisms about the policy that emerges.

### Work programme

And to provide extra certainty and remove surprises, every 18 months the tax policy work programme is published on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website.

I encourage you to have a look at that website and familiarise yourself with the work programme.

This work programme is not dreamed up by officials in an ivory tower.

The private sector is consulted and much of the programme comes from the private sector.

I encourage you to have a look at the tax policy website and familiarise yourself with the work programme.

I would like to announce an important consultation process today that ties into the use of Inland Revenue information for some very real public good.

This morning, I am jointly announcing with my ministerial colleagues, Hon Judith Collins, Minister of Justice, and Hon Anne Tolley, Minister of Police, a discussion document seeking feedback into a proposal for Inland Revenue to share information as appropriate where it can help catch serious criminals.

While privacy concerns will remain at the heart of any and all decisions, and while secrecy around tax information is a key value in taxation, we are looking at how we can perhaps also use that information appropriately to fight crime.

And we are talking about serious crime – that which would have a term of imprisonment of four years or more.

It could include offences from violent crime, to wildlife smuggling to immigration fraud.

Inland Revenue is scrupulous in maintaining taxpayers’ privacy, but this has to be balanced against the greater good for the community in certain other areas.

I think society is ready to express its views on these issues and balance their priorities and concerns.

We will be running both an online and standard consultation process until May 21.

If you have a view on whether or not this should proceed, then I encourage you to express it.

You can find the online consultation at www-targetingseriouscrime.ird.govt.nz \[site no longer available - see [Internet Archive](http://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/ArcAggregator/arcView/frameView/IE18352817/https://targetingseriouscrime.ird.govt.nz/)\
 for archived version\]

### Reflections on the process

Let me return for a minute to the GTPP.

I think that it generally works well, but there is always room for improvement with any process.

The process is intended to ensure that adequate consultation occurs, and that the voice of the public is heard.

Ideally, information should come through as early as possible in the consultation process.

This means that all views are considered and assessed.

Any tax policy proposal is a balance between conflicting considerations.

Reasonable people can have different opinions depending on the weightings they give to different priorities.

It is probably also a useful reminder for officials to achieve a balance between what is good for the revenue and what is good for the tax system.

Officials need to consider what is desirable from a tax policy perspective (for example, fairness and efficiency across the tax treatment of employee remuneration), administration and compliance costs.

Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance.

In New Zealand we have a very high rate of compliance with the tax laws because people believe that the laws are generally fair.

I want to ensure that we continue to have that trust in the tax system and the GTPP has an important role in building that trust.

While I believe that GTPP provides huge benefits to tax policy formation in New Zealand, I am always keen to improve processes and would be interested in any suggestions that you have on this matter.

### Conclusion

What the Generic Tax Policy Process provides is certainty for businesses and better quality policy by allowing business input into the development of tax proposals.

For the process to work, all parties have to see advantages from taking part in it – if they do not see that they can affect outcomes, the process is damaged.

This then, is the approach we have developed for consultation on tax and tax-related policy proposals in New Zealand.

In our experience, the Generic Tax Policy Process has proved a useful tool for developing good tax policy and for assisting government decision-making, as well as ensuring a large degree of public or sector buy-in or at least an understanding of the policy objectives and what trade-offs the Government has made.

Because of the part you play in helping to implement tax law changes, it is crucial that you express your views on tax proposals.

I hope my talk today has given you an insight into how tax policy is formulated.

I thank you for the opportunity to discuss this with you.

Ends.

### Dunne: multinationals tax report shows NZ on track

The latest report on international progress in reviewing the taxation of multinationals shows New Zealand is well placed on the issue, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

The Treasury and Inland Revenue officials’ report on the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) work takes stock of New Zealand’s rules and provides an update on its continuing work.

“It is almost universally accepted that this is a global issue that requires – and is getting – a global response, but my determination is that New Zealand drives that hard and is to the forefront of the work, and that is happening,” Mr Dunne said.

“This report certainly gives me confidence that we are strongly in that mix and contributing. Our tax laws are at or above world standards,” he said.

Mr Dunne said that the multinationals tax issue is not new and current global concerns have arisen due to a range of factors.

”There has been a worldwide trend towards lower company tax rates – and this includes New Zealand – as economies look to encourage business, but it has also included growing mismatches between different countries’ tax systems.

“Multinationals often do not pay tax in the countries where they are headquartered, owned, or where their business is done because of deficiencies in domestic laws and the application of tax treaties.

“Many countries, including New Zealand and other OECD nations, only tax foreign companies on activities that they actually perform in their countries and multinationals have exploited these differences to minimise their global tax liabilities.

“So the root of the problem lies in how nations work, or fail to work together – and that is why the answer is the global response that New Zealand is involved in working towards,” Mr Dunne said.

He said New Zealand, like every other country, still has a responsibility to ensure its own domestic tax rules are sound.

“And our tax laws are strong. We have always sought to protect our taxation rights and we act quickly to address problems with our rules as they arise.

“New Zealand has a vigilant and responsive approach to tax issues,” he said.

“On the policy side, actions include introducing the bank minimum equity rules, re-characterisation of stapled stock, elimination of conduit, and tightening of the thin capitalisation rules.

“And we continue to propose changes where necessary, as with the recently released officials’ issues paper on thin capitalisation.”

Mr Dunne said the ongoing OECD work will help highlight areas where New Zealand can further strengthen its domestic laws.

Transparency of the New Zealand tax affairs of multi-nationals doing business here is also an issue worth considering, Mr Dunne said.

Australia has proposed that the Australian tax affairs of large multi-nationals should be made public in a simplified way.

”Such a move, in itself, is not a complete solution as there are many factors to consider.

“Taxes paid may be high or low in comparison to turnover for any number of reasons, but I have tax officials monitoring the Australian proposals very closely,” Mr Dunne said.

He said that the Government will continue with its two-pronged approach to the issue; participating in international efforts particularly, while working on further strengthening domestic rules.

Feedback sought on taxation of land-related lease payments

### Dunne: views sought on taxing land-related lease payments

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has welcomed the release today of a tax policy officials’ issues paper exploring options to reform the rules around land-related lease payments such as lease transfer payments and ‘key money’ payments.

The paper, [_The taxation of land-related lease payments_](/publications/2013/2013-ip-land-related-lease-payments)
 suggests rationalising the current rules by introducing generic income, deduction and timing rules for all land-related lease payments.

“Rationalising the rules would help overcome current uncertainties where provisions in the Income Tax Act could result in similar payments being treated differently, giving inconsistent results for taxpayers,” Mr Dunne said.

The suggested changes would follow the lease inducement and lease surrender payment reforms introduced in the [Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill](/bills/64-1)
, which is currently before Parliament, he said.

Under the new proposals, payments for leases or licences of land for a term of less than 50 years would be treated as deductible to the payer and taxable to the recipient.

A separate timing rule is also proposed, to spread the income and deductions over the term of the land right. This would give more cohesion to the rules and give greater certainty to taxpayers over how the rules should apply, Mr Dunne said.

The proposals would change the tax treatment of some lease payments from the status quo.

“For example, lease transfer payments that are generally made by incoming tenants to existing tenants for the transfer of a lease, and which are currently non-taxable to commercial tenants, would become taxable under the suggested changes,” Mr Dunne said.

“This is because the current non-taxable nature of lease transfer payments, together with the proposed taxation of lease surrender payments introduced in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill could distort the commercial decisions of existing tenants.

“Left unchanged, there would be a tax advantage for a commercial tenant to receive a non-taxable lease transfer payment over a taxable lease surrender payment, which is clearly unfair,” he said.

Payments derived by tenants of residential premises are excluded from the proposals.

Other changes under the proposals include making lease modification payments tax deductible that are currently non-deductible to commercial tenants. Also, payments for a permanent easement that are currently taxable would become non-taxable to the landowner.

The timing rules for income from key money would also be rationalised and spread over the term of the lease rather than six years as it is currently.

Together the changes would bring about “a more consistent and coherent tax treatment of land-related lease payments and make it easier for businesses to apply the rules,” Mr Dunne said.

The issues paper, [_The taxation of land-related lease payments_](/publications/2013/2013-ip-land-related-lease-payments)
 is available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website, www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. Submissions close on 4 June.

May 2013 1 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Black hole expenditure fact sheet Intellectual property Resource consents Introduction When costs are incurred in earning business income, that income can usually be offset by those costs for tax purposes. Certain business expenditure however does not result in a tax deduction, either immediately or over time and is commonly referred to as “black hole” expenditure. The Government is proposing some changes and clarifications to the tax treatment of some types of business expenditure. Proposed changes  Capitalised expenditure on legal and administrative fees that would have been part of the depreciable cost base of a patent application or plant variety rights, but where no depreciable asset is recognised for tax purposes, will be made immediately tax deductible.  A taxpayer will receive the deduction in the income year in which they decide to no longer proceed with seeking the registration of the applicable intellectual property right. Making capitalised expenditure that would have been part of the depreciable cost base of a patent application or plant variety rights, but where no depreciable asset is recognised for tax purposes, tax deductible helps to improve the symmetry between the tax treatment of expenditure on successful and unsuccessful projects. Providing a deduction for this expenditure will remove a disincentive to obtaining intellectual property rights in respect of innovation.  Fixed-life resource consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 to do something that otherwise would contravene section 15A (dumping of waste in coastal areas) or 15B (discharging hazardous substances from ships and offshore installations) of that Act will be made depreciable for tax purposes.  Expenditure incurred in relation to abandoned resource consent applications that have not been lodged will be made immediately tax deductible. Currently taxpayers are required to lodge the application in order to access the deduction.  A taxpayer will receive the deduction in the income year in which they decide to no longer proceed with seeking the grant of a resource consent. Making fixed-life resource consents depreciable fits within the Government’s depreciation framework, as their economic benefits are consumed over their lifetime. This change also improves the consistency May 2013 2 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Company administration costs of the tax system, as it grants these resource consents the same tax treatment as other fixed-life resource consents. Requiring taxpayers to lodge an application for a resource consent that is no longer sought solely in order to access a tax deduction is not a satisfactory policy outcome. Eliminating the requirement to lodge an application will remove unnecessary compliance costs for taxpayers.  All direct costs associated with the payment of dividends by a company to shareholders will be made immediately tax deductible.  The annual fee for listing on a stock exchange will be made immediately tax deductible.  The initial cost of listing on a stock exchange and the cost of additional share issues will be confirmed as non-deductible for tax purposes.  It will be clarified that annual shareholder meeting (AGM) costs are immediately tax deductible.  Costs incurred to hold special shareholder meetings will not be deductible for tax purposes. These proposals are intended to clarify some capital/revenue boundaries related to some common company administrative costs. Providing an immediate tax deduction for all direct costs associated with the payment of dividends will minimise compliance costs for taxpayers and provide certainty around the tax treatment of such costs. The annual fee for listing on a stock exchange is being made tax deductible because it is a regular expense that provides only a short-term benefit. Initial listing and subsequent share issue costs are to remain non-deductible, as these create benefits that persist indefinitely. These changes clarify the tax treatment of these expenditure items for taxpayers. Specifying that AGM costs are tax deductible and that special shareholder meeting costs are non-deductible will reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Taxpayers will be required only to allocate expenditure between the AGM and special shareholder meetings (if any), rather than apply the capital/revenue test to special shareholder meeting costs. These changes also provide certainty to taxpayers about the tax treatment of these costs. Legislation These proposed changes will be included in a tax bill to be introduced later this year and will apply from the 2014/15 income year.
Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue 16 May 2013 Multinational investors – paying fair share of tax Changes to the thin capitalisation rules will help ensure multinational companies investing in New Zealand pay their fair share of tax, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne says. The changes flow from an issues paper released earlier this year. “New Zealand welcomes foreign investors, but we expect everyone participating in the New Zealand economy to contribute their share of tax,” Mr Dunne says. The thin capitalisation rules are designed to address the situation where non- resident investors can artificially load debt into their New Zealand investments to limit their tax exposure, so limiting interest deductions for foreign-owned firms. However, they currently apply only where one non-resident owns 50 per cent or more of a New Zealand investment. This means that the rules apply to traditional multinational companies, but not to other types of non-resident investors, such as private equity investors. “If other types of investors have the ability to take excessive interest deductions which reduce their tax liability, then that is not fair. The thin capitalisation rules should apply,” Mr Dunne says. The Government has therefore decided to extend these rules to where non-residents are acting together, and together have a controlling interest of a New Zealand investment. This change is expected to generate $20 million over three years from 2014/15. Another area of concern is around the issue of shareholder debt, which can allow companies operating in New Zealand to have excessive levels of debt without the thin capitalisation rules applying. “This defeats the intent of the rules, so we have decided shareholder debt should be excluded from the worldwide group safe harbour debt calculations. “And this also means that groups with high levels of external debt should not be affected by these changes. “Some technical issues still need to be resolved, including defining the „acting together‟ test and making sure that extending the application of the rules to trusts does not inadvertently affect benign structures, Mr Dunne says. “My officials will continue to work with interested parties to ensure the legislation works in practice.” Legislation for the changes is expected to be introduced later this year, and the changes will apply from the start of the 2015/16 income year. Media contact: Mark Stewart 021 243 6985 Fact sheet – thin capitalisation changes The thin capitalisation rules form part of New Zealand‟s international tax rules that protect our tax base. Debt incurred in earning income can be used to offset income, thereby reducing tax liability. The thin capitalisation rules are designed to address the situation where non-resident investors can artificially load debt into their New Zealand investments in order to limit their tax exposure. What is changing?  The thin capitalisation rules currently apply only when a single non- resident owns 50 per cent or more of a New Zealand investment. The rules are being extended so they will also apply when a group of non-resident taxpayers are acting together and collectively own 50 per cent or more of a New Zealand investment.  Shareholder debt will also be excluded from a company‟s worldwide group safe harbour debt calculations. This will help to discourage shareholders from recharacterising dividends into interest, but it will also make sure the thin cap rules do not impact businesses with high levels of genuine third-party debt.  These changes follow an officials‟ issues paper that was released in January this year with proposals to tighten the thin capitalisation rules.  Some technical details of these changes, such as what constitutes acting together, are still being worked through. Additionally, decisions have not yet been made on the other issues discussed in the issues paper. Officials are working with interested parties to ensure that the resulting legislation effectively targets the areas of most concern, but does not impact benign business structures.  These changes will be included in a bill later in the year and will apply from the beginning of the 2015/16 year. Why are these changes being made? These changes to the thin capitalisation rules respond to techniques and structures that can defeat the intention of the rules. The changes will help ensure the thin capitalisation rules continue to protect New Zealand‟s tax base.

Hon Todd McClay  
Minister of Revenue

20 June 2013

### Address to the EMA Central North Island Annual Payroll Conference, Novotel Hotel Lakeside, Rotorua

I’d like to thank you for inviting me to join you today.

As the Member for Rotorua and the Minister of Revenue, it is especially appropriate that my first speech to a conference in my new portfolio is to you today.

While the portfolio is new to me, I am no stranger to the world of tax, having served on Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure committee (known in Wellington as the FEC).

Through my involvement with the FEC I have come to take greater interest in tax matters so I was really pleased that the PM asked me to take up the portfolio of Revenue Minister.

You have invited me here to discuss tax policy and I am sure there are many in the audience today who would be able to set me straight on a number of tax technicalities.

That’s a good thing, because one thing I have quickly spotted is that there is a direct link between tax policy and the work that you do.

The policies that I announce as Minister of Revenue will (all going to plan) in due course become law and people come together here to discuss their implementation.

So you are clearly interested in getting to grips with tax legislation.

Not many are, sadly.

Tax may not be glamorous, but tax changes affect us all in some way so it is in our own interests to take note of proposed changes and express your opinion.

Because the really good thing about how tax policy is developed in New Zealand is that it allows and even seeks and considers your views on proposed changes.

It is appropriate that this is your inaugural conference because as a starting point for a discussion about tax, I would like to talk to you today about the process whereby an idea becomes a proposal and then makes its way into tax law.

And as one cannot talk about tax changes without discussing last month’s Budget, I will also touch on changes announced in the Budget.

But my starting point is perhaps the obvious: what are the Government’s objectives for tax policy?

#### Government’s objectives

I appreciate that when tax policy changes are announced, it can have implications for you good people gathered here today.

The Government collects around 55 billion in tax revenue each year.

Of that, 39 percent of its revenue — that’s around $21 billion in the 2011/12 year — comes through Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT).

And the fact that the vast majority of that is handled quickly, efficiently and with minimal fuss through payroll systems is a testament to your work.

The Government is very appreciative of your work and I want to assure you that we do not embark on changes lightly.  
As I said before, tax affects all of us so it’s important that the tax system is managed carefully.

Unwise tax changes can see taxes intrude on decisions and tend to encourage individuals and businesses to do things that would not be sensible in the absence of tax decisions.

The Government has an ongoing programme of maintaining a broad-base, low-rate tax system that does as little as possible to distort the decisions of businesses and individuals.

We want New Zealand to be a good place for businesses to locate in and for individuals to live and work.

For that we need to continue to maintain the tax system, ensuring that our tax laws continue to be effective.

This requires a constant process of tax changes supporting our broad-base, low-rate system.

Looking to the immediate future, I do not envisage changes to the basic tax frameworks as they are fit for purpose.

By that, I mean that the tax system does what it is meant to do and does so relatively efficiently — and that is to collect and dispense funds as appropriate.

Tax policy work will instead focus on improvements within the current framework aimed at supporting the Government’s intention to ensure fairness in the tax system and its objectives for the economy.

New Zealand must prepare itself to deal with economic shocks — whether they arise from offshore as in the case of the Global Financial Crisis or domestically as with the Christchurch earthquake and the recent drought.

For example, the Minister of Finance has estimated that the cost to the economy of the drought could be as much as $2 billion.

To absorb such blows it is important that the Government maintains a strong balance sheet, which means we must have a robust revenue base to finance government spending.

The Government remains on target to return the government’s books to surplus, and it is achieving that through careful economic and fiscal management.

Getting debt under control and reducing our over-reliance on foreign debt are the most important things we can do to steer us towards a more secure economic footing.

So it is important that New Zealand maintains robust taxes to finance government spending in ways that are as fair and efficient as possible.

The Government has resisted the impulse to raise revenue by imposing new taxes or raising tax rates.

Instead, it is taking a responsible approach to raising revenue by addressing inequities and anomalies in the tax system to strengthen the system while also continuing to collect revenue efficiently.

It does this by removing loopholes in the existing tax bases to reduce investment distortions and increase fairness so that the tax burden is spread more evenly.

It is also putting more focus on enforcing current rules.

Budget 2013 was a good illustration of this approach.

#### Budget 2013

Budget 2013 had a focus on building a more competitive and productive economy, and a return to surplus in 2014/15.

Our expected return to surplus in 2014/15 which, incidentally, makes New Zealand almost unique amongst developed nations is being driven in large part by recovering tax revenues.

Core tax revenue receipts are currently ahead of expectations and are being driven, in part, by a bigger company tax take as our economy continues to grow.

So let me assure you, that as the new Revenue Minister, I am not anticipating any radical shifts.

This is no time to abandon a formula that is working and the announcements made on Budget day are a continuation of the theme the Government has adopted over the four previous Budgets; namely, to protect the revenue base and make the system fairer to all taxpayers.

The Budget has new spending of $900m but the big focus is on better quality spending rather than more spending.

I am sure you are all well aware of the main tax announcements, but to recap, they were:

*   A proposal to allow tax losses arising from R&D expenditure to be accessed early by small start-up firms which supports the government priority of building a competitive economy. A consultation paper is to be released later this month.
*   The announcement of a base protection measure to tighten the thin capitalisation rules to limit interest deductibility, particularly where a group of non-residents are acting together.
*   Increased funding for Inland Revenue to continue its compliance focus on property investment. A consultation paper has also released seeking feedback on proposals to clarify the date of acquisition of land to help determine if it has been acquired with an intention to sell.
*   And an announcement of a proposal to provide tax relief for six areas of black hole expenditure by making them either deductible or depreciable.

All in all, a continuing focus on ensuring that the taxes which currently exist are applied fairly and equitably.

It is in this context that officials develop tax policy which supports the Government’s objectives.

#### GTPP

By and large, our tax policy development process is widely recognised as good, open and consultative.

But it has not always been the case.

It used to be that the tax policy development process was not formalised.

Some tax policy was effectively designed in a vacuum, while other proposals were extensively consulted on; the introduction of GST is an excellent example.

Businesses were sometimes taken by surprise by tax proposals — the infamous entertainment tax announced on Budget night 1992 is a prime example of this.

That type of approach understandably left the business community in quite some uncertainty as to the direction of tax policy and even the thinking behind policy changes.

I imagine payroll people had to scramble to keep up with tax changes.

This patchy approach to consultation was inefficient and consequently produced tax policy of variable quality.

A review of the process recommended some profound changes.

Firstly the Review addressed the issue of practicality of tax proposals and recommended that the tax collection agency have a more prominent role in developing tax policy.

It meant that tax policy could be developed in the context of real world considerations for the practicalities of implementing law changes.

Along with that change came the introduction of what is known as the Generic Tax Policy Process (or GTPP).

The principal feature of GTPP is public consultation – allowing the public to have a say on proposals early in the development process to try to ensure that tax policy is workable and that compliance costs are kept to a minimum.

The new approach recognised that the best policy was produced when there was adequate consultation.

There are times when certain tax policy proposals are not subject to consultation prior to any amending legislation being introduced into Parliament.

For example, on occasion the Government may need to act swiftly to close a loop hole, however, businesses will usually have the opportunity to express their views through the select committee process.

Changes are now much more extensively consulted on – I imagine there are some here today who will remember the introduction of KiwiSaver, for instance.

Today New Zealand’s generic tax policy process is upheld as an example of how to do good tax policy and is emulated by other countries.

Even so, very few countries today run as open and transparent a process for developing tax policy, where taxpayers can have real influence over the design of a policy.

#### Consultation process

Typically in New Zealand, formal consultation runs for six weeks.

After that period, officials assess feedback received and will, if necessary check back with submitters to clarify points.

Frequently the draft proposal is amended in response to feedback.

The proposal is then written into draft legislation.

Once it is referred to the Parliamentary select committee, submitters have a second opportunity to comment by providing evidence directly to the Finance and Expenditure committee.

As an aside, as the former Chair of that select committee I have been impressed by the number of people who take the time and effort to make a submission.

I fully appreciate that tax legislation can be complex, but that should not daunt you.

I have seen that Inland Revenue officials are committed to the consultation process and try to be helpful by explaining matters as clearly and simply as possible.

The vast majority of tax proposals go through the generic tax policy process and by the time they reach Parliament as draft legislation, interested parties such as payroll professionals, the general public and tax professionals have been consulted and had an opportunity to comment and provide input.

Major concerns will have been considered and reported on to Ministers.

While there will always be areas of disagreement on policy changes, there will have been ample opportunity for the legislation to have been modified to take account of concerns that have been raised in consultation and to ensure that the proposals are more workable.

So GTPP has transformed the tax policy process and provided certainty and good, fit-for-purpose tax policy.

The process is intended to eliminate uncertainty, ensuring that adequate consultation occurs, and that the voice of the public is heard.

#### Work programme

And to provide extra certainty and remove surprises, every 18 months the Government’s tax policy work programme is published on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website.

I encourage you to have a look at that website and familiarise yourself with the work programme.

In developing the work programme, officials provide advice on proposals based on the Government’s objectives and on feedback from taxpayers.

As Revenue Minister, it will be my joint responsibility, along with my colleague the Minister of Finance, to set the direction for the work programme.

The work programme, I must stress, is not dreamed up in isolation.

The proposed black hole expenditure tax change announced in the Budget is a case in point where the private sector brought a certain matter to officials.

I am not announcing an updated tax policy work programme today — that will be later this year.

There is no particular secret about what the new work programme will incorporate, it is simply that no decisions nor any firm recommendations have yet been made.

I will take some time to listen to others’ views on what should be the forthcoming priorities.

What I can tell you is that we will continue on our broad-base, low-rate framework for the tax system.

We will also continue with measures designed to support economic performance.

And I certainly do not envision any big changes to the tax system.

As I said before, an exciting Budget may not be desirable.

And the same is true for a tax policy work programme developed in isolation.

Lack of clarity about Government’s priorities or the future direction for tax policy spells uncertainty for business.

Today, the tax policy work programme is developed in consultation with the private sector to understand its priorities and issues and the finalised work programme is published on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website.

#### IRD’s business transformation

Any discussion of the tax system must also include mention of the tax administration.

You have probably heard about Inland Revenue’s transformation programme.

My predecessor, the Hon Peter Dunne saw the need for change and worked hard to drive this programme and I would like to acknowledge his efforts in this regard.

Mr Dunne saw that customer service expectations were changing and that the role of the department itself had evolved.

Today Inland Revenue is the government agency most people deal with on matters from child support to Working for Families, to KiwiSaver and student loans repayments, as well as their tax affairs.

In addition, in response to taxpayers’ service expectations, a growing number of those interactions occur online.

I don’t claim to have an in-depth knowledge yet of how the department operates, but in my view, IRD continues to discharge its duties efficiently and effectively.

However I am also aware that these factors have combined to put pressure on the department’s computer system, FIRST, which in turn is becoming a significant constraint on the department’s operations.

To illustrate this, I am told that it is taking longer to implement the current changes to the child support scheme than it took to implement the original scheme in FIRST in 1991.

But it’s not just a simple question of installing a new computer system.

Our tax system, like other parts of Government, needs to be readily accessible for all New Zealanders – from individuals through to small businesses and large companies.

New Zealanders are getting used to doing many things instantly, easily and on-line – whether it’s booking an air ticket or managing their bank balance.

They want to be able to deal with Inland Revenue as easily as that.

And that means a tax and social policy system that is straightforward to deal with – and well designed to accommodate changing needs and new demands.

Inland Revenue – the way it works and the way it delivers services – must be able to change and deliver in a world that’s moving fast.

It’s our opportunity to build a 21st century tax system that will best serve the needs and requirements of Government and the public.

That’s the work my predecessor set out on, and which I am very excited to be picking up.

Cabinet has approved in principle the case for major change at IRD and asked the department to proceed with more work.

While many details are yet to be worked though, I know that Inland Revenue will be engaging with the business sector and with software developers (the people who build your payroll software) on this and other matters in the future.

As with consultation on tax policy changes, consultation on this will be carried out to ensure that a wide range of views are heard.

Given your important role in the system, I want to make sure your voice is heard.

#### Conclusion

Which brings me back to consultation and the Generic Tax Policy Process.

I can see the strong value of it and am committed to ensuring that it continues.

What the Generic Tax Policy Process provides is certainty for businesses and better quality policy by allowing business input into the development of tax proposals.

But for the process to work, all parties have to see advantages from taking part in it – if they do not see that they can affect outcomes, the process is damaged.

In our experience, the Generic Tax Policy Process has proved a useful tool for developing good tax policy and for assisting government decision-making, as well as ensuring a large degree of buy-in, or at least an understanding of the policy objectives and what trade-offs the Government has made.

I believe that GTPP provides huge benefits to tax policy formulation in New Zealand and am committed to it, and as part of that commitment, I am keen to strengthen the process and would be interested in any suggestions that you have on this matter.

Because of the part you play in helping to implement tax law changes, it is crucial that you express your views on tax proposals.

Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance.

In New Zealand we have a very high rate of compliance with the tax laws because people believe that the laws are generally fair.

I want to ensure that we continue to have that trust in the tax system and it is my firm view that the GTPP has an important role in building that trust.

I thank you for the opportunity to discuss this with you.

### Top Issues in the Revenue Portfolio

Minister of Revenue, Todd McClay has today released Inland Revenue’s supplementary Briefing to the Incoming Minister (known as the BIM) that outlines the key issues facing the tax system.

Mr McClay said that the tax system was in good shape. The last few years have been particularly difficult for many New Zealanders as the government has dealt with headwinds from the GFC and the significant impact of the Canterbury earthquakes.

“The message I want to convey is that New Zealand is actually very well served by its tax system. The work of the last few years has greatly improved the integrity and the fairness of our tax system, particularly better alignment of tax rates. We’ve also tackled the issue of tax compliance in the property market and work is continuing in that area,” says Mr McClay

The coming months would see an increase in engagement with New Zealand taxpayers over the future role of Inland Revenue and its Business Transformation programme. Inland Revenue oversees collection of around $55b each year and the 7,000,000 registered taxpayers can expect value for money service which is modern and takes account of a changing business and tax environment. An example of the changing nature of Inland Revenue’s interaction is where 93% of individual tax returns were filed electronically for the quarter ending 31 March 2013 and 82.3% filed for the year to date”

“Inland Revenue and I will be engaging directly with New Zealanders on Business Transformation with a view to seeking the widest possible feedback on ways for Inland Revenue to further engage, reduce red tape and unnecessary compliance and create a more business friendly environment,” says Mr McClay.

International tax rules were increasingly becoming important in respect of protecting the tax base.

"In particular I have welcomed the OECD report on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPs) and will be working closely with the Commissioner to ensure New Zealand is an active part of this multilateral process.   My officials will also report on other options for further strengthening our international tax rules later this year,” says Mr McClay.

Since receiving his Ministerial appointment on 11 June Mr McClay has overseen the passage of the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation and Remedial Matters) Bill, has begun consultation on tax policy changes to remove tax distortions on research and development costs for start-up Kiwi businesses, and public consultation on the tax treatment of charities following deregistration, has addressed an inaugural payroll conference in Rotorua and opened Inland Revenue’s new office in Christchurch.

“The document that I am releasing is a supplement to the full BIM that was produced in 2011. Together the two documents provide a good insight into the real issues facing the tax system in New Zealand. New Zealand’s tax system is in very good shape and the envy of many nations. It comes through careful and considered tax policy development – not knee-jerk reactions. We’ve got a plan, it's working and we’re sticking to it” says Mr McClay.

Speech

### Opening Address to Fundraising Institute of New Zealand Annual Conference

I’m pleased to be here with you today.

I would like to thank James Austin, CEO of the Fundraising Institute of New Zealand for inviting me to your conference. James tells me that this is an _educational_ conference aiming to impart many of the fundamental pieces of information any charitable organisation will need to succeed. I’m glad to hear it.

The objectives of FINZ according to James, are to grow philanthropy in New Zealand and in so doing, ensure that fundraising is ethical and run as professionally as possible. These are admirable objectives.

I believe that to be really effective in their role and achieving their objectives, not-for-profit organisations may not be businesses in the normal sense, but they need to operate in a business-_like_ manner.

So I urge you to take full advantage of the knowledge and wisdom being shared here today — the work that the not-for-profit sector does goes beyond the immediate recipients of your services and the Government has a direct interest in the sector being as productive as possible.

On behalf of the Government and the people of New Zealand, I would like to thank you for the very good work you do for your communities and for New Zealand. I would like to contribute to that education in a small way by talking about the tax implications for charities because these are quite important for the sector.

I cannot advise you on what forms to fill in or how to manage your tax affairs but I will talk today about the philosophy behind the Government’s tax policies for the not-for-profit sector, how those policies are developed and how the not-for-profit sector can engage in and influence policy formulation. I will also discuss current tax policy work and work coming up in the future relating to the sector.

So how does the Government view the not-for-profit sector? To answer that, perhaps we should first look at what support the Government provides through the tax system.

#### Support through the tax system

A key way that Government has always supported the sector through the tax system is of course, financially, with:

*   Income tax exemptions
*   FBT exemptions
*   And, of course tax incentives for charitable giving

Subsidising not-for-profit organisations through the tax exemption ensures that those members of society who do not donate to charitable organisations but who nevertheless benefit indirectly from them, contribute through their general tax payments.

These forms of Government support are based on the concept that the services that not-for-profit organisations provide are complementary to the programmes that the Government provides as part of its social objectives, and assist in furthering those objectives. Or to put it plainly — we’re grateful for the work you do and the services you provide and want to see you do well.

#### A framework for tax policy

In order to help you do well, the Government seeks to develop sound policies for the not-for-profit sector. I said before that not-for-profit organisations need to be business-like. You owe it to the people depending on you and to the people who donate to you. And equally, Government needs to be business-like in its tax treatment of charities.

Tax policies for the not for profit sector fall into two main categories: tax exemptions and tax relief. In developing policies in these categories, and to help ensure your continued work we apply some basic principles to tax policies formulated for the not-for-profit sector. And these are that we aim for simplicity in tax rules so that you know what your obligations are, we aim to maintain the integrity of the tax system in these rules and above all, we strive for fairness.

These principles are all interwoven — allow me to elaborate. Simplicity is a precious commodity in tax law. Because of what it is, tax law becomes horribly complex as the Government tries to ensure that all loopholes are closed off and everyone pays their fair share of tax. At the same time, there are always people who seek to get out of paying tax, so the legislation becomes increasingly complex.

It becomes so complex that people build careers out of understanding and interpreting tax law. Inevitably that results in compliance costs. Compliance costs may be inevitable, excessive compliance costs is something that the Government is opposed to and seeks strenuously to minimise.

The last thing we want to do is to impose excessive compliance costs on the sector. By keeping rules as simple as possible, we reduce compliance costs and people have greater clarity of what their tax obligations are. If you understand your obligations, you’re more likely to comply.

Which leads me to the integrity of the tax system. The tax system is here to serve New Zealanders. The money collected is used to fund all the various government services and functions that New Zealanders expect and require. As we all use those services, we all need to pay our fair share of tax.

The tax system needs to minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and must provide a suitable revenue base for the Government. The Government has improved the integrity of the tax system already through alignment of the top tax rates, reducing the opportunity for people to seek tax shelter in trusts for example.

Maintaining the integrity of the tax system is ongoing work. As exemptions are available for not for profit organisations, you can see that there is potential for integrity to be threatened. The Government is committed to the support it provides to the sector – we need to ensure that the support is going to where it’s needed.

And the final point is about fairness. Tax policies have to be fair to the sector and also to the taxpayer. Fairness is something you hear about a lot in relation to tax. You will have heard it in discussions about taxing large multinationals, collecting GST on online purchases, and a host of other topics. The bottom line is that everyone must pay their fair share of tax. For legitimate charities, tax exemptions are available and that is as it should be because society values your services.

In formulating tax policy, the Government has to weigh up what is good for the integrity of the tax system versus the will of society. That is quite an undertaking. We don’t really expect to do this on our own.

So how do we do it?

#### Tax policy process

The simple answer is that we follow a process for policy development, which ensures that policies are sound, workable and fit for purpose. It is a well-established, proven process known as the Generic Tax Policy Process (or GTPP) and this is simply an acknowledgement that Government cannot develop tax policy in isolation.

In assessing the merits of individual policy options relevant to the not-for-profit sector, consideration is given to the effect they would have on the growth of the charitable and non-profit sector in New Zealand and the resulting benefits to New Zealand.

The policy options should also be fair. A policy that provides financial support represents a cost to the taxpayer and Government.

The costs of different policy measures that need to be considered include:

*   the cost to businesses, community and voluntary organisations and individuals of the costs of complying with the tax rules;
*   administrative costs, that is, the cost to the Government of administering the tax rules, and
*   what can be termed deadweight costs - the costs that arise from the effects of the tax system on decisions to produce, consume, work, save and invest .

Consideration of these benefits and costs will inevitably lead to policy trade-offs being made. These are increasingly important considerations. In times of economic adversity, it is necessary to ensure careful fiscal management and also to ensure that Government revenue is protected because certain Government services and functions must continue – preferably without having to borrow to fund them.

Maintaining a stable revenue stream is absolutely critical in retaining international confidence. But maintaining such a stream is not simply a matter of gathering as much tax as possible – the focus has been on making changes at the margin within our current framework to make it fairer and more efficient.

We are aiming for the best possible tax system designed by the best possible policy and supported by the best possible tax administration. A tax policy proposal is only good if it is workable and reflects the will of the people and is finely focused on its objectives. To be good policy, it must be practical and fit for purpose and the best way to achieve that is through proper public consultation, a key feature of the GTPP.

I therefore urge you to take advantage of opportunities to comment where tax policy proposals affect your work.

#### Charities de-registration

You may be aware that right at the moment, there is public consultation taking place on a matter affecting charities. On 18 July a consultation document [_Clarifying the tax consequences for deregistered charities_](/consultation/2013/clarifying-tax-consequences-deregistered-charities)
 was released for public comment. The consultation document sets out possible changes to the tax rules to clarify the tax consequences for charities that are removed from the Charities Register. Charities that register are eligible for tax exemptions.

This piece of work is an example of the quest for simplicity and clarity.

When de-registering, for whatever reason, a charity presently can face significant and complex tax implications. What is proposed in the consultation document is an earnest attempt to clarify and simplify those tax obligations.

The vast majority of charities who find themselves in this situation will, I hope find that their tax obligations are clearer. Most do try sincerely to observe and follow the rules. For others (a tiny minority) it is perhaps questionable whether they are in fact a charity.

It appears that they may have found themselves a loophole and exploited the rules pertaining to charities and taken advantage of the exemptions available. This mentality is the reason why tax rules become so complex. For these outfits, I can assure you we will come down hard on them. Cowboys like this do nothing for the community and turn the general public off donating making it even harder for the many reputable charities.

I urge you to read the proposals on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website.

Consultation closes on 23 August so you still have time to make your voice heard.

#### Further work

Looking ahead, the work we have on hand is not on a large scale. I think that generally speaking, we have the major policy settings about right for the not-for-profit sector. The focus will instead be on refinement and improvement of the overall integrity and coherence of the charitable income tax exemption and the tax incentives for charitable donations.

In particular, work will largely relate to charitable giving by the general public. As you know, donors may be eligible for tax relief on cash donations they make to done organisations. It’s important that donors are clear about who they can give to and legitimately claim tax relief on their donations.

The measures include:

*   Resolving a number of technical problems relating to donee organisation requirements. The donee status requirements are different from those for charitable entities, and this has given rise to confusion and compliance costs for charities and donors;
*   Dealing with transactions where there has not been a “true” gift. We have seen some schemes that allow charitable donations tax incentives to be claimed in circumstances when there has not been a “true” gift.
*   Improving the Schedule 32 process for approving overseas-focussed charities. Donee organisations that send funds overseas or that carry out charitable purposes overseas pose specific risks. There is increased opportunity for serious wrongdoing through fraud and money laundering and it is more difficult to verify whether the charities are actually carrying out charitable purposes overseas.

The timing of this work will be determined as the Minister of Finance and I set the next 18 month tax policy work programme.

These are some of the current and upcoming policy matters that will affect the not-for-profit sector. But we should also remember that a good tax system comprises good tax policy supported by good tax administration and I’d like to turn now to something that affects you as equally as everyone else, regardless of your tax status.

#### Business transformation

I spoke before about the Government’s determination to minimise compliance costs and to keep things as simple as possible. I want to talk to you briefly about Inland Revenue’s administration and how the modernisation of the revenue system fits into New Zealand’s future, and therefore into your future.

The Government is committed to making it easier for customers to deal with government agencies. For example, you may be aware that over recent years Inland Revenue and the Charities Services have worked closely to enhance their services to charities.

But you will probably also know there are still many opportunities for further services improvement in a wider government context. Dealing with government services needs to be easier, less confusing and less expensive.

The world is changing and New Zealanders have changing expectations of how they interact with government. People want to be able to interact with government services when they want to – 24 hours, 7 days a week.

They want to be able to do business with government agencies as easily and safely as with any other business. Mobile services are becoming faster and easier to use. More people have tablets and smart phones, allowing people to self-manage their tax obligations and social support entitlements, whenever and wherever they are.

People want to spend less time on paperwork, especially on providing the same information to multiple government agencies.They want to do it online.

Agencies need to share information when that’s the right approach — while, of course, always protecting people’s privacy and security. This is all great, large scale stuff, but why focus on Inland Revenue?

It may seem obvious, but people can forget that the government uses taxpayers’ money to pay for services we all need, such as health care, social services, education, environmental protection and recreation. Inland Revenue plays a critical part in supporting New Zealanders every day, through the collection of taxes, distribution of social entitlements and the administration of KiwiSaver.

The revenue service delivers the funds to pay for most of the services that New Zealanders depend on. Vital services such as distributing $200 million a year in Child Support, or collecting more than $2billion in KiwiSaver contributions are provided directly by Inland Revenue. Touching the lives of so many New Zealanders – individuals, families, the non-profit sector and businesses – Inland Revenue will play a key role in the government’s desire for better public services for everyone.

New Zealand is recognised as a great place to live in and do business – we must keep working to ensure we stay that way. The Government is committed to meeting this expectation: delivering better and cheaper services and Inland Revenue’s transformation will play a leading part in delivering these changes to government services. Online and mobile services will be faster and easier, allowing people to manage their tax obligations and social entitlements with certainty and security.

At the same time government agencies need to be able to manage, use and share relevant and accurate information to provide better services and to protect against fraud. Sharing and using information appropriately will support government’s “no wrong door” approach across government.

Keeping the balance between protecting New Zealanders’ privacy and the security of their information while at the same time enhancing government’s ability to combat crime and fraud will remain a strong underpinning principle in this work.

Obviously Inland Revenue can’t make these changes on its own. We are looking to work with people, other government agencies and organisations that have the right skills to help us. There will be opportunities for businesses and other organisations to be involved throughout the change programme.

I hope you will take the opportunity to be part of this – the not-for-profit sector has much to gain from an efficiently running tax system.

#### Conclusion

Looking at Government’s tax policy activity in the not for profit space over the last few years, we can see that the Government has demonstrated the value it places on the sector by introducing tax incentives to provide financial support for the sector and simplifying policies to facilitate charitable giving.

In devising tax policy, the Government is keen to ensure continued support for the sector, but must balance that with the various considerations that come into play. That intention to provide support still remains, I assure you, but tax policy work in the foreseeable future is more modest in its scale compared to what has gone before.

To ensure that tax policies continue to support the sector, the Government relies on the sector to express its views on tax proposals. With the Generic Tax Policy Process, you have a voice and I, as Minister of Revenue, am keen that that voice is heard. By doing so you are contributing to the development of sound, practical tax policies affecting this very important sector of New Zealand’s society.

I hope my talk today has given you an insight into how tax policy is formulated and how and why the Government is considering the modernisation of the revenue system for New Zealanders. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss these matters with you.

Hon Todd McClay  
Minister of Revenue

19 September 2013

### Address to the NZ Payroll Practitioners’ Association Annual Conference

Thank you for your welcome and thank you inviting me to speak to you.

Since your last conference much has changed. Most obviously is the fact that you have a new keynote speaker. I hope I can live up to the high standards set by my esteemed colleague and predecessor, the very able Mr Dunne.

He spoke highly of you and of your conference, describing it once as “where the rubber of the economy hits the road”.  By that he meant that in Wellington, ensconced in the Beehive, we might devise exciting new ideas for the economy, but right here is where we see it played out in the real world where payroll professionals discuss implementing those policies.

Your work is at the very heart of our economy — the reason why we all go to work — people getting paid to do their jobs. I think Mr Dunne was right, and taking my cue from him, I look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with you.

For me, the past few months have been a steep learning curve as I get to grips with all the changes I need to accommodate in my new portfolio. But while I am coming to terms with changes, I still need to keep on top of the day to day requirements of being Minister of Revenue.

The Revenue portfolio is a very busy one with a steady stream of legislative reform going through  the House at any one time. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of the new changes, but it’s important to ensure that the business as usual work keeps going during periods of change.

And that’s what I’d like to talk to you about today.

#### Business transformation

Some of you may be aware of Inland Revenue’s transformation programme.

It’s an ambitious project and as I look into the way that Inland Revenue operates and the changes that it is contemplating, I am struck by the magnitude of the possible changes. But I am also deeply conscious of the fact that in the face of all this change, it is crucial to ensure that the business as usual work continues.

I know that Mr Dunne has spoken to you in the past about the need for change so I won’t go into that again. We’ve all read the news reports about Inland Revenue needing a new computer system. The truth is that IT changes are just a _part_ of what Inland Revenue is contemplating. I’ll come back to that later.

#### Managing change

It must be said that Inland Revenue has a good reputation for modernisation and managing change. I was interested to see that back in 1994, Inland Revenue was being congratulated on its successful implementation of its (then) ground-breaking FIRST computer system.

Yes that’s right: back in the early 90’s FIRST was considered a marvel amongst tax administrations and the department hosted a number of international delegations who came to New Zealand to learn from it. Quite rightly, it was a very big deal at the time, representing a major shift in how Inland Revenue managed the tax system.

And remember, FIRST did not happen overnight – it was phased in over 5 years.

There undoubtedly were teething problems –it’s almost inevitable in such large projects, but the important thing is that it was successful – surpassing even the original designers’ expectations, as it now manages more than just tax, Child Support, Working for Families and Student loans but also KiwiSaver. But the world keeps turning and customer expectations evolve and therefore service delivery must adapt.

In the face of great change, some things still stay the same and I might say; _must,_ stay the same. Tax must continue to be collected. And to keep the machine running smoothly, ongoing repairs and maintenance have to be carried out on the tax system, that is, to the operating system (FIRST) and the legislation. 

This ensures that tax continues to be collected fairly and efficiently, and people receive their entitlements correctly. It is absolutely crucial that this work continues in the background. It is this that will ensure our success.

My job, as the Minister of Revenue therefore, is primarily to oversee the development of fair and efficient tax policies which will deliver the necessary revenue to fund government services and support the Government’s objectives for the economy.

#### The tax system

The objective is not to collect as much tax as possible, but to collect the fair and correct amount from each taxpayer, and it needs to do it efficiently so as to minimise costs on the taxpayer.

Taxation and the tax system have to be both fair and efficient. The Government’s focus in the tax system following the Financial Crisis has been on maintaining a stable revenue base. In times of economic adversity, it is necessary to ensure that government revenue is protected because certain government services and functions must continue; preferably without having to borrow to fund them. That approach will see the Government’s books return to surplus, not through wholesale tax grabs, but by diligently ensuring that most people pay the tax that is due.

It has been suggested that the financial woes of some states in the EU stem from an overly relaxed attitude to debt, imprudent spending and a proud tradition of tax evasion. For example, I remember reading of a Greek tax collector who, on arriving to conduct an audit was confronted by a whip-wielding Athenian! Indeed, Christine Lagard of the IMF has expressed the view that Greece can help lift itself out of its economic woes by simply paying its taxes.

The reason we’re in a better position here in New Zealand where most people recognise the value they receive in return for their taxes and most people comply with their tax obligations voluntarily is because they see that generally the tax system is fair. Our tax system with its low rates and a broad base is a sound and equitable approach to taxation and is much admired internationally.

We will continue to refine and improve, but generally, our tax system is just about right. The focus must now be on modernising our tax administration – that is ensuring that it fit for purpose for the 21st century.

I will be releasing details of the updated tax policy work programme once it is agreed. Those details haven’t been finalised yet, but I can tell you that we will continue with the broad base, low rates approach. And an important aspect of the policy work programme will focus on ensuring that we have the appropriate tax administration and legislative framework to support and enable the transformation of Inland Revenue. This is work that has been in train for some time.

#### What we’re already doing

In some ways, the future is already here. Today Inland Revenue connects with the public in a range of ways. Inland Revenue is already embarking on many of the changes that will fundamentally change and simplify the way New Zealanders engage with the tax system. Taxpayers can already manage a range of tax transactions online. Around 1.6 million taxpayers for instance, are self-managing their tax affairs online through myIR, which is a web portal.

If you think back to when you began your career, it was a different world wasn’t it? With a lot of paper. I’m sure some of you here may remember life before the Employer Monthly Schedule (or EMS) and electronic communication with Inland Revenue. Some of you will remember the tedious business of getting employees to fill in IR 12 forms and then sending those on to IRD at year-end as part of the annual payroll reconciliation process. 

Now this information is provided monthly via the EMS and Inland Revenue completes the summary of salary and wage details for each employee at year end.

Changing to the EMS was a big change. Maybe it’s time to make another change.

#### Improving PAYE

The PAYE system is a marvellously simple theory yet in practise, it consumes a great deal of your time. PAYE and ESCT account for around $21 billion of government revenue, so clearly it’s hugely important that it functions smoothly and efficiently.  But I’m sure no one here would describe PAYE as efficient as it could be, would they?

I know, from talking to many people that the Employer Monthly Schedule, central to the PAYE system, is responsible for a great deal of rework. A fundamental issue with it is that it is labour-intensive, often requiring double-handling and repeat contacts from IRD, thus making it a significant burden on employers.

Inland Revenue is conscious of this, and makes efforts to help. By contacting employers with overdue employer monthly schedules, last year they reduced the number of employers with overdue schedules by 24%. That’s great of course, because it means those businesses have avoided penalties and interest, but this approach is not a smart solution.

So that makes the EMS a prime candidate for a makeover. And I’m really talking about an _extreme_ makeover.It really is timely that Inland Revenue is looking atstreamlining PAYE – making sure that systems are designed to make it as easy as possible for employers to share the information they need to with Inland Revenue. 

If the purpose of the EMS is to provide employment information to Inland Revenue to administer the tax system, why can’t your payroll system provide that information digitally? At a single stroke, we’d greatly improve the efficiency of a major vehicle of the tax system and reduce compliance costs for employers.

We’d achieve this through a much greater reliance on electronic media and a system which allows accurate, validated information from employers at the first interaction providing near real time confirmation and improved status reporting. Because while an efficient tax system can have benefits for an economy, in order to be most beneficial, the task of collecting tax needs to be as simple and efficient as possible.

We realise that introducing such a thing would require wide consultation and close collaboration with software developers. We’ll be kicking off that consultation soon and software developers and payroll providers will be key groups we want to talk to and hear views from. It’s a sign of the times that an important relationship for Inland Revenue these days is with your software developer to keep them informed about changes and to implement the annual changes required for meeting payroll obligations.

The department will be looking to engage with New Zealanders and business on the changes to ensure that the tax administration system reflects your needs and expectations.

This will be crucial for Inland Revenue’s delivery of its business transformation.  I can assure you now that you will be hearing from us over the coming months. 

#### Public service efficiency

But innovation is not just about flashy IT projects. Necessity, as the cliché has it, is the mother of invention. Following the Canterbury earthquakes we found that government agencies can be very flexible and find new ways to work if need be.

So for example, we found courts being convened on marae and different agencies, like Work & Income and Inland Revenue working together to provide frontline services to those in need. That spirit of the public service working more cohesively together is to be encouraged and legislation has been passed which provides for greater sharing of information between Inland Revenue and other government agencies, subject to a range of restrictions.

It makes little sense that a person dealing with a number of different agencies has to provide the same information to each agency. Sharing information is therefore a rational and efficient way for the public to interact with the public service.

There is a cost to collecting taxes, a cost which of course is borne by the taxpayer, so anything which reduces Inland Revenue’s costs is good for the taxpayer and consequently, the economy. Careful sharing of information seems like a very useful way of making the public service function more efficiently — most recently, public consultation has occurred on the topic of sharing information with justice agencies in order to combat serious crime!

#### Next steps

So what happens next?

Last month I launched the next phase of Inland Revenue’s Transformation programme to the market. This is a significant step because the transformation of Inland Revenue will require the expert services of many people from a range of industries over the next decade.

I’ve already mentioned the possible overhaul of how PAYE information is provided to Inland Revenue. If this were to proceed it would be one of the first items you as payroll practitioners would see off the blocks. A range of other initiatives would be rolled out over the decade in four stages.

Exactly how and when that would occur, I cannot say. This is something that the Department will have to work through in conjunction with all interested parties such as yourselves.

What I can say is that if using 20 year old technology the department could deliver all the innovative forms of service delivery we now use and keep itself at the forefront amongst international tax jurisdictions, just imagine what could be achieved in the current transformation over the next ten years.

#### Conclusion

So in drawing to a close, let me say that taxes are necessary, and the work that you do in making PAYE deductions is invaluable.

The tax system requires ongoing changes to ensure efficiency; collecting the revenue it should while keeping the burden of compliance costs to an absolute minimum because the Government is focused on supporting businesses to help grow our economy.

Maintaining our broad-based, low-rate tax framework as well as the changes envisioned at Inland Revenue will support this objective.

Your conference programme looks an interesting one, and one in keeping with an organisation striving to lift the knowledge and practice of payroll professionals.

I wish you a successful conference.

Thank you.

### McClay backs OECD action plan for taxing multinationals

An Inland Revenue report released today by Revenue Minister Todd McClay strongly endorses measures outlined in an OECD action plan dealing with the taxation of multinational companies in relation to base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) concerns among OECD member countries.

“The OECD action plan is a far-reaching document outlining the 15 points of focus over the next one to two-and-a-half years to address base erosion and profit shifting by multinationals. The IRD report supports the OECD approach and the particular focus and priority given to actions recommended in the plan,” says Mr McClay.

“This co-ordinated, structured plan is what we need to tackle this threat to tax bases around the world. As we have always said, we need a global response to this global problem. The action plan represents an international commitment to combat the problem, while the 15 points for action will help establish an international standard for tax rules.”

The IRD report released today recommends aspects of that plan which New Zealand could benefit from implementing. The issue of large multinationals shifting their profits to countries in order to gain the most favourable tax result (known as base erosion and profit shifting) is of huge importance to OECD member states who are concerned about how this practice can distort and erode their respective tax bases. New Zealand officials had participated in the development of the OECD action plan.

“The central issue is that international tax standards have not kept pace with developments in the global economy. While it may seem like a simple matter to clamp down on the corporates involved, Governments are mindful of the threat to international trade arising from knee-jerk reactions. For these reasons it will be difficult for any single country, acting alone, to fully address the issue,” says Mr McClay.

“What we’re looking at is an overhaul of international tax rules to update global tax rules from the industrial age to the digital age. Taken in that context, the OECD’s suggested timetable for addressing the issue over a period of up to two-and-a-half years is dynamic and ambitious. We will continue to support the OECD initiative.”

Mr McClay said that he would be considering both the OECD report and officials’ recommendations outlined in the IRD report and that his decisions would be reflected in the Government’s updated tax policy work programme to be released in November.

“Ultimately, the approach we take in dealing with the problem will have to be tempered by the careful balancing of all the factors involved, including any compliance costs. Consultation with New Zealand’s business community and tax practitioners will be a big part of our approach,” says Mr McClay said.

With regard to another issue that is sometimes seen to be linked with BEPS, the payment of GST on imported goods and services (online shopping), Mr McClay said he is intending to release a consultation paper on the issue later in the year.

The latest report, and earlier reports released in April 2013 and December 2012 can be found on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/year/2013

### Changes to Tax Treatment of Employee and Accommodation Allowances

The Government is to include changes to the tax treatment of employee allowances, reimbursements and employer-provided accommodation in a tax bill to be introduced to Parliament later this month that will bring clarity for many taxpayers.  
  
Revenue Minister Todd McClay said today that a decision by Cabinet to include changes to the Income Tax Act as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill will also minimise compliance and administration costs for many businesses and organisations.  
  
“The current rules around allowances, other expenditure payments and employer-provided accommodation can leave businesses uncertain about the extent to which these payments and accommodation are taxable under different circumstances.  
  
“Under the current legislation, when an employer makes a payment to meet an employee’s work expense, and there is no private benefit, then generally there will be no tax consequences. However there are occasions when the line between what is a private expense and what is solely a work expense is not straightforward. This has been a concern for employers.  
  
“Our message is that the Government has listened to those concerns. A significant number of people spend time working away from their normal workplace, and are paid work-related allowances or have accommodation provided, especially those who are part of the Canterbury rebuild,” Mr McClay said.  
  
The proposed changes include:

*   When an employee is expected to work away from their normal workplace for up to two years, employer-provided accommodation will be tax-exempt. This exemption will extend to up to three years for employees working on capital projects and up to five years for Canterbury earthquake recovery projects.
*   Accommodation or accommodation payments for those working at more than one workplace on an on-going basis will be tax exempt without an upper time limit.
*   When an accommodation benefit is taxable, it will generally be valued at its market rental value. However, for reasons of fairness, a specific valuation rule is proposed for ministers of religion, to reflect longstanding past practice. In that case the taxable value will be capped at 10% of the minister’s remuneration, subject to the accommodation being commensurate with the minister’s position and ministry location.
*   Likewise, a specific valuation rule is proposed for accommodation provided by the New Zealand Defence Forces to a number of its personnel, in recognition of the unique nature of the accommodation arrangement.
*   Meal payments linked to work-related travel will be exempt for up to three months. Meal payments and light refreshments outside of work-related travel (such as conferences) will also be tax-exempt.
*   A specific exemption for payments for distinctive work clothing (to match the outcome where clothing is provided directly by the employer). Plain clothes allowances will also be exempt if paid to employees who are provided with a uniform but because of the nature of their current duties are required not to wear that uniform.

“The proposed changes will potentially benefit a wide range of employees who are required to work away from their normal place of work for a period of time while providing greater certainty, consistency, and fairness for those businesses and organisations who are their employers.  
  
“By providing legislative clarity around these tax rules, the Government is ensuring that it not only continues to support the Canterbury earthquake recovery, but also reduces the cost of doing business.” Mr McClay said.

### Tax Bill gives greater clarity to tax rules

An omnibus tax bill introduced today by Revenue Minister Todd McClay proposes changes to bring greater clarity to the tax rules and make them easier for businesses and other taxpayers to understand and comply with.

Mr McClay said the principal measures proposed in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill are the result of earlier consultation with businesses and other taxpayers, and are aimed at fine-tuning the tax system so that it remains fit for purpose.

“A well-targeted, responsive and efficient tax system is an essential part of the Government’s broader economic aspirations for New Zealand. The measures in this Bill support that goal,” says Mr McClay.

As I announced last week, the Bill introduces proposed changes to clarify the tax treatment of allowances and other reimbursement payments paid by employers to their employees, and employer-provided accommodation.

The Bill also contains measures to deal with distortions arising from the current ‘black hole’ tax treatment of certain items of expenditure. Under the proposed rules, businesses will no longer have to lodge a patent or resource consent application before they can receive a deduction for expenditure incurred on an aborted or unsuccessful application.

“There are also new rules to clarify the tax treatment of agreements for the sale and purchase of property and services and the GST treatment of immigration and other services. Rules that are relatively easy for people to understand and apply will help to minimise compliance and administration costs for everyone,” says Mr McClay.

In addition, the Bill makes changes to New Zealand’s international tax rules. The first of these provides that when the inter-governmental agreement with the United States in relation to its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act is finalised, New Zealand financial institutions will have an appropriate domestic law framework to follow.

The second group of changes are intended to strengthen the thin capitalisation rules which limit how much debt foreign investors are able to place in New Zealand, and the interest deductions that can be taken.

“The bill proposes to extend the inbound thin capitalisation rules to cover non-residents acting together when investing in New Zealand. The rules currently apply only when a single non-resident controls the investment. These changes are an important part of continued efforts to maintain the integrity of New Zealand’s domestic tax rules governing the activities of international businesses here”, says Mr McClay

The Bill contains proposals reforming the income tax treatment of land-related lease payments to protect the tax base and provide certainty and consistency. Following consultation, the Bill proposes to tax lease transfer payments that are substitutable for taxable lease surrender and  
lease premium payments. This is a more targeted approach than that suggested in an officials’ issues paper released in April which involved making all lease transfer payments taxable.

Following consultation earlier this year, the Bill also sets out new tax rules for charities which are removed from the register of charitable entities.

“The proposals are intended to clarify the law so that deregistered charities have a greater level of certainty about the tax consequences of deregistration. The new rules also ensure that donors who have claimed tax relief on donations made to charities which were later deregistered would not generally see this tax relief reversed. Donors who have made bona fide donations in good faith can have a greater level of certainty about the tax treatment of their donation,” says Mr McClay.

Other changes in the Bill, such as clarifications to the GST rules, and introducing a tax exemption for some community housing providers, will make it easier for businesses and taxpayers more generally to understand their obligations.

Finally, the Bill sets the annual rates for income tax for the 2014–15 tax year, and makes minor changes to the child support and Working for Families rules to ensure they work as intended.

“I expect the proposals in this Bill to make a real difference for businesses and taxpayers, as they contribute to an efficient tax administration, one that delivers the services to people that they need to enable them to manage their tax affairs. That’s something the Government will be increasingly focusing on as Inland Revenue’s programme of business transformation gathers momentum,” says Mr McClay.

More information on the bill is available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website, www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz

### Address to Deloitte National Tax Conference  
Deloitte Centre, Auckland

Thank you for inviting me here today to talk about base erosion and profit shifting (or “BEPS” as it’s known as).

BEPS is a matter of growing importance and an issue of real concern to both the OECD and the G20. But there is nothing new in ensuring that international tax rules are robust – it’s been an important part of our international tax reforms in recent years. For that I am immensely grateful and greatly comforted as it means that our tax rules are in a strong position to face this issue.

I’d like to talk today about the current and planned work addressing this issue, but I’ll start with a little background.

The emergence of BEPS as an issue comes through a change in technology and business practices and is part of globalisation. Globalisation of course is not new. But in the last 20 years, the flow of goods and services between countries and international capital flows has exploded worldwide through the growth of the internet and the relentless march of information technology.

Before the economic reforms of the 1980s, the New Zealand economy was one of the most protected outside the Iron Curtain. Since then, economically, socially and intellectually we have built our society around active involvement with the rest of the world.

It’s a good thing and absolutely the correct path to follow for a relatively small and geographically isolated economy such as ours and tax policy has reflected that.

International tax reforms since 2009 have made New Zealand a better place to base an international business as have improvements in New Zealand’s network of tax treaties and reductions in New Zealand’s company rate.

But at the same time, we need to recognise that with globalisation come problems and risks. Tax rules designed for a very physical age of steam power and iron are ill-suited to a world of intangible transactions occurring in cyber-space.

Our rules need to adapt to fit the new reality while still ensuring that New Zealand is attractive to base a business and for businesses to invest and create jobs while ensuring that a fair amount of tax is paid.

Where countries have shared taxing rights because of cross-border trade, they have been at pains to ensure that double taxation does not occur. But what’s happening now of course, is double non-taxation where a company is taxed nowhere in the world.

International tax policy should not be a question of “double or nothing”.

Increasingly, profits can be located anywhere in the world and quite separate from manufacturing and selling activities. Obviously where the profits are located is where the tax base is located.

And to add further complexity, the real value of a multinational enterprise is not to be found in its manufacturing expertise, which is increasingly outsourced, but in the brand name and marketing of the product, in the company’s ability to innovate and its intellectual property.

An increasing challenge for revenue authorities of countries in which goods and services are sold or produced is to ensure that a reasonable proportion of profits are attributable to, and taxable in, their countries.

While it is easy to see where physical production takes place, it is much harder to tell where value is created when a large amount of value creation can relate to intangible assets such as intellectual property.

The rules for determining where multinational profits are located are becoming less clear as knowledge capital rises in importance relative to physical capital and as enterprises become more global.

Ensuring tax is still levied, but at an appropriate level, will require increased international co-operation between tax authorities and increased levels of sophistication by tax authorities.

The internet means it’s quite common for a company to be heavily involved in the economic life of a country without any physical presence which might give rise to a taxing right. And as businesses increasingly integrate across borders and tax rules remain uncoordinated there are a number of technically legal structures which take advantage of differences between international and domestic rules.

Since the Global Financial Crisis there has been a growing awareness of the business practices of these multinationals and a growing concern at the implications for government revenues. And the public are outraged because of the unfairness and because it’s so artificial.

After all, if I were to buy half a pig from a hunter friend I'd be pretty surprised if he was sending 75% of that money to the British Virgin Islands because that’s where he’s sold the intellectual property of his pig hunting technique to.

It’s absurd. Something has to be done. Which brings me to the concrete actions we’re going to be taking to address BEPS.

I’ve said it before, but I think it bears repeating: New Zealand’s international tax rules are in good shape.

Compared with some other jurisdictions we have a robust Controlled Foreign Companies regime, thin capitalisation rules and broad, effective anti-avoidance rules. And our broad base, low rates tax framework means we are freer of the kinds of tax incentives attractive to multinationals for exploitation.

But there is no room for complacency — not by a long shot.

A global response has been led by the OECD and I am very proud that New Zealand has been an active participant in this work and is represented on the OECD’s tax working parties. These groups are focused on ways to address BEPS and to deliver the action plan.

In evaluating our rules as they compare against the OECD action plan, it’s clear that we have work to do. Related-party debt provides an opportunity for multinationals to shift profits. Interest expenses incurred and paid by borrowers are tax deductible, so there is a danger of tax deductible debt or interest rates paid on related-party debt becoming artificially inflated.

Issues relating to high priced debt and abuses of the NRWT rules will all be Considered as part of the new work programme. Hybrid entities and instruments are also areas for further consideration as these are frequently used by multinationals to exploit differences between countries’ domestic tax rules.

In addition to work on these specific issues my officials are continuing to work closely with the OECD. Many of the concerns raised by BEPS cannot be resolved by a single country working in isolation.

At the same time, while we have committed to the OECD global response, that doesn’t mean that we sit on our hands and wait to be told what to do with regard to our own domestic laws.

But first I want to reassure you that the pendulum is not swinging too far in the opposite direction.

Following the Global Financial Crisis and the growing threat of BEPS, it’s easy to bring in knee-jerk responses which reverse the trend towards freer international markets and removing tax impediments. We do not want a return to the pre-1980s Fortress New Zealand.

New Zealand's double tax agreements (usually referred to as DTAs) help New Zealand-based businesses compete abroad and help make New Zealand a more attractive place to invest in. There has been a major focus on the DTA network in recent times. I am looking to continue expanding it, bearing in mind that DTAs provide more bang for our buck when there are (or are likely to be) strong investment and trade flows.

DTAs recently signed with Viet Nam and Papua New Guinea, will bring our network to 39, covering nearly all of our major investment and trading partners – comparable with Australia’s network of 44.

Since 2008 we’ve also focused on bringing our DTAs into line with international norms by securing lower withholding tax rates on dividends and royalties and have updated DTAs with five of our top ten investment partners: Australia, Canada, Japan, Singapore, and the United States.

Negotiating and entering into double tax agreements is not without cost. They also give up revenue, lock in certain positions, and affect our ability to change tax policy. DTAs can provide real benefits for our economy, but we need to be astute in our choices of DTA partners so that they can stand the test of time.

Meanwhile, in line with New Zealand’s commitment to a global, unified approach to combating tax avoidance and evasion, New Zealand will be taking the final procedural step for ratification of the multilateral _Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters_, which will now come into force for New Zealand on 1 April 2014.

The Convention provides the 61 current signatory countries including New Zealand, an extra weapon in their arsenal against avoidance and evasion. As with our DTAs and Tax Information Exchange Agreements, the Convention will allow Inland Revenue to request information from other tax authorities and to seek assistance in collecting outstanding tax debts from taxpayers who’ve move overseas.

A range of initiatives is also being developed to improve the quality and usefulness of information collected by Inland Revenue. As well as beefing up international and domestic tax rules, it’s equally important to ensure that tax authorities have the information they need to assess specific revenue risks and identify any deficiencies in how these tax rules operate in practice. This work includes a simple, high level disclosure form, more detailed information from AIL payers and exploring a code of practice for large corporates.

These are some of the actions the Government will be taking to address the issue of base erosion and profit shifting. It’s a priority because a New Zealand without a fair and efficient tax system would be an economic disaster. One need only look abroad to countries where tax evasion is a national pastime to see why a threat to our tax system is a threat to our economy.

Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance and to work, must be seen to be fair to encourage everyone to pay their fair share of tax. If multinationals can legally avoid paying income tax, then voluntary compliance is threatened.

Addressing these issues is critical both for securing the Government’s revenue and levelling the playing field for businesses. Proposed solutions to the problem will have to take into account all the factors involved, including any compliance costs.

So consultation with New Zealand’s business community and tax practitioners will be a big part of our approach.

New Zealand is a good place to do business and Government policy aims to continue to make New Zealand a better place for businesses to base themselves, invest and grow jobs.

On the international front we continue our focus on ensuring that our tax rules are internationally competitive and, where it is sensible, that our rules on the taxation of offshore investment are in line with international norms.

Today the biggest threat to fairness in the tax system is base erosion and profit shifting by large multinationals, who, not unreasonably, want to maximise their profits. But by doing so through tax avoidance and evasion, they jeopardise the integrity of the tax system.

Engagement with tax professionals such as yourselves will be important in ensuring that tax changes to address BEPS are well targeted and fully  
considered and do not lead to unintended tax outcomes.

Thank you.
