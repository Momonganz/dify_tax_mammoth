Note (not part of the Rulings): These rulings deal with the ability of a registered person to claim a GST input tax credit on the purchase of fishing quota or a marine farming authorisation from an unregistered person. It was considered appropriate to issue four separate rulings given the different nature of the different marine farming authorisations and fishing quota. However, a single commentary applies to all four of the Rulings. FISHING QUOTA AND SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDITS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 03/07 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3) and the definitions of “goods” and “secondhand goods” in section 2, and the definition of “input tax” in section 3A of the Act. Definitions For the purposes of this ruling— “Fishing quota” means - (a) Individual Transferable Quota which has been granted under the Fisheries Act 1983; or (b) Individual Transferable Quota which has been granted under the Fisheries Act 1996. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of fishing quota. The supply of the fishing quota must satisfy the following conditions: 1. The supply by the vendor is a supply made by way of sale. 2. The supply is not a taxable supply. 3. The supply is made to the purchaser, who is a registered person. 4. The fishing quota is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. 5. The fishing quota is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Fishing quota is not “goods” in accordance with the definition of that term in section 2 of the Act. As a result, fishing quota will not constitute “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the Act. • The purchaser of such fishing quota will not be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period any amount of input tax in respect of the supply of the fishing quota. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to a supply of fishing quota where the time of the supply occurs within 3 years from the date on which this Ruling is signed. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of November 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 03/07 to BR PUB 03/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 03/07 to BR Pub 03/10 (“the Rulings”). Background The question being considered is whether a GST input tax credit is available to registered persons who acquire fishing quota or marine farming authorisations from unregistered persons. While this commentary considers both fishing quota and marine farming authorisations, they need to be dealt with separately as there are different statutory requirements for each of them. Before looking at the relevant GST legislation, the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations needs to be considered in more detail. Fishing quota The fishing quota being considered is individual transferable quota as defined in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1996. The Fisheries Act 1996 is almost fully in force. Prior to this, the operative legislation was the Fisheries Act 1983. It seems that the majority of fishing quota was allocated under the 1983 Act. The provisions in the 1996 Act relating to the allocation of quota came into force on 1 October 1997, and the registration provisions under the 1996 Act came into effect on 1 October 2001. The background to the allocation of fishing quota is that it was initially established and allocated in 1986 pursuant to the Fisheries (Quota Management Areas, Total Allowable Catches, And Catch Histories) Notice 1986, which was made under the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota appears to have been allocated based on a person’s commercial fishing history and no charge was made for the quota initially allocated. The quota does not provide a “free” right, however, as an annual levy needs to be paid. These levies are typically significant amounts. While the majority of the fishing quota is held by large organisations, individual fishermen hold some small parcels of fishing quota. Some of these persons may not make supplies in excess of $40,000 in a 12-month period and thus are not required to register for GST under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. One of these persons may sell their fishing quota to another person who is registered for GST. The question arises for the purchaser as to whether a GST input tax credit can be claimed. The nature of fishing quota There is no definitive statement in any of the fisheries legislation as to the nature of fishing quota. “Individual transferable quota” was not defined in the Fisheries Act 1983. While the term is defined in the Fisheries Act 1996, the definition appears to have been added as a means of ensuring that all of the quota allocated under the different Acts and sections of the Acts is regarded as fishing quota for the purposes of the Fisheries Act 1996. This change in legislation appears to have affected the characteristics that could be ascribed to fishing quota. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, the fundamental rights acquired by the holder of fishing quota (as determined from the legislation) were that the holder of the fishing quota had the right to catch and take away for their own purposes: • a specified quantity; • of a particular fish species; • from a particular area (the quota management area); • in a specific period (in a year, although the quota is issued in perpetuity). These rights were able to be dealt with in ordinary commercial dealings in that they could be bought and sold, used as security, and it was possible to register interests against the rights. The nature of fishing quota granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 has been alluded to in a number of court decisions. The Court of Appeal considered the nature of fishing quota in the case of New Zealand Fishing Industry Association (Inc) v Minister of Fisheries (unreported, CA 82/97, 22 July 1997, Wellington). The case involved the judicial review of a decision made by the Minister of Fisheries to reduce the total allowable commercial catch (TACC) for snapper in quota management area 1. The Court of Appeal made various comments regarding the nature of fishing quota. At page 16 of the Court’s judgment, Justice Tipping stated: While quota are undoubtedly a species of property and a valuable one at that, the rights inherent in that property are not absolute. They are subject to the provisions of the legislation establishing them. That legislation contains the capacity for quota to be reduced. If such reduction is otherwise lawfully made, the fact that quota are a “property right”, to use the appellants’ expression, cannot save them from reduction. That would be to deny an incident integral to the property concerned. The Court of Appeal confirmed that fishing quota is property, although it provides little in the way of further guidance on its precise nature except to state that its characteristics must be determined from the legislation. Further clarification was provided by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith \[2003\] 2 NZLR 23. In dealing with a contractual dispute, he stated that fishing quota is a statutory chose in action (at paragraph 5 of the judgment): The root of title is the issue under the quota management system (the QMS) of individual transferable quota (ITQ) which is a statutory chose in action comprising a fraction of the total of exclusive rights to fish commercially a particular species of fish within one of the ten quota management areas into which the exclusive economic zone is divided. Rights to ITQ are codified by the relevant legislation, especially the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 and the Fisheries Act 1996. This dicta, while useful, does not fully explain the rights and obligations that arise in relation to fishing quota, particularly in relation to change in the nature of the entitlement under the Fisheries Act 1996. The position under the Fisheries Act 1996 is different to the previous position under the Fisheries Act 1983. One of the major differences in relation to the rights derived by holding fishing quota is the introduction of the concept of an “annual catch entitlement”. Instead of the fishing quota providing a right to catch a specified amount of fish, the fishing quota now “generates” an annual catch entitlement on the first day of the fishing year. Fish are now generally caught under the authority of a fishing permit and an annual catch entitlement (there is also a deemed value payment procedure set out in the legislation). For fishing quota holders, the annual catch entitlement is separately tradable, so that for a particular year a quota owner can sell their annual catch entitlement while retaining the fishing quota that will generate another annual catch entitlement the following year. These developments add a further dimension to the nature of fishing quota. The lack of any in-depth analysis of the nature of fishing quota means that it is necessary to examine the characteristics and rights granted under the fisheries legislation. These can then be compared to recognised categories of property. If they are sufficiently similar, it may be appropriate to conclude that the fishing quota should be regarded as belonging to that particular category. Alternatively, it may be that the most appropriate conclusion is that fishing quota is not sufficiently similar to anything else and must be regarded as a separate category of property. There have been a number of suggestions as to the nature of fishing quota. The terms “usufruct right” and “profit à prendre” have been suggested as perhaps describing the fishing quota. A further possibility is that the fishing quota might be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods. This commentary will consider these possible classifications in the following order: • Is fishing quota a “usufruct right”? • Is fishing quota the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the goods? • Is fishing quota a “profit à prendre”? Usufruct right The term “usufruct right” is a civil law rather than common law term. As New Zealand’s jurisprudence is based on the common law and doctrine of precedent, the term “usufruct right” is largely unknown to New Zealand law. The basis of this term in the civil law as opposed to common law is confirmed by the definition of the word “usufruct” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (9 th ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995) which provides: usufruct n. (in Roman and Scots law) the right of enjoying the use and advantages of another’s property short of the destruction or waste of its substance. A more expansive definition of the term “usufruct” is found in Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed, West Publishing Co, 1990): In the civil law, a real right of limited duration on the property of another. The features of the right vary with the nature of the things subject to it as consumables or nonconsumables. ... The right of using and enjoying and receiving the profits of property that belongs to another, and a “usufructuary” is a person who has the usufruct or right of enjoying anything in which he has no property interest. ... There are three types of “usufructs”: natural profits produced by the subject of the usufruct, industrial profits produced by cultivation, and civil profits, which are rents, freights, and revenues from annuities and from other effects or rights. The South African case of Geldenhuys v CIR (1947) 14 SATC 419 provided a very full judicial consideration of the nature of a usufruct right. The case concerned the assessability of an amount of income that arose from the sale of a flock of sheep. The taxpayer’s husband died leaving the taxpayer with a “life interest” in her husband’s estate, with their children as the ultimate beneficiaries. The flock of sheep was valued at £1,451 at the date of the husband’s death. The flock declined in number after the husband’s death due to drought, and a lesser number of sheep were sold for £4,941 some years later. The taxpayer used the proceeds from the sale to invest, purportedly for her own benefit. The Commissioner sought to include the difference in the taxpayer’s assessable income. The taxpayer argued that she was unable to be assessed on this amount as she was only a usufructuary in relation to the sheep. This meant that she only had a right to use the sheep, with no liability for waste due to circumstances beyond her control. She accepted that this also meant that the investment did not belong to her. Justice Steyn (with whom Herbstein and Ogilvie Thompson AJJ agreed) delivered the leading judgment. In considering the nature of a usufruct right, Justice Steyn made the following observations at page 424: According to some authorities, ... movables which are consumed or impaired (consumuntur et minuuntur) by use cannot be subject to a full and complete usufruct, but they can be made the subject of an incomplete usufruct, a quasi-usufruct. In this class of movables cattle and animals are, according to the authorities, included. After referring to further texts and commentaries, Steyn J reached the following conclusions at page 428: The passages from Domat and Huber which I have set out above, however, make it clear in my judgment, that with regard to the cattle and other animals to which they refer these authorities hold that the dominium remains with the remainderman; the usufructuary, according to the passage from Huber cited above having no right to sell or kill them and being obliged to restore them. ... The authorities appear to be agreed that the usufructuary is only entitled to the young or progeny over and above the full complement of the flock. The full number of the flock must be maintained, the young replacing the old as they die, but the flock as an entity must be returned .... Application to fishing quota It seems difficult to apply this concept to fish except perhaps in a fish farming situation. The nature of a usufruct right, even if it did apply in a New Zealand context, does not appear to be consistent with the characteristics of fishing quota identified above. A usufruct right is a right to use property without liability for waste. However, under the fishing quota, a person obtains the right to take the relevant fish from the sea and provide these for consumption. The quota owner is under no obligation in relation to all the other fish in the sea. Further, the quota holder does not have to give a school of fish back at the end of the period, although it will obviously be in the quota holder’s best interests to manage the fisheries resources to ensure sustainability in accordance with the principles in the Fisheries Act 1996. It is also noted that a usufruct right is typically granted for a finite period, while the fishing quota is granted in perpetuity. The effect of this is that the characteristics of a usufruct right are not sufficiently similar to the characteristics of fishing quota for there to be any serious possibility that the fishing quota could be a usufruct right. Sale of goods with a licence The concept of a sale of goods with a licence refers to a contract for the sale of goods, where a licence is granted to the purchaser to go onto (typically the vendor’s) land to get the goods. For instance, an agreement for the right to take trees from a property could be the sale of goods coupled with a licence to enter onto the land and remove the trees. Alternatively, the agreement might constitute a profit à prendre, which will be discussed in more detail below. The distinction between an agreement for the sale of goods with a licence and a profit à prendre appears to turn on whether the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, or simply may take the trees. This follows from the definition of “goods” in the Sale of Goods Act 1908. The definition provides that goods “includes emblements, growing crops, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale”. Thus, unless the agreement between the parties requires that the trees shall be severed, the trees will not be goods under the Sale of Goods Act. If the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, then the agreement is more likely a contract for the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the trees, but if the purchaser may take the trees, then it is more likely to be a profit à prendre. This issue was addressed by Justice Young in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104. The case concerned the nature of an agreement between a landowner and a quarrying company where in return for the payment of a royalty, the quarrying company was entitled to quarry for sand and sandstone on the landowner’s property. In distinguishing between a profit à prendre and a contract for the sale of goods, Justice Young states at page 116: Taking all these factors together it seems to me that the document looks more like a profit à prendre than a licence, but I must also look at the distinction between profits and sale of goods. After a considerable search, it seems to me that the most accurate statement of the law in this connection is provided by Hinde McMorland Sim (op cit at 715), where the authors say: “... profits à prendre and contracts for the sale of goods are seen as mutually exclusive, the former consist only of contracts relating to fructus naturales or other parts of the realty where the purchaser has merely a right or option to sever, while the latter consist of: (1) All sales of fructus industriales regardless of who is to sever them; (2) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which are to be severed by the vendor before property passes to the purchaser; and (3) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which the purchaser is under a contractual obligation to sever.” Thus if the document puts on the purchaser an obligation to sever there is a contract for the sale of goods including a licence to go onto the land for the purpose of carrying out the contract, but if the purchaser merely has the option to sever then there is a profit à prendre. In dealing with this issue, Justice Young referred to a statement in Hinde McMorland & Sim on Land Law (1978-79). That statement still represents the view of the authors as it is also included in the latest edition of the book Land Law in New Zealand, Hinde McMorland & Sim (1997, Butterworths, Wellington). On the basis of this, the key distinguishing feature between a profit à prendre and a sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods is that a profit à prendre only gives rise to an option to sever and take the goods, while there will be an obligation to take the goods under a contract for sale. This is consistent with the New Zealand Supreme Court decision in Egmont Box Company Limited v Registrar General of Lands \[1920\] NZLR 741. Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota could be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, assistance can be derived from the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota itself was originally allocated without cost to fishermen based on prior catch histories. In order to exercise the rights under the fishing quota and associated annual catch entitlement, an annual levy is payable. In determining whether fishing quota is the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, the key distinction is whether there is an obligation to take the fish, or whether there is merely an option to take the fish. This question appears to be answered by section 28ZC(3) of the Fisheries Act 1983, and the more recent version contained in regulation 4(3) of the Fisheries (Cost Recovery Levies) Order 2000. It provides that the levy is payable by quota holders irrespective of whether or not the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed to which the quota relates is taken. Given that the levy is payable regardless of whether the fish are caught in relation to the quota, fishing quota should not be regarded as a sale of the fish as there is no obligation to take the fish. It is also noted that the levy charged is for administering the quota management system rather than necessarily being a “price” payable for the fish. Further, the fish are not “made available” either – the quota owner still has to catch the fish. Thus, situations might exist where the quota owner is unable to catch the amount of the particular species for which they have quota, despite having paid the full levy and desiring to catch the fish. The characteristics of fishing quota are more consistent with the quota holder having only a right to catch the fish. Therefore, the terms of the ownership of the fishing quota are inconsistent with it being an agreement for the sale of goods. Profit à prendre It is noted at the outset that the concept of profit à prendre has been referred to in relation to fishing quota in other contexts. The Law Commission in its Preliminary Paper No. 9 “The Treaty of Waitangi and Maori Fisheries” (1989, Wellington) referred to fishing quota as being in the nature of a profit à prendre. At paragraph 4.20 of the Preliminary Paper it states: In economic terms the ITQ scheme has created a new limited monopoly akin to those arising from other restrictive licensing schemes, such as liquor licences and taxi licences. In legal terms it has converted a public right to fish commercially (subject, of course, to regulation) into a series of private rights. It has created a new property right in the nature of a profit à prendre – broadly an ongoing right to take something tangible that is present on another person’s land – and allocated that right to those who held, or had recently held, commercial fishing licences at the time of its commencement. What is a profit à prendre? The nature of a profit à prendre can be gained from the definition in Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1980) Vol 14, “Easements and Profits à Prendre” para 240, page 115: A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person’s land. It may be more fully defined as a right to enter another’s land and to take some profit of the soil, or a portion of the soil itself, for the use of the owner of the right. Profits à prendre are often contrasted with easements or licences. All three items, profits à prendre, easements and licences, confer a right to enter onto land for a particular purpose. However, the distinguishing feature of a profit à prendre is that it confers an additional right to remove something from the land. While this concept has been used in relation to rights to take trees, turf and various minerals, it has also been applied to the taking of fish and other game from land. One of the earlier cases on point is that of Wickham v Hawker \[1835-42\] All ER 1. The case was concerned with the nature of the right provided to an individual providing the “liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling”. The issue was whether this was a personal licence in which case it could only be exercised by the individual himself, or whether it was a right in the nature of a profit à prendre that could be exercised by servants. Parke B made the following observation at page 5: This being the rule of law on the subject, the point to be decided here is whether the liberty granted is a mere personal licence of pleasure, or a grant of a licence of profit – a profit à prendre. The liberty of fowling has been decided, in one case, to be a profit à prendre, and may be prescribed for as such (Davies’ Case (1688) 3 Mod Rep 246). The liberty to hawk is one species of ancupium ..., the taking of birds by hawks, and seems to follow the same rule. The liberty of fishing appears to be of the same nature; it implies that the person who takes the fish, takes for his own benefit: it is common of fishing. The conclusion of the court was that this grant of the liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling was a profit à prendre. This case was followed by the English Court of Appeal decision in Fitzgerald v Firbank \[1895-9\] All ER 445. This case concerned the nature of a grant of exclusive fishing rights in respect of a section of a river. The reason that the nature of the fishing rights was being considered was that the river had been polluted by the defendant discharging waste products from a gravel works into the river which had a significant detrimental effect on the fish in the river. The plaintiff brought an action for an injunction to stop further pollution and for damages for the pollution to date. The Court of Appeal decided the case in favour of the plaintiff. The comments of the various members of the Court are useful in terms of identifying the nature of the fishing rights. Lindley LJ made the following comments at page 448: The right of fishing includes the right to take away fish unless the contrary is expressly stipulated. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Therefore, the plaintiffs have got a right of some sort as distinguished from a mere revocable licence. What is that? It is a good deal more than an easement; it is what is commonly called a profit à prendre. It is of such a nature that a person who enjoys that right has possessory rights that he can bring an action for trespass at common law for the infringement of those rights.... Rigby LJ, in agreeing with Lindley LJ, went on to state at page 450: I hold that, on the incorporeal hereditament, there is a right of action against any person who disturbs them, either by trespass, or by nuisance, or in any other substantial manner. This decision was followed by Farwell J in Nicholls v Ely Beet Sugar Factory Ltd \[1931\] All ER 154. That case concerned the ability of the plaintiff to bring an action of nuisance seeking an injunction to stop the defendant polluting a river in which the plaintiff held two fishing rights. The defendant sought to defend the action by arguing that the plaintiff’s title was not sufficient title to maintain the action in nuisance. The Court held that the plaintiff’s title, which was a profit à prendre, was sufficient to enable the plaintiff to bring an action in trespass or nuisance to protect that right. The above cases demonstrate that a feature of a profit à prendre is the right to remove something from the land. The cases also show that the courts have applied this concept to fishing rights. Therefore, on the basis that the fishing quota is a “fishing right”, it is possible that the fishing quota is a profit à prendre. An interest in land So far, the cases have concluded that the grant of fishing rights is generally a profit à prendre as it includes the right not only to catch the fish but also to take them away. Another important feature of a profit à prendre is identified in the Nicholls case. This feature is that a profit à prendre is considered to be an interest in land. While not explicitly stated in the Nicholls case, the parties necessarily assume it, as the plaintiff was bringing an action of nuisance. A nuisance, according to the definition accepted by Goddard CJ in the English case of Howard v Walker \[1947\] 2 All ER 197 at page 199 is: Nuisance is the unlawful interference with a person’s use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over, or in connection with it. That a profit à prendre is an interest in land was addressed more directly in Webber v Lee (1882) 9 QBD 315. The case concerned the nature of a right that had been granted over certain land to shoot game and to take it away. The plaintiff was arguing that what had been granted was a mere licence, the defendant that the right was a profit à prendre. The English Court of Appeal unanimously decided that the interest was a profit à prendre and an interest in land. While all three judges delivered separate judgments, they all made statements similar to that delivered by Jessel MR at page 318: The right to shoot game and to take it away when shot has been decided to be an interest in land and a profit à prendre. One of the consequences of a profit à prendre being an interest in land is that a profit à prendre can only be created or granted by the owner of a sufficient estate or interest in the land. Hinde McMorland & Sim’s Land Law in New Zealand (1997, Butterworths, Wellington) states at page 655: It is also necessary to ensure that the proposed grantor both has title to the product involved and has capacity as grantor if he or she owns an estate less than the fee simple. Therefore, a profit à prendre is a right to take something off someone else’s land. It has been held in a number of cases to describe certain fishing rights. Further, it is an interest in land. As it is an interest in land, the fishing rights if they were to constitute a profit à prendre would need to be granted by a person with a legal estate in the land concerned. However, the cases considered so far have only dealt with fishing rights granted over inland waterways, being lakes, rivers and streams. While some fishing quota is granted in respect of freshwater species, the majority of the fishing quota is granted in respect of species that live in the sea. It needs to be considered whether this makes any difference. Can a profit à prendre exist in relation to the sea? The principles identified in the cases considered regarding fishing rights and profits à prendre have been applied to inland waterways. The current situation also involves fishing quota granted over the open seas. There is an issue as to whether the same principles involving profits à prendre can be applied in this instance. Some assistance on this issue can be found in the Privy Council decision in Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada \[1914\] AC 153. The case concerned the ability of the Government of British Columbia to grant various fishing rights. The Government of the Dominion had exclusive authority over the sea coast and inland fisheries, but the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority over property and civil rights in the province. The case concerned an area known as the “railway belt”, which included both non-tidal and tidal waters. The question was whether the granting of fishing rights over this area was in the domain of the Government of the Dominion or whether such rights were property rights properly in the domain of the Government of British Columbia. The Privy Council acknowledged the distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters. Non-tidal waters are those such as lakes, rivers and other inland waterways, excluding those parts of rivers and other waterways that meet the sea and as such are tidal. Tidal waters include these areas where non-tidal waters meet tidal waters, at the mouths of streams and in estuaries, as well as the sea coast. The open seas appear to fall into a separate category. The Privy Council held that in respect of non-tidal waters, the right to grant fishing rights is a property right and as such exists with the owner of the underlying land. It is a private property right. In the case of rivers this may well exist with private individuals, but in the case of lakes, the title to the underlying land is typically reserved to the Crown. On the facts of the case, this should have meant that the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority to grant fishing rights. However, the Government of British Columbia had specifically granted ownership of the particular land in question back to the Government of the Dominion. The railway belt also included tidal waters. The issue was whether the principles that applied to non-tidal waters could have equal application to tidal waters. The Privy Council concluded that the same principles did not apply. In respect of the tidal waters, there was an overriding public right of fishing in tidal waters, which was only subject to regulation by the Government of the Dominion. Viscount Haldane stated at pages 167 and 168: The general principle is that fisheries are in their nature mere profits of the soil over which the water flows, and that title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum. A fishery may of course be severed from the solum, and then it becomes a profit à prendre in alieno solo and an incorporeal hereditament. The severance may be effected by grant or by prescription, but it cannot be brought about by custom, for the origin of such a custom would be an unlawful act. But apart from the existence of such severance by grant or prescription the fishing rights go with the property in the solum. The authorities treat this broad principle as being of general application. They do not regard it as restricted to inland or non- tidal waters. They recognise it as giving to the owners of land on the foreshore or within an estuary or elsewhere where the tide flows and reflows a title to fish in the waters over such lands, and this is equally the case whether the owner be the Crown or a private individual. But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public. From these passages, it can be seen that the Privy Council accepted the general principle that fishing rights attach to the land under the water. These rights can be severed, at which point they become profits à prendre. The Privy Council noted that the authorities have treated this general principle as applying to both inland waterways as well as tidal waters. However, Viscount Haldane noted a further factor that could impact on the application of the principle to tidal waters. The factor is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council noted that the nature of the public right was “not easy to define”. However, the public right was regarded as paramount, which led Viscount Haldane to conclude at page 173: So far as the waters are tidal the right of fishing in them is a public right subject only to regulation by the Dominion Parliament. Therefore, while the general principle is accepted in respect of non-tidal or inland waterways, the Privy Council concluded that it does not apply in respect of tidal waters. The reason for this is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council also reached the same conclusion in relation to the open seas. In specifically addressing fishing rights in waters below the mean low water mark and in the open seas, Viscount Haldane stated at page 173: Their Lordships have already expressed their opinion that the right of fishing in the sea is a right of the public in general which does not depend on any proprietary title, and that the Dominion has the exclusive right of legislating with regard to it. The effect of this is that the Privy Council rejected the application of the profit à prendre concept in respect of fishing rights relating to tidal waters and the open seas. The basis for the rejection of the profit à prendre concept in relation to fishing rights in respect of tidal waters and the open seas is the existence of an overriding public right to fish in the sea. According to the Privy Council, this title is “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The existence of the overriding public right to fish in the sea was a sufficient basis for the Privy Council to decide the matter in the British Columbia case. However, it is noted that even if the public right had not existed, the Privy Council would not automatically have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre. As a profit à prendre is an interest in land, the person granting the fishing rights needs to have a sufficient interest in the land before the fishing right can be a profit à prendre. Therefore, before the Privy Council could have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (in absence of the public right to fish), it would need to be established that the Crown owned the land under sea in respect of which the fishing rights were granted. The Privy Council regarded the issue as a difficult one, and one which they considered they did not need to answer. Viscount Haldane stated at page 174: But their Lordships feel themselves relieved from expressing any opinion on the question whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low water mark to what is known as the three-mile limit because they are of the opinion that the right of the public to fish in the sea has been well established in English law for many centuries and does not depend on the assertion or maintenance of any title in the Crown to the subjacent land. Therefore, the particular issue of whether the Crown owns the seabed appears to be a complex issue in English law. While the Privy Council did not reach a conclusion in respect of this matter, it seems clear that they considered it would have been relevant to a positive finding that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (although the Privy Council concluded that it was not a profit à prendre because of the overriding public right). Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota might be in the nature of a profit à prendre, it is necessary to consider the factors established by the cases and then compare these with the fishing quota. The first characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is a right to take something from land. The cases have held that this extends to taking fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, fishing quota might have been argued to satisfy this requirement as being a right to take fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1996, the position is less arguable. The introduction of the concept of an annual catch entitlement that is severable from the fishing quota perhaps indicates that the right to fish is one step removed from the fishing quota. However, given that the annual catch entitlement is generated by the fishing quota it is considered that fishing quota can still be regarded as ultimately giving rise to a right to take fish from water that flows over land. The second point to note is that fishing quota is granted in relation to a number of different species. These include both freshwater species (found in internal waterways) as well as the deep sea species. It is considered that there is no express differentiation in the Fisheries Acts of the rights provided in relation to the different species. Accordingly, it is considered that any determination of the nature of the property rights obtained in relation to fishing quota has to apply equally to all quota across the various species. Against this background, the Privy Council decision in the British Columbia case that an overriding public right to fish in the sea was inconsistent with the existence of a fishing right in the nature of a profit à prendre in relation to the seas poses a potential problem for the characterisation of fishing quota as a profit à prendre. The Privy Council considered that the public right was “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The acknowledgement that this public right is subject to regulation by Parliament is important in the New Zealand context. It appears that Parliament in New Zealand has regulated the right to fish in the sea through the Fisheries Acts and associated legislation. While a public right to fish in the sea still appears to exist (with the right being limited as to the size and number of fish that can be caught), it seems clear that this is no longer an overriding public right to fish. The rights created under the quota management system now appear to be the paramount rights. The effect of this is that it is considered that primary concern of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case does not appear to be as relevant in a New Zealand context. The final characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is an interest in land. This means that the profit à prendre needs to have been created by a person with a legal interest in the land. In this regard, problems may exist for fishing quota granted in respect of freshwater species. In relation to inland waterways, the owner of the adjacent land generally owns the land lying under the waterway where the waterway is contained on the land owned by the person, and to the midpoint where the waterway forms a border of the property. This principle is subject to certain exceptions where the Crown has asserted ownership of the underlying land – as may have occurred in the case of lakes and navigable rivers. Thus, the case for fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre encounters some difficulties in relation to fishing quota allocated in respect of freshwater species as it not clear whether the Crown would own all of the underlying land in question, from which it could grant an interest in land in the nature of a profit à prendre. The situation is fraught with even more uncertainty in relation to the seabed and foreshore. There is some argument that section 7 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, And Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 provides some assistance as to the ownership of the seabed. However, this only applies in respect of the “territorial sea” which extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of New Zealand. Fishing quota is granted in respect of quota management areas, which extend 200 nautical miles from the mean high water mark along the coast of New Zealand. Further, the effectiveness of this section against customary title was unanimously rejected by the Court of Appeal in Ngati Apa and Others v Attorney-General and Others \[2003\] NZCA 117 (19 June 2003). It is considered that the position is not improved by the “sovereign rights” conferred on New Zealand through Article 56 of the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea. New Zealand did not become a signatory to the Convention until 19 July 1996, meaning that any fishing quota allocated between 1986 and 1996 could not have been granted by the Crown relying on the rights conferred under the Convention. Accordingly, the issue of whether the Crown owns a sufficient interest in the land from which it could grant an interest in the nature of a profit à prendre is unclear. From this perspective, the approach of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case to leave the issue concerning the Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed as unresolved has considerable merit. There are further factors from which guidance can be obtained as to whether fishing quota can be regarded as a profit à prendre. When the Fisheries legislation is considered as a whole and in a wider statutory setting, it is considered that there are some other factors that support a conclusion that Parliament did not intend fishing quota to be a profit à prendre. An example is the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983, where Parliament specifically refers to a forestry right being a profit à prendre. The absence of a similar provision in relation to fishing quota perhaps becomes more significant. A further example is the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 where fishing quota is specifically excluded from the ambit of that Act. While excluding fishing quota from an Act dealing with personal property might tend to support a conclusion that fishing quota is perhaps a profit à prendre, an interest in land, and not personal property, the method of exclusion suggests that Parliament did not exclude fishing quota on this basis. The exclusion provisions in section 23(e) of that Act contain general exclusions for interests in land, and a specific exclusion for fishing quota. If fishing quota was regarded as a profit à prendre and an interest in land, there would have been no need for the specific exclusion. The end result is that there are a number of difficulties with fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre. While there are a number of similarities between the characteristics of fishing quota and the characteristics of a profit à prendre, there are also a number of fundamental inconsistencies in the characteristics that indicate that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre. The effect of these conclusions on the nature of fishing quota leads to the further other possibility that fishing quota is a unique property right, with the rights and obligations in respect of the property determined from the statute creating the right (as alluded to earlier). A unique property right The decision in the British Columbia case was cited with approval by the Full High Court of Australia in the case of Harper v Minister for Sea Fisheries (1989) 168 CLR 314. While the case concerned whether payments made by commercial fishermen for fishing licences were a “tax”, the High Court made some useful observations regarding the nature of the Australian fishing licence system. The Court noted the similarities between the rights obtained under a commercial licence and the rights obtained under a profit à prendre. However, the Court ultimately concluded that the fishing rights were not profits à prendre, but instead were statutory rights created under the particular statutory regime. Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ stated at page 325: The right of commercial exploitation of a public resource for personal profit has become a privilege confined to those who hold commercial licences. This privilege can be compared to a profit à prendre. In truth, however, it is an entitlement of a new kind created as part of a system for preserving a limited public natural resource in a society which is coming to recognize that, in so far as such resources are concerned, to fail to protect may destroy and to preserve the right of everyone to take what he or she will may eventually deprive that right of all context. Conclusion on the nature of fishing quota From the above analysis, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a usufruct right nor is it the sale of goods coupled with a licence. It is noted, however, that the rights granted under the fishing quota are similar to the rights that arise under a profit à prendre. The fishing quota generates an annual catch entitlement which provides the right to take a certain amount of a certain item (being the species of fish) from a certain area. These are the basic characteristics of a profit à prendre. While the rights seem similar, the courts have held that a profit à prendre cannot exist in respect of tidal waters and the open seas, and further that only the owner of an interest in land can create a profit à prendre. As the Crown ownership of the land under the water in respect of which fishing quota is granted is not clear and for the various other reasons considered above, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre. The effect of this is that it is concluded that fishing quota cannot be categorised as a usufruct right, the sale of goods coupled with a licence, or a profit à prendre. Fishing quota has to be regarded as a unique property right, with its characteristics determined from the provisions of the fishing legislation as set out by Justice Tipping in the New Zealand Fishing Industry Association decision referred to above. This is consistent with the Australian decision in Harper. It could also be seen to be consistent with the position set out by the Law Commission referred to above, where the rights are “akin” to a profit à prendre, but not entirely the same. It also reflects the statement made by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd. It is noted that the general characteristics of individual transferable quota were set out in section 27 of the Fisheries Act 1996, but that section 27 has since been repealed. It is considered that section 27 was repealed as being redundant, in that it merely summarised the characteristics that are found in other sections of the Fisheries Act 1996. Marine farming authorisations There are three different statutory bases on which a marine farming authorisation may have been granted. Prior to 1 October 1991, the relevant legislation was the Marine Farming Act 1971. Under this Act, the Ministry of Fisheries was able to grant marine farm leases and marine farming licences. On 1 October 1991, the Resource Management Act 1991 came into effect. This Act set out a new procedure for obtaining a marine farming authorisation. The Resource Management Act also repealed the sections of the Marine Farming Act 1971, which enabled marine farm leases and licences to be granted. The new process under the Resource Management Act 1991 involves two stages. The first stage involves obtaining a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit, or, if the proposed farming activity is already permitted by the relevant Regional Plan, a certificate of compliance. Once one of these documents has been obtained, an application can then be made to the Ministry of Fisheries for a marine farming permit. These are issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The effect of these different statutory regimes is that there are three different types of statutory approval that might be involved in the sale of a marine farming authorisation. These are: • A marine farming lease granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971; • A marine farming licence granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971; or • A marine farming permit granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 in conjunction with a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. Marine farming leases The characteristics of marine farming leases are set out in section 11 of the Marine Farming Act. On the basis of section 11(1)(a) of that Act, it appears that a lease granted under this section would constitute a leasehold estate and thus be an interest in land. However, as the actual terms of any lease as set out in a marine farming lease agreement would govern the nature of the rights acquired under the lease, these terms of the marine farming lease agreement would need to be considered to ensure that they were consistent with the grant of a leasehold estate. For instance, the lease would need to define a particular area of the seabed. Additionally, the terms of the lease would need to be consistent with the lessee obtaining rights in respect of the seabed. While it is likely that most leases would specify a particular area, as it appears that there is no “standard form” lease agreement it is possible that some of the leases granted might exclude rights in respect of the seabed. Such leases may not constitute real property. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming leases that satisfy the following conditions: • The marine farming lease defines the area subject to the lease by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • The legal effect of the marine farming lease is that the seabed is not excluded from the area leased. Marine farming licences Similar concerns arise in respect of marine farming licences as with marine farming leases. Section 11(3) refers to a property right that can be passed onto a person’s estate and is able to be assigned. While the provision is consistent with a licence being in the nature of a contractual right in accordance with the general law concept of a licence, it is also possible that the terms of a licence granted under this provision might give rise to exclusive rights over a defined area of land and so constitute an interest in land – possibly a leasehold interest. Once again, this appears to be a matter that can only be determined by considering the specific terms of the particular marine farming licence in question. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming licences that satisfy the following conditions: • The marine farming licence defines the area subject to the licence by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • The legal effect of the marine farming licence is that the seabed is not excluded from the area licensed. Transition to the Resource Management Act Section 11 of the Marine Farming Act was repealed as from 1 October 1991 by section 362 of the Resource Management Act 1991. However, a savings provision is contained in section 426 of the Resource Management Act. The effect of this provision is to preserve the pre-existing rights relating to both marine farming leases and marine farming licences despite the repeal of section 11 of the Marine Farming Act by the Resource Management Act. Therefore, both marine farming leases and marine farming licences granted under the Marine Farming Act continue in force under the Resource Management Act with no alteration of the rights and obligations under which they were granted. New marine farming authorisations New marine farming authorisations are granted under the Resource Management Act and the Fisheries Act 1983. The first step in the process is to apply for a resource consent from the Local or Regional Council. Section 87 of the Resource Management Act defines a resource consent granted in relation to a coastal marine area to be a “coastal permit”. Both these terms are relevant as some provisions of the Resource Management Act relate to coastal permits and some relate to the more general resource consent. If the Council has already approved the proposed marine farming activity in the area, the applicant will likely only require a Certificate of Compliance rather than a resource consent. Once a person has obtained either a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance, the person also requires a marine farming permit, which is issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The treatment for GST purposes The new marine farming authorisations need to be considered as to how they will be treated under the GST Act because they involve two separate items – a resource consent or certificate of compliance, and a marine farming permit. This matter needs to be considered as it needs to be determined whether there is a single supply of a “marine farming authorisation” or whether there are two separate supplies, one of the resource consent or certificate of compliance and another of the marine farming permit. This general issue is a difficult one, and has not been fully dealt with by the courts. However, there have been a number of cases both in New Zealand and overseas which have provided some guidance. Some of the New Zealand cases to consider the issue of single versus multiple supplies are the High Court decision in CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140; the High Court decision in Coveney v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,328; and the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193. There have been a number of UK decisions on this issue as well, including British Airways plc v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1990\] STC 643; Customs and Excise Commissioners v United Biscuits (UK) Ltd \[1992\] STC 325; Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1995\] STC 341; and Customs & Excise Commissioners v British Telecommunications \[1998\] STC 544. From these cases a number of factors has emerged as being relevant to determining whether there is a single supply or multiple supplies. These factors can be summarised as follows: • The degree to which the services alleged to constitute a single supply are inter- connected, the extent of the interdependence and intertwining, and whether each is an integral part or component of a composite whole. • The mere separate itemisation of things in a contract does not make them separable if they are necessary components of the entire transaction. • Whether the services are rendered under a single contract, or for a single undivided consideration, are matters to be considered, but they are not conclusive. • If it would not be possible to purchase each of the various elements separately and still end up with a useful article or service, the supply is a compound supply that cannot be split up for tax purposes. Application to the facts In determining the degree of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit, section 67J(2) of the Fisheries Act 1983 provides some assistance. It states that a marine farming permit shall only be issued to a person who holds a coastal permit for the relevant area, or to a person who holds a certificate of compliance in respect of the relevant area. Therefore, this section illustrates that there is a high level of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit. This relationship is also reflected in section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983, the section relating to the transfer of the marine farming permit. This section implies that it is only possible to transfer a marine farming permit in conjunction with the resource consent or certificate of compliance to which it relates. It is understood that as a matter of practice, both the coastal permit and the marine farming permit would be transferred when a marine farm is transferred. In terms of the case law discussed above, this relationship between the marine farming permit and the resource consent should be sufficient to conclude that they are sufficiently interconnected to be regarded as a single supply rather than as separate supplies. This is on the basis that one of the permits without the other is essentially useless. Therefore, it appears that most transfers of marine farming activities will involve the supply of both the marine farming permit and the coastal permit or certificate of compliance. It is concluded that when these items are supplied together as part of the same supply, they should be treated as a single supply for GST purposes. The Ruling only applies to supplies of this nature. Legislation Having established the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations, the next issue involves determining the relevant GST legislation. The section for obtaining an input tax credit is section 20. Section 20(2) outlines the documentary evidence that needs to be held in order to obtain an input tax credit, and section 20(3) provides the circumstances in which a claim will be available depending on the basis of GST registration. 20(1) In respect of each taxable period every registered person shall calculate the amount of tax payable by that registered person in accordance with the provisions of this section. 20(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, no deduction of input tax shall be made in respect of a supply, unless - (a) A tax invoice or debit note or credit note, in relation to that supply, has been provided in accordance with sections 24 and 25 of this Act and is held by the registered person making that deduction at the time that any return in respect of that supply is furnished; or (b) A tax invoice is not required to be issued pursuant to section 24(5) or section 24(6) of this Act, or a debit note or credit note is not required to be issued pursuant to section 25 of this Act; or (c) Sufficient records are maintained as required pursuant to section 24(7) of this Act where the supply is a supply of secondhand goods to which that section relates: Provided that where a tax invoice or debit note or credit note in relation to that supply has been provided in accordance with this Act, the Commissioner may determine that no deduction for input tax in relation to that supply shall be made unless that tax invoice or debit note or credit note is retained in accordance with the provisions of section 75 of this Act. 20(3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period - (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) or section 26 of this Act; and (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii) Paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) In relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) of this Act, to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount, or section 26 of this Act; and Under section 20(3), a registered person may deduct from the amount of output tax payable, an amount of “input tax” in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b). “Input tax” is defined in section 3A of the Act. It provides: 3A(1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means - (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (b) tax levied under section 12(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by that person, being goods applied or acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). 3A(2) In the case of a supply by way of sale to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, the amount of input tax is determined under subsection (3) if - (a) the supply is not a taxable supply; and (b) the goods are not supplied by a supplier who - (i) is not resident in New Zealand; and (ii) has previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (c) the goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 3A(3) The amount of input tax is - (a) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, the lesser of - (i) the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (b) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(7A), the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the open market value of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (c) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(8), the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the valuation under section 10(8) of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (d) if the supplier and the recipient are not associated persons and the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates, the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (ii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (e) in all other cases, the tax fraction of the consideration in money for the supply. 3A(4) For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), applied does not include - (a) the delivery or the arranging of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand; or (b) the making of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand more easily achieved. 3A(5) For the purpose of subsection (3), tax fraction means the tax fraction that applies at the time of supply. Section 3A(1)(c) of the definition of “input tax” is the relevant provision. It refers to the calculation of input tax through subsections (2) and (3) when the supply is one of “secondhand goods”. “Secondhand goods” is defined in section 2: “Secondhand goods” does not include - (a) Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or (b) Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver, platinum, or any other substance which, if it were of the required fineness, would be fine metal: or (c) Livestock: Section 2 also provides a definition of the term “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money: Application of the legislation The starting place in order to determine whether a GST input tax credit is available to a registered person is section 20(3). The section provides different options depending on the method of registration adopted by the registered person. For a person registered on an invoice basis, the relevant paragraph is (a)(ia), and for a person using the payments or hybrid basis of registration the relevant paragraph is (b)(i). However, irrespective of the basis of registration, the Act provides very similar tests for claiming an input tax credit in respect of supplies of secondhand goods. The claim is limited to the amount of “input tax” in relation to a supply of goods or services to that registered person, “to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period”. The relevant definition of “input tax” is contained in section 3A(1)(c) of the Act. In determining the input tax under paragraph (c) it is necessary to consider subsections (2) and (3). Leaving aside the associated persons provisions (which are not relevant to the current rulings), there are a number of requirements that need to be satisfied under the two provisions. These are that: (i) there be a supply by way of sale; (ii) the supply not be a taxable supply; (iii) the supply be made to a registered person; (iv) the supply be of secondhand goods; (v) the secondhand goods be situated in New Zealand at the time of supply; and (vi) the secondhand goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Most of these requirements are specified in the rulings to ensure that they will be satisfied in every instance in which the ruling applies. However, requirement 4, that the supply be of secondhand goods, is something that needs to be considered in detail as it cannot be specified in the rulings. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether or not the fishing quota and mussel licences can be secondhand goods. “Secondhand goods” The definition of “secondhand goods” does not attempt to define the term, but instead prescribes a list of things that are not included in the meaning of “secondhand goods”. Fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are not excluded under the definition. As the definition gives little indication as to what is included in the term, regard needs to be had to the ordinary meaning of “secondhand goods”. The first observation that can be made is that “secondhand goods” is a composite term. It relates to items that are first of all “goods”, and then the subset of those goods that can be described as “secondhand”. “Goods” In considering the first question as to what is comprised in the term “goods”, assistance can be found in section 2. Goods “means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money”. “Goods” is defined very widely in the initial part of the definition, and then subjected to two specific exclusions. It includes all kinds of real and personal property, but excludes choses in action and money. Therefore, it is necessary to establish whether fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are real or personal property and then secondly, whether they are money or choses in action. “Property” Before considering the “real” or “personal” aspects of property, the nature of “property” should first be established. The term “property” is not defined in the Act. Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1991) Volume 44, “Stamp Duty”, para 1,032, provides the following description of “property”: Property is that which belongs to a person exclusively of others, and can be the subject of bargain and sale. It includes goodwill, trademarks, licence to use a patent, book debts, options to purchase and other rights under a contract. A revocable licence is not property. An owner of unworked minerals who gives an undertaking to the service owner not to work them does not thereby convey property, and a grant of a purported exclusive right to carry on a certain business in an area when the grantor has no such right is not a conveyance of property. A similar view is taken in Gray’s Law of Personal Property (5th ed, Butterworths, 1968) at page 1: The term “property” as used in the law of New Zealand and other common-law countries has a dual meaning. It may signify the title to or rights to ownership in goods or other property; and when s. 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 provides by rule 1 that in a contract for the sale of ascertained goods in a deliverable state the “property” in the goods passes at the time the contract is made, “property” here means the title to or ownership of the goods in question. The word “property” may in addition signify the thing owned, that over which title is exercised; in this sense, of course, it includes tangible goods such as a book or a table, but the word covers also incorporeal forms of property such as estates in land (an estate being an aggregate of rights exercisable over or in respect of land) or the contractual rights embodied in a cheque or an insurance policy. From this it can be seen that the term “property” is used to describe a wide range of things, both tangible and intangible. Its fundamental characteristics seem to be that it is capable of being owned, and that the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred (see, for instance the House of Lords decision in National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth \[1965\] 2 All ER 472). “Property” needs to be able to be defined and identified, and have a degree of permanence or stability. Further, it needs to able to be transferred. “Real” and “personal” property It is a well-established principle of English law that all “property” can be categorised as either real property or personal property. As Gray explains at page 1: “The distinction between real property (or realty) and personal property (personalty) is procedural in origin and is derived from the ancient forms of action in English law. In the twelfth century, the possession of freehold land was recoverable by certain actions which were called “real” actions; at this date the remedy for dispossession of all other kinds of property was, effectively, damages only, and actions for damages in these circumstances were called “personal” actions. The existence of only two classes of property has its origin in these two types of action. The acknowledgement that property is either real or personal is contained in the first sentence of the following quote from Gray (at page 2): It is not sufficient, however, to say simply without qualification that land is realty and all other property is personalty. Real property includes, besides the freehold estates and interests in land, things which are said to “savour of the realty”. The effect of there only being two classes of property, one being real and the other personal, is that a finding that something is property necessarily means that it will be either real or personal property. There is no third category. Therefore, in terms of the definition of “goods”, if the item is “property”, then it will be either real or personal property. A question arises as to whether it is necessary to determine whether the fishing quota is real or personal property. The section includes both types of property and as long as it is either one or the other there should be no need to make a final determination. While this is true, attempting to classify the property as either real or personal assists in determining whether or not the item is a chose in action. The reason for this is that the chose in action – chose in possession distinction appears to be limited to personal property. The exclusion for “choses in action” The term “chose in action” is used to describe various types of personal property. It is not a term that is applied to real property. This observation was made in the English case of Torkington v Magee \[1900-3\] All ER 991 where Channell J defined the term at page 994: Chose in action is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession (emphasis added). Therefore, a finding that an item is real property means that the exclusion for choses in action will not be relevant. However, a finding that the item is personal property means that the exclusion for choses in action could be relevant. In determining the characteristics of a chose in action, the above quote from Torkington v Magee is referred to by a number of commentators as providing a useful working definition. In a New Zealand context, the Court of Appeal considered the issue in the case of Re Marshall (Deceased), CIR v Public Trustee \[1965\] NZLR 851. The case considered a situation involving a right to demand interest on a loan, and whether this was a chose in action for the purposes of the Death Duties Act 1921. In considering the issue of “chose in action”, McCarthy J stated at page 860: The right was property, for property in its wider sense includes all things of value. It was personal property and “all personal things are either in possession or in action. The law knows no tertium quid between the two”. This celebrated statement of Fry LJ in Colonial Bank v Whinney (1885) 30 Ch D 261 at p 285, is familiar to every lawyer. It received, I think the express, but certainly the implied approval of the House of Lords on appeal ((1886) 11 AC 426). Justice McCarthy provides further guidance on the characteristics of choses in action at page 861: That is so because if the right to give the notice and the corresponding duty to accept it had been denied, there was no possible method of enforcement other than going to law and thereby securing not the physical possession of the thing but the advantages of its ownership. This, says Mr Cyprian Williams in his article in (1895) 11 LQR 223, is the true test, and I agree. ... The characteristics that one cannot take the right into physical possession (even after judgment in one’s favour) and that it can only be vindicated by Court action, are the qualifying features of a chose in action and have become the bases of most modern definitions (emphasis added). The fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is the same in both authorities. Both authorities refer to the fact that in respect of a chose in action, one cannot take the right into physical possession. Being able to take the thing into possession is a characteristic of a chose in possession. Even if court action is taken to enforce the chose in action, the result may well be that the advantages of ownership are secured rather than actual physical possession of the thing. “Secondhand” There have been few cases on the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” in the GST context. Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 was a decision of Barber DJ where he had to consider whether deer velvet purchased direct from producers by means of commission agents were secondhand goods when they were purchased by a distributor and exporter of deer velvet. His Honour concluded that they were not secondhand goods. Judge Barber accepted that the two key concepts underlying whether something is secondhand are previous ownership and previous use. He stated at page 3,148: I agree with counsel that the concept of secondhand relates to pre-ownership or pre-use. I agree ... that the emphasis is on pre-use. I consider that there is quite some commonsense flexibility in ascertaining whether a good is still new or has become secondhand. I do not regard second ownership as necessarily rendering an item secondhand. Many goods pass from manufacturer to wholesaler or retailer to customer or consumer (with other levels of distributors sometimes also involved), and yet are not regarded as secondhand at the consumer purchaser level, even though the item has been used as stock-in- trade at the various distribution levels. The good is not usually regarded as secondhand until it has been used for its intrinsic purpose. The TRA felt that previous ownership of goods is not in itself necessarily sufficient to meet the test of secondhand in the Act. Usually a previous owner must have also used the goods for their intrinsic purpose. Subsequently the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of secondhand in LR McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. McKay J expressly referred to and agreed with Judge Barber’s comments in Case N16 as to the ordinary meaning of the term “secondhand”. Justice Richardson (as he then was) stated at page 11,213: The short point of the appeal is whether wool purchased by registered persons from unregistered persons is secondhand goods for the purposes of the 1985 Act. If the expression secondhand goods is given its ordinary and natural meaning it is common ground that it is not within that description. In ordinary usage the expression refers to goods which have been used, although depending on the context it may apply to goods which are no longer new or even in some contexts goods which have simply been previously owned. Mr Harley for the appellants did not seek to draw any distinction based on “use” of the wool by the sellers. The argument for the appellants is that to accord with the scheme and purpose of the legislation the expression has to be given the meaning of any goods which have been purchased by a registered person. The judgments of the Court of Appeal state that the term “secondhand” should be given its ordinary or normal meaning. While “secondhand” can mean either pre- owned or pre-used, the Court concluded that it is not sufficient that the goods were previously owned. If an item were “secondhand” simply through being previously owned, the term “secondhand” would be deprived of any practical meaning according to Justice Richardson. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that the more relevant factor is whether the goods have been previously used. The effect of this is that the courts have not extended the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” to goods that have been previously owned but not previously used for their intrinsic purpose. Application to fishing quota Is fishing quota “property”? When these concepts are applied to fishing quota, it seems that fishing quota would constitute property. Fishing quota is definable and identifiable through being granted under a statutory regime. It is permanent or stable in nature as it is issued in perpetuity. Fishing quota is capable of being owned and there are specific legislative provisions in the Fisheries Act 1996 dealing with the ability of the fishing quota to be transferred. On this basis, it can be accepted that fishing quota is “property”. Is fishing quota real or personal property? The next issue is whether fishing quota is real or personal property. The characteristics of fishing quota are determined from considering the legislation under which it is created. Under section 66 of the Fisheries Act 1996 (previously section 28O of the Fisheries Act 1983) the holders of individual transferable quota obtain a right to receive an annual catch entitlement for the species that is the subject of the quota. While the annual catch entitlement is defined by reference to a “quota management area”, there is nothing in either of the Fisheries Acts to suggest that it was intended that fishing quota gives rise to an interest in land. Therefore, based on this and the earlier conclusion that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre, it is considered that fishing quota is neither an interest in land nor real property. As fishing quota is “property” and property is either “real” or “personal”, the conclusion that fishing quota is not real property leads also to the conclusion that it must be personal property. As fishing quota is personal property, it will fall within the words “all kinds of real and personal property” in the definition of “goods” in the Act. Therefore, it is considered that this first part of the definition is satisfied. The next question is whether either of the two exclusions to the definition applies. Is fishing quota a “chose in action”? On the issue of whether fishing quota is a chose in action, it is established by the cases that the fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is that one cannot take the right into physical possession. Fishing quota appears to possess this characteristic. The right to catch fish cannot be taken into possession. While an argument could be made that a person could simply catch the fish under the quota, this seems to confuse the fish (which could be taken into possession) with the right to catch those fish (which, it is considered, cannot be taken into possession). The end result is that it is concluded that fishing quota is a chose in action. While fishing quota is capable of satisfying the first part of the definition of “goods”, being a form of personal property, it is then excluded from the definition of “goods” by reason that it is a chose in action. The effect of this is that fishing quota cannot be regarded as being “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. Given that it is concluded that fishing quota is not “goods”, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether the fishing quota could be regarded as being “secondhand”. Therefore, as it is concluded that fishing quota is not “goods”, it is also concluded that fishing quota cannot be “secondhand goods”. Application to marine farming authorisations Are marine farming authorisations “goods”? This question needs to be addressed in respect of the three types of marine farming authorisations: • The old marine farming leases; • The old marine farming licences; and • The new combination resource consent and marine farming permit. Marine farming leases It is accepted that marine farming leases are property. The marine farming lease is definable, has a degree of permanence (being the term of the lease) and is capable of being transferred. This means that marine farming leases are property for the first part of the definition. However, in terms of whether marine farming leases are real or personal property, it is not certain that all marine farming leases would give rise to a leasehold estate. To the extent that a marine farming lease is a leasehold estate, it will be real property. If the particular marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate, it will then constitute personal property. An issue exists as to whether marine farming leases might be excluded from being goods on the basis that they are choses in action. As noted above in relation to fishing quota, because choses in action are a subset of personal property, this will only be relevant if it is determined that the particular marine farming lease is not a leasehold estate (and thus not real property). If the marine farming lease is real property, then it will be “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that are not real property and are thus personal property, it needs to be determined whether they would be choses in action. The key distinguishing characteristic between choses in action and choses in possession, is the ability of the item to be “taken into possession”. Marine farming leases are like fishing quota in this regard in that they do not have a physical aspect to their nature. They encompass a number of rights, but these rights cannot be taken into possession. The only way to enforce these rights is to sue to enforce them. The effect of this is the conclusion that those marine farming leases that are not real property would be choses in action. This means that if a marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate it will be a chose in action and excluded from the definition of “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that constitute real property and are “goods”, the further issue of whether they are “secondhand” so as to be “secondhand goods” needs to be considered. The marine farming leases being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. The only other issue to consider is the “use” issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16. The intrinsic purpose of a marine farming lease is to farm the particular species specified in the lease. If a farming operation has been carried out pursuant to the lease, then the conclusion appears inescapable that the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. However, situations could arise in respect of marine farming leases where a person never actually exercises the rights under the lease and simply sells it without ever having attempted to farm the particular aquatic life in question. In such a case, an issue exists as to whether the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. On the basis of the case law, it appears that it has not been used for its intrinsic purpose. As this is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis, the Ruling only applies to marine farming leases that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the lease. Marine farming licences Under section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act, it seems clear that marine farming licences are property. The licences are defined in that Act, they have a degree of permanence (being the term of the licence) and are capable of being transferred. Therefore, it is concluded that marine farming licences are property. The next issue is whether marine farming licences are real or personal property. The nature of a marine farming licence is not entirely clear from the Marine Farming Act. Section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act provides that the right received under a marine farming licence is “the exclusive right during the currency of the licence to farm within the licensed area the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence”. It seems possible that the rights created under this provision could constitute an interest in land depending on the particular terms of any given licence. If the licence is defined by reference to a particular area of land and the licence provides the exclusive right to farm this area, it is possible that an interest in land (being a leasehold interest) would have been created despite the use of the term “licence”. On this basis, it is concluded that some marine farming licences may constitute an interest in land and will thus be real property. As it has been concluded that marine farming licences are “property”, those licences that are not real property will be personal property. The next matter to be considered is whether the exclusion for choses in action in the definition of “goods” applies. This issue will only be relevant to those licences that are personal property. The key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. It is a right that can only be enforced through court action. In respect of those marine farming licences that are personal property, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that constitute the marine farming licences into possession. If the rights are not real property, the licence will not provide an exclusive right to “possess” the particular area. The marine farming licence will provide for the exclusive right of being able to farm in the particular area, but it does not appear to provide the right to exclude others from the area. Therefore, it seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears as if the marine farming licences that are personal property would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that these marine farming licences are excluded from the definition of “goods” for GST purposes. However, the marine farming licences that are real property are not subject to the exclusion for choses in action, and thus will constitute “goods” for the purposes of the Act. For those marine farming licences that are real property, the next question is whether these “goods” are “secondhand” so as to qualify for the secondhand goods input tax credit under the GST Act. The marine farming licences being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. In terms of the “use” issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16, the same conclusion that applied to marine farming leases applies to marine farming licences. Whether the marine farming licence has been used for its intrinsic purpose is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis. For this reason, the Ruling only applies to marine farming licences that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence. Resource consents and marine farming permits The definition of “goods” requires that the item concerned be either real or personal property. It has been concluded that the GST Act will regard the supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit as a single supply. The nature of the property comprised in this supply needs to be considered. The nature of a resource consent and certificate of compliance Section 139(6) deems a certificate of compliance to be a resource consent with the result that the provisions of the Resource Management Act are to apply accordingly. Being a “resource consent” means that the rights attaching to the resource consent are governed by section 122 of the Resource Management Act. Section 122 states that “a resource consent is neither real nor personal property”. This statement is interesting. It is well established that all property is either real or personal property. On this basis, the only sensible interpretation which can be placed on this provision is that Parliament did not want all of the common law and other rights which would automatically attach to property of this nature to attach to resource consents. Parliament must have wanted to regulate the rights that attach to a resource consent. This is consistent with the rest of the section, which goes on to deal with the characteristics of resource consents for the purposes of other legislation. Unfortunately, there is no statement regarding the revenue Acts. The issue, therefore, is whether the statement in section 122 of the Resource Management Act applies to the GST Act. Not real nor personal property In determining whether or not the statement in the Resource Management Act 1991 impacts on the classification of a resource consent under the GST Act, there are a number of observations which can be made. The first observation is that the statement in section 122 is not a standard definition. It is not contained in section 2 of the Resource Management Act along with all the other definitions that are prefaced with the words “for the purposes of this Act”. Therefore, Parliament may well have intended section 122 to have wider application than simply the Resource Management Act. A second point can be derived from the wording of section 122 itself. After making the initial statement, the section goes on to address a number of specific Acts and circumstances where the resource consents are to be regarded as having the characteristics of personal property. The GST Act is not one of those situations. This seems a clear indication from Parliament that the opening statement was intended to apply to the Acts that are dealt with in the section. To take the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 as an example, it seems from the plain wording of the section that Parliament intended that the opening words of the section would have meant that resource consents were not real or personal for the purposes of that Act. This was why Parliament inserted subsection (4) to make it clear that for the purposes of that Act, it was appropriate for a resource consent to be regarded as goods within the meaning of that Act. This does not make a resource consent goods or personal property for other purposes though. On this basis, it seems that the statement in section 122 would apply for the purposes of the GST Act also. By not making a specific exception for the GST Act, it is only possible to assume that Parliament were content with the initial statement applying to the GST Act. The third observation, which follows from the second, is the intention of the section that is apparent from the words used. By making the statement that a resource consent is neither real nor personal property, Parliament has created a legal fiction. A resource consent has the general characteristics of property, and the law only knows two categorisations of that property – real and personal. Therefore, in discerning the intention of Parliament in making this statement, the most logical intention is that Parliament did not want the natural common law rights to attach to a resource consent which would attach as a matter of course if the resource consent were either real or personal property. The consequences of section 122 of the Resource Management Act then need to be applied to the definition of “goods” in the GST Act. “Goods” means “all kinds of personal or real property ...”. It has been established that resource consents and certificates of compliance are deemed not to be “personal or real property”, and that the deeming provision operates for purposes outside the Resource Management Act and so affects the GST Act as well. This means that resource consents and certificates of compliance do not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act as they are not personal or real property. Effect of the marine farming permit There is one further matter to consider, and that is the effect that the marine farming permit might have on any ultimate conclusion regarding the combined property right, being the resource consent or certificate of compliance and a marine farming permit. It has already been concluded that for GST purposes, the supply of these items should be treated as a single supply. It has also been noted that the issuing of a marine farming permit is dependent on having a resource consent or certificate of compliance. Based on these conclusions, it is possible to conclude that the marine farming permit would have no effect on the issue of whether the combined property right is goods. However, if the marine farming permit were considered in its own right, it seems that the same conclusion would be reached. It appears that a marine farming permit would constitute property. Marine farming permits are capable of being owned, and the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred under section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983. There is nothing in any of the relevant legislation to suggest that a marine farming permit is real property. While a marine farming permit provides a right to farm within the permit area, it does not typically provide any right to occupy the seabed. It is considered that without such a right, the marine farming permit is unlikely to be an interest in land and thus real property. That a marine farming permit does not provide any right to occupy the seabed seems reflected in section 67L(3), which provides that the marine farming permit does not authorise the permit holder to take any naturally occurring aquatic life in the area subject to the permit. Thus, it is considered that marine farming permits do not give rise to an interest in land and are accordingly concluded to be personal property. As the marine farming permits are not “money” the only other exclusion to be considered is that for choses in action. From the earlier analysis, the key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. In respect of marine farming permits, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that comprise a marine farming permit into possession. It seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears that marine farming permits would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that marine farming permits are excluded from the definition of “goods” for GST purposes. Therefore, it is concluded that the existence of a marine farming permit as part of a supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit will not affect the status of the supply for GST purposes. Regardless of whether the resource consent or certificate of compliance and the marine farming permit are considered together or separately, it is concluded that a supply of such items will not be a supply of “goods” as defined in the GST Act. Summary for marine farming authorisations Some marine farming leases and some marine farming licences may constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. These will be leases and licences that are defined with reference to a particular area of land, and that provide for exclusive rights in respect of that land. Such marine farming leases and licences are likely to be interests in land and thus real property. As real property, neither of the exclusions relating to “money” and “choses in action” will apply so that they will not be excluded from the definition of “goods”. The marine farming leases and licences that are not real property and so are personal property will not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. The reason for this is that they are choses in action. Because the rights under these marine farming leases and licences cannot be taken into possession, the leases and licences that are personal property will constitute choses in action rather than choses in possession and so will be excluded from the definition of “goods”. In relation to resource consents and marine farming permits, it appears as if the declaration in section 122 of the Resource Management Act that resource consents are neither real nor personal property is intended to apply outside the Resource Management Act. As there is no legislative modification of the statement in respect of the GST Act, the resource consents and marine farming permits will not qualify as being “goods” because they do not satisfy the opening words of the definition of being real or personal property. Therefore, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether they are “secondhand”. One further matter Before concluding in respect of marine farming authorisations, it needs to be noted that there is presently a Bill before Parliament that, if enacted in its present form, would affect the three different statutory permissions set out above. The Bill is the Resource Management (Marine Farming and Heritage Provisions) Amendment Bill. This Bill has been reviewed by the Transport and Environment Committee (which reported back on 30 April 1999), and there are a number of useful comments in the Committee’s report as to the existing situation and the proposed legislation. The Bill is currently awaiting its second reading. Under the proposals, marine farming leases and licences will be incorporated into the Resource Management Act and deemed to be resource consents. According to the Committee there will be no diminution of rights for the holders of leases under the Marine Farming Act and the rights of marine farming licence holders may well increase. It certainly appears that the nature of the rights held by marine farmers under the Marine Farming Act will be affected. Instead of a marine farming lease or licence potentially being an interest in land as discussed above, marine farming leases and licences will be deemed to be resource consents. If the Bill is enacted in this form, this will mean that, based on the previous analysis, the marine farming leases and licences will be neither real nor personal property under section 122(1) of the Resource Management Act. Such a conclusion will mean that all of the various types of “marine farming authorisations” will be treated in the same manner for GST purposes, namely that no secondhand goods input tax credit will be available.
Note (not part of the Rulings): These rulings deal with the ability of a registered person to claim a GST input tax credit on the purchase of fishing quota or a marine farming authorisation from an unregistered person. It was considered appropriate to issue four separate rulings given the different nature of the different marine farming authorisations and fishing quota. However, a single commentary applies to all four of the Rulings. MARINE FARMING LEASES AND SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDITS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 03/08 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3) and the definitions of “goods” and “secondhand goods” in section 2, the definition of “associated persons” in section 2A of the Act, and the definition of “input tax” in section 3A of the Act. Definitions For the purposes of this ruling, “marine farming lease” means a marine farming lease granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of a marine farming lease. The supply of the marine farming lease must satisfy the following conditions: 1. The supply by the vendor is a supply made by way of sale. 2. The supply is not a taxable supply. 3. The vendor used the marine farming lease to carry on the marine farming activity specified in the marine farming lease. 4. The supply is made to the purchaser, who is a registered person. 5. The marine farming lease is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. 6. The marine farming lease is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 7. The purchaser maintains sufficient records as required by section 24(7) of the Act. 8. The vendor and the purchaser are not associated persons under the Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: 1. If the marine farming lease satisfies the following two factors: • the marine farming lease defines the area subject to the lease by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • the legal effect of the marine farming lease is that the seabed is not excluded from the area leased, then: • The marine farming lease is “goods” in accordance with the definition of that term in section 2 of the Act. • As the vendor has used the marine farming lease for its intrinsic purpose before the sale to the purchaser, the marine farming lease will constitute “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the Act. • The purchaser of such a marine farming lease will be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period the amount of input tax being the tax fraction of the consideration payable for the supply of the marine farming lease to the extent that payment has been made for that supply in that taxable period. 2. If the marine farming lease does not satisfy one or both of the following two factors: • the marine farming lease defines the area subject to the lease by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • the legal effect of the marine farming lease is that the seabed is not excluded from the area leased, then: • The marine farming lease is not “goods” in accordance with the definition of that term in section 2 of the Act. As a result, the marine farming lease will not constitute “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the Act. • The purchaser of the marine farming lease will not be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period any amount of input tax in respect of the supply of the marine farming lease. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to a supply of a marine farming lease where the time of the supply occurs within 3 years from the date on which this Ruling is signed. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of November 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 03/07 to BR PUB 03/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 03/07 to BR Pub 03/10 (“the Rulings”). Background The question being considered is whether a GST input tax credit is available to registered persons who acquire fishing quota or marine farming authorisations from unregistered persons. While this commentary considers both fishing quota and marine farming authorisations, they need to be dealt with separately as there are different statutory requirements for each of them. Before looking at the relevant GST legislation, the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations needs to be considered in more detail. Fishing quota The fishing quota being considered is individual transferable quota as defined in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1996. The Fisheries Act 1996 is almost fully in force. Prior to this, the operative legislation was the Fisheries Act 1983. It seems that the majority of fishing quota was allocated under the 1983 Act. The provisions in the 1996 Act relating to the allocation of quota came into force on 1 October 1997, and the registration provisions under the 1996 Act came into effect on 1 October 2001. The background to the allocation of fishing quota is that it was initially established and allocated in 1986 pursuant to the Fisheries (Quota Management Areas, Total Allowable Catches, And Catch Histories) Notice 1986, which was made under the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota appears to have been allocated based on a person’s commercial fishing history and no charge was made for the quota initially allocated. The quota does not provide a “free” right, however, as an annual levy needs to be paid. These levies are typically significant amounts. While the majority of the fishing quota is held by large organisations, individual fishermen hold some small parcels of fishing quota. Some of these persons may not make supplies in excess of $40,000 in a 12-month period and thus are not required to register for GST under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. One of these persons may sell their fishing quota to another person who is registered for GST. The question arises for the purchaser as to whether a GST input tax credit can be claimed. The nature of fishing quota There is no definitive statement in any of the fisheries legislation as to the nature of fishing quota. “Individual transferable quota” was not defined in the Fisheries Act 1983. While the term is defined in the Fisheries Act 1996, the definition appears to have been added as a means of ensuring that all of the quota allocated under the different Acts and sections of the Acts is regarded as fishing quota for the purposes of the Fisheries Act 1996. This change in legislation appears to have affected the characteristics that could be ascribed to fishing quota. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, the fundamental rights acquired by the holder of fishing quota (as determined from the legislation) were that the holder of the fishing quota had the right to catch and take away for their own purposes: • a specified quantity; • of a particular fish species; • from a particular area (the quota management area); • in a specific period (in a year, although the quota is issued in perpetuity). These rights were able to be dealt with in ordinary commercial dealings in that they could be bought and sold, used as security, and it was possible to register interests against the rights. The nature of fishing quota granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 has been alluded to in a number of court decisions. The Court of Appeal considered the nature of fishing quota in the case of New Zealand Fishing Industry Association (Inc) v Minister of Fisheries (unreported, CA 82/97, 22 July 1997, Wellington). The case involved the judicial review of a decision made by the Minister of Fisheries to reduce the total allowable commercial catch (TACC) for snapper in quota management area 1. The Court of Appeal made various comments regarding the nature of fishing quota. At page 16 of the Court’s judgment, Justice Tipping stated: While quota are undoubtedly a species of property and a valuable one at that, the rights inherent in that property are not absolute. They are subject to the provisions of the legislation establishing them. That legislation contains the capacity for quota to be reduced. If such reduction is otherwise lawfully made, the fact that quota are a “property right”, to use the appellants’ expression, cannot save them from reduction. That would be to deny an incident integral to the property concerned. The Court of Appeal confirmed that fishing quota is property, although it provides little in the way of further guidance on its precise nature except to state that its characteristics must be determined from the legislation. Further clarification was provided by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith \[2003\] 2 NZLR 23. In dealing with a contractual dispute, he stated that fishing quota is a statutory chose in action (at paragraph 5 of the judgment): The root of title is the issue under the quota management system (the QMS) of individual transferable quota (ITQ) which is a statutory chose in action comprising a fraction of the total of exclusive rights to fish commercially a particular species of fish within one of the ten quota management areas into which the exclusive economic zone is divided. Rights to ITQ are codified by the relevant legislation, especially the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 and the Fisheries Act 1996. This dicta, while useful, does not fully explain the rights and obligations that arise in relation to fishing quota, particularly in relation to change in the nature of the entitlement under the Fisheries Act 1996. The position under the Fisheries Act 1996 is different to the previous position under the Fisheries Act 1983. One of the major differences in relation to the rights derived by holding fishing quota is the introduction of the concept of an “annual catch entitlement”. Instead of the fishing quota providing a right to catch a specified amount of fish, the fishing quota now “generates” an annual catch entitlement on the first day of the fishing year. Fish are now generally caught under the authority of a fishing permit and an annual catch entitlement (there is also a deemed value payment procedure set out in the legislation). For fishing quota holders, the annual catch entitlement is separately tradable, so that for a particular year a quota owner can sell their annual catch entitlement while retaining the fishing quota that will generate another annual catch entitlement the following year. These developments add a further dimension to the nature of fishing quota. The lack of any in-depth analysis of the nature of fishing quota means that it is necessary to examine the characteristics and rights granted under the fisheries legislation. These can then be compared to recognised categories of property. If they are sufficiently similar, it may be appropriate to conclude that the fishing quota should be regarded as belonging to that particular category. Alternatively, it may be that the most appropriate conclusion is that fishing quota is not sufficiently similar to anything else and must be regarded as a separate category of property. There have been a number of suggestions as to the nature of fishing quota. The terms “usufruct right” and “profit à prendre” have been suggested as perhaps describing the fishing quota. A further possibility is that the fishing quota might be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods. This commentary will consider these possible classifications in the following order: • Is fishing quota a “usufruct right”? • Is fishing quota the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the goods? • Is fishing quota a “profit à prendre”? Usufruct right The term “usufruct right” is a civil law rather than common law term. As New Zealand’s jurisprudence is based on the common law and doctrine of precedent, the term “usufruct right” is largely unknown to New Zealand law. The basis of this term in the civil law as opposed to common law is confirmed by the definition of the word “usufruct” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (9 th ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995) which provides: usufruct n. (in Roman and Scots law) the right of enjoying the use and advantages of another’s property short of the destruction or waste of its substance. A more expansive definition of the term “usufruct” is found in Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed, West Publishing Co, 1990): In the civil law, a real right of limited duration on the property of another. The features of the right vary with the nature of the things subject to it as consumables or nonconsumables. ... The right of using and enjoying and receiving the profits of property that belongs to another, and a “usufructuary” is a person who has the usufruct or right of enjoying anything in which he has no property interest. ... There are three types of “usufructs”: natural profits produced by the subject of the usufruct, industrial profits produced by cultivation, and civil profits, which are rents, freights, and revenues from annuities and from other effects or rights. The South African case of Geldenhuys v CIR (1947) 14 SATC 419 provided a very full judicial consideration of the nature of a usufruct right. The case concerned the assessability of an amount of income that arose from the sale of a flock of sheep. The taxpayer’s husband died leaving the taxpayer with a “life interest” in her husband’s estate, with their children as the ultimate beneficiaries. The flock of sheep was valued at £1,451 at the date of the husband’s death. The flock declined in number after the husband’s death due to drought, and a lesser number of sheep were sold for £4,941 some years later. The taxpayer used the proceeds from the sale to invest, purportedly for her own benefit. The Commissioner sought to include the difference in the taxpayer’s assessable income. The taxpayer argued that she was unable to be assessed on this amount as she was only a usufructuary in relation to the sheep. This meant that she only had a right to use the sheep, with no liability for waste due to circumstances beyond her control. She accepted that this also meant that the investment did not belong to her. Justice Steyn (with whom Herbstein and Ogilvie Thompson AJJ agreed) delivered the leading judgment. In considering the nature of a usufruct right, Justice Steyn made the following observations at page 424: According to some authorities, ... movables which are consumed or impaired (consumuntur et minuuntur) by use cannot be subject to a full and complete usufruct, but they can be made the subject of an incomplete usufruct, a quasi-usufruct. In this class of movables cattle and animals are, according to the authorities, included. After referring to further texts and commentaries, Steyn J reached the following conclusions at page 428: The passages from Domat and Huber which I have set out above, however, make it clear in my judgment, that with regard to the cattle and other animals to which they refer these authorities hold that the dominium remains with the remainderman; the usufructuary, according to the passage from Huber cited above having no right to sell or kill them and being obliged to restore them. ... The authorities appear to be agreed that the usufructuary is only entitled to the young or progeny over and above the full complement of the flock. The full number of the flock must be maintained, the young replacing the old as they die, but the flock as an entity must be returned .... Application to fishing quota It seems difficult to apply this concept to fish except perhaps in a fish farming situation. The nature of a usufruct right, even if it did apply in a New Zealand context, does not appear to be consistent with the characteristics of fishing quota identified above. A usufruct right is a right to use property without liability for waste. However, under the fishing quota, a person obtains the right to take the relevant fish from the sea and provide these for consumption. The quota owner is under no obligation in relation to all the other fish in the sea. Further, the quota holder does not have to give a school of fish back at the end of the period, although it will obviously be in the quota holder’s best interests to manage the fisheries resources to ensure sustainability in accordance with the principles in the Fisheries Act 1996. It is also noted that a usufruct right is typically granted for a finite period, while the fishing quota is granted in perpetuity. The effect of this is that the characteristics of a usufruct right are not sufficiently similar to the characteristics of fishing quota for there to be any serious possibility that the fishing quota could be a usufruct right. Sale of goods with a licence The concept of a sale of goods with a licence refers to a contract for the sale of goods, where a licence is granted to the purchaser to go onto (typically the vendor’s) land to get the goods. For instance, an agreement for the right to take trees from a property could be the sale of goods coupled with a licence to enter onto the land and remove the trees. Alternatively, the agreement might constitute a profit à prendre, which will be discussed in more detail below. The distinction between an agreement for the sale of goods with a licence and a profit à prendre appears to turn on whether the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, or simply may take the trees. This follows from the definition of “goods” in the Sale of Goods Act 1908. The definition provides that goods “includes emblements, growing crops, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale”. Thus, unless the agreement between the parties requires that the trees shall be severed, the trees will not be goods under the Sale of Goods Act. If the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, then the agreement is more likely a contract for the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the trees, but if the purchaser may take the trees, then it is more likely to be a profit à prendre. This issue was addressed by Justice Young in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104. The case concerned the nature of an agreement between a landowner and a quarrying company where in return for the payment of a royalty, the quarrying company was entitled to quarry for sand and sandstone on the landowner’s property. In distinguishing between a profit à prendre and a contract for the sale of goods, Justice Young states at page 116: Taking all these factors together it seems to me that the document looks more like a profit à prendre than a licence, but I must also look at the distinction between profits and sale of goods. After a considerable search, it seems to me that the most accurate statement of the law in this connection is provided by Hinde McMorland Sim (op cit at 715), where the authors say: “... profits à prendre and contracts for the sale of goods are seen as mutually exclusive, the former consist only of contracts relating to fructus naturales or other parts of the realty where the purchaser has merely a right or option to sever, while the latter consist of: (1) All sales of fructus industriales regardless of who is to sever them; (2) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which are to be severed by the vendor before property passes to the purchaser; and (3) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which the purchaser is under a contractual obligation to sever.” Thus if the document puts on the purchaser an obligation to sever there is a contract for the sale of goods including a licence to go onto the land for the purpose of carrying out the contract, but if the purchaser merely has the option to sever then there is a profit à prendre. In dealing with this issue, Justice Young referred to a statement in Hinde McMorland & Sim on Land Law (1978-79). That statement still represents the view of the authors as it is also included in the latest edition of the book Land Law in New Zealand, Hinde McMorland & Sim (1997, Butterworths, Wellington). On the basis of this, the key distinguishing feature between a profit à prendre and a sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods is that a profit à prendre only gives rise to an option to sever and take the goods, while there will be an obligation to take the goods under a contract for sale. This is consistent with the New Zealand Supreme Court decision in Egmont Box Company Limited v Registrar General of Lands \[1920\] NZLR 741. Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota could be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, assistance can be derived from the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota itself was originally allocated without cost to fishermen based on prior catch histories. In order to exercise the rights under the fishing quota and associated annual catch entitlement, an annual levy is payable. In determining whether fishing quota is the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, the key distinction is whether there is an obligation to take the fish, or whether there is merely an option to take the fish. This question appears to be answered by section 28ZC(3) of the Fisheries Act 1983, and the more recent version contained in regulation 4(3) of the Fisheries (Cost Recovery Levies) Order 2000. It provides that the levy is payable by quota holders irrespective of whether or not the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed to which the quota relates is taken. Given that the levy is payable regardless of whether the fish are caught in relation to the quota, fishing quota should not be regarded as a sale of the fish as there is no obligation to take the fish. It is also noted that the levy charged is for administering the quota management system rather than necessarily being a “price” payable for the fish. Further, the fish are not “made available” either – the quota owner still has to catch the fish. Thus, situations might exist where the quota owner is unable to catch the amount of the particular species for which they have quota, despite having paid the full levy and desiring to catch the fish. The characteristics of fishing quota are more consistent with the quota holder having only a right to catch the fish. Therefore, the terms of the ownership of the fishing quota are inconsistent with it being an agreement for the sale of goods. Profit à prendre It is noted at the outset that the concept of profit à prendre has been referred to in relation to fishing quota in other contexts. The Law Commission in its Preliminary Paper No. 9 “The Treaty of Waitangi and Maori Fisheries” (1989, Wellington) referred to fishing quota as being in the nature of a profit à prendre. At paragraph 4.20 of the Preliminary Paper it states: In economic terms the ITQ scheme has created a new limited monopoly akin to those arising from other restrictive licensing schemes, such as liquor licences and taxi licences. In legal terms it has converted a public right to fish commercially (subject, of course, to regulation) into a series of private rights. It has created a new property right in the nature of a profit à prendre – broadly an ongoing right to take something tangible that is present on another person’s land – and allocated that right to those who held, or had recently held, commercial fishing licences at the time of its commencement. What is a profit à prendre? The nature of a profit à prendre can be gained from the definition in Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1980) Vol 14, “Easements and Profits à Prendre” para 240, page 115: A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person’s land. It may be more fully defined as a right to enter another’s land and to take some profit of the soil, or a portion of the soil itself, for the use of the owner of the right. Profits à prendre are often contrasted with easements or licences. All three items, profits à prendre, easements and licences, confer a right to enter onto land for a particular purpose. However, the distinguishing feature of a profit à prendre is that it confers an additional right to remove something from the land. While this concept has been used in relation to rights to take trees, turf and various minerals, it has also been applied to the taking of fish and other game from land. One of the earlier cases on point is that of Wickham v Hawker \[1835-42\] All ER 1. The case was concerned with the nature of the right provided to an individual providing the “liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling”. The issue was whether this was a personal licence in which case it could only be exercised by the individual himself, or whether it was a right in the nature of a profit à prendre that could be exercised by servants. Parke B made the following observation at page 5: This being the rule of law on the subject, the point to be decided here is whether the liberty granted is a mere personal licence of pleasure, or a grant of a licence of profit – a profit à prendre. The liberty of fowling has been decided, in one case, to be a profit à prendre, and may be prescribed for as such (Davies’ Case (1688) 3 Mod Rep 246). The liberty to hawk is one species of ancupium ..., the taking of birds by hawks, and seems to follow the same rule. The liberty of fishing appears to be of the same nature; it implies that the person who takes the fish, takes for his own benefit: it is common of fishing. The conclusion of the court was that this grant of the liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling was a profit à prendre. This case was followed by the English Court of Appeal decision in Fitzgerald v Firbank \[1895-9\] All ER 445. This case concerned the nature of a grant of exclusive fishing rights in respect of a section of a river. The reason that the nature of the fishing rights was being considered was that the river had been polluted by the defendant discharging waste products from a gravel works into the river which had a significant detrimental effect on the fish in the river. The plaintiff brought an action for an injunction to stop further pollution and for damages for the pollution to date. The Court of Appeal decided the case in favour of the plaintiff. The comments of the various members of the Court are useful in terms of identifying the nature of the fishing rights. Lindley LJ made the following comments at page 448: The right of fishing includes the right to take away fish unless the contrary is expressly stipulated. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Therefore, the plaintiffs have got a right of some sort as distinguished from a mere revocable licence. What is that? It is a good deal more than an easement; it is what is commonly called a profit à prendre. It is of such a nature that a person who enjoys that right has possessory rights that he can bring an action for trespass at common law for the infringement of those rights.... Rigby LJ, in agreeing with Lindley LJ, went on to state at page 450: I hold that, on the incorporeal hereditament, there is a right of action against any person who disturbs them, either by trespass, or by nuisance, or in any other substantial manner. This decision was followed by Farwell J in Nicholls v Ely Beet Sugar Factory Ltd \[1931\] All ER 154. That case concerned the ability of the plaintiff to bring an action of nuisance seeking an injunction to stop the defendant polluting a river in which the plaintiff held two fishing rights. The defendant sought to defend the action by arguing that the plaintiff’s title was not sufficient title to maintain the action in nuisance. The Court held that the plaintiff’s title, which was a profit à prendre, was sufficient to enable the plaintiff to bring an action in trespass or nuisance to protect that right. The above cases demonstrate that a feature of a profit à prendre is the right to remove something from the land. The cases also show that the courts have applied this concept to fishing rights. Therefore, on the basis that the fishing quota is a “fishing right”, it is possible that the fishing quota is a profit à prendre. An interest in land So far, the cases have concluded that the grant of fishing rights is generally a profit à prendre as it includes the right not only to catch the fish but also to take them away. Another important feature of a profit à prendre is identified in the Nicholls case. This feature is that a profit à prendre is considered to be an interest in land. While not explicitly stated in the Nicholls case, the parties necessarily assume it, as the plaintiff was bringing an action of nuisance. A nuisance, according to the definition accepted by Goddard CJ in the English case of Howard v Walker \[1947\] 2 All ER 197 at page 199 is: Nuisance is the unlawful interference with a person’s use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over, or in connection with it. That a profit à prendre is an interest in land was addressed more directly in Webber v Lee (1882) 9 QBD 315. The case concerned the nature of a right that had been granted over certain land to shoot game and to take it away. The plaintiff was arguing that what had been granted was a mere licence, the defendant that the right was a profit à prendre. The English Court of Appeal unanimously decided that the interest was a profit à prendre and an interest in land. While all three judges delivered separate judgments, they all made statements similar to that delivered by Jessel MR at page 318: The right to shoot game and to take it away when shot has been decided to be an interest in land and a profit à prendre. One of the consequences of a profit à prendre being an interest in land is that a profit à prendre can only be created or granted by the owner of a sufficient estate or interest in the land. Hinde McMorland & Sim’s Land Law in New Zealand (1997, Butterworths, Wellington) states at page 655: It is also necessary to ensure that the proposed grantor both has title to the product involved and has capacity as grantor if he or she owns an estate less than the fee simple. Therefore, a profit à prendre is a right to take something off someone else’s land. It has been held in a number of cases to describe certain fishing rights. Further, it is an interest in land. As it is an interest in land, the fishing rights if they were to constitute a profit à prendre would need to be granted by a person with a legal estate in the land concerned. However, the cases considered so far have only dealt with fishing rights granted over inland waterways, being lakes, rivers and streams. While some fishing quota is granted in respect of freshwater species, the majority of the fishing quota is granted in respect of species that live in the sea. It needs to be considered whether this makes any difference. Can a profit à prendre exist in relation to the sea? The principles identified in the cases considered regarding fishing rights and profits à prendre have been applied to inland waterways. The current situation also involves fishing quota granted over the open seas. There is an issue as to whether the same principles involving profits à prendre can be applied in this instance. Some assistance on this issue can be found in the Privy Council decision in Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada \[1914\] AC 153. The case concerned the ability of the Government of British Columbia to grant various fishing rights. The Government of the Dominion had exclusive authority over the sea coast and inland fisheries, but the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority over property and civil rights in the province. The case concerned an area known as the “railway belt”, which included both non-tidal and tidal waters. The question was whether the granting of fishing rights over this area was in the domain of the Government of the Dominion or whether such rights were property rights properly in the domain of the Government of British Columbia. The Privy Council acknowledged the distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters. Non-tidal waters are those such as lakes, rivers and other inland waterways, excluding those parts of rivers and other waterways that meet the sea and as such are tidal. Tidal waters include these areas where non-tidal waters meet tidal waters, at the mouths of streams and in estuaries, as well as the sea coast. The open seas appear to fall into a separate category. The Privy Council held that in respect of non-tidal waters, the right to grant fishing rights is a property right and as such exists with the owner of the underlying land. It is a private property right. In the case of rivers this may well exist with private individuals, but in the case of lakes, the title to the underlying land is typically reserved to the Crown. On the facts of the case, this should have meant that the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority to grant fishing rights. However, the Government of British Columbia had specifically granted ownership of the particular land in question back to the Government of the Dominion. The railway belt also included tidal waters. The issue was whether the principles that applied to non-tidal waters could have equal application to tidal waters. The Privy Council concluded that the same principles did not apply. In respect of the tidal waters, there was an overriding public right of fishing in tidal waters, which was only subject to regulation by the Government of the Dominion. Viscount Haldane stated at pages 167 and 168: The general principle is that fisheries are in their nature mere profits of the soil over which the water flows, and that title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum. A fishery may of course be severed from the solum, and then it becomes a profit à prendre in alieno solo and an incorporeal hereditament. The severance may be effected by grant or by prescription, but it cannot be brought about by custom, for the origin of such a custom would be an unlawful act. But apart from the existence of such severance by grant or prescription the fishing rights go with the property in the solum. The authorities treat this broad principle as being of general application. They do not regard it as restricted to inland or non- tidal waters. They recognise it as giving to the owners of land on the foreshore or within an estuary or elsewhere where the tide flows and reflows a title to fish in the waters over such lands, and this is equally the case whether the owner be the Crown or a private individual. But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public. From these passages, it can be seen that the Privy Council accepted the general principle that fishing rights attach to the land under the water. These rights can be severed, at which point they become profits à prendre. The Privy Council noted that the authorities have treated this general principle as applying to both inland waterways as well as tidal waters. However, Viscount Haldane noted a further factor that could impact on the application of the principle to tidal waters. The factor is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council noted that the nature of the public right was “not easy to define”. However, the public right was regarded as paramount, which led Viscount Haldane to conclude at page 173: So far as the waters are tidal the right of fishing in them is a public right subject only to regulation by the Dominion Parliament. Therefore, while the general principle is accepted in respect of non-tidal or inland waterways, the Privy Council concluded that it does not apply in respect of tidal waters. The reason for this is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council also reached the same conclusion in relation to the open seas. In specifically addressing fishing rights in waters below the mean low water mark and in the open seas, Viscount Haldane stated at page 173: Their Lordships have already expressed their opinion that the right of fishing in the sea is a right of the public in general which does not depend on any proprietary title, and that the Dominion has the exclusive right of legislating with regard to it. The effect of this is that the Privy Council rejected the application of the profit à prendre concept in respect of fishing rights relating to tidal waters and the open seas. The basis for the rejection of the profit à prendre concept in relation to fishing rights in respect of tidal waters and the open seas is the existence of an overriding public right to fish in the sea. According to the Privy Council, this title is “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The existence of the overriding public right to fish in the sea was a sufficient basis for the Privy Council to decide the matter in the British Columbia case. However, it is noted that even if the public right had not existed, the Privy Council would not automatically have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre. As a profit à prendre is an interest in land, the person granting the fishing rights needs to have a sufficient interest in the land before the fishing right can be a profit à prendre. Therefore, before the Privy Council could have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (in absence of the public right to fish), it would need to be established that the Crown owned the land under sea in respect of which the fishing rights were granted. The Privy Council regarded the issue as a difficult one, and one which they considered they did not need to answer. Viscount Haldane stated at page 174: But their Lordships feel themselves relieved from expressing any opinion on the question whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low water mark to what is known as the three-mile limit because they are of the opinion that the right of the public to fish in the sea has been well established in English law for many centuries and does not depend on the assertion or maintenance of any title in the Crown to the subjacent land. Therefore, the particular issue of whether the Crown owns the seabed appears to be a complex issue in English law. While the Privy Council did not reach a conclusion in respect of this matter, it seems clear that they considered it would have been relevant to a positive finding that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (although the Privy Council concluded that it was not a profit à prendre because of the overriding public right). Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota might be in the nature of a profit à prendre, it is necessary to consider the factors established by the cases and then compare these with the fishing quota. The first characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is a right to take something from land. The cases have held that this extends to taking fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, fishing quota might have been argued to satisfy this requirement as being a right to take fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1996, the position is less arguable. The introduction of the concept of an annual catch entitlement that is severable from the fishing quota perhaps indicates that the right to fish is one step removed from the fishing quota. However, given that the annual catch entitlement is generated by the fishing quota it is considered that fishing quota can still be regarded as ultimately giving rise to a right to take fish from water that flows over land. The second point to note is that fishing quota is granted in relation to a number of different species. These include both freshwater species (found in internal waterways) as well as the deep sea species. It is considered that there is no express differentiation in the Fisheries Acts of the rights provided in relation to the different species. Accordingly, it is considered that any determination of the nature of the property rights obtained in relation to fishing quota has to apply equally to all quota across the various species. Against this background, the Privy Council decision in the British Columbia case that an overriding public right to fish in the sea was inconsistent with the existence of a fishing right in the nature of a profit à prendre in relation to the seas poses a potential problem for the characterisation of fishing quota as a profit à prendre. The Privy Council considered that the public right was “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The acknowledgement that this public right is subject to regulation by Parliament is important in the New Zealand context. It appears that Parliament in New Zealand has regulated the right to fish in the sea through the Fisheries Acts and associated legislation. While a public right to fish in the sea still appears to exist (with the right being limited as to the size and number of fish that can be caught), it seems clear that this is no longer an overriding public right to fish. The rights created under the quota management system now appear to be the paramount rights. The effect of this is that it is considered that primary concern of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case does not appear to be as relevant in a New Zealand context. The final characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is an interest in land. This means that the profit à prendre needs to have been created by a person with a legal interest in the land. In this regard, problems may exist for fishing quota granted in respect of freshwater species. In relation to inland waterways, the owner of the adjacent land generally owns the land lying under the waterway where the waterway is contained on the land owned by the person, and to the midpoint where the waterway forms a border of the property. This principle is subject to certain exceptions where the Crown has asserted ownership of the underlying land – as may have occurred in the case of lakes and navigable rivers. Thus, the case for fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre encounters some difficulties in relation to fishing quota allocated in respect of freshwater species as it not clear whether the Crown would own all of the underlying land in question, from which it could grant an interest in land in the nature of a profit à prendre. The situation is fraught with even more uncertainty in relation to the seabed and foreshore. There is some argument that section 7 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, And Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 provides some assistance as to the ownership of the seabed. However, this only applies in respect of the “territorial sea” which extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of New Zealand. Fishing quota is granted in respect of quota management areas, which extend 200 nautical miles from the mean high water mark along the coast of New Zealand. Further, the effectiveness of this section against customary title was unanimously rejected by the Court of Appeal in Ngati Apa and Others v Attorney-General and Others \[2003\] NZCA 117 (19 June 2003). It is considered that the position is not improved by the “sovereign rights” conferred on New Zealand through Article 56 of the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea. New Zealand did not become a signatory to the Convention until 19 July 1996, meaning that any fishing quota allocated between 1986 and 1996 could not have been granted by the Crown relying on the rights conferred under the Convention. Accordingly, the issue of whether the Crown owns a sufficient interest in the land from which it could grant an interest in the nature of a profit à prendre is unclear. From this perspective, the approach of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case to leave the issue concerning the Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed as unresolved has considerable merit. There are further factors from which guidance can be obtained as to whether fishing quota can be regarded as a profit à prendre. When the Fisheries legislation is considered as a whole and in a wider statutory setting, it is considered that there are some other factors that support a conclusion that Parliament did not intend fishing quota to be a profit à prendre. An example is the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983, where Parliament specifically refers to a forestry right being a profit à prendre. The absence of a similar provision in relation to fishing quota perhaps becomes more significant. A further example is the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 where fishing quota is specifically excluded from the ambit of that Act. While excluding fishing quota from an Act dealing with personal property might tend to support a conclusion that fishing quota is perhaps a profit à prendre, an interest in land, and not personal property, the method of exclusion suggests that Parliament did not exclude fishing quota on this basis. The exclusion provisions in section 23(e) of that Act contain general exclusions for interests in land, and a specific exclusion for fishing quota. If fishing quota was regarded as a profit à prendre and an interest in land, there would have been no need for the specific exclusion. The end result is that there are a number of difficulties with fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre. While there are a number of similarities between the characteristics of fishing quota and the characteristics of a profit à prendre, there are also a number of fundamental inconsistencies in the characteristics that indicate that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre. The effect of these conclusions on the nature of fishing quota leads to the further other possibility that fishing quota is a unique property right, with the rights and obligations in respect of the property determined from the statute creating the right (as alluded to earlier). A unique property right The decision in the British Columbia case was cited with approval by the Full High Court of Australia in the case of Harper v Minister for Sea Fisheries (1989) 168 CLR 314. While the case concerned whether payments made by commercial fishermen for fishing licences were a “tax”, the High Court made some useful observations regarding the nature of the Australian fishing licence system. The Court noted the similarities between the rights obtained under a commercial licence and the rights obtained under a profit à prendre. However, the Court ultimately concluded that the fishing rights were not profits à prendre, but instead were statutory rights created under the particular statutory regime. Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ stated at page 325: The right of commercial exploitation of a public resource for personal profit has become a privilege confined to those who hold commercial licences. This privilege can be compared to a profit à prendre. In truth, however, it is an entitlement of a new kind created as part of a system for preserving a limited public natural resource in a society which is coming to recognize that, in so far as such resources are concerned, to fail to protect may destroy and to preserve the right of everyone to take what he or she will may eventually deprive that right of all context. Conclusion on the nature of fishing quota From the above analysis, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a usufruct right nor is it the sale of goods coupled with a licence. It is noted, however, that the rights granted under the fishing quota are similar to the rights that arise under a profit à prendre. The fishing quota generates an annual catch entitlement which provides the right to take a certain amount of a certain item (being the species of fish) from a certain area. These are the basic characteristics of a profit à prendre. While the rights seem similar, the courts have held that a profit à prendre cannot exist in respect of tidal waters and the open seas, and further that only the owner of an interest in land can create a profit à prendre. As the Crown ownership of the land under the water in respect of which fishing quota is granted is not clear and for the various other reasons considered above, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre. The effect of this is that it is concluded that fishing quota cannot be categorised as a usufruct right, the sale of goods coupled with a licence, or a profit à prendre. Fishing quota has to be regarded as a unique property right, with its characteristics determined from the provisions of the fishing legislation as set out by Justice Tipping in the New Zealand Fishing Industry Association decision referred to above. This is consistent with the Australian decision in Harper. It could also be seen to be consistent with the position set out by the Law Commission referred to above, where the rights are “akin” to a profit à prendre, but not entirely the same. It also reflects the statement made by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd. It is noted that the general characteristics of individual transferable quota were set out in section 27 of the Fisheries Act 1996, but that section 27 has since been repealed. It is considered that section 27 was repealed as being redundant, in that it merely summarised the characteristics that are found in other sections of the Fisheries Act 1996. Marine farming authorisations There are three different statutory bases on which a marine farming authorisation may have been granted. Prior to 1 October 1991, the relevant legislation was the Marine Farming Act 1971. Under this Act, the Ministry of Fisheries was able to grant marine farm leases and marine farming licences. On 1 October 1991, the Resource Management Act 1991 came into effect. This Act set out a new procedure for obtaining a marine farming authorisation. The Resource Management Act also repealed the sections of the Marine Farming Act 1971, which enabled marine farm leases and licences to be granted. The new process under the Resource Management Act 1991 involves two stages. The first stage involves obtaining a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit, or, if the proposed farming activity is already permitted by the relevant Regional Plan, a certificate of compliance. Once one of these documents has been obtained, an application can then be made to the Ministry of Fisheries for a marine farming permit. These are issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The effect of these different statutory regimes is that there are three different types of statutory approval that might be involved in the sale of a marine farming authorisation. These are: • A marine farming lease granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971; • A marine farming licence granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971; or • A marine farming permit granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 in conjunction with a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. Marine farming leases The characteristics of marine farming leases are set out in section 11 of the Marine Farming Act. On the basis of section 11(1)(a) of that Act, it appears that a lease granted under this section would constitute a leasehold estate and thus be an interest in land. However, as the actual terms of any lease as set out in a marine farming lease agreement would govern the nature of the rights acquired under the lease, these terms of the marine farming lease agreement would need to be considered to ensure that they were consistent with the grant of a leasehold estate. For instance, the lease would need to define a particular area of the seabed. Additionally, the terms of the lease would need to be consistent with the lessee obtaining rights in respect of the seabed. While it is likely that most leases would specify a particular area, as it appears that there is no “standard form” lease agreement it is possible that some of the leases granted might exclude rights in respect of the seabed. Such leases may not constitute real property. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming leases that satisfy the following conditions: • The marine farming lease defines the area subject to the lease by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • The legal effect of the marine farming lease is that the seabed is not excluded from the area leased. Marine farming licences Similar concerns arise in respect of marine farming licences as with marine farming leases. Section 11(3) refers to a property right that can be passed onto a person’s estate and is able to be assigned. While the provision is consistent with a licence being in the nature of a contractual right in accordance with the general law concept of a licence, it is also possible that the terms of a licence granted under this provision might give rise to exclusive rights over a defined area of land and so constitute an interest in land – possibly a leasehold interest. Once again, this appears to be a matter that can only be determined by considering the specific terms of the particular marine farming licence in question. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming licences that satisfy the following conditions: • The marine farming licence defines the area subject to the licence by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • The legal effect of the marine farming licence is that the seabed is not excluded from the area licensed. Transition to the Resource Management Act Section 11 of the Marine Farming Act was repealed as from 1 October 1991 by section 362 of the Resource Management Act 1991. However, a savings provision is contained in section 426 of the Resource Management Act. The effect of this provision is to preserve the pre-existing rights relating to both marine farming leases and marine farming licences despite the repeal of section 11 of the Marine Farming Act by the Resource Management Act. Therefore, both marine farming leases and marine farming licences granted under the Marine Farming Act continue in force under the Resource Management Act with no alteration of the rights and obligations under which they were granted. New marine farming authorisations New marine farming authorisations are granted under the Resource Management Act and the Fisheries Act 1983. The first step in the process is to apply for a resource consent from the Local or Regional Council. Section 87 of the Resource Management Act defines a resource consent granted in relation to a coastal marine area to be a “coastal permit”. Both these terms are relevant as some provisions of the Resource Management Act relate to coastal permits and some relate to the more general resource consent. If the Council has already approved the proposed marine farming activity in the area, the applicant will likely only require a Certificate of Compliance rather than a resource consent. Once a person has obtained either a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance, the person also requires a marine farming permit, which is issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The treatment for GST purposes The new marine farming authorisations need to be considered as to how they will be treated under the GST Act because they involve two separate items – a resource consent or certificate of compliance, and a marine farming permit. This matter needs to be considered as it needs to be determined whether there is a single supply of a “marine farming authorisation” or whether there are two separate supplies, one of the resource consent or certificate of compliance and another of the marine farming permit. This general issue is a difficult one, and has not been fully dealt with by the courts. However, there have been a number of cases both in New Zealand and overseas which have provided some guidance. Some of the New Zealand cases to consider the issue of single versus multiple supplies are the High Court decision in CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140; the High Court decision in Coveney v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,328; and the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193. There have been a number of UK decisions on this issue as well, including British Airways plc v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1990\] STC 643; Customs and Excise Commissioners v United Biscuits (UK) Ltd \[1992\] STC 325; Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1995\] STC 341; and Customs & Excise Commissioners v British Telecommunications \[1998\] STC 544. From these cases a number of factors has emerged as being relevant to determining whether there is a single supply or multiple supplies. These factors can be summarised as follows: • The degree to which the services alleged to constitute a single supply are inter- connected, the extent of the interdependence and intertwining, and whether each is an integral part or component of a composite whole. • The mere separate itemisation of things in a contract does not make them separable if they are necessary components of the entire transaction. • Whether the services are rendered under a single contract, or for a single undivided consideration, are matters to be considered, but they are not conclusive. • If it would not be possible to purchase each of the various elements separately and still end up with a useful article or service, the supply is a compound supply that cannot be split up for tax purposes. Application to the facts In determining the degree of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit, section 67J(2) of the Fisheries Act 1983 provides some assistance. It states that a marine farming permit shall only be issued to a person who holds a coastal permit for the relevant area, or to a person who holds a certificate of compliance in respect of the relevant area. Therefore, this section illustrates that there is a high level of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit. This relationship is also reflected in section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983, the section relating to the transfer of the marine farming permit. This section implies that it is only possible to transfer a marine farming permit in conjunction with the resource consent or certificate of compliance to which it relates. It is understood that as a matter of practice, both the coastal permit and the marine farming permit would be transferred when a marine farm is transferred. In terms of the case law discussed above, this relationship between the marine farming permit and the resource consent should be sufficient to conclude that they are sufficiently interconnected to be regarded as a single supply rather than as separate supplies. This is on the basis that one of the permits without the other is essentially useless. Therefore, it appears that most transfers of marine farming activities will involve the supply of both the marine farming permit and the coastal permit or certificate of compliance. It is concluded that when these items are supplied together as part of the same supply, they should be treated as a single supply for GST purposes. The Ruling only applies to supplies of this nature. Legislation Having established the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations, the next issue involves determining the relevant GST legislation. The section for obtaining an input tax credit is section 20. Section 20(2) outlines the documentary evidence that needs to be held in order to obtain an input tax credit, and section 20(3) provides the circumstances in which a claim will be available depending on the basis of GST registration. 20(1) In respect of each taxable period every registered person shall calculate the amount of tax payable by that registered person in accordance with the provisions of this section. 20(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, no deduction of input tax shall be made in respect of a supply, unless - (a) A tax invoice or debit note or credit note, in relation to that supply, has been provided in accordance with sections 24 and 25 of this Act and is held by the registered person making that deduction at the time that any return in respect of that supply is furnished; or (b) A tax invoice is not required to be issued pursuant to section 24(5) or section 24(6) of this Act, or a debit note or credit note is not required to be issued pursuant to section 25 of this Act; or (c) Sufficient records are maintained as required pursuant to section 24(7) of this Act where the supply is a supply of secondhand goods to which that section relates: Provided that where a tax invoice or debit note or credit note in relation to that supply has been provided in accordance with this Act, the Commissioner may determine that no deduction for input tax in relation to that supply shall be made unless that tax invoice or debit note or credit note is retained in accordance with the provisions of section 75 of this Act. 20(3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period - (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) or section 26 of this Act; and (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii) Paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) In relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) of this Act, to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount, or section 26 of this Act; and Under section 20(3), a registered person may deduct from the amount of output tax payable, an amount of “input tax” in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b). “Input tax” is defined in section 3A of the Act. It provides: 3A(1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means - (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (b) tax levied under section 12(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by that person, being goods applied or acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). 3A(2) In the case of a supply by way of sale to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, the amount of input tax is determined under subsection (3) if - (a) the supply is not a taxable supply; and (b) the goods are not supplied by a supplier who - (i) is not resident in New Zealand; and (ii) has previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (c) the goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 3A(3) The amount of input tax is - (a) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, the lesser of - (i) the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (b) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(7A), the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the open market value of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (c) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(8), the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the valuation under section 10(8) of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (d) if the supplier and the recipient are not associated persons and the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates, the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (ii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (e) in all other cases, the tax fraction of the consideration in money for the supply. 3A(4) For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), applied does not include - (a) the delivery or the arranging of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand; or (b) the making of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand more easily achieved. 3A(5) For the purpose of subsection (3), tax fraction means the tax fraction that applies at the time of supply. Section 3A(1)(c) of the definition of “input tax” is the relevant provision. It refers to the calculation of input tax through subsections (2) and (3) when the supply is one of “secondhand goods”. “Secondhand goods” is defined in section 2: “Secondhand goods” does not include - (a) Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or (b) Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver, platinum, or any other substance which, if it were of the required fineness, would be fine metal: or (c) Livestock: Section 2 also provides a definition of the term “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money: Application of the legislation The starting place in order to determine whether a GST input tax credit is available to a registered person is section 20(3). The section provides different options depending on the method of registration adopted by the registered person. For a person registered on an invoice basis, the relevant paragraph is (a)(ia), and for a person using the payments or hybrid basis of registration the relevant paragraph is (b)(i). However, irrespective of the basis of registration, the Act provides very similar tests for claiming an input tax credit in respect of supplies of secondhand goods. The claim is limited to the amount of “input tax” in relation to a supply of goods or services to that registered person, “to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period”. The relevant definition of “input tax” is contained in section 3A(1)(c) of the Act. In determining the input tax under paragraph (c) it is necessary to consider subsections (2) and (3). Leaving aside the associated persons provisions (which are not relevant to the current rulings), there are a number of requirements that need to be satisfied under the two provisions. These are that: (i) there be a supply by way of sale; (ii) the supply not be a taxable supply; (iii) the supply be made to a registered person; (iv) the supply be of secondhand goods; (v) the secondhand goods be situated in New Zealand at the time of supply; and (vi) the secondhand goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Most of these requirements are specified in the rulings to ensure that they will be satisfied in every instance in which the ruling applies. However, requirement 4, that the supply be of secondhand goods, is something that needs to be considered in detail as it cannot be specified in the rulings. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether or not the fishing quota and mussel licences can be secondhand goods. “Secondhand goods” The definition of “secondhand goods” does not attempt to define the term, but instead prescribes a list of things that are not included in the meaning of “secondhand goods”. Fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are not excluded under the definition. As the definition gives little indication as to what is included in the term, regard needs to be had to the ordinary meaning of “secondhand goods”. The first observation that can be made is that “secondhand goods” is a composite term. It relates to items that are first of all “goods”, and then the subset of those goods that can be described as “secondhand”. “Goods” In considering the first question as to what is comprised in the term “goods”, assistance can be found in section 2. Goods “means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money”. “Goods” is defined very widely in the initial part of the definition, and then subjected to two specific exclusions. It includes all kinds of real and personal property, but excludes choses in action and money. Therefore, it is necessary to establish whether fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are real or personal property and then secondly, whether they are money or choses in action. “Property” Before considering the “real” or “personal” aspects of property, the nature of “property” should first be established. The term “property” is not defined in the Act. Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1991) Volume 44, “Stamp Duty”, para 1,032, provides the following description of “property”: Property is that which belongs to a person exclusively of others, and can be the subject of bargain and sale. It includes goodwill, trademarks, licence to use a patent, book debts, options to purchase and other rights under a contract. A revocable licence is not property. An owner of unworked minerals who gives an undertaking to the service owner not to work them does not thereby convey property, and a grant of a purported exclusive right to carry on a certain business in an area when the grantor has no such right is not a conveyance of property. A similar view is taken in Gray’s Law of Personal Property (5th ed, Butterworths, 1968) at page 1: The term “property” as used in the law of New Zealand and other common-law countries has a dual meaning. It may signify the title to or rights to ownership in goods or other property; and when s. 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 provides by rule 1 that in a contract for the sale of ascertained goods in a deliverable state the “property” in the goods passes at the time the contract is made, “property” here means the title to or ownership of the goods in question. The word “property” may in addition signify the thing owned, that over which title is exercised; in this sense, of course, it includes tangible goods such as a book or a table, but the word covers also incorporeal forms of property such as estates in land (an estate being an aggregate of rights exercisable over or in respect of land) or the contractual rights embodied in a cheque or an insurance policy. From this it can be seen that the term “property” is used to describe a wide range of things, both tangible and intangible. Its fundamental characteristics seem to be that it is capable of being owned, and that the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred (see, for instance the House of Lords decision in National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth \[1965\] 2 All ER 472). “Property” needs to be able to be defined and identified, and have a degree of permanence or stability. Further, it needs to able to be transferred. “Real” and “personal” property It is a well-established principle of English law that all “property” can be categorised as either real property or personal property. As Gray explains at page 1: “The distinction between real property (or realty) and personal property (personalty) is procedural in origin and is derived from the ancient forms of action in English law. In the twelfth century, the possession of freehold land was recoverable by certain actions which were called “real” actions; at this date the remedy for dispossession of all other kinds of property was, effectively, damages only, and actions for damages in these circumstances were called “personal” actions. The existence of only two classes of property has its origin in these two types of action. The acknowledgement that property is either real or personal is contained in the first sentence of the following quote from Gray (at page 2): It is not sufficient, however, to say simply without qualification that land is realty and all other property is personalty. Real property includes, besides the freehold estates and interests in land, things which are said to “savour of the realty”. The effect of there only being two classes of property, one being real and the other personal, is that a finding that something is property necessarily means that it will be either real or personal property. There is no third category. Therefore, in terms of the definition of “goods”, if the item is “property”, then it will be either real or personal property. A question arises as to whether it is necessary to determine whether the fishing quota is real or personal property. The section includes both types of property and as long as it is either one or the other there should be no need to make a final determination. While this is true, attempting to classify the property as either real or personal assists in determining whether or not the item is a chose in action. The reason for this is that the chose in action – chose in possession distinction appears to be limited to personal property. The exclusion for “choses in action” The term “chose in action” is used to describe various types of personal property. It is not a term that is applied to real property. This observation was made in the English case of Torkington v Magee \[1900-3\] All ER 991 where Channell J defined the term at page 994: Chose in action is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession (emphasis added). Therefore, a finding that an item is real property means that the exclusion for choses in action will not be relevant. However, a finding that the item is personal property means that the exclusion for choses in action could be relevant. In determining the characteristics of a chose in action, the above quote from Torkington v Magee is referred to by a number of commentators as providing a useful working definition. In a New Zealand context, the Court of Appeal considered the issue in the case of Re Marshall (Deceased), CIR v Public Trustee \[1965\] NZLR 851. The case considered a situation involving a right to demand interest on a loan, and whether this was a chose in action for the purposes of the Death Duties Act 1921. In considering the issue of “chose in action”, McCarthy J stated at page 860: The right was property, for property in its wider sense includes all things of value. It was personal property and “all personal things are either in possession or in action. The law knows no tertium quid between the two”. This celebrated statement of Fry LJ in Colonial Bank v Whinney (1885) 30 Ch D 261 at p 285, is familiar to every lawyer. It received, I think the express, but certainly the implied approval of the House of Lords on appeal ((1886) 11 AC 426). Justice McCarthy provides further guidance on the characteristics of choses in action at page 861: That is so because if the right to give the notice and the corresponding duty to accept it had been denied, there was no possible method of enforcement other than going to law and thereby securing not the physical possession of the thing but the advantages of its ownership. This, says Mr Cyprian Williams in his article in (1895) 11 LQR 223, is the true test, and I agree. ... The characteristics that one cannot take the right into physical possession (even after judgment in one’s favour) and that it can only be vindicated by Court action, are the qualifying features of a chose in action and have become the bases of most modern definitions (emphasis added). The fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is the same in both authorities. Both authorities refer to the fact that in respect of a chose in action, one cannot take the right into physical possession. Being able to take the thing into possession is a characteristic of a chose in possession. Even if court action is taken to enforce the chose in action, the result may well be that the advantages of ownership are secured rather than actual physical possession of the thing. “Secondhand” There have been few cases on the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” in the GST context. Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 was a decision of Barber DJ where he had to consider whether deer velvet purchased direct from producers by means of commission agents were secondhand goods when they were purchased by a distributor and exporter of deer velvet. His Honour concluded that they were not secondhand goods. Judge Barber accepted that the two key concepts underlying whether something is secondhand are previous ownership and previous use. He stated at page 3,148: I agree with counsel that the concept of secondhand relates to pre-ownership or pre-use. I agree ... that the emphasis is on pre-use. I consider that there is quite some commonsense flexibility in ascertaining whether a good is still new or has become secondhand. I do not regard second ownership as necessarily rendering an item secondhand. Many goods pass from manufacturer to wholesaler or retailer to customer or consumer (with other levels of distributors sometimes also involved), and yet are not regarded as secondhand at the consumer purchaser level, even though the item has been used as stock-in- trade at the various distribution levels. The good is not usually regarded as secondhand until it has been used for its intrinsic purpose. The TRA felt that previous ownership of goods is not in itself necessarily sufficient to meet the test of secondhand in the Act. Usually a previous owner must have also used the goods for their intrinsic purpose. Subsequently the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of secondhand in LR McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. McKay J expressly referred to and agreed with Judge Barber’s comments in Case N16 as to the ordinary meaning of the term “secondhand”. Justice Richardson (as he then was) stated at page 11,213: The short point of the appeal is whether wool purchased by registered persons from unregistered persons is secondhand goods for the purposes of the 1985 Act. If the expression secondhand goods is given its ordinary and natural meaning it is common ground that it is not within that description. In ordinary usage the expression refers to goods which have been used, although depending on the context it may apply to goods which are no longer new or even in some contexts goods which have simply been previously owned. Mr Harley for the appellants did not seek to draw any distinction based on “use” of the wool by the sellers. The argument for the appellants is that to accord with the scheme and purpose of the legislation the expression has to be given the meaning of any goods which have been purchased by a registered person. The judgments of the Court of Appeal state that the term “secondhand” should be given its ordinary or normal meaning. While “secondhand” can mean either pre- owned or pre-used, the Court concluded that it is not sufficient that the goods were previously owned. If an item were “secondhand” simply through being previously owned, the term “secondhand” would be deprived of any practical meaning according to Justice Richardson. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that the more relevant factor is whether the goods have been previously used. The effect of this is that the courts have not extended the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” to goods that have been previously owned but not previously used for their intrinsic purpose. Application to fishing quota Is fishing quota “property”? When these concepts are applied to fishing quota, it seems that fishing quota would constitute property. Fishing quota is definable and identifiable through being granted under a statutory regime. It is permanent or stable in nature as it is issued in perpetuity. Fishing quota is capable of being owned and there are specific legislative provisions in the Fisheries Act 1996 dealing with the ability of the fishing quota to be transferred. On this basis, it can be accepted that fishing quota is “property”. Is fishing quota real or personal property? The next issue is whether fishing quota is real or personal property. The characteristics of fishing quota are determined from considering the legislation under which it is created. Under section 66 of the Fisheries Act 1996 (previously section 28O of the Fisheries Act 1983) the holders of individual transferable quota obtain a right to receive an annual catch entitlement for the species that is the subject of the quota. While the annual catch entitlement is defined by reference to a “quota management area”, there is nothing in either of the Fisheries Acts to suggest that it was intended that fishing quota gives rise to an interest in land. Therefore, based on this and the earlier conclusion that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre, it is considered that fishing quota is neither an interest in land nor real property. As fishing quota is “property” and property is either “real” or “personal”, the conclusion that fishing quota is not real property leads also to the conclusion that it must be personal property. As fishing quota is personal property, it will fall within the words “all kinds of real and personal property” in the definition of “goods” in the Act. Therefore, it is considered that this first part of the definition is satisfied. The next question is whether either of the two exclusions to the definition applies. Is fishing quota a “chose in action”? On the issue of whether fishing quota is a chose in action, it is established by the cases that the fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is that one cannot take the right into physical possession. Fishing quota appears to possess this characteristic. The right to catch fish cannot be taken into possession. While an argument could be made that a person could simply catch the fish under the quota, this seems to confuse the fish (which could be taken into possession) with the right to catch those fish (which, it is considered, cannot be taken into possession). The end result is that it is concluded that fishing quota is a chose in action. While fishing quota is capable of satisfying the first part of the definition of “goods”, being a form of personal property, it is then excluded from the definition of “goods” by reason that it is a chose in action. The effect of this is that fishing quota cannot be regarded as being “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. Given that it is concluded that fishing quota is not “goods”, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether the fishing quota could be regarded as being “secondhand”. Therefore, as it is concluded that fishing quota is not “goods”, it is also concluded that fishing quota cannot be “secondhand goods”. Application to marine farming authorisations Are marine farming authorisations “goods”? This question needs to be addressed in respect of the three types of marine farming authorisations: • The old marine farming leases; • The old marine farming licences; and • The new combination resource consent and marine farming permit. Marine farming leases It is accepted that marine farming leases are property. The marine farming lease is definable, has a degree of permanence (being the term of the lease) and is capable of being transferred. This means that marine farming leases are property for the first part of the definition. However, in terms of whether marine farming leases are real or personal property, it is not certain that all marine farming leases would give rise to a leasehold estate. To the extent that a marine farming lease is a leasehold estate, it will be real property. If the particular marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate, it will then constitute personal property. An issue exists as to whether marine farming leases might be excluded from being goods on the basis that they are choses in action. As noted above in relation to fishing quota, because choses in action are a subset of personal property, this will only be relevant if it is determined that the particular marine farming lease is not a leasehold estate (and thus not real property). If the marine farming lease is real property, then it will be “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that are not real property and are thus personal property, it needs to be determined whether they would be choses in action. The key distinguishing characteristic between choses in action and choses in possession, is the ability of the item to be “taken into possession”. Marine farming leases are like fishing quota in this regard in that they do not have a physical aspect to their nature. They encompass a number of rights, but these rights cannot be taken into possession. The only way to enforce these rights is to sue to enforce them. The effect of this is the conclusion that those marine farming leases that are not real property would be choses in action. This means that if a marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate it will be a chose in action and excluded from the definition of “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that constitute real property and are “goods”, the further issue of whether they are “secondhand” so as to be “secondhand goods” needs to be considered. The marine farming leases being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. The only other issue to consider is the “use” issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16. The intrinsic purpose of a marine farming lease is to farm the particular species specified in the lease. If a farming operation has been carried out pursuant to the lease, then the conclusion appears inescapable that the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. However, situations could arise in respect of marine farming leases where a person never actually exercises the rights under the lease and simply sells it without ever having attempted to farm the particular aquatic life in question. In such a case, an issue exists as to whether the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. On the basis of the case law, it appears that it has not been used for its intrinsic purpose. As this is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis, the Ruling only applies to marine farming leases that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the lease. Marine farming licences Under section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act, it seems clear that marine farming licences are property. The licences are defined in that Act, they have a degree of permanence (being the term of the licence) and are capable of being transferred. Therefore, it is concluded that marine farming licences are property. The next issue is whether marine farming licences are real or personal property. The nature of a marine farming licence is not entirely clear from the Marine Farming Act. Section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act provides that the right received under a marine farming licence is “the exclusive right during the currency of the licence to farm within the licensed area the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence”. It seems possible that the rights created under this provision could constitute an interest in land depending on the particular terms of any given licence. If the licence is defined by reference to a particular area of land and the licence provides the exclusive right to farm this area, it is possible that an interest in land (being a leasehold interest) would have been created despite the use of the term “licence”. On this basis, it is concluded that some marine farming licences may constitute an interest in land and will thus be real property. As it has been concluded that marine farming licences are “property”, those licences that are not real property will be personal property. The next matter to be considered is whether the exclusion for choses in action in the definition of “goods” applies. This issue will only be relevant to those licences that are personal property. The key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. It is a right that can only be enforced through court action. In respect of those marine farming licences that are personal property, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that constitute the marine farming licences into possession. If the rights are not real property, the licence will not provide an exclusive right to “possess” the particular area. The marine farming licence will provide for the exclusive right of being able to farm in the particular area, but it does not appear to provide the right to exclude others from the area. Therefore, it seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears as if the marine farming licences that are personal property would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that these marine farming licences are excluded from the definition of “goods” for GST purposes. However, the marine farming licences that are real property are not subject to the exclusion for choses in action, and thus will constitute “goods” for the purposes of the Act. For those marine farming licences that are real property, the next question is whether these “goods” are “secondhand” so as to qualify for the secondhand goods input tax credit under the GST Act. The marine farming licences being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. In terms of the “use” issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16, the same conclusion that applied to marine farming leases applies to marine farming licences. Whether the marine farming licence has been used for its intrinsic purpose is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis. For this reason, the Ruling only applies to marine farming licences that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence. Resource consents and marine farming permits The definition of “goods” requires that the item concerned be either real or personal property. It has been concluded that the GST Act will regard the supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit as a single supply. The nature of the property comprised in this supply needs to be considered. The nature of a resource consent and certificate of compliance Section 139(6) deems a certificate of compliance to be a resource consent with the result that the provisions of the Resource Management Act are to apply accordingly. Being a “resource consent” means that the rights attaching to the resource consent are governed by section 122 of the Resource Management Act. Section 122 states that “a resource consent is neither real nor personal property”. This statement is interesting. It is well established that all property is either real or personal property. On this basis, the only sensible interpretation which can be placed on this provision is that Parliament did not want all of the common law and other rights which would automatically attach to property of this nature to attach to resource consents. Parliament must have wanted to regulate the rights that attach to a resource consent. This is consistent with the rest of the section, which goes on to deal with the characteristics of resource consents for the purposes of other legislation. Unfortunately, there is no statement regarding the revenue Acts. The issue, therefore, is whether the statement in section 122 of the Resource Management Act applies to the GST Act. Not real nor personal property In determining whether or not the statement in the Resource Management Act 1991 impacts on the classification of a resource consent under the GST Act, there are a number of observations which can be made. The first observation is that the statement in section 122 is not a standard definition. It is not contained in section 2 of the Resource Management Act along with all the other definitions that are prefaced with the words “for the purposes of this Act”. Therefore, Parliament may well have intended section 122 to have wider application than simply the Resource Management Act. A second point can be derived from the wording of section 122 itself. After making the initial statement, the section goes on to address a number of specific Acts and circumstances where the resource consents are to be regarded as having the characteristics of personal property. The GST Act is not one of those situations. This seems a clear indication from Parliament that the opening statement was intended to apply to the Acts that are dealt with in the section. To take the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 as an example, it seems from the plain wording of the section that Parliament intended that the opening words of the section would have meant that resource consents were not real or personal for the purposes of that Act. This was why Parliament inserted subsection (4) to make it clear that for the purposes of that Act, it was appropriate for a resource consent to be regarded as goods within the meaning of that Act. This does not make a resource consent goods or personal property for other purposes though. On this basis, it seems that the statement in section 122 would apply for the purposes of the GST Act also. By not making a specific exception for the GST Act, it is only possible to assume that Parliament were content with the initial statement applying to the GST Act. The third observation, which follows from the second, is the intention of the section that is apparent from the words used. By making the statement that a resource consent is neither real nor personal property, Parliament has created a legal fiction. A resource consent has the general characteristics of property, and the law only knows two categorisations of that property – real and personal. Therefore, in discerning the intention of Parliament in making this statement, the most logical intention is that Parliament did not want the natural common law rights to attach to a resource consent which would attach as a matter of course if the resource consent were either real or personal property. The consequences of section 122 of the Resource Management Act then need to be applied to the definition of “goods” in the GST Act. “Goods” means “all kinds of personal or real property ...”. It has been established that resource consents and certificates of compliance are deemed not to be “personal or real property”, and that the deeming provision operates for purposes outside the Resource Management Act and so affects the GST Act as well. This means that resource consents and certificates of compliance do not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act as they are not personal or real property. Effect of the marine farming permit There is one further matter to consider, and that is the effect that the marine farming permit might have on any ultimate conclusion regarding the combined property right, being the resource consent or certificate of compliance and a marine farming permit. It has already been concluded that for GST purposes, the supply of these items should be treated as a single supply. It has also been noted that the issuing of a marine farming permit is dependent on having a resource consent or certificate of compliance. Based on these conclusions, it is possible to conclude that the marine farming permit would have no effect on the issue of whether the combined property right is goods. However, if the marine farming permit were considered in its own right, it seems that the same conclusion would be reached. It appears that a marine farming permit would constitute property. Marine farming permits are capable of being owned, and the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred under section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983. There is nothing in any of the relevant legislation to suggest that a marine farming permit is real property. While a marine farming permit provides a right to farm within the permit area, it does not typically provide any right to occupy the seabed. It is considered that without such a right, the marine farming permit is unlikely to be an interest in land and thus real property. That a marine farming permit does not provide any right to occupy the seabed seems reflected in section 67L(3), which provides that the marine farming permit does not authorise the permit holder to take any naturally occurring aquatic life in the area subject to the permit. Thus, it is considered that marine farming permits do not give rise to an interest in land and are accordingly concluded to be personal property. As the marine farming permits are not “money” the only other exclusion to be considered is that for choses in action. From the earlier analysis, the key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. In respect of marine farming permits, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that comprise a marine farming permit into possession. It seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears that marine farming permits would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that marine farming permits are excluded from the definition of “goods” for GST purposes. Therefore, it is concluded that the existence of a marine farming permit as part of a supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit will not affect the status of the supply for GST purposes. Regardless of whether the resource consent or certificate of compliance and the marine farming permit are considered together or separately, it is concluded that a supply of such items will not be a supply of “goods” as defined in the GST Act. Summary for marine farming authorisations Some marine farming leases and some marine farming licences may constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. These will be leases and licences that are defined with reference to a particular area of land, and that provide for exclusive rights in respect of that land. Such marine farming leases and licences are likely to be interests in land and thus real property. As real property, neither of the exclusions relating to “money” and “choses in action” will apply so that they will not be excluded from the definition of “goods”. The marine farming leases and licences that are not real property and so are personal property will not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. The reason for this is that they are choses in action. Because the rights under these marine farming leases and licences cannot be taken into possession, the leases and licences that are personal property will constitute choses in action rather than choses in possession and so will be excluded from the definition of “goods”. In relation to resource consents and marine farming permits, it appears as if the declaration in section 122 of the Resource Management Act that resource consents are neither real nor personal property is intended to apply outside the Resource Management Act. As there is no legislative modification of the statement in respect of the GST Act, the resource consents and marine farming permits will not qualify as being “goods” because they do not satisfy the opening words of the definition of being real or personal property. Therefore, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether they are “secondhand”. One further matter Before concluding in respect of marine farming authorisations, it needs to be noted that there is presently a Bill before Parliament that, if enacted in its present form, would affect the three different statutory permissions set out above. The Bill is the Resource Management (Marine Farming and Heritage Provisions) Amendment Bill. This Bill has been reviewed by the Transport and Environment Committee (which reported back on 30 April 1999), and there are a number of useful comments in the Committee’s report as to the existing situation and the proposed legislation. The Bill is currently awaiting its second reading. Under the proposals, marine farming leases and licences will be incorporated into the Resource Management Act and deemed to be resource consents. According to the Committee there will be no diminution of rights for the holders of leases under the Marine Farming Act and the rights of marine farming licence holders may well increase. It certainly appears that the nature of the rights held by marine farmers under the Marine Farming Act will be affected. Instead of a marine farming lease or licence potentially being an interest in land as discussed above, marine farming leases and licences will be deemed to be resource consents. If the Bill is enacted in this form, this will mean that, based on the previous analysis, the marine farming leases and licences will be neither real nor personal property under section 122(1) of the Resource Management Act. Such a conclusion will mean that all of the various types of “marine farming authorisations” will be treated in the same manner for GST purposes, namely that no secondhand goods input tax credit will be available.
Note (not part of the Rulings): These rulings deal with the ability of a registered person to claim a GST input tax credit on the purchase of fishing quota or a marine farming authorisation from an unregistered person. It was considered appropriate to issue four separate rulings given the different nature of the different marine farming authorisations and fishing quota. However, a single commentary applies to all four of the Rulings. MARINE FARMING LICENCES AND SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDITS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 03/09 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3) and the definitions of “goods” and “secondhand goods” in section 2, the definition of “associated persons” in section 2A of the Act, and the definition of “input tax” in section 3A of the Act. Definitions For the purposes of this ruling, “marine farming licence” means a marine farming licence granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of a marine farming licence. The supply of the marine farming licence must satisfy the following conditions: 1. The supply by the vendor is a supply made by way of sale. 2. The supply is not a taxable supply. 3. The vendor used the marine farming licence to carry on the marine farming activity specified in the marine farming licence. 4. The supply is made to the purchaser, who is a registered person. 5. The marine farming licence is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. 6. The marine farming licence is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 7. The purchaser maintains sufficient records as required by section 24(7) of the Act. 8. The vendor and the purchaser are not associated persons under the Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: 1. If the marine farming licence satisfies the following two factors: • the marine farming licence defines the area subject to the licence by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • the legal effect of the marine farming licence is that the seabed is not excluded from the area licensed, then • The marine farming licence is “goods” in accordance with the definition of that term in section 2 of the Act. • As the vendor has used the marine farming licence for its intrinsic purpose before the sale to the purchaser, the marine farming licence will constitute “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the Act. • The purchaser of the marine farming licence will be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period the amount of input tax being the tax fraction of the consideration payable for the supply of the marine farming licence, to the extent that payment has been made for that supply in that taxable period. 2. If the marine farming licence does not satisfy one or both of the following two factors: • the marine farming licence defines the area subject to the licence by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • the legal effect of the marine farming licence is that the seabed is not excluded from the area licensed, then • The marine farming licence is not “goods” in accordance with the definition of that term in section 2 of the Act. As a result, the marine farming licence will not constitute “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the Act. • The purchaser of the marine farming licence will not be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period any amount of input tax in respect of the supply of the marine farming licence. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to a supply of a marine farming licence where the time of the supply occurs within 3 years from the date on which this Ruling is signed. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of November 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 03/07 to BR PUB 03/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 03/07 to BR Pub 03/10 (“the Rulings”). Background The question being considered is whether a GST input tax credit is available to registered persons who acquire fishing quota or marine farming authorisations from unregistered persons. While this commentary considers both fishing quota and marine farming authorisations, they need to be dealt with separately as there are different statutory requirements for each of them. Before looking at the relevant GST legislation, the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations needs to be considered in more detail. Fishing quota The fishing quota being considered is individual transferable quota as defined in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1996. The Fisheries Act 1996 is almost fully in force. Prior to this, the operative legislation was the Fisheries Act 1983. It seems that the majority of fishing quota was allocated under the 1983 Act. The provisions in the 1996 Act relating to the allocation of quota came into force on 1 October 1997, and the registration provisions under the 1996 Act came into effect on 1 October 2001. The background to the allocation of fishing quota is that it was initially established and allocated in 1986 pursuant to the Fisheries (Quota Management Areas, Total Allowable Catches, And Catch Histories) Notice 1986, which was made under the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota appears to have been allocated based on a person’s commercial fishing history and no charge was made for the quota initially allocated. The quota does not provide a “free” right, however, as an annual levy needs to be paid. These levies are typically significant amounts. While the majority of the fishing quota is held by large organisations, individual fishermen hold some small parcels of fishing quota. Some of these persons may not make supplies in excess of $40,000 in a 12-month period and thus are not required to register for GST under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. One of these persons may sell their fishing quota to another person who is registered for GST. The question arises for the purchaser as to whether a GST input tax credit can be claimed. The nature of fishing quota There is no definitive statement in any of the fisheries legislation as to the nature of fishing quota. “Individual transferable quota” was not defined in the Fisheries Act 1983. While the term is defined in the Fisheries Act 1996, the definition appears to have been added as a means of ensuring that all of the quota allocated under the different Acts and sections of the Acts is regarded as fishing quota for the purposes of the Fisheries Act 1996. This change in legislation appears to have affected the characteristics that could be ascribed to fishing quota. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, the fundamental rights acquired by the holder of fishing quota (as determined from the legislation) were that the holder of the fishing quota had the right to catch and take away for their own purposes: • a specified quantity; • of a particular fish species; • from a particular area (the quota management area); • in a specific period (in a year, although the quota is issued in perpetuity). These rights were able to be dealt with in ordinary commercial dealings in that they could be bought and sold, used as security, and it was possible to register interests against the rights. The nature of fishing quota granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 has been alluded to in a number of court decisions. The Court of Appeal considered the nature of fishing quota in the case of New Zealand Fishing Industry Association (Inc) v Minister of Fisheries (unreported, CA 82/97, 22 July 1997, Wellington). The case involved the judicial review of a decision made by the Minister of Fisheries to reduce the total allowable commercial catch (TACC) for snapper in quota management area 1. The Court of Appeal made various comments regarding the nature of fishing quota. At page 16 of the Court’s judgment, Justice Tipping stated: While quota are undoubtedly a species of property and a valuable one at that, the rights inherent in that property are not absolute. They are subject to the provisions of the legislation establishing them. That legislation contains the capacity for quota to be reduced. If such reduction is otherwise lawfully made, the fact that quota are a “property right”, to use the appellants’ expression, cannot save them from reduction. That would be to deny an incident integral to the property concerned. The Court of Appeal confirmed that fishing quota is property, although it provides little in the way of further guidance on its precise nature except to state that its characteristics must be determined from the legislation. Further clarification was provided by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith \[2003\] 2 NZLR 23. In dealing with a contractual dispute, he stated that fishing quota is a statutory chose in action (at paragraph 5 of the judgment): The root of title is the issue under the quota management system (the QMS) of individual transferable quota (ITQ) which is a statutory chose in action comprising a fraction of the total of exclusive rights to fish commercially a particular species of fish within one of the ten quota management areas into which the exclusive economic zone is divided. Rights to ITQ are codified by the relevant legislation, especially the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 and the Fisheries Act 1996. This dicta, while useful, does not fully explain the rights and obligations that arise in relation to fishing quota, particularly in relation to change in the nature of the entitlement under the Fisheries Act 1996. The position under the Fisheries Act 1996 is different to the previous position under the Fisheries Act 1983. One of the major differences in relation to the rights derived by holding fishing quota is the introduction of the concept of an “annual catch entitlement”. Instead of the fishing quota providing a right to catch a specified amount of fish, the fishing quota now “generates” an annual catch entitlement on the first day of the fishing year. Fish are now generally caught under the authority of a fishing permit and an annual catch entitlement (there is also a deemed value payment procedure set out in the legislation). For fishing quota holders, the annual catch entitlement is separately tradable, so that for a particular year a quota owner can sell their annual catch entitlement while retaining the fishing quota that will generate another annual catch entitlement the following year. These developments add a further dimension to the nature of fishing quota. The lack of any in-depth analysis of the nature of fishing quota means that it is necessary to examine the characteristics and rights granted under the fisheries legislation. These can then be compared to recognised categories of property. If they are sufficiently similar, it may be appropriate to conclude that the fishing quota should be regarded as belonging to that particular category. Alternatively, it may be that the most appropriate conclusion is that fishing quota is not sufficiently similar to anything else and must be regarded as a separate category of property. There have been a number of suggestions as to the nature of fishing quota. The terms “usufruct right” and “profit à prendre” have been suggested as perhaps describing the fishing quota. A further possibility is that the fishing quota might be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods. This commentary will consider these possible classifications in the following order: • Is fishing quota a “usufruct right”? • Is fishing quota the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the goods? • Is fishing quota a “profit à prendre”? Usufruct right The term “usufruct right” is a civil law rather than common law term. As New Zealand’s jurisprudence is based on the common law and doctrine of precedent, the term “usufruct right” is largely unknown to New Zealand law. The basis of this term in the civil law as opposed to common law is confirmed by the definition of the word “usufruct” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (9 th ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995) which provides: usufruct n. (in Roman and Scots law) the right of enjoying the use and advantages of another’s property short of the destruction or waste of its substance. A more expansive definition of the term “usufruct” is found in Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed, West Publishing Co, 1990): In the civil law, a real right of limited duration on the property of another. The features of the right vary with the nature of the things subject to it as consumables or nonconsumables. ... The right of using and enjoying and receiving the profits of property that belongs to another, and a “usufructuary” is a person who has the usufruct or right of enjoying anything in which he has no property interest. ... There are three types of “usufructs”: natural profits produced by the subject of the usufruct, industrial profits produced by cultivation, and civil profits, which are rents, freights, and revenues from annuities and from other effects or rights. The South African case of Geldenhuys v CIR (1947) 14 SATC 419 provided a very full judicial consideration of the nature of a usufruct right. The case concerned the assessability of an amount of income that arose from the sale of a flock of sheep. The taxpayer’s husband died leaving the taxpayer with a “life interest” in her husband’s estate, with their children as the ultimate beneficiaries. The flock of sheep was valued at £1,451 at the date of the husband’s death. The flock declined in number after the husband’s death due to drought, and a lesser number of sheep were sold for £4,941 some years later. The taxpayer used the proceeds from the sale to invest, purportedly for her own benefit. The Commissioner sought to include the difference in the taxpayer’s assessable income. The taxpayer argued that she was unable to be assessed on this amount as she was only a usufructuary in relation to the sheep. This meant that she only had a right to use the sheep, with no liability for waste due to circumstances beyond her control. She accepted that this also meant that the investment did not belong to her. Justice Steyn (with whom Herbstein and Ogilvie Thompson AJJ agreed) delivered the leading judgment. In considering the nature of a usufruct right, Justice Steyn made the following observations at page 424: According to some authorities, ... movables which are consumed or impaired (consumuntur et minuuntur) by use cannot be subject to a full and complete usufruct, but they can be made the subject of an incomplete usufruct, a quasi-usufruct. In this class of movables cattle and animals are, according to the authorities, included. After referring to further texts and commentaries, Steyn J reached the following conclusions at page 428: The passages from Domat and Huber which I have set out above, however, make it clear in my judgment, that with regard to the cattle and other animals to which they refer these authorities hold that the dominium remains with the remainderman; the usufructuary, according to the passage from Huber cited above having no right to sell or kill them and being obliged to restore them. ... The authorities appear to be agreed that the usufructuary is only entitled to the young or progeny over and above the full complement of the flock. The full number of the flock must be maintained, the young replacing the old as they die, but the flock as an entity must be returned .... Application to fishing quota It seems difficult to apply this concept to fish except perhaps in a fish farming situation. The nature of a usufruct right, even if it did apply in a New Zealand context, does not appear to be consistent with the characteristics of fishing quota identified above. A usufruct right is a right to use property without liability for waste. However, under the fishing quota, a person obtains the right to take the relevant fish from the sea and provide these for consumption. The quota owner is under no obligation in relation to all the other fish in the sea. Further, the quota holder does not have to give a school of fish back at the end of the period, although it will obviously be in the quota holder’s best interests to manage the fisheries resources to ensure sustainability in accordance with the principles in the Fisheries Act 1996. It is also noted that a usufruct right is typically granted for a finite period, while the fishing quota is granted in perpetuity. The effect of this is that the characteristics of a usufruct right are not sufficiently similar to the characteristics of fishing quota for there to be any serious possibility that the fishing quota could be a usufruct right. Sale of goods with a licence The concept of a sale of goods with a licence refers to a contract for the sale of goods, where a licence is granted to the purchaser to go onto (typically the vendor’s) land to get the goods. For instance, an agreement for the right to take trees from a property could be the sale of goods coupled with a licence to enter onto the land and remove the trees. Alternatively, the agreement might constitute a profit à prendre, which will be discussed in more detail below. The distinction between an agreement for the sale of goods with a licence and a profit à prendre appears to turn on whether the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, or simply may take the trees. This follows from the definition of “goods” in the Sale of Goods Act 1908. The definition provides that goods “includes emblements, growing crops, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale”. Thus, unless the agreement between the parties requires that the trees shall be severed, the trees will not be goods under the Sale of Goods Act. If the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, then the agreement is more likely a contract for the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the trees, but if the purchaser may take the trees, then it is more likely to be a profit à prendre. This issue was addressed by Justice Young in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104. The case concerned the nature of an agreement between a landowner and a quarrying company where in return for the payment of a royalty, the quarrying company was entitled to quarry for sand and sandstone on the landowner’s property. In distinguishing between a profit à prendre and a contract for the sale of goods, Justice Young states at page 116: Taking all these factors together it seems to me that the document looks more like a profit à prendre than a licence, but I must also look at the distinction between profits and sale of goods. After a considerable search, it seems to me that the most accurate statement of the law in this connection is provided by Hinde McMorland Sim (op cit at 715), where the authors say: “... profits à prendre and contracts for the sale of goods are seen as mutually exclusive, the former consist only of contracts relating to fructus naturales or other parts of the realty where the purchaser has merely a right or option to sever, while the latter consist of: (1) All sales of fructus industriales regardless of who is to sever them; (2) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which are to be severed by the vendor before property passes to the purchaser; and (3) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which the purchaser is under a contractual obligation to sever.” Thus if the document puts on the purchaser an obligation to sever there is a contract for the sale of goods including a licence to go onto the land for the purpose of carrying out the contract, but if the purchaser merely has the option to sever then there is a profit à prendre. In dealing with this issue, Justice Young referred to a statement in Hinde McMorland & Sim on Land Law (1978-79). That statement still represents the view of the authors as it is also included in the latest edition of the book Land Law in New Zealand, Hinde McMorland & Sim (1997, Butterworths, Wellington). On the basis of this, the key distinguishing feature between a profit à prendre and a sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods is that a profit à prendre only gives rise to an option to sever and take the goods, while there will be an obligation to take the goods under a contract for sale. This is consistent with the New Zealand Supreme Court decision in Egmont Box Company Limited v Registrar General of Lands \[1920\] NZLR 741. Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota could be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, assistance can be derived from the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota itself was originally allocated without cost to fishermen based on prior catch histories. In order to exercise the rights under the fishing quota and associated annual catch entitlement, an annual levy is payable. In determining whether fishing quota is the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, the key distinction is whether there is an obligation to take the fish, or whether there is merely an option to take the fish. This question appears to be answered by section 28ZC(3) of the Fisheries Act 1983, and the more recent version contained in regulation 4(3) of the Fisheries (Cost Recovery Levies) Order 2000. It provides that the levy is payable by quota holders irrespective of whether or not the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed to which the quota relates is taken. Given that the levy is payable regardless of whether the fish are caught in relation to the quota, fishing quota should not be regarded as a sale of the fish as there is no obligation to take the fish. It is also noted that the levy charged is for administering the quota management system rather than necessarily being a “price” payable for the fish. Further, the fish are not “made available” either – the quota owner still has to catch the fish. Thus, situations might exist where the quota owner is unable to catch the amount of the particular species for which they have quota, despite having paid the full levy and desiring to catch the fish. The characteristics of fishing quota are more consistent with the quota holder having only a right to catch the fish. Therefore, the terms of the ownership of the fishing quota are inconsistent with it being an agreement for the sale of goods. Profit à prendre It is noted at the outset that the concept of profit à prendre has been referred to in relation to fishing quota in other contexts. The Law Commission in its Preliminary Paper No. 9 “The Treaty of Waitangi and Maori Fisheries” (1989, Wellington) referred to fishing quota as being in the nature of a profit à prendre. At paragraph 4.20 of the Preliminary Paper it states: In economic terms the ITQ scheme has created a new limited monopoly akin to those arising from other restrictive licensing schemes, such as liquor licences and taxi licences. In legal terms it has converted a public right to fish commercially (subject, of course, to regulation) into a series of private rights. It has created a new property right in the nature of a profit à prendre – broadly an ongoing right to take something tangible that is present on another person’s land – and allocated that right to those who held, or had recently held, commercial fishing licences at the time of its commencement. What is a profit à prendre? The nature of a profit à prendre can be gained from the definition in Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1980) Vol 14, “Easements and Profits à Prendre” para 240, page 115: A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person’s land. It may be more fully defined as a right to enter another’s land and to take some profit of the soil, or a portion of the soil itself, for the use of the owner of the right. Profits à prendre are often contrasted with easements or licences. All three items, profits à prendre, easements and licences, confer a right to enter onto land for a particular purpose. However, the distinguishing feature of a profit à prendre is that it confers an additional right to remove something from the land. While this concept has been used in relation to rights to take trees, turf and various minerals, it has also been applied to the taking of fish and other game from land. One of the earlier cases on point is that of Wickham v Hawker \[1835-42\] All ER 1. The case was concerned with the nature of the right provided to an individual providing the “liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling”. The issue was whether this was a personal licence in which case it could only be exercised by the individual himself, or whether it was a right in the nature of a profit à prendre that could be exercised by servants. Parke B made the following observation at page 5: This being the rule of law on the subject, the point to be decided here is whether the liberty granted is a mere personal licence of pleasure, or a grant of a licence of profit – a profit à prendre. The liberty of fowling has been decided, in one case, to be a profit à prendre, and may be prescribed for as such (Davies’ Case (1688) 3 Mod Rep 246). The liberty to hawk is one species of ancupium ..., the taking of birds by hawks, and seems to follow the same rule. The liberty of fishing appears to be of the same nature; it implies that the person who takes the fish, takes for his own benefit: it is common of fishing. The conclusion of the court was that this grant of the liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling was a profit à prendre. This case was followed by the English Court of Appeal decision in Fitzgerald v Firbank \[1895-9\] All ER 445. This case concerned the nature of a grant of exclusive fishing rights in respect of a section of a river. The reason that the nature of the fishing rights was being considered was that the river had been polluted by the defendant discharging waste products from a gravel works into the river which had a significant detrimental effect on the fish in the river. The plaintiff brought an action for an injunction to stop further pollution and for damages for the pollution to date. The Court of Appeal decided the case in favour of the plaintiff. The comments of the various members of the Court are useful in terms of identifying the nature of the fishing rights. Lindley LJ made the following comments at page 448: The right of fishing includes the right to take away fish unless the contrary is expressly stipulated. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Therefore, the plaintiffs have got a right of some sort as distinguished from a mere revocable licence. What is that? It is a good deal more than an easement; it is what is commonly called a profit à prendre. It is of such a nature that a person who enjoys that right has possessory rights that he can bring an action for trespass at common law for the infringement of those rights.... Rigby LJ, in agreeing with Lindley LJ, went on to state at page 450: I hold that, on the incorporeal hereditament, there is a right of action against any person who disturbs them, either by trespass, or by nuisance, or in any other substantial manner. This decision was followed by Farwell J in Nicholls v Ely Beet Sugar Factory Ltd \[1931\] All ER 154. That case concerned the ability of the plaintiff to bring an action of nuisance seeking an injunction to stop the defendant polluting a river in which the plaintiff held two fishing rights. The defendant sought to defend the action by arguing that the plaintiff’s title was not sufficient title to maintain the action in nuisance. The Court held that the plaintiff’s title, which was a profit à prendre, was sufficient to enable the plaintiff to bring an action in trespass or nuisance to protect that right. The above cases demonstrate that a feature of a profit à prendre is the right to remove something from the land. The cases also show that the courts have applied this concept to fishing rights. Therefore, on the basis that the fishing quota is a “fishing right”, it is possible that the fishing quota is a profit à prendre. An interest in land So far, the cases have concluded that the grant of fishing rights is generally a profit à prendre as it includes the right not only to catch the fish but also to take them away. Another important feature of a profit à prendre is identified in the Nicholls case. This feature is that a profit à prendre is considered to be an interest in land. While not explicitly stated in the Nicholls case, the parties necessarily assume it, as the plaintiff was bringing an action of nuisance. A nuisance, according to the definition accepted by Goddard CJ in the English case of Howard v Walker \[1947\] 2 All ER 197 at page 199 is: Nuisance is the unlawful interference with a person’s use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over, or in connection with it. That a profit à prendre is an interest in land was addressed more directly in Webber v Lee (1882) 9 QBD 315. The case concerned the nature of a right that had been granted over certain land to shoot game and to take it away. The plaintiff was arguing that what had been granted was a mere licence, the defendant that the right was a profit à prendre. The English Court of Appeal unanimously decided that the interest was a profit à prendre and an interest in land. While all three judges delivered separate judgments, they all made statements similar to that delivered by Jessel MR at page 318: The right to shoot game and to take it away when shot has been decided to be an interest in land and a profit à prendre. One of the consequences of a profit à prendre being an interest in land is that a profit à prendre can only be created or granted by the owner of a sufficient estate or interest in the land. Hinde McMorland & Sim’s Land Law in New Zealand (1997, Butterworths, Wellington) states at page 655: It is also necessary to ensure that the proposed grantor both has title to the product involved and has capacity as grantor if he or she owns an estate less than the fee simple. Therefore, a profit à prendre is a right to take something off someone else’s land. It has been held in a number of cases to describe certain fishing rights. Further, it is an interest in land. As it is an interest in land, the fishing rights if they were to constitute a profit à prendre would need to be granted by a person with a legal estate in the land concerned. However, the cases considered so far have only dealt with fishing rights granted over inland waterways, being lakes, rivers and streams. While some fishing quota is granted in respect of freshwater species, the majority of the fishing quota is granted in respect of species that live in the sea. It needs to be considered whether this makes any difference. Can a profit à prendre exist in relation to the sea? The principles identified in the cases considered regarding fishing rights and profits à prendre have been applied to inland waterways. The current situation also involves fishing quota granted over the open seas. There is an issue as to whether the same principles involving profits à prendre can be applied in this instance. Some assistance on this issue can be found in the Privy Council decision in Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada \[1914\] AC 153. The case concerned the ability of the Government of British Columbia to grant various fishing rights. The Government of the Dominion had exclusive authority over the sea coast and inland fisheries, but the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority over property and civil rights in the province. The case concerned an area known as the “railway belt”, which included both non-tidal and tidal waters. The question was whether the granting of fishing rights over this area was in the domain of the Government of the Dominion or whether such rights were property rights properly in the domain of the Government of British Columbia. The Privy Council acknowledged the distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters. Non-tidal waters are those such as lakes, rivers and other inland waterways, excluding those parts of rivers and other waterways that meet the sea and as such are tidal. Tidal waters include these areas where non-tidal waters meet tidal waters, at the mouths of streams and in estuaries, as well as the sea coast. The open seas appear to fall into a separate category. The Privy Council held that in respect of non-tidal waters, the right to grant fishing rights is a property right and as such exists with the owner of the underlying land. It is a private property right. In the case of rivers this may well exist with private individuals, but in the case of lakes, the title to the underlying land is typically reserved to the Crown. On the facts of the case, this should have meant that the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority to grant fishing rights. However, the Government of British Columbia had specifically granted ownership of the particular land in question back to the Government of the Dominion. The railway belt also included tidal waters. The issue was whether the principles that applied to non-tidal waters could have equal application to tidal waters. The Privy Council concluded that the same principles did not apply. In respect of the tidal waters, there was an overriding public right of fishing in tidal waters, which was only subject to regulation by the Government of the Dominion. Viscount Haldane stated at pages 167 and 168: The general principle is that fisheries are in their nature mere profits of the soil over which the water flows, and that title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum. A fishery may of course be severed from the solum, and then it becomes a profit à prendre in alieno solo and an incorporeal hereditament. The severance may be effected by grant or by prescription, but it cannot be brought about by custom, for the origin of such a custom would be an unlawful act. But apart from the existence of such severance by grant or prescription the fishing rights go with the property in the solum. The authorities treat this broad principle as being of general application. They do not regard it as restricted to inland or non- tidal waters. They recognise it as giving to the owners of land on the foreshore or within an estuary or elsewhere where the tide flows and reflows a title to fish in the waters over such lands, and this is equally the case whether the owner be the Crown or a private individual. But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public. From these passages, it can be seen that the Privy Council accepted the general principle that fishing rights attach to the land under the water. These rights can be severed, at which point they become profits à prendre. The Privy Council noted that the authorities have treated this general principle as applying to both inland waterways as well as tidal waters. However, Viscount Haldane noted a further factor that could impact on the application of the principle to tidal waters. The factor is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council noted that the nature of the public right was “not easy to define”. However, the public right was regarded as paramount, which led Viscount Haldane to conclude at page 173: So far as the waters are tidal the right of fishing in them is a public right subject only to regulation by the Dominion Parliament. Therefore, while the general principle is accepted in respect of non-tidal or inland waterways, the Privy Council concluded that it does not apply in respect of tidal waters. The reason for this is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council also reached the same conclusion in relation to the open seas. In specifically addressing fishing rights in waters below the mean low water mark and in the open seas, Viscount Haldane stated at page 173: Their Lordships have already expressed their opinion that the right of fishing in the sea is a right of the public in general which does not depend on any proprietary title, and that the Dominion has the exclusive right of legislating with regard to it. The effect of this is that the Privy Council rejected the application of the profit à prendre concept in respect of fishing rights relating to tidal waters and the open seas. The basis for the rejection of the profit à prendre concept in relation to fishing rights in respect of tidal waters and the open seas is the existence of an overriding public right to fish in the sea. According to the Privy Council, this title is “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The existence of the overriding public right to fish in the sea was a sufficient basis for the Privy Council to decide the matter in the British Columbia case. However, it is noted that even if the public right had not existed, the Privy Council would not automatically have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre. As a profit à prendre is an interest in land, the person granting the fishing rights needs to have a sufficient interest in the land before the fishing right can be a profit à prendre. Therefore, before the Privy Council could have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (in absence of the public right to fish), it would need to be established that the Crown owned the land under sea in respect of which the fishing rights were granted. The Privy Council regarded the issue as a difficult one, and one which they considered they did not need to answer. Viscount Haldane stated at page 174: But their Lordships feel themselves relieved from expressing any opinion on the question whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low water mark to what is known as the three-mile limit because they are of the opinion that the right of the public to fish in the sea has been well established in English law for many centuries and does not depend on the assertion or maintenance of any title in the Crown to the subjacent land. Therefore, the particular issue of whether the Crown owns the seabed appears to be a complex issue in English law. While the Privy Council did not reach a conclusion in respect of this matter, it seems clear that they considered it would have been relevant to a positive finding that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (although the Privy Council concluded that it was not a profit à prendre because of the overriding public right). Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota might be in the nature of a profit à prendre, it is necessary to consider the factors established by the cases and then compare these with the fishing quota. The first characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is a right to take something from land. The cases have held that this extends to taking fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, fishing quota might have been argued to satisfy this requirement as being a right to take fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1996, the position is less arguable. The introduction of the concept of an annual catch entitlement that is severable from the fishing quota perhaps indicates that the right to fish is one step removed from the fishing quota. However, given that the annual catch entitlement is generated by the fishing quota it is considered that fishing quota can still be regarded as ultimately giving rise to a right to take fish from water that flows over land. The second point to note is that fishing quota is granted in relation to a number of different species. These include both freshwater species (found in internal waterways) as well as the deep sea species. It is considered that there is no express differentiation in the Fisheries Acts of the rights provided in relation to the different species. Accordingly, it is considered that any determination of the nature of the property rights obtained in relation to fishing quota has to apply equally to all quota across the various species. Against this background, the Privy Council decision in the British Columbia case that an overriding public right to fish in the sea was inconsistent with the existence of a fishing right in the nature of a profit à prendre in relation to the seas poses a potential problem for the characterisation of fishing quota as a profit à prendre. The Privy Council considered that the public right was “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The acknowledgement that this public right is subject to regulation by Parliament is important in the New Zealand context. It appears that Parliament in New Zealand has regulated the right to fish in the sea through the Fisheries Acts and associated legislation. While a public right to fish in the sea still appears to exist (with the right being limited as to the size and number of fish that can be caught), it seems clear that this is no longer an overriding public right to fish. The rights created under the quota management system now appear to be the paramount rights. The effect of this is that it is considered that primary concern of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case does not appear to be as relevant in a New Zealand context. The final characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is an interest in land. This means that the profit à prendre needs to have been created by a person with a legal interest in the land. In this regard, problems may exist for fishing quota granted in respect of freshwater species. In relation to inland waterways, the owner of the adjacent land generally owns the land lying under the waterway where the waterway is contained on the land owned by the person, and to the midpoint where the waterway forms a border of the property. This principle is subject to certain exceptions where the Crown has asserted ownership of the underlying land – as may have occurred in the case of lakes and navigable rivers. Thus, the case for fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre encounters some difficulties in relation to fishing quota allocated in respect of freshwater species as it not clear whether the Crown would own all of the underlying land in question, from which it could grant an interest in land in the nature of a profit à prendre. The situation is fraught with even more uncertainty in relation to the seabed and foreshore. There is some argument that section 7 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, And Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 provides some assistance as to the ownership of the seabed. However, this only applies in respect of the “territorial sea” which extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of New Zealand. Fishing quota is granted in respect of quota management areas, which extend 200 nautical miles from the mean high water mark along the coast of New Zealand. Further, the effectiveness of this section against customary title was unanimously rejected by the Court of Appeal in Ngati Apa and Others v Attorney-General and Others \[2003\] NZCA 117 (19 June 2003). It is considered that the position is not improved by the “sovereign rights” conferred on New Zealand through Article 56 of the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea. New Zealand did not become a signatory to the Convention until 19 July 1996, meaning that any fishing quota allocated between 1986 and 1996 could not have been granted by the Crown relying on the rights conferred under the Convention. Accordingly, the issue of whether the Crown owns a sufficient interest in the land from which it could grant an interest in the nature of a profit à prendre is unclear. From this perspective, the approach of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case to leave the issue concerning the Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed as unresolved has considerable merit. There are further factors from which guidance can be obtained as to whether fishing quota can be regarded as a profit à prendre. When the Fisheries legislation is considered as a whole and in a wider statutory setting, it is considered that there are some other factors that support a conclusion that Parliament did not intend fishing quota to be a profit à prendre. An example is the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983, where Parliament specifically refers to a forestry right being a profit à prendre. The absence of a similar provision in relation to fishing quota perhaps becomes more significant. A further example is the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 where fishing quota is specifically excluded from the ambit of that Act. While excluding fishing quota from an Act dealing with personal property might tend to support a conclusion that fishing quota is perhaps a profit à prendre, an interest in land, and not personal property, the method of exclusion suggests that Parliament did not exclude fishing quota on this basis. The exclusion provisions in section 23(e) of that Act contain general exclusions for interests in land, and a specific exclusion for fishing quota. If fishing quota was regarded as a profit à prendre and an interest in land, there would have been no need for the specific exclusion. The end result is that there are a number of difficulties with fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre. While there are a number of similarities between the characteristics of fishing quota and the characteristics of a profit à prendre, there are also a number of fundamental inconsistencies in the characteristics that indicate that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre. The effect of these conclusions on the nature of fishing quota leads to the further other possibility that fishing quota is a unique property right, with the rights and obligations in respect of the property determined from the statute creating the right (as alluded to earlier). A unique property right The decision in the British Columbia case was cited with approval by the Full High Court of Australia in the case of Harper v Minister for Sea Fisheries (1989) 168 CLR 314. While the case concerned whether payments made by commercial fishermen for fishing licences were a “tax”, the High Court made some useful observations regarding the nature of the Australian fishing licence system. The Court noted the similarities between the rights obtained under a commercial licence and the rights obtained under a profit à prendre. However, the Court ultimately concluded that the fishing rights were not profits à prendre, but instead were statutory rights created under the particular statutory regime. Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ stated at page 325: The right of commercial exploitation of a public resource for personal profit has become a privilege confined to those who hold commercial licences. This privilege can be compared to a profit à prendre. In truth, however, it is an entitlement of a new kind created as part of a system for preserving a limited public natural resource in a society which is coming to recognize that, in so far as such resources are concerned, to fail to protect may destroy and to preserve the right of everyone to take what he or she will may eventually deprive that right of all context. Conclusion on the nature of fishing quota From the above analysis, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a usufruct right nor is it the sale of goods coupled with a licence. It is noted, however, that the rights granted under the fishing quota are similar to the rights that arise under a profit à prendre. The fishing quota generates an annual catch entitlement which provides the right to take a certain amount of a certain item (being the species of fish) from a certain area. These are the basic characteristics of a profit à prendre. While the rights seem similar, the courts have held that a profit à prendre cannot exist in respect of tidal waters and the open seas, and further that only the owner of an interest in land can create a profit à prendre. As the Crown ownership of the land under the water in respect of which fishing quota is granted is not clear and for the various other reasons considered above, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre. The effect of this is that it is concluded that fishing quota cannot be categorised as a usufruct right, the sale of goods coupled with a licence, or a profit à prendre. Fishing quota has to be regarded as a unique property right, with its characteristics determined from the provisions of the fishing legislation as set out by Justice Tipping in the New Zealand Fishing Industry Association decision referred to above. This is consistent with the Australian decision in Harper. It could also be seen to be consistent with the position set out by the Law Commission referred to above, where the rights are “akin” to a profit à prendre, but not entirely the same. It also reflects the statement made by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd. It is noted that the general characteristics of individual transferable quota were set out in section 27 of the Fisheries Act 1996, but that section 27 has since been repealed. It is considered that section 27 was repealed as being redundant, in that it merely summarised the characteristics that are found in other sections of the Fisheries Act 1996. Marine farming authorisations There are three different statutory bases on which a marine farming authorisation may have been granted. Prior to 1 October 1991, the relevant legislation was the Marine Farming Act 1971. Under this Act, the Ministry of Fisheries was able to grant marine farm leases and marine farming licences. On 1 October 1991, the Resource Management Act 1991 came into effect. This Act set out a new procedure for obtaining a marine farming authorisation. The Resource Management Act also repealed the sections of the Marine Farming Act 1971, which enabled marine farm leases and licences to be granted. The new process under the Resource Management Act 1991 involves two stages. The first stage involves obtaining a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit, or, if the proposed farming activity is already permitted by the relevant Regional Plan, a certificate of compliance. Once one of these documents has been obtained, an application can then be made to the Ministry of Fisheries for a marine farming permit. These are issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The effect of these different statutory regimes is that there are three different types of statutory approval that might be involved in the sale of a marine farming authorisation. These are: • A marine farming lease granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971; • A marine farming licence granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971; or • A marine farming permit granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 in conjunction with a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. Marine farming leases The characteristics of marine farming leases are set out in section 11 of the Marine Farming Act. On the basis of section 11(1)(a) of that Act, it appears that a lease granted under this section would constitute a leasehold estate and thus be an interest in land. However, as the actual terms of any lease as set out in a marine farming lease agreement would govern the nature of the rights acquired under the lease, these terms of the marine farming lease agreement would need to be considered to ensure that they were consistent with the grant of a leasehold estate. For instance, the lease would need to define a particular area of the seabed. Additionally, the terms of the lease would need to be consistent with the lessee obtaining rights in respect of the seabed. While it is likely that most leases would specify a particular area, as it appears that there is no “standard form” lease agreement it is possible that some of the leases granted might exclude rights in respect of the seabed. Such leases may not constitute real property. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming leases that satisfy the following conditions: • The marine farming lease defines the area subject to the lease by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • The legal effect of the marine farming lease is that the seabed is not excluded from the area leased. Marine farming licences Similar concerns arise in respect of marine farming licences as with marine farming leases. Section 11(3) refers to a property right that can be passed onto a person’s estate and is able to be assigned. While the provision is consistent with a licence being in the nature of a contractual right in accordance with the general law concept of a licence, it is also possible that the terms of a licence granted under this provision might give rise to exclusive rights over a defined area of land and so constitute an interest in land – possibly a leasehold interest. Once again, this appears to be a matter that can only be determined by considering the specific terms of the particular marine farming licence in question. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming licences that satisfy the following conditions: • The marine farming licence defines the area subject to the licence by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • The legal effect of the marine farming licence is that the seabed is not excluded from the area licensed. Transition to the Resource Management Act Section 11 of the Marine Farming Act was repealed as from 1 October 1991 by section 362 of the Resource Management Act 1991. However, a savings provision is contained in section 426 of the Resource Management Act. The effect of this provision is to preserve the pre-existing rights relating to both marine farming leases and marine farming licences despite the repeal of section 11 of the Marine Farming Act by the Resource Management Act. Therefore, both marine farming leases and marine farming licences granted under the Marine Farming Act continue in force under the Resource Management Act with no alteration of the rights and obligations under which they were granted. New marine farming authorisations New marine farming authorisations are granted under the Resource Management Act and the Fisheries Act 1983. The first step in the process is to apply for a resource consent from the Local or Regional Council. Section 87 of the Resource Management Act defines a resource consent granted in relation to a coastal marine area to be a “coastal permit”. Both these terms are relevant as some provisions of the Resource Management Act relate to coastal permits and some relate to the more general resource consent. If the Council has already approved the proposed marine farming activity in the area, the applicant will likely only require a Certificate of Compliance rather than a resource consent. Once a person has obtained either a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance, the person also requires a marine farming permit, which is issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The treatment for GST purposes The new marine farming authorisations need to be considered as to how they will be treated under the GST Act because they involve two separate items – a resource consent or certificate of compliance, and a marine farming permit. This matter needs to be considered as it needs to be determined whether there is a single supply of a “marine farming authorisation” or whether there are two separate supplies, one of the resource consent or certificate of compliance and another of the marine farming permit. This general issue is a difficult one, and has not been fully dealt with by the courts. However, there have been a number of cases both in New Zealand and overseas which have provided some guidance. Some of the New Zealand cases to consider the issue of single versus multiple supplies are the High Court decision in CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140; the High Court decision in Coveney v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,328; and the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193. There have been a number of UK decisions on this issue as well, including British Airways plc v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1990\] STC 643; Customs and Excise Commissioners v United Biscuits (UK) Ltd \[1992\] STC 325; Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1995\] STC 341; and Customs & Excise Commissioners v British Telecommunications \[1998\] STC 544. From these cases a number of factors has emerged as being relevant to determining whether there is a single supply or multiple supplies. These factors can be summarised as follows: • The degree to which the services alleged to constitute a single supply are inter- connected, the extent of the interdependence and intertwining, and whether each is an integral part or component of a composite whole. • The mere separate itemisation of things in a contract does not make them separable if they are necessary components of the entire transaction. • Whether the services are rendered under a single contract, or for a single undivided consideration, are matters to be considered, but they are not conclusive. • If it would not be possible to purchase each of the various elements separately and still end up with a useful article or service, the supply is a compound supply that cannot be split up for tax purposes. Application to the facts In determining the degree of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit, section 67J(2) of the Fisheries Act 1983 provides some assistance. It states that a marine farming permit shall only be issued to a person who holds a coastal permit for the relevant area, or to a person who holds a certificate of compliance in respect of the relevant area. Therefore, this section illustrates that there is a high level of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit. This relationship is also reflected in section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983, the section relating to the transfer of the marine farming permit. This section implies that it is only possible to transfer a marine farming permit in conjunction with the resource consent or certificate of compliance to which it relates. It is understood that as a matter of practice, both the coastal permit and the marine farming permit would be transferred when a marine farm is transferred. In terms of the case law discussed above, this relationship between the marine farming permit and the resource consent should be sufficient to conclude that they are sufficiently interconnected to be regarded as a single supply rather than as separate supplies. This is on the basis that one of the permits without the other is essentially useless. Therefore, it appears that most transfers of marine farming activities will involve the supply of both the marine farming permit and the coastal permit or certificate of compliance. It is concluded that when these items are supplied together as part of the same supply, they should be treated as a single supply for GST purposes. The Ruling only applies to supplies of this nature. Legislation Having established the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations, the next issue involves determining the relevant GST legislation. The section for obtaining an input tax credit is section 20. Section 20(2) outlines the documentary evidence that needs to be held in order to obtain an input tax credit, and section 20(3) provides the circumstances in which a claim will be available depending on the basis of GST registration. 20(1) In respect of each taxable period every registered person shall calculate the amount of tax payable by that registered person in accordance with the provisions of this section. 20(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, no deduction of input tax shall be made in respect of a supply, unless - (a) A tax invoice or debit note or credit note, in relation to that supply, has been provided in accordance with sections 24 and 25 of this Act and is held by the registered person making that deduction at the time that any return in respect of that supply is furnished; or (b) A tax invoice is not required to be issued pursuant to section 24(5) or section 24(6) of this Act, or a debit note or credit note is not required to be issued pursuant to section 25 of this Act; or (c) Sufficient records are maintained as required pursuant to section 24(7) of this Act where the supply is a supply of secondhand goods to which that section relates: Provided that where a tax invoice or debit note or credit note in relation to that supply has been provided in accordance with this Act, the Commissioner may determine that no deduction for input tax in relation to that supply shall be made unless that tax invoice or debit note or credit note is retained in accordance with the provisions of section 75 of this Act. 20(3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period - (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) or section 26 of this Act; and (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii) Paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) In relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) of this Act, to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount, or section 26 of this Act; and Under section 20(3), a registered person may deduct from the amount of output tax payable, an amount of “input tax” in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b). “Input tax” is defined in section 3A of the Act. It provides: 3A(1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means - (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (b) tax levied under section 12(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by that person, being goods applied or acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). 3A(2) In the case of a supply by way of sale to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, the amount of input tax is determined under subsection (3) if - (a) the supply is not a taxable supply; and (b) the goods are not supplied by a supplier who - (i) is not resident in New Zealand; and (ii) has previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (c) the goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 3A(3) The amount of input tax is - (a) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, the lesser of - (i) the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (b) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(7A), the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the open market value of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (c) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(8), the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the valuation under section 10(8) of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (d) if the supplier and the recipient are not associated persons and the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates, the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (ii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (e) in all other cases, the tax fraction of the consideration in money for the supply. 3A(4) For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), applied does not include - (a) the delivery or the arranging of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand; or (b) the making of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand more easily achieved. 3A(5) For the purpose of subsection (3), tax fraction means the tax fraction that applies at the time of supply. Section 3A(1)(c) of the definition of “input tax” is the relevant provision. It refers to the calculation of input tax through subsections (2) and (3) when the supply is one of “secondhand goods”. “Secondhand goods” is defined in section 2: “Secondhand goods” does not include - (a) Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or (b) Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver, platinum, or any other substance which, if it were of the required fineness, would be fine metal: or (c) Livestock: Section 2 also provides a definition of the term “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money: Application of the legislation The starting place in order to determine whether a GST input tax credit is available to a registered person is section 20(3). The section provides different options depending on the method of registration adopted by the registered person. For a person registered on an invoice basis, the relevant paragraph is (a)(ia), and for a person using the payments or hybrid basis of registration the relevant paragraph is (b)(i). However, irrespective of the basis of registration, the Act provides very similar tests for claiming an input tax credit in respect of supplies of secondhand goods. The claim is limited to the amount of “input tax” in relation to a supply of goods or services to that registered person, “to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period”. The relevant definition of “input tax” is contained in section 3A(1)(c) of the Act. In determining the input tax under paragraph (c) it is necessary to consider subsections (2) and (3). Leaving aside the associated persons provisions (which are not relevant to the current rulings), there are a number of requirements that need to be satisfied under the two provisions. These are that: (i) there be a supply by way of sale; (ii) the supply not be a taxable supply; (iii) the supply be made to a registered person; (iv) the supply be of secondhand goods; (v) the secondhand goods be situated in New Zealand at the time of supply; and (vi) the secondhand goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Most of these requirements are specified in the rulings to ensure that they will be satisfied in every instance in which the ruling applies. However, requirement 4, that the supply be of secondhand goods, is something that needs to be considered in detail as it cannot be specified in the rulings. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether or not the fishing quota and mussel licences can be secondhand goods. “Secondhand goods” The definition of “secondhand goods” does not attempt to define the term, but instead prescribes a list of things that are not included in the meaning of “secondhand goods”. Fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are not excluded under the definition. As the definition gives little indication as to what is included in the term, regard needs to be had to the ordinary meaning of “secondhand goods”. The first observation that can be made is that “secondhand goods” is a composite term. It relates to items that are first of all “goods”, and then the subset of those goods that can be described as “secondhand”. “Goods” In considering the first question as to what is comprised in the term “goods”, assistance can be found in section 2. Goods “means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money”. “Goods” is defined very widely in the initial part of the definition, and then subjected to two specific exclusions. It includes all kinds of real and personal property, but excludes choses in action and money. Therefore, it is necessary to establish whether fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are real or personal property and then secondly, whether they are money or choses in action. “Property” Before considering the “real” or “personal” aspects of property, the nature of “property” should first be established. The term “property” is not defined in the Act. Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1991) Volume 44, “Stamp Duty”, para 1,032, provides the following description of “property”: Property is that which belongs to a person exclusively of others, and can be the subject of bargain and sale. It includes goodwill, trademarks, licence to use a patent, book debts, options to purchase and other rights under a contract. A revocable licence is not property. An owner of unworked minerals who gives an undertaking to the service owner not to work them does not thereby convey property, and a grant of a purported exclusive right to carry on a certain business in an area when the grantor has no such right is not a conveyance of property. A similar view is taken in Gray’s Law of Personal Property (5th ed, Butterworths, 1968) at page 1: The term “property” as used in the law of New Zealand and other common-law countries has a dual meaning. It may signify the title to or rights to ownership in goods or other property; and when s. 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 provides by rule 1 that in a contract for the sale of ascertained goods in a deliverable state the “property” in the goods passes at the time the contract is made, “property” here means the title to or ownership of the goods in question. The word “property” may in addition signify the thing owned, that over which title is exercised; in this sense, of course, it includes tangible goods such as a book or a table, but the word covers also incorporeal forms of property such as estates in land (an estate being an aggregate of rights exercisable over or in respect of land) or the contractual rights embodied in a cheque or an insurance policy. From this it can be seen that the term “property” is used to describe a wide range of things, both tangible and intangible. Its fundamental characteristics seem to be that it is capable of being owned, and that the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred (see, for instance the House of Lords decision in National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth \[1965\] 2 All ER 472). “Property” needs to be able to be defined and identified, and have a degree of permanence or stability. Further, it needs to able to be transferred. “Real” and “personal” property It is a well-established principle of English law that all “property” can be categorised as either real property or personal property. As Gray explains at page 1: “The distinction between real property (or realty) and personal property (personalty) is procedural in origin and is derived from the ancient forms of action in English law. In the twelfth century, the possession of freehold land was recoverable by certain actions which were called “real” actions; at this date the remedy for dispossession of all other kinds of property was, effectively, damages only, and actions for damages in these circumstances were called “personal” actions. The existence of only two classes of property has its origin in these two types of action. The acknowledgement that property is either real or personal is contained in the first sentence of the following quote from Gray (at page 2): It is not sufficient, however, to say simply without qualification that land is realty and all other property is personalty. Real property includes, besides the freehold estates and interests in land, things which are said to “savour of the realty”. The effect of there only being two classes of property, one being real and the other personal, is that a finding that something is property necessarily means that it will be either real or personal property. There is no third category. Therefore, in terms of the definition of “goods”, if the item is “property”, then it will be either real or personal property. A question arises as to whether it is necessary to determine whether the fishing quota is real or personal property. The section includes both types of property and as long as it is either one or the other there should be no need to make a final determination. While this is true, attempting to classify the property as either real or personal assists in determining whether or not the item is a chose in action. The reason for this is that the chose in action – chose in possession distinction appears to be limited to personal property. The exclusion for “choses in action” The term “chose in action” is used to describe various types of personal property. It is not a term that is applied to real property. This observation was made in the English case of Torkington v Magee \[1900-3\] All ER 991 where Channell J defined the term at page 994: Chose in action is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession (emphasis added). Therefore, a finding that an item is real property means that the exclusion for choses in action will not be relevant. However, a finding that the item is personal property means that the exclusion for choses in action could be relevant. In determining the characteristics of a chose in action, the above quote from Torkington v Magee is referred to by a number of commentators as providing a useful working definition. In a New Zealand context, the Court of Appeal considered the issue in the case of Re Marshall (Deceased), CIR v Public Trustee \[1965\] NZLR 851. The case considered a situation involving a right to demand interest on a loan, and whether this was a chose in action for the purposes of the Death Duties Act 1921. In considering the issue of “chose in action”, McCarthy J stated at page 860: The right was property, for property in its wider sense includes all things of value. It was personal property and “all personal things are either in possession or in action. The law knows no tertium quid between the two”. This celebrated statement of Fry LJ in Colonial Bank v Whinney (1885) 30 Ch D 261 at p 285, is familiar to every lawyer. It received, I think the express, but certainly the implied approval of the House of Lords on appeal ((1886) 11 AC 426). Justice McCarthy provides further guidance on the characteristics of choses in action at page 861: That is so because if the right to give the notice and the corresponding duty to accept it had been denied, there was no possible method of enforcement other than going to law and thereby securing not the physical possession of the thing but the advantages of its ownership. This, says Mr Cyprian Williams in his article in (1895) 11 LQR 223, is the true test, and I agree. ... The characteristics that one cannot take the right into physical possession (even after judgment in one’s favour) and that it can only be vindicated by Court action, are the qualifying features of a chose in action and have become the bases of most modern definitions (emphasis added). The fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is the same in both authorities. Both authorities refer to the fact that in respect of a chose in action, one cannot take the right into physical possession. Being able to take the thing into possession is a characteristic of a chose in possession. Even if court action is taken to enforce the chose in action, the result may well be that the advantages of ownership are secured rather than actual physical possession of the thing. “Secondhand” There have been few cases on the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” in the GST context. Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 was a decision of Barber DJ where he had to consider whether deer velvet purchased direct from producers by means of commission agents were secondhand goods when they were purchased by a distributor and exporter of deer velvet. His Honour concluded that they were not secondhand goods. Judge Barber accepted that the two key concepts underlying whether something is secondhand are previous ownership and previous use. He stated at page 3,148: I agree with counsel that the concept of secondhand relates to pre-ownership or pre-use. I agree ... that the emphasis is on pre-use. I consider that there is quite some commonsense flexibility in ascertaining whether a good is still new or has become secondhand. I do not regard second ownership as necessarily rendering an item secondhand. Many goods pass from manufacturer to wholesaler or retailer to customer or consumer (with other levels of distributors sometimes also involved), and yet are not regarded as secondhand at the consumer purchaser level, even though the item has been used as stock-in- trade at the various distribution levels. The good is not usually regarded as secondhand until it has been used for its intrinsic purpose. The TRA felt that previous ownership of goods is not in itself necessarily sufficient to meet the test of secondhand in the Act. Usually a previous owner must have also used the goods for their intrinsic purpose. Subsequently the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of secondhand in LR McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. McKay J expressly referred to and agreed with Judge Barber’s comments in Case N16 as to the ordinary meaning of the term “secondhand”. Justice Richardson (as he then was) stated at page 11,213: The short point of the appeal is whether wool purchased by registered persons from unregistered persons is secondhand goods for the purposes of the 1985 Act. If the expression secondhand goods is given its ordinary and natural meaning it is common ground that it is not within that description. In ordinary usage the expression refers to goods which have been used, although depending on the context it may apply to goods which are no longer new or even in some contexts goods which have simply been previously owned. Mr Harley for the appellants did not seek to draw any distinction based on “use” of the wool by the sellers. The argument for the appellants is that to accord with the scheme and purpose of the legislation the expression has to be given the meaning of any goods which have been purchased by a registered person. The judgments of the Court of Appeal state that the term “secondhand” should be given its ordinary or normal meaning. While “secondhand” can mean either pre- owned or pre-used, the Court concluded that it is not sufficient that the goods were previously owned. If an item were “secondhand” simply through being previously owned, the term “secondhand” would be deprived of any practical meaning according to Justice Richardson. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that the more relevant factor is whether the goods have been previously used. The effect of this is that the courts have not extended the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” to goods that have been previously owned but not previously used for their intrinsic purpose. Application to fishing quota Is fishing quota “property”? When these concepts are applied to fishing quota, it seems that fishing quota would constitute property. Fishing quota is definable and identifiable through being granted under a statutory regime. It is permanent or stable in nature as it is issued in perpetuity. Fishing quota is capable of being owned and there are specific legislative provisions in the Fisheries Act 1996 dealing with the ability of the fishing quota to be transferred. On this basis, it can be accepted that fishing quota is “property”. Is fishing quota real or personal property? The next issue is whether fishing quota is real or personal property. The characteristics of fishing quota are determined from considering the legislation under which it is created. Under section 66 of the Fisheries Act 1996 (previously section 28O of the Fisheries Act 1983) the holders of individual transferable quota obtain a right to receive an annual catch entitlement for the species that is the subject of the quota. While the annual catch entitlement is defined by reference to a “quota management area”, there is nothing in either of the Fisheries Acts to suggest that it was intended that fishing quota gives rise to an interest in land. Therefore, based on this and the earlier conclusion that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre, it is considered that fishing quota is neither an interest in land nor real property. As fishing quota is “property” and property is either “real” or “personal”, the conclusion that fishing quota is not real property leads also to the conclusion that it must be personal property. As fishing quota is personal property, it will fall within the words “all kinds of real and personal property” in the definition of “goods” in the Act. Therefore, it is considered that this first part of the definition is satisfied. The next question is whether either of the two exclusions to the definition applies. Is fishing quota a “chose in action”? On the issue of whether fishing quota is a chose in action, it is established by the cases that the fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is that one cannot take the right into physical possession. Fishing quota appears to possess this characteristic. The right to catch fish cannot be taken into possession. While an argument could be made that a person could simply catch the fish under the quota, this seems to confuse the fish (which could be taken into possession) with the right to catch those fish (which, it is considered, cannot be taken into possession). The end result is that it is concluded that fishing quota is a chose in action. While fishing quota is capable of satisfying the first part of the definition of “goods”, being a form of personal property, it is then excluded from the definition of “goods” by reason that it is a chose in action. The effect of this is that fishing quota cannot be regarded as being “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. Given that it is concluded that fishing quota is not “goods”, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether the fishing quota could be regarded as being “secondhand”. Therefore, as it is concluded that fishing quota is not “goods”, it is also concluded that fishing quota cannot be “secondhand goods”. Application to marine farming authorisations Are marine farming authorisations “goods”? This question needs to be addressed in respect of the three types of marine farming authorisations: • The old marine farming leases; • The old marine farming licences; and • The new combination resource consent and marine farming permit. Marine farming leases It is accepted that marine farming leases are property. The marine farming lease is definable, has a degree of permanence (being the term of the lease) and is capable of being transferred. This means that marine farming leases are property for the first part of the definition. However, in terms of whether marine farming leases are real or personal property, it is not certain that all marine farming leases would give rise to a leasehold estate. To the extent that a marine farming lease is a leasehold estate, it will be real property. If the particular marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate, it will then constitute personal property. An issue exists as to whether marine farming leases might be excluded from being goods on the basis that they are choses in action. As noted above in relation to fishing quota, because choses in action are a subset of personal property, this will only be relevant if it is determined that the particular marine farming lease is not a leasehold estate (and thus not real property). If the marine farming lease is real property, then it will be “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that are not real property and are thus personal property, it needs to be determined whether they would be choses in action. The key distinguishing characteristic between choses in action and choses in possession, is the ability of the item to be “taken into possession”. Marine farming leases are like fishing quota in this regard in that they do not have a physical aspect to their nature. They encompass a number of rights, but these rights cannot be taken into possession. The only way to enforce these rights is to sue to enforce them. The effect of this is the conclusion that those marine farming leases that are not real property would be choses in action. This means that if a marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate it will be a chose in action and excluded from the definition of “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that constitute real property and are “goods”, the further issue of whether they are “secondhand” so as to be “secondhand goods” needs to be considered. The marine farming leases being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. The only other issue to consider is the “use” issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16. The intrinsic purpose of a marine farming lease is to farm the particular species specified in the lease. If a farming operation has been carried out pursuant to the lease, then the conclusion appears inescapable that the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. However, situations could arise in respect of marine farming leases where a person never actually exercises the rights under the lease and simply sells it without ever having attempted to farm the particular aquatic life in question. In such a case, an issue exists as to whether the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. On the basis of the case law, it appears that it has not been used for its intrinsic purpose. As this is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis, the Ruling only applies to marine farming leases that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the lease. Marine farming licences Under section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act, it seems clear that marine farming licences are property. The licences are defined in that Act, they have a degree of permanence (being the term of the licence) and are capable of being transferred. Therefore, it is concluded that marine farming licences are property. The next issue is whether marine farming licences are real or personal property. The nature of a marine farming licence is not entirely clear from the Marine Farming Act. Section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act provides that the right received under a marine farming licence is “the exclusive right during the currency of the licence to farm within the licensed area the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence”. It seems possible that the rights created under this provision could constitute an interest in land depending on the particular terms of any given licence. If the licence is defined by reference to a particular area of land and the licence provides the exclusive right to farm this area, it is possible that an interest in land (being a leasehold interest) would have been created despite the use of the term “licence”. On this basis, it is concluded that some marine farming licences may constitute an interest in land and will thus be real property. As it has been concluded that marine farming licences are “property”, those licences that are not real property will be personal property. The next matter to be considered is whether the exclusion for choses in action in the definition of “goods” applies. This issue will only be relevant to those licences that are personal property. The key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. It is a right that can only be enforced through court action. In respect of those marine farming licences that are personal property, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that constitute the marine farming licences into possession. If the rights are not real property, the licence will not provide an exclusive right to “possess” the particular area. The marine farming licence will provide for the exclusive right of being able to farm in the particular area, but it does not appear to provide the right to exclude others from the area. Therefore, it seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears as if the marine farming licences that are personal property would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that these marine farming licences are excluded from the definition of “goods” for GST purposes. However, the marine farming licences that are real property are not subject to the exclusion for choses in action, and thus will constitute “goods” for the purposes of the Act. For those marine farming licences that are real property, the next question is whether these “goods” are “secondhand” so as to qualify for the secondhand goods input tax credit under the GST Act. The marine farming licences being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. In terms of the “use” issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16, the same conclusion that applied to marine farming leases applies to marine farming licences. Whether the marine farming licence has been used for its intrinsic purpose is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis. For this reason, the Ruling only applies to marine farming licences that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence. Resource consents and marine farming permits The definition of “goods” requires that the item concerned be either real or personal property. It has been concluded that the GST Act will regard the supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit as a single supply. The nature of the property comprised in this supply needs to be considered. The nature of a resource consent and certificate of compliance Section 139(6) deems a certificate of compliance to be a resource consent with the result that the provisions of the Resource Management Act are to apply accordingly. Being a “resource consent” means that the rights attaching to the resource consent are governed by section 122 of the Resource Management Act. Section 122 states that “a resource consent is neither real nor personal property”. This statement is interesting. It is well established that all property is either real or personal property. On this basis, the only sensible interpretation which can be placed on this provision is that Parliament did not want all of the common law and other rights which would automatically attach to property of this nature to attach to resource consents. Parliament must have wanted to regulate the rights that attach to a resource consent. This is consistent with the rest of the section, which goes on to deal with the characteristics of resource consents for the purposes of other legislation. Unfortunately, there is no statement regarding the revenue Acts. The issue, therefore, is whether the statement in section 122 of the Resource Management Act applies to the GST Act. Not real nor personal property In determining whether or not the statement in the Resource Management Act 1991 impacts on the classification of a resource consent under the GST Act, there are a number of observations which can be made. The first observation is that the statement in section 122 is not a standard definition. It is not contained in section 2 of the Resource Management Act along with all the other definitions that are prefaced with the words “for the purposes of this Act”. Therefore, Parliament may well have intended section 122 to have wider application than simply the Resource Management Act. A second point can be derived from the wording of section 122 itself. After making the initial statement, the section goes on to address a number of specific Acts and circumstances where the resource consents are to be regarded as having the characteristics of personal property. The GST Act is not one of those situations. This seems a clear indication from Parliament that the opening statement was intended to apply to the Acts that are dealt with in the section. To take the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 as an example, it seems from the plain wording of the section that Parliament intended that the opening words of the section would have meant that resource consents were not real or personal for the purposes of that Act. This was why Parliament inserted subsection (4) to make it clear that for the purposes of that Act, it was appropriate for a resource consent to be regarded as goods within the meaning of that Act. This does not make a resource consent goods or personal property for other purposes though. On this basis, it seems that the statement in section 122 would apply for the purposes of the GST Act also. By not making a specific exception for the GST Act, it is only possible to assume that Parliament were content with the initial statement applying to the GST Act. The third observation, which follows from the second, is the intention of the section that is apparent from the words used. By making the statement that a resource consent is neither real nor personal property, Parliament has created a legal fiction. A resource consent has the general characteristics of property, and the law only knows two categorisations of that property – real and personal. Therefore, in discerning the intention of Parliament in making this statement, the most logical intention is that Parliament did not want the natural common law rights to attach to a resource consent which would attach as a matter of course if the resource consent were either real or personal property. The consequences of section 122 of the Resource Management Act then need to be applied to the definition of “goods” in the GST Act. “Goods” means “all kinds of personal or real property ...”. It has been established that resource consents and certificates of compliance are deemed not to be “personal or real property”, and that the deeming provision operates for purposes outside the Resource Management Act and so affects the GST Act as well. This means that resource consents and certificates of compliance do not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act as they are not personal or real property. Effect of the marine farming permit There is one further matter to consider, and that is the effect that the marine farming permit might have on any ultimate conclusion regarding the combined property right, being the resource consent or certificate of compliance and a marine farming permit. It has already been concluded that for GST purposes, the supply of these items should be treated as a single supply. It has also been noted that the issuing of a marine farming permit is dependent on having a resource consent or certificate of compliance. Based on these conclusions, it is possible to conclude that the marine farming permit would have no effect on the issue of whether the combined property right is goods. However, if the marine farming permit were considered in its own right, it seems that the same conclusion would be reached. It appears that a marine farming permit would constitute property. Marine farming permits are capable of being owned, and the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred under section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983. There is nothing in any of the relevant legislation to suggest that a marine farming permit is real property. While a marine farming permit provides a right to farm within the permit area, it does not typically provide any right to occupy the seabed. It is considered that without such a right, the marine farming permit is unlikely to be an interest in land and thus real property. That a marine farming permit does not provide any right to occupy the seabed seems reflected in section 67L(3), which provides that the marine farming permit does not authorise the permit holder to take any naturally occurring aquatic life in the area subject to the permit. Thus, it is considered that marine farming permits do not give rise to an interest in land and are accordingly concluded to be personal property. As the marine farming permits are not “money” the only other exclusion to be considered is that for choses in action. From the earlier analysis, the key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. In respect of marine farming permits, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that comprise a marine farming permit into possession. It seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears that marine farming permits would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that marine farming permits are excluded from the definition of “goods” for GST purposes. Therefore, it is concluded that the existence of a marine farming permit as part of a supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit will not affect the status of the supply for GST purposes. Regardless of whether the resource consent or certificate of compliance and the marine farming permit are considered together or separately, it is concluded that a supply of such items will not be a supply of “goods” as defined in the GST Act. Summary for marine farming authorisations Some marine farming leases and some marine farming licences may constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. These will be leases and licences that are defined with reference to a particular area of land, and that provide for exclusive rights in respect of that land. Such marine farming leases and licences are likely to be interests in land and thus real property. As real property, neither of the exclusions relating to “money” and “choses in action” will apply so that they will not be excluded from the definition of “goods”. The marine farming leases and licences that are not real property and so are personal property will not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. The reason for this is that they are choses in action. Because the rights under these marine farming leases and licences cannot be taken into possession, the leases and licences that are personal property will constitute choses in action rather than choses in possession and so will be excluded from the definition of “goods”. In relation to resource consents and marine farming permits, it appears as if the declaration in section 122 of the Resource Management Act that resource consents are neither real nor personal property is intended to apply outside the Resource Management Act. As there is no legislative modification of the statement in respect of the GST Act, the resource consents and marine farming permits will not qualify as being “goods” because they do not satisfy the opening words of the definition of being real or personal property. Therefore, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether they are “secondhand”. One further matter Before concluding in respect of marine farming authorisations, it needs to be noted that there is presently a Bill before Parliament that, if enacted in its present form, would affect the three different statutory permissions set out above. The Bill is the Resource Management (Marine Farming and Heritage Provisions) Amendment Bill. This Bill has been reviewed by the Transport and Environment Committee (which reported back on 30 April 1999), and there are a number of useful comments in the Committee’s report as to the existing situation and the proposed legislation. The Bill is currently awaiting its second reading. Under the proposals, marine farming leases and licences will be incorporated into the Resource Management Act and deemed to be resource consents. According to the Committee there will be no diminution of rights for the holders of leases under the Marine Farming Act and the rights of marine farming licence holders may well increase. It certainly appears that the nature of the rights held by marine farmers under the Marine Farming Act will be affected. Instead of a marine farming lease or licence potentially being an interest in land as discussed above, marine farming leases and licences will be deemed to be resource consents. If the Bill is enacted in this form, this will mean that, based on the previous analysis, the marine farming leases and licences will be neither real nor personal property under section 122(1) of the Resource Management Act. Such a conclusion will mean that all of the various types of “marine farming authorisations” will be treated in the same manner for GST purposes, namely that no secondhand goods input tax credit will be available.
Note (not part of the Rulings): These rulings deal with the ability of a registered person to claim a GST input tax credit on the purchase of fishing quota or a marine farming authorisation from an unregistered person. It was considered appropriate to issue four separate rulings given the different nature of the different marine farming authorisations and fishing quota. However, a single commentary applies to all four of the Rulings. COASTAL PERMITS, CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE, MARINE FARMING PERMITS, AND SECONDHAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDITS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 03/10 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3) and the definitions of “goods” and “secondhand goods” in section 2, and the definition of “input tax” in section 3A of the Act. Definitions For the purposes of this ruling— “Marine farming permit” means a marine farming permit granted under the Fisheries Act 1983; “Coastal permit” means a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit granted under the Resource Management Act 1991; “Certificate of compliance” means a certificate of compliance granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply of a marine farming permit in conjunction with either: • a coastal permit; or • a certificate of compliance. The supply of the marine farming permit in conjunction with a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance must satisfy the following conditions: 1. The supply by the vendor is a supply made by way of sale. 2. The supply is not a taxable supply. 3. The supply is made to the purchaser, who is a registered person. 4. The marine farming permit and associated coastal permit or certificate of compliance are situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. 5. The marine farming permit and associated coastal permit or certificate of compliance are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • A marine farming permit and associated coastal permit or certificate of compliance are not “goods” in accordance with the definition of that term in section 2 of the Act. As a result, the marine farming permit and associated coastal permit or certificate of compliance will not constitute “secondhand goods” for the purposes of the Act. • The purchaser of a marine farming permit and associated coastal permit or certificate of compliance will not be entitled under section 20(3) to deduct from the amount of output tax payable in a taxable period any amount of input tax in respect of the supply of the marine farming permit and associated coastal permit or certificate of compliance. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to a supply of a marine farming permit in conjunction with a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance where the time of the supply occurs within 3 years from the date on which this Ruling is signed. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of November 2003. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 03/07 to BR PUB 03/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 03/07 to BR Pub 03/10 (“the Rulings”). Background The question being considered is whether a GST input tax credit is available to registered persons who acquire fishing quota or marine farming authorisations from unregistered persons. While this commentary considers both fishing quota and marine farming authorisations, they need to be dealt with separately as there are different statutory requirements for each of them. Before looking at the relevant GST legislation, the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations needs to be considered in more detail. Fishing quota The fishing quota being considered is individual transferable quota as defined in section 2 of the Fisheries Act 1996. The Fisheries Act 1996 is almost fully in force. Prior to this, the operative legislation was the Fisheries Act 1983. It seems that the majority of fishing quota was allocated under the 1983 Act. The provisions in the 1996 Act relating to the allocation of quota came into force on 1 October 1997, and the registration provisions under the 1996 Act came into effect on 1 October 2001. The background to the allocation of fishing quota is that it was initially established and allocated in 1986 pursuant to the Fisheries (Quota Management Areas, Total Allowable Catches, And Catch Histories) Notice 1986, which was made under the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota appears to have been allocated based on a person’s commercial fishing history and no charge was made for the quota initially allocated. The quota does not provide a “free” right, however, as an annual levy needs to be paid. These levies are typically significant amounts. While the majority of the fishing quota is held by large organisations, individual fishermen hold some small parcels of fishing quota. Some of these persons may not make supplies in excess of $40,000 in a 12-month period and thus are not required to register for GST under section 51 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. One of these persons may sell their fishing quota to another person who is registered for GST. The question arises for the purchaser as to whether a GST input tax credit can be claimed. The nature of fishing quota There is no definitive statement in any of the fisheries legislation as to the nature of fishing quota. “Individual transferable quota” was not defined in the Fisheries Act 1983. While the term is defined in the Fisheries Act 1996, the definition appears to have been added as a means of ensuring that all of the quota allocated under the different Acts and sections of the Acts is regarded as fishing quota for the purposes of the Fisheries Act 1996. This change in legislation appears to have affected the characteristics that could be ascribed to fishing quota. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, the fundamental rights acquired by the holder of fishing quota (as determined from the legislation) were that the holder of the fishing quota had the right to catch and take away for their own purposes: • a specified quantity; • of a particular fish species; • from a particular area (the quota management area); • in a specific period (in a year, although the quota is issued in perpetuity). These rights were able to be dealt with in ordinary commercial dealings in that they could be bought and sold, used as security, and it was possible to register interests against the rights. The nature of fishing quota granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 has been alluded to in a number of court decisions. The Court of Appeal considered the nature of fishing quota in the case of New Zealand Fishing Industry Association (Inc) v Minister of Fisheries (unreported, CA 82/97, 22 July 1997, Wellington). The case involved the judicial review of a decision made by the Minister of Fisheries to reduce the total allowable commercial catch (TACC) for snapper in quota management area 1. The Court of Appeal made various comments regarding the nature of fishing quota. At page 16 of the Court’s judgment, Justice Tipping stated: While quota are undoubtedly a species of property and a valuable one at that, the rights inherent in that property are not absolute. They are subject to the provisions of the legislation establishing them. That legislation contains the capacity for quota to be reduced. If such reduction is otherwise lawfully made, the fact that quota are a “property right”, to use the appellants’ expression, cannot save them from reduction. That would be to deny an incident integral to the property concerned. The Court of Appeal confirmed that fishing quota is property, although it provides little in the way of further guidance on its precise nature except to state that its characteristics must be determined from the legislation. Further clarification was provided by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd v Smith \[2003\] 2 NZLR 23. In dealing with a contractual dispute, he stated that fishing quota is a statutory chose in action (at paragraph 5 of the judgment): The root of title is the issue under the quota management system (the QMS) of individual transferable quota (ITQ) which is a statutory chose in action comprising a fraction of the total of exclusive rights to fish commercially a particular species of fish within one of the ten quota management areas into which the exclusive economic zone is divided. Rights to ITQ are codified by the relevant legislation, especially the Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 and the Fisheries Act 1996. This dicta, while useful, does not fully explain the rights and obligations that arise in relation to fishing quota, particularly in relation to change in the nature of the entitlement under the Fisheries Act 1996. The position under the Fisheries Act 1996 is different to the previous position under the Fisheries Act 1983. One of the major differences in relation to the rights derived by holding fishing quota is the introduction of the concept of an “annual catch entitlement”. Instead of the fishing quota providing a right to catch a specified amount of fish, the fishing quota now “generates” an annual catch entitlement on the first day of the fishing year. Fish are now generally caught under the authority of a fishing permit and an annual catch entitlement (there is also a deemed value payment procedure set out in the legislation). For fishing quota holders, the annual catch entitlement is separately tradable, so that for a particular year a quota owner can sell their annual catch entitlement while retaining the fishing quota that will generate another annual catch entitlement the following year. These developments add a further dimension to the nature of fishing quota. The lack of any in-depth analysis of the nature of fishing quota means that it is necessary to examine the characteristics and rights granted under the fisheries legislation. These can then be compared to recognised categories of property. If they are sufficiently similar, it may be appropriate to conclude that the fishing quota should be regarded as belonging to that particular category. Alternatively, it may be that the most appropriate conclusion is that fishing quota is not sufficiently similar to anything else and must be regarded as a separate category of property. There have been a number of suggestions as to the nature of fishing quota. The terms “usufruct right” and “profit à prendre” have been suggested as perhaps describing the fishing quota. A further possibility is that the fishing quota might be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods. This commentary will consider these possible classifications in the following order: • Is fishing quota a “usufruct right”? • Is fishing quota the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the goods? • Is fishing quota a “profit à prendre”? Usufruct right The term “usufruct right” is a civil law rather than common law term. As New Zealand’s jurisprudence is based on the common law and doctrine of precedent, the term “usufruct right” is largely unknown to New Zealand law. The basis of this term in the civil law as opposed to common law is confirmed by the definition of the word “usufruct” in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (9 th ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995) which provides: usufruct n. (in Roman and Scots law) the right of enjoying the use and advantages of another’s property short of the destruction or waste of its substance. A more expansive definition of the term “usufruct” is found in Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed, West Publishing Co, 1990): In the civil law, a real right of limited duration on the property of another. The features of the right vary with the nature of the things subject to it as consumables or nonconsumables. ... The right of using and enjoying and receiving the profits of property that belongs to another, and a “usufructuary” is a person who has the usufruct or right of enjoying anything in which he has no property interest. ... There are three types of “usufructs”: natural profits produced by the subject of the usufruct, industrial profits produced by cultivation, and civil profits, which are rents, freights, and revenues from annuities and from other effects or rights. The South African case of Geldenhuys v CIR (1947) 14 SATC 419 provided a very full judicial consideration of the nature of a usufruct right. The case concerned the assessability of an amount of income that arose from the sale of a flock of sheep. The taxpayer’s husband died leaving the taxpayer with a “life interest” in her husband’s estate, with their children as the ultimate beneficiaries. The flock of sheep was valued at £1,451 at the date of the husband’s death. The flock declined in number after the husband’s death due to drought, and a lesser number of sheep were sold for £4,941 some years later. The taxpayer used the proceeds from the sale to invest, purportedly for her own benefit. The Commissioner sought to include the difference in the taxpayer’s assessable income. The taxpayer argued that she was unable to be assessed on this amount as she was only a usufructuary in relation to the sheep. This meant that she only had a right to use the sheep, with no liability for waste due to circumstances beyond her control. She accepted that this also meant that the investment did not belong to her. Justice Steyn (with whom Herbstein and Ogilvie Thompson AJJ agreed) delivered the leading judgment. In considering the nature of a usufruct right, Justice Steyn made the following observations at page 424: According to some authorities, ... movables which are consumed or impaired (consumuntur et minuuntur) by use cannot be subject to a full and complete usufruct, but they can be made the subject of an incomplete usufruct, a quasi-usufruct. In this class of movables cattle and animals are, according to the authorities, included. After referring to further texts and commentaries, Steyn J reached the following conclusions at page 428: The passages from Domat and Huber which I have set out above, however, make it clear in my judgment, that with regard to the cattle and other animals to which they refer these authorities hold that the dominium remains with the remainderman; the usufructuary, according to the passage from Huber cited above having no right to sell or kill them and being obliged to restore them. ... The authorities appear to be agreed that the usufructuary is only entitled to the young or progeny over and above the full complement of the flock. The full number of the flock must be maintained, the young replacing the old as they die, but the flock as an entity must be returned .... Application to fishing quota It seems difficult to apply this concept to fish except perhaps in a fish farming situation. The nature of a usufruct right, even if it did apply in a New Zealand context, does not appear to be consistent with the characteristics of fishing quota identified above. A usufruct right is a right to use property without liability for waste. However, under the fishing quota, a person obtains the right to take the relevant fish from the sea and provide these for consumption. The quota owner is under no obligation in relation to all the other fish in the sea. Further, the quota holder does not have to give a school of fish back at the end of the period, although it will obviously be in the quota holder’s best interests to manage the fisheries resources to ensure sustainability in accordance with the principles in the Fisheries Act 1996. It is also noted that a usufruct right is typically granted for a finite period, while the fishing quota is granted in perpetuity. The effect of this is that the characteristics of a usufruct right are not sufficiently similar to the characteristics of fishing quota for there to be any serious possibility that the fishing quota could be a usufruct right. Sale of goods with a licence The concept of a sale of goods with a licence refers to a contract for the sale of goods, where a licence is granted to the purchaser to go onto (typically the vendor’s) land to get the goods. For instance, an agreement for the right to take trees from a property could be the sale of goods coupled with a licence to enter onto the land and remove the trees. Alternatively, the agreement might constitute a profit à prendre, which will be discussed in more detail below. The distinction between an agreement for the sale of goods with a licence and a profit à prendre appears to turn on whether the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, or simply may take the trees. This follows from the definition of “goods” in the Sale of Goods Act 1908. The definition provides that goods “includes emblements, growing crops, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale”. Thus, unless the agreement between the parties requires that the trees shall be severed, the trees will not be goods under the Sale of Goods Act. If the purchaser is obliged to take the trees, then the agreement is more likely a contract for the sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the trees, but if the purchaser may take the trees, then it is more likely to be a profit à prendre. This issue was addressed by Justice Young in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104. The case concerned the nature of an agreement between a landowner and a quarrying company where in return for the payment of a royalty, the quarrying company was entitled to quarry for sand and sandstone on the landowner’s property. In distinguishing between a profit à prendre and a contract for the sale of goods, Justice Young states at page 116: Taking all these factors together it seems to me that the document looks more like a profit à prendre than a licence, but I must also look at the distinction between profits and sale of goods. After a considerable search, it seems to me that the most accurate statement of the law in this connection is provided by Hinde McMorland Sim (op cit at 715), where the authors say: “... profits à prendre and contracts for the sale of goods are seen as mutually exclusive, the former consist only of contracts relating to fructus naturales or other parts of the realty where the purchaser has merely a right or option to sever, while the latter consist of: (1) All sales of fructus industriales regardless of who is to sever them; (2) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which are to be severed by the vendor before property passes to the purchaser; and (3) All sales of fructus naturales or other parts of the realty which the purchaser is under a contractual obligation to sever.” Thus if the document puts on the purchaser an obligation to sever there is a contract for the sale of goods including a licence to go onto the land for the purpose of carrying out the contract, but if the purchaser merely has the option to sever then there is a profit à prendre. In dealing with this issue, Justice Young referred to a statement in Hinde McMorland & Sim on Land Law (1978-79). That statement still represents the view of the authors as it is also included in the latest edition of the book Land Law in New Zealand, Hinde McMorland & Sim (1997, Butterworths, Wellington). On the basis of this, the key distinguishing feature between a profit à prendre and a sale of goods coupled with a licence to retrieve the goods is that a profit à prendre only gives rise to an option to sever and take the goods, while there will be an obligation to take the goods under a contract for sale. This is consistent with the New Zealand Supreme Court decision in Egmont Box Company Limited v Registrar General of Lands \[1920\] NZLR 741. Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota could be regarded as the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, assistance can be derived from the Fisheries Act 1983. The fishing quota itself was originally allocated without cost to fishermen based on prior catch histories. In order to exercise the rights under the fishing quota and associated annual catch entitlement, an annual levy is payable. In determining whether fishing quota is the sale of goods coupled with a licence to remove the fish, the key distinction is whether there is an obligation to take the fish, or whether there is merely an option to take the fish. This question appears to be answered by section 28ZC(3) of the Fisheries Act 1983, and the more recent version contained in regulation 4(3) of the Fisheries (Cost Recovery Levies) Order 2000. It provides that the levy is payable by quota holders irrespective of whether or not the fish, aquatic life, or seaweed to which the quota relates is taken. Given that the levy is payable regardless of whether the fish are caught in relation to the quota, fishing quota should not be regarded as a sale of the fish as there is no obligation to take the fish. It is also noted that the levy charged is for administering the quota management system rather than necessarily being a “price” payable for the fish. Further, the fish are not “made available” either – the quota owner still has to catch the fish. Thus, situations might exist where the quota owner is unable to catch the amount of the particular species for which they have quota, despite having paid the full levy and desiring to catch the fish. The characteristics of fishing quota are more consistent with the quota holder having only a right to catch the fish. Therefore, the terms of the ownership of the fishing quota are inconsistent with it being an agreement for the sale of goods. Profit à prendre It is noted at the outset that the concept of profit à prendre has been referred to in relation to fishing quota in other contexts. The Law Commission in its Preliminary Paper No. 9 “The Treaty of Waitangi and Maori Fisheries” (1989, Wellington) referred to fishing quota as being in the nature of a profit à prendre. At paragraph 4.20 of the Preliminary Paper it states: In economic terms the ITQ scheme has created a new limited monopoly akin to those arising from other restrictive licensing schemes, such as liquor licences and taxi licences. In legal terms it has converted a public right to fish commercially (subject, of course, to regulation) into a series of private rights. It has created a new property right in the nature of a profit à prendre – broadly an ongoing right to take something tangible that is present on another person’s land – and allocated that right to those who held, or had recently held, commercial fishing licences at the time of its commencement. What is a profit à prendre? The nature of a profit à prendre can be gained from the definition in Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1980) Vol 14, “Easements and Profits à Prendre” para 240, page 115: A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person’s land. It may be more fully defined as a right to enter another’s land and to take some profit of the soil, or a portion of the soil itself, for the use of the owner of the right. Profits à prendre are often contrasted with easements or licences. All three items, profits à prendre, easements and licences, confer a right to enter onto land for a particular purpose. However, the distinguishing feature of a profit à prendre is that it confers an additional right to remove something from the land. While this concept has been used in relation to rights to take trees, turf and various minerals, it has also been applied to the taking of fish and other game from land. One of the earlier cases on point is that of Wickham v Hawker \[1835-42\] All ER 1. The case was concerned with the nature of the right provided to an individual providing the “liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling”. The issue was whether this was a personal licence in which case it could only be exercised by the individual himself, or whether it was a right in the nature of a profit à prendre that could be exercised by servants. Parke B made the following observation at page 5: This being the rule of law on the subject, the point to be decided here is whether the liberty granted is a mere personal licence of pleasure, or a grant of a licence of profit – a profit à prendre. The liberty of fowling has been decided, in one case, to be a profit à prendre, and may be prescribed for as such (Davies’ Case (1688) 3 Mod Rep 246). The liberty to hawk is one species of ancupium ..., the taking of birds by hawks, and seems to follow the same rule. The liberty of fishing appears to be of the same nature; it implies that the person who takes the fish, takes for his own benefit: it is common of fishing. The conclusion of the court was that this grant of the liberty of hawking, hunting, fishing, and fowling was a profit à prendre. This case was followed by the English Court of Appeal decision in Fitzgerald v Firbank \[1895-9\] All ER 445. This case concerned the nature of a grant of exclusive fishing rights in respect of a section of a river. The reason that the nature of the fishing rights was being considered was that the river had been polluted by the defendant discharging waste products from a gravel works into the river which had a significant detrimental effect on the fish in the river. The plaintiff brought an action for an injunction to stop further pollution and for damages for the pollution to date. The Court of Appeal decided the case in favour of the plaintiff. The comments of the various members of the Court are useful in terms of identifying the nature of the fishing rights. Lindley LJ made the following comments at page 448: The right of fishing includes the right to take away fish unless the contrary is expressly stipulated. I have not the slightest doubt about that. Therefore, the plaintiffs have got a right of some sort as distinguished from a mere revocable licence. What is that? It is a good deal more than an easement; it is what is commonly called a profit à prendre. It is of such a nature that a person who enjoys that right has possessory rights that he can bring an action for trespass at common law for the infringement of those rights.... Rigby LJ, in agreeing with Lindley LJ, went on to state at page 450: I hold that, on the incorporeal hereditament, there is a right of action against any person who disturbs them, either by trespass, or by nuisance, or in any other substantial manner. This decision was followed by Farwell J in Nicholls v Ely Beet Sugar Factory Ltd \[1931\] All ER 154. That case concerned the ability of the plaintiff to bring an action of nuisance seeking an injunction to stop the defendant polluting a river in which the plaintiff held two fishing rights. The defendant sought to defend the action by arguing that the plaintiff’s title was not sufficient title to maintain the action in nuisance. The Court held that the plaintiff’s title, which was a profit à prendre, was sufficient to enable the plaintiff to bring an action in trespass or nuisance to protect that right. The above cases demonstrate that a feature of a profit à prendre is the right to remove something from the land. The cases also show that the courts have applied this concept to fishing rights. Therefore, on the basis that the fishing quota is a “fishing right”, it is possible that the fishing quota is a profit à prendre. An interest in land So far, the cases have concluded that the grant of fishing rights is generally a profit à prendre as it includes the right not only to catch the fish but also to take them away. Another important feature of a profit à prendre is identified in the Nicholls case. This feature is that a profit à prendre is considered to be an interest in land. While not explicitly stated in the Nicholls case, the parties necessarily assume it, as the plaintiff was bringing an action of nuisance. A nuisance, according to the definition accepted by Goddard CJ in the English case of Howard v Walker \[1947\] 2 All ER 197 at page 199 is: Nuisance is the unlawful interference with a person’s use or enjoyment of land, or of some right over, or in connection with it. That a profit à prendre is an interest in land was addressed more directly in Webber v Lee (1882) 9 QBD 315. The case concerned the nature of a right that had been granted over certain land to shoot game and to take it away. The plaintiff was arguing that what had been granted was a mere licence, the defendant that the right was a profit à prendre. The English Court of Appeal unanimously decided that the interest was a profit à prendre and an interest in land. While all three judges delivered separate judgments, they all made statements similar to that delivered by Jessel MR at page 318: The right to shoot game and to take it away when shot has been decided to be an interest in land and a profit à prendre. One of the consequences of a profit à prendre being an interest in land is that a profit à prendre can only be created or granted by the owner of a sufficient estate or interest in the land. Hinde McMorland & Sim’s Land Law in New Zealand (1997, Butterworths, Wellington) states at page 655: It is also necessary to ensure that the proposed grantor both has title to the product involved and has capacity as grantor if he or she owns an estate less than the fee simple. Therefore, a profit à prendre is a right to take something off someone else’s land. It has been held in a number of cases to describe certain fishing rights. Further, it is an interest in land. As it is an interest in land, the fishing rights if they were to constitute a profit à prendre would need to be granted by a person with a legal estate in the land concerned. However, the cases considered so far have only dealt with fishing rights granted over inland waterways, being lakes, rivers and streams. While some fishing quota is granted in respect of freshwater species, the majority of the fishing quota is granted in respect of species that live in the sea. It needs to be considered whether this makes any difference. Can a profit à prendre exist in relation to the sea? The principles identified in the cases considered regarding fishing rights and profits à prendre have been applied to inland waterways. The current situation also involves fishing quota granted over the open seas. There is an issue as to whether the same principles involving profits à prendre can be applied in this instance. Some assistance on this issue can be found in the Privy Council decision in Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia v Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada \[1914\] AC 153. The case concerned the ability of the Government of British Columbia to grant various fishing rights. The Government of the Dominion had exclusive authority over the sea coast and inland fisheries, but the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority over property and civil rights in the province. The case concerned an area known as the “railway belt”, which included both non-tidal and tidal waters. The question was whether the granting of fishing rights over this area was in the domain of the Government of the Dominion or whether such rights were property rights properly in the domain of the Government of British Columbia. The Privy Council acknowledged the distinction between tidal and non-tidal waters. Non-tidal waters are those such as lakes, rivers and other inland waterways, excluding those parts of rivers and other waterways that meet the sea and as such are tidal. Tidal waters include these areas where non-tidal waters meet tidal waters, at the mouths of streams and in estuaries, as well as the sea coast. The open seas appear to fall into a separate category. The Privy Council held that in respect of non-tidal waters, the right to grant fishing rights is a property right and as such exists with the owner of the underlying land. It is a private property right. In the case of rivers this may well exist with private individuals, but in the case of lakes, the title to the underlying land is typically reserved to the Crown. On the facts of the case, this should have meant that the Government of British Columbia had exclusive authority to grant fishing rights. However, the Government of British Columbia had specifically granted ownership of the particular land in question back to the Government of the Dominion. The railway belt also included tidal waters. The issue was whether the principles that applied to non-tidal waters could have equal application to tidal waters. The Privy Council concluded that the same principles did not apply. In respect of the tidal waters, there was an overriding public right of fishing in tidal waters, which was only subject to regulation by the Government of the Dominion. Viscount Haldane stated at pages 167 and 168: The general principle is that fisheries are in their nature mere profits of the soil over which the water flows, and that title to a fishery arises from the right to the solum. A fishery may of course be severed from the solum, and then it becomes a profit à prendre in alieno solo and an incorporeal hereditament. The severance may be effected by grant or by prescription, but it cannot be brought about by custom, for the origin of such a custom would be an unlawful act. But apart from the existence of such severance by grant or prescription the fishing rights go with the property in the solum. The authorities treat this broad principle as being of general application. They do not regard it as restricted to inland or non- tidal waters. They recognise it as giving to the owners of land on the foreshore or within an estuary or elsewhere where the tide flows and reflows a title to fish in the waters over such lands, and this is equally the case whether the owner be the Crown or a private individual. But in the case of tidal waters (whether on the foreshore or in estuaries or tidal rivers) the exclusive character of the title is qualified by another and paramount title which is prima facie in the public. From these passages, it can be seen that the Privy Council accepted the general principle that fishing rights attach to the land under the water. These rights can be severed, at which point they become profits à prendre. The Privy Council noted that the authorities have treated this general principle as applying to both inland waterways as well as tidal waters. However, Viscount Haldane noted a further factor that could impact on the application of the principle to tidal waters. The factor is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council noted that the nature of the public right was “not easy to define”. However, the public right was regarded as paramount, which led Viscount Haldane to conclude at page 173: So far as the waters are tidal the right of fishing in them is a public right subject only to regulation by the Dominion Parliament. Therefore, while the general principle is accepted in respect of non-tidal or inland waterways, the Privy Council concluded that it does not apply in respect of tidal waters. The reason for this is that there is an overriding public right to fish in tidal waters. The Privy Council also reached the same conclusion in relation to the open seas. In specifically addressing fishing rights in waters below the mean low water mark and in the open seas, Viscount Haldane stated at page 173: Their Lordships have already expressed their opinion that the right of fishing in the sea is a right of the public in general which does not depend on any proprietary title, and that the Dominion has the exclusive right of legislating with regard to it. The effect of this is that the Privy Council rejected the application of the profit à prendre concept in respect of fishing rights relating to tidal waters and the open seas. The basis for the rejection of the profit à prendre concept in relation to fishing rights in respect of tidal waters and the open seas is the existence of an overriding public right to fish in the sea. According to the Privy Council, this title is “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The existence of the overriding public right to fish in the sea was a sufficient basis for the Privy Council to decide the matter in the British Columbia case. However, it is noted that even if the public right had not existed, the Privy Council would not automatically have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre. As a profit à prendre is an interest in land, the person granting the fishing rights needs to have a sufficient interest in the land before the fishing right can be a profit à prendre. Therefore, before the Privy Council could have concluded that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (in absence of the public right to fish), it would need to be established that the Crown owned the land under sea in respect of which the fishing rights were granted. The Privy Council regarded the issue as a difficult one, and one which they considered they did not need to answer. Viscount Haldane stated at page 174: But their Lordships feel themselves relieved from expressing any opinion on the question whether the Crown has a right of property in the bed of the sea below low water mark to what is known as the three-mile limit because they are of the opinion that the right of the public to fish in the sea has been well established in English law for many centuries and does not depend on the assertion or maintenance of any title in the Crown to the subjacent land. Therefore, the particular issue of whether the Crown owns the seabed appears to be a complex issue in English law. While the Privy Council did not reach a conclusion in respect of this matter, it seems clear that they considered it would have been relevant to a positive finding that the fishing rights were profits à prendre (although the Privy Council concluded that it was not a profit à prendre because of the overriding public right). Application to fishing quota In determining whether fishing quota might be in the nature of a profit à prendre, it is necessary to consider the factors established by the cases and then compare these with the fishing quota. The first characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is a right to take something from land. The cases have held that this extends to taking fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1983, fishing quota might have been argued to satisfy this requirement as being a right to take fish from water that flows over land. Under the Fisheries Act 1996, the position is less arguable. The introduction of the concept of an annual catch entitlement that is severable from the fishing quota perhaps indicates that the right to fish is one step removed from the fishing quota. However, given that the annual catch entitlement is generated by the fishing quota it is considered that fishing quota can still be regarded as ultimately giving rise to a right to take fish from water that flows over land. The second point to note is that fishing quota is granted in relation to a number of different species. These include both freshwater species (found in internal waterways) as well as the deep sea species. It is considered that there is no express differentiation in the Fisheries Acts of the rights provided in relation to the different species. Accordingly, it is considered that any determination of the nature of the property rights obtained in relation to fishing quota has to apply equally to all quota across the various species. Against this background, the Privy Council decision in the British Columbia case that an overriding public right to fish in the sea was inconsistent with the existence of a fishing right in the nature of a profit à prendre in relation to the seas poses a potential problem for the characterisation of fishing quota as a profit à prendre. The Privy Council considered that the public right was “paramount” and subject only to regulation by Parliament. The acknowledgement that this public right is subject to regulation by Parliament is important in the New Zealand context. It appears that Parliament in New Zealand has regulated the right to fish in the sea through the Fisheries Acts and associated legislation. While a public right to fish in the sea still appears to exist (with the right being limited as to the size and number of fish that can be caught), it seems clear that this is no longer an overriding public right to fish. The rights created under the quota management system now appear to be the paramount rights. The effect of this is that it is considered that primary concern of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case does not appear to be as relevant in a New Zealand context. The final characteristic of a profit à prendre is that it is an interest in land. This means that the profit à prendre needs to have been created by a person with a legal interest in the land. In this regard, problems may exist for fishing quota granted in respect of freshwater species. In relation to inland waterways, the owner of the adjacent land generally owns the land lying under the waterway where the waterway is contained on the land owned by the person, and to the midpoint where the waterway forms a border of the property. This principle is subject to certain exceptions where the Crown has asserted ownership of the underlying land – as may have occurred in the case of lakes and navigable rivers. Thus, the case for fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre encounters some difficulties in relation to fishing quota allocated in respect of freshwater species as it not clear whether the Crown would own all of the underlying land in question, from which it could grant an interest in land in the nature of a profit à prendre. The situation is fraught with even more uncertainty in relation to the seabed and foreshore. There is some argument that section 7 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, And Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977 provides some assistance as to the ownership of the seabed. However, this only applies in respect of the “territorial sea” which extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of New Zealand. Fishing quota is granted in respect of quota management areas, which extend 200 nautical miles from the mean high water mark along the coast of New Zealand. Further, the effectiveness of this section against customary title was unanimously rejected by the Court of Appeal in Ngati Apa and Others v Attorney-General and Others \[2003\] NZCA 117 (19 June 2003). It is considered that the position is not improved by the “sovereign rights” conferred on New Zealand through Article 56 of the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea. New Zealand did not become a signatory to the Convention until 19 July 1996, meaning that any fishing quota allocated between 1986 and 1996 could not have been granted by the Crown relying on the rights conferred under the Convention. Accordingly, the issue of whether the Crown owns a sufficient interest in the land from which it could grant an interest in the nature of a profit à prendre is unclear. From this perspective, the approach of the Privy Council in the British Columbia case to leave the issue concerning the Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed as unresolved has considerable merit. There are further factors from which guidance can be obtained as to whether fishing quota can be regarded as a profit à prendre. When the Fisheries legislation is considered as a whole and in a wider statutory setting, it is considered that there are some other factors that support a conclusion that Parliament did not intend fishing quota to be a profit à prendre. An example is the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983, where Parliament specifically refers to a forestry right being a profit à prendre. The absence of a similar provision in relation to fishing quota perhaps becomes more significant. A further example is the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 where fishing quota is specifically excluded from the ambit of that Act. While excluding fishing quota from an Act dealing with personal property might tend to support a conclusion that fishing quota is perhaps a profit à prendre, an interest in land, and not personal property, the method of exclusion suggests that Parliament did not exclude fishing quota on this basis. The exclusion provisions in section 23(e) of that Act contain general exclusions for interests in land, and a specific exclusion for fishing quota. If fishing quota was regarded as a profit à prendre and an interest in land, there would have been no need for the specific exclusion. The end result is that there are a number of difficulties with fishing quota being regarded as a profit à prendre. While there are a number of similarities between the characteristics of fishing quota and the characteristics of a profit à prendre, there are also a number of fundamental inconsistencies in the characteristics that indicate that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre. The effect of these conclusions on the nature of fishing quota leads to the further other possibility that fishing quota is a unique property right, with the rights and obligations in respect of the property determined from the statute creating the right (as alluded to earlier). A unique property right The decision in the British Columbia case was cited with approval by the Full High Court of Australia in the case of Harper v Minister for Sea Fisheries (1989) 168 CLR 314. While the case concerned whether payments made by commercial fishermen for fishing licences were a “tax”, the High Court made some useful observations regarding the nature of the Australian fishing licence system. The Court noted the similarities between the rights obtained under a commercial licence and the rights obtained under a profit à prendre. However, the Court ultimately concluded that the fishing rights were not profits à prendre, but instead were statutory rights created under the particular statutory regime. Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ stated at page 325: The right of commercial exploitation of a public resource for personal profit has become a privilege confined to those who hold commercial licences. This privilege can be compared to a profit à prendre. In truth, however, it is an entitlement of a new kind created as part of a system for preserving a limited public natural resource in a society which is coming to recognize that, in so far as such resources are concerned, to fail to protect may destroy and to preserve the right of everyone to take what he or she will may eventually deprive that right of all context. Conclusion on the nature of fishing quota From the above analysis, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a usufruct right nor is it the sale of goods coupled with a licence. It is noted, however, that the rights granted under the fishing quota are similar to the rights that arise under a profit à prendre. The fishing quota generates an annual catch entitlement which provides the right to take a certain amount of a certain item (being the species of fish) from a certain area. These are the basic characteristics of a profit à prendre. While the rights seem similar, the courts have held that a profit à prendre cannot exist in respect of tidal waters and the open seas, and further that only the owner of an interest in land can create a profit à prendre. As the Crown ownership of the land under the water in respect of which fishing quota is granted is not clear and for the various other reasons considered above, it is concluded that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre. The effect of this is that it is concluded that fishing quota cannot be categorised as a usufruct right, the sale of goods coupled with a licence, or a profit à prendre. Fishing quota has to be regarded as a unique property right, with its characteristics determined from the provisions of the fishing legislation as set out by Justice Tipping in the New Zealand Fishing Industry Association decision referred to above. This is consistent with the Australian decision in Harper. It could also be seen to be consistent with the position set out by the Law Commission referred to above, where the rights are “akin” to a profit à prendre, but not entirely the same. It also reflects the statement made by Justice Baragwanath in Antons Trawling Co Ltd. It is noted that the general characteristics of individual transferable quota were set out in section 27 of the Fisheries Act 1996, but that section 27 has since been repealed. It is considered that section 27 was repealed as being redundant, in that it merely summarised the characteristics that are found in other sections of the Fisheries Act 1996. Marine farming authorisations There are three different statutory bases on which a marine farming authorisation may have been granted. Prior to 1 October 1991, the relevant legislation was the Marine Farming Act 1971. Under this Act, the Ministry of Fisheries was able to grant marine farm leases and marine farming licences. On 1 October 1991, the Resource Management Act 1991 came into effect. This Act set out a new procedure for obtaining a marine farming authorisation. The Resource Management Act also repealed the sections of the Marine Farming Act 1971, which enabled marine farm leases and licences to be granted. The new process under the Resource Management Act 1991 involves two stages. The first stage involves obtaining a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit, or, if the proposed farming activity is already permitted by the relevant Regional Plan, a certificate of compliance. Once one of these documents has been obtained, an application can then be made to the Ministry of Fisheries for a marine farming permit. These are issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The effect of these different statutory regimes is that there are three different types of statutory approval that might be involved in the sale of a marine farming authorisation. These are: • A marine farming lease granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971; • A marine farming licence granted under the Marine Farming Act 1971; or • A marine farming permit granted under the Fisheries Act 1983 in conjunction with a resource consent in the form of a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. Marine farming leases The characteristics of marine farming leases are set out in section 11 of the Marine Farming Act. On the basis of section 11(1)(a) of that Act, it appears that a lease granted under this section would constitute a leasehold estate and thus be an interest in land. However, as the actual terms of any lease as set out in a marine farming lease agreement would govern the nature of the rights acquired under the lease, these terms of the marine farming lease agreement would need to be considered to ensure that they were consistent with the grant of a leasehold estate. For instance, the lease would need to define a particular area of the seabed. Additionally, the terms of the lease would need to be consistent with the lessee obtaining rights in respect of the seabed. While it is likely that most leases would specify a particular area, as it appears that there is no “standard form” lease agreement it is possible that some of the leases granted might exclude rights in respect of the seabed. Such leases may not constitute real property. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming leases that satisfy the following conditions: • The marine farming lease defines the area subject to the lease by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • The legal effect of the marine farming lease is that the seabed is not excluded from the area leased. Marine farming licences Similar concerns arise in respect of marine farming licences as with marine farming leases. Section 11(3) refers to a property right that can be passed onto a person’s estate and is able to be assigned. While the provision is consistent with a licence being in the nature of a contractual right in accordance with the general law concept of a licence, it is also possible that the terms of a licence granted under this provision might give rise to exclusive rights over a defined area of land and so constitute an interest in land – possibly a leasehold interest. Once again, this appears to be a matter that can only be determined by considering the specific terms of the particular marine farming licence in question. In order to ensure that the correct position is provided in the ruling, it only applies to marine farming licences that satisfy the following conditions: • The marine farming licence defines the area subject to the licence by means of a legal description giving an area in hectares (or equivalent) and its position on a survey plan; and • The legal effect of the marine farming licence is that the seabed is not excluded from the area licensed. Transition to the Resource Management Act Section 11 of the Marine Farming Act was repealed as from 1 October 1991 by section 362 of the Resource Management Act 1991. However, a savings provision is contained in section 426 of the Resource Management Act. The effect of this provision is to preserve the pre-existing rights relating to both marine farming leases and marine farming licences despite the repeal of section 11 of the Marine Farming Act by the Resource Management Act. Therefore, both marine farming leases and marine farming licences granted under the Marine Farming Act continue in force under the Resource Management Act with no alteration of the rights and obligations under which they were granted. New marine farming authorisations New marine farming authorisations are granted under the Resource Management Act and the Fisheries Act 1983. The first step in the process is to apply for a resource consent from the Local or Regional Council. Section 87 of the Resource Management Act defines a resource consent granted in relation to a coastal marine area to be a “coastal permit”. Both these terms are relevant as some provisions of the Resource Management Act relate to coastal permits and some relate to the more general resource consent. If the Council has already approved the proposed marine farming activity in the area, the applicant will likely only require a Certificate of Compliance rather than a resource consent. Once a person has obtained either a coastal permit or a certificate of compliance, the person also requires a marine farming permit, which is issued under section 67J of the Fisheries Act 1983. The treatment for GST purposes The new marine farming authorisations need to be considered as to how they will be treated under the GST Act because they involve two separate items – a resource consent or certificate of compliance, and a marine farming permit. This matter needs to be considered as it needs to be determined whether there is a single supply of a “marine farming authorisation” or whether there are two separate supplies, one of the resource consent or certificate of compliance and another of the marine farming permit. This general issue is a difficult one, and has not been fully dealt with by the courts. However, there have been a number of cases both in New Zealand and overseas which have provided some guidance. Some of the New Zealand cases to consider the issue of single versus multiple supplies are the High Court decision in CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140; the High Court decision in Coveney v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,328; and the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v Coveney (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193. There have been a number of UK decisions on this issue as well, including British Airways plc v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1990\] STC 643; Customs and Excise Commissioners v United Biscuits (UK) Ltd \[1992\] STC 325; Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1995\] STC 341; and Customs & Excise Commissioners v British Telecommunications \[1998\] STC 544. From these cases a number of factors has emerged as being relevant to determining whether there is a single supply or multiple supplies. These factors can be summarised as follows: • The degree to which the services alleged to constitute a single supply are inter- connected, the extent of the interdependence and intertwining, and whether each is an integral part or component of a composite whole. • The mere separate itemisation of things in a contract does not make them separable if they are necessary components of the entire transaction. • Whether the services are rendered under a single contract, or for a single undivided consideration, are matters to be considered, but they are not conclusive. • If it would not be possible to purchase each of the various elements separately and still end up with a useful article or service, the supply is a compound supply that cannot be split up for tax purposes. Application to the facts In determining the degree of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit, section 67J(2) of the Fisheries Act 1983 provides some assistance. It states that a marine farming permit shall only be issued to a person who holds a coastal permit for the relevant area, or to a person who holds a certificate of compliance in respect of the relevant area. Therefore, this section illustrates that there is a high level of interdependence between the resource consent and the marine farming permit. This relationship is also reflected in section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983, the section relating to the transfer of the marine farming permit. This section implies that it is only possible to transfer a marine farming permit in conjunction with the resource consent or certificate of compliance to which it relates. It is understood that as a matter of practice, both the coastal permit and the marine farming permit would be transferred when a marine farm is transferred. In terms of the case law discussed above, this relationship between the marine farming permit and the resource consent should be sufficient to conclude that they are sufficiently interconnected to be regarded as a single supply rather than as separate supplies. This is on the basis that one of the permits without the other is essentially useless. Therefore, it appears that most transfers of marine farming activities will involve the supply of both the marine farming permit and the coastal permit or certificate of compliance. It is concluded that when these items are supplied together as part of the same supply, they should be treated as a single supply for GST purposes. The Ruling only applies to supplies of this nature. Legislation Having established the nature of both fishing quota and the various types of marine farming authorisations, the next issue involves determining the relevant GST legislation. The section for obtaining an input tax credit is section 20. Section 20(2) outlines the documentary evidence that needs to be held in order to obtain an input tax credit, and section 20(3) provides the circumstances in which a claim will be available depending on the basis of GST registration. 20(1) In respect of each taxable period every registered person shall calculate the amount of tax payable by that registered person in accordance with the provisions of this section. 20(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, no deduction of input tax shall be made in respect of a supply, unless - (a) A tax invoice or debit note or credit note, in relation to that supply, has been provided in accordance with sections 24 and 25 of this Act and is held by the registered person making that deduction at the time that any return in respect of that supply is furnished; or (b) A tax invoice is not required to be issued pursuant to section 24(5) or section 24(6) of this Act, or a debit note or credit note is not required to be issued pursuant to section 25 of this Act; or (c) Sufficient records are maintained as required pursuant to section 24(7) of this Act where the supply is a supply of secondhand goods to which that section relates: Provided that where a tax invoice or debit note or credit note in relation to that supply has been provided in accordance with this Act, the Commissioner may determine that no deduction for input tax in relation to that supply shall be made unless that tax invoice or debit note or credit note is retained in accordance with the provisions of section 75 of this Act. 20(3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period - (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) or section 26 of this Act; and (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax - (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii) Paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) In relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) of this Act, to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount, or section 26 of this Act; and Under section 20(3), a registered person may deduct from the amount of output tax payable, an amount of “input tax” in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b). “Input tax” is defined in section 3A of the Act. It provides: 3A(1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means - (a) tax charged under section 8(1) on the supply of goods and services made to that person, being goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (b) tax levied under section 12(1) of this Act on goods entered for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 by that person, being goods applied or acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies: (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). 3A(2) In the case of a supply by way of sale to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, the amount of input tax is determined under subsection (3) if - (a) the supply is not a taxable supply; and (b) the goods are not supplied by a supplier who - (i) is not resident in New Zealand; and (ii) has previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; and (c) the goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 3A(3) The amount of input tax is - (a) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons, the lesser of - (i) the tax included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier; and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (b) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(7A), the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the open market value of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (c) if the supplier and the recipient are associated persons and the supplier is deemed to have made a supply of the goods under section 5(3) that has been valued under section 10(8), the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the valuation under section 10(8) of the deemed supply under section 5(3); and (ii) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (iii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (d) if the supplier and the recipient are not associated persons and the supply is not the only matter to which the consideration relates, the lesser of - (i) the tax fraction of the purchase price; and (ii) the tax fraction of the open market value of the supply; or (e) in all other cases, the tax fraction of the consideration in money for the supply. 3A(4) For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), applied does not include - (a) the delivery or the arranging of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand; or (b) the making of the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand more easily achieved. 3A(5) For the purpose of subsection (3), tax fraction means the tax fraction that applies at the time of supply. Section 3A(1)(c) of the definition of “input tax” is the relevant provision. It refers to the calculation of input tax through subsections (2) and (3) when the supply is one of “secondhand goods”. “Secondhand goods” is defined in section 2: “Secondhand goods” does not include - (a) Secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal; or (b) Secondhand goods which are, or to the extent to which they are, manufactured or made from gold, silver, platinum, or any other substance which, if it were of the required fineness, would be fine metal: or (c) Livestock: Section 2 also provides a definition of the term “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money: Application of the legislation The starting place in order to determine whether a GST input tax credit is available to a registered person is section 20(3). The section provides different options depending on the method of registration adopted by the registered person. For a person registered on an invoice basis, the relevant paragraph is (a)(ia), and for a person using the payments or hybrid basis of registration the relevant paragraph is (b)(i). However, irrespective of the basis of registration, the Act provides very similar tests for claiming an input tax credit in respect of supplies of secondhand goods. The claim is limited to the amount of “input tax” in relation to a supply of goods or services to that registered person, “to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period”. The relevant definition of “input tax” is contained in section 3A(1)(c) of the Act. In determining the input tax under paragraph (c) it is necessary to consider subsections (2) and (3). Leaving aside the associated persons provisions (which are not relevant to the current rulings), there are a number of requirements that need to be satisfied under the two provisions. These are that: (i) there be a supply by way of sale; (ii) the supply not be a taxable supply; (iii) the supply be made to a registered person; (iv) the supply be of secondhand goods; (v) the secondhand goods be situated in New Zealand at the time of supply; and (vi) the secondhand goods are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Most of these requirements are specified in the rulings to ensure that they will be satisfied in every instance in which the ruling applies. However, requirement 4, that the supply be of secondhand goods, is something that needs to be considered in detail as it cannot be specified in the rulings. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether or not the fishing quota and mussel licences can be secondhand goods. “Secondhand goods” The definition of “secondhand goods” does not attempt to define the term, but instead prescribes a list of things that are not included in the meaning of “secondhand goods”. Fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are not excluded under the definition. As the definition gives little indication as to what is included in the term, regard needs to be had to the ordinary meaning of “secondhand goods”. The first observation that can be made is that “secondhand goods” is a composite term. It relates to items that are first of all “goods”, and then the subset of those goods that can be described as “secondhand”. “Goods” In considering the first question as to what is comprised in the term “goods”, assistance can be found in section 2. Goods “means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money”. “Goods” is defined very widely in the initial part of the definition, and then subjected to two specific exclusions. It includes all kinds of real and personal property, but excludes choses in action and money. Therefore, it is necessary to establish whether fishing quota and marine farming authorisations are real or personal property and then secondly, whether they are money or choses in action. “Property” Before considering the “real” or “personal” aspects of property, the nature of “property” should first be established. The term “property” is not defined in the Act. Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed, Butterworths, London, 1991) Volume 44, “Stamp Duty”, para 1,032, provides the following description of “property”: Property is that which belongs to a person exclusively of others, and can be the subject of bargain and sale. It includes goodwill, trademarks, licence to use a patent, book debts, options to purchase and other rights under a contract. A revocable licence is not property. An owner of unworked minerals who gives an undertaking to the service owner not to work them does not thereby convey property, and a grant of a purported exclusive right to carry on a certain business in an area when the grantor has no such right is not a conveyance of property. A similar view is taken in Gray’s Law of Personal Property (5th ed, Butterworths, 1968) at page 1: The term “property” as used in the law of New Zealand and other common-law countries has a dual meaning. It may signify the title to or rights to ownership in goods or other property; and when s. 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 provides by rule 1 that in a contract for the sale of ascertained goods in a deliverable state the “property” in the goods passes at the time the contract is made, “property” here means the title to or ownership of the goods in question. The word “property” may in addition signify the thing owned, that over which title is exercised; in this sense, of course, it includes tangible goods such as a book or a table, but the word covers also incorporeal forms of property such as estates in land (an estate being an aggregate of rights exercisable over or in respect of land) or the contractual rights embodied in a cheque or an insurance policy. From this it can be seen that the term “property” is used to describe a wide range of things, both tangible and intangible. Its fundamental characteristics seem to be that it is capable of being owned, and that the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred (see, for instance the House of Lords decision in National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth \[1965\] 2 All ER 472). “Property” needs to be able to be defined and identified, and have a degree of permanence or stability. Further, it needs to able to be transferred. “Real” and “personal” property It is a well-established principle of English law that all “property” can be categorised as either real property or personal property. As Gray explains at page 1: “The distinction between real property (or realty) and personal property (personalty) is procedural in origin and is derived from the ancient forms of action in English law. In the twelfth century, the possession of freehold land was recoverable by certain actions which were called “real” actions; at this date the remedy for dispossession of all other kinds of property was, effectively, damages only, and actions for damages in these circumstances were called “personal” actions. The existence of only two classes of property has its origin in these two types of action. The acknowledgement that property is either real or personal is contained in the first sentence of the following quote from Gray (at page 2): It is not sufficient, however, to say simply without qualification that land is realty and all other property is personalty. Real property includes, besides the freehold estates and interests in land, things which are said to “savour of the realty”. The effect of there only being two classes of property, one being real and the other personal, is that a finding that something is property necessarily means that it will be either real or personal property. There is no third category. Therefore, in terms of the definition of “goods”, if the item is “property”, then it will be either real or personal property. A question arises as to whether it is necessary to determine whether the fishing quota is real or personal property. The section includes both types of property and as long as it is either one or the other there should be no need to make a final determination. While this is true, attempting to classify the property as either real or personal assists in determining whether or not the item is a chose in action. The reason for this is that the chose in action – chose in possession distinction appears to be limited to personal property. The exclusion for “choses in action” The term “chose in action” is used to describe various types of personal property. It is not a term that is applied to real property. This observation was made in the English case of Torkington v Magee \[1900-3\] All ER 991 where Channell J defined the term at page 994: Chose in action is a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession (emphasis added). Therefore, a finding that an item is real property means that the exclusion for choses in action will not be relevant. However, a finding that the item is personal property means that the exclusion for choses in action could be relevant. In determining the characteristics of a chose in action, the above quote from Torkington v Magee is referred to by a number of commentators as providing a useful working definition. In a New Zealand context, the Court of Appeal considered the issue in the case of Re Marshall (Deceased), CIR v Public Trustee \[1965\] NZLR 851. The case considered a situation involving a right to demand interest on a loan, and whether this was a chose in action for the purposes of the Death Duties Act 1921. In considering the issue of “chose in action”, McCarthy J stated at page 860: The right was property, for property in its wider sense includes all things of value. It was personal property and “all personal things are either in possession or in action. The law knows no tertium quid between the two”. This celebrated statement of Fry LJ in Colonial Bank v Whinney (1885) 30 Ch D 261 at p 285, is familiar to every lawyer. It received, I think the express, but certainly the implied approval of the House of Lords on appeal ((1886) 11 AC 426). Justice McCarthy provides further guidance on the characteristics of choses in action at page 861: That is so because if the right to give the notice and the corresponding duty to accept it had been denied, there was no possible method of enforcement other than going to law and thereby securing not the physical possession of the thing but the advantages of its ownership. This, says Mr Cyprian Williams in his article in (1895) 11 LQR 223, is the true test, and I agree. ... The characteristics that one cannot take the right into physical possession (even after judgment in one’s favour) and that it can only be vindicated by Court action, are the qualifying features of a chose in action and have become the bases of most modern definitions (emphasis added). The fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is the same in both authorities. Both authorities refer to the fact that in respect of a chose in action, one cannot take the right into physical possession. Being able to take the thing into possession is a characteristic of a chose in possession. Even if court action is taken to enforce the chose in action, the result may well be that the advantages of ownership are secured rather than actual physical possession of the thing. “Secondhand” There have been few cases on the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” in the GST context. Case N16 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,142 was a decision of Barber DJ where he had to consider whether deer velvet purchased direct from producers by means of commission agents were secondhand goods when they were purchased by a distributor and exporter of deer velvet. His Honour concluded that they were not secondhand goods. Judge Barber accepted that the two key concepts underlying whether something is secondhand are previous ownership and previous use. He stated at page 3,148: I agree with counsel that the concept of secondhand relates to pre-ownership or pre-use. I agree ... that the emphasis is on pre- use. I consider that there is quite some commonsense flexibility in ascertaining whether a good is still new or has become secondhand. I do not regard second ownership as necessarily rendering an item secondhand. Many goods pass from manufacturer to wholesaler or retailer to customer or consumer (with other levels of distributors sometimes also involved), and yet are not regarded as secondhand at the consumer purchaser level, even though the item has been used as stock-in-trade at the various distribution levels. The good is not usually regarded as secondhand until it has been used for its intrinsic purpose. The TRA felt that previous ownership of goods is not in itself necessarily sufficient to meet the test of secondhand in the Act. Usually a previous owner must have also used the goods for their intrinsic purpose. Subsequently the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of secondhand in LR McLean & Co Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211. McKay J expressly referred to and agreed with Judge Barber’s comments in Case N16 as to the ordinary meaning of the term “secondhand”. Justice Richardson (as he then was) stated at page 11,213: The short point of the appeal is whether wool purchased by registered persons from unregistered persons is secondhand goods for the purposes of the 1985 Act. If the expression secondhand goods is given its ordinary and natural meaning it is common ground that it is not within that description. In ordinary usage the expression refers to goods which have been used, although depending on the context it may apply to goods which are no longer new or even in some contexts goods which have simply been previously owned. Mr Harley for the appellants did not seek to draw any distinction based on “use” of the wool by the sellers. The argument for the appellants is that to accord with the scheme and purpose of the legislation the expression has to be given the meaning of any goods which have been purchased by a registered person. The judgments of the Court of Appeal state that the term “secondhand” should be given its ordinary or normal meaning. While “secondhand” can mean either pre-owned or pre-used, the Court concluded that it is not sufficient that the goods were previously owned. If an item were “secondhand” simply through being previously owned, the term “secondhand” would be deprived of any practical meaning according to Justice Richardson. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded that the more relevant factor is whether the goods have been previously used. The effect of this is that the courts have not extended the meaning of the term “secondhand goods” to goods that have been previously owned but not previously used for their intrinsic purpose. Application to fishing quota Is fishing quota “property”? When these concepts are applied to fishing quota, it seems that fishing quota would constitute property. Fishing quota is definable and identifiable through being granted under a statutory regime. It is permanent or stable in nature as it is issued in perpetuity. Fishing quota is capable of being owned and there are specific legislative provisions in the Fisheries Act 1996 dealing with the ability of the fishing quota to be transferred. On this basis, it can be accepted that fishing quota is “property”. Is fishing quota real or personal property? The next issue is whether fishing quota is real or personal property. The characteristics of fishing quota are determined from considering the legislation under which it is created. Under section 66 of the Fisheries Act 1996 (previously section 28O of the Fisheries Act 1983) the holders of individual transferable quota obtain a right to receive an annual catch entitlement for the species that is the subject of the quota. While the annual catch entitlement is defined by reference to a “quota management area”, there is nothing in either of the Fisheries Acts to suggest that it was intended that fishing quota gives rise to an interest in land. Therefore, based on this and the earlier conclusion that fishing quota is not a profit à prendre, it is considered that fishing quota is neither an interest in land nor real property. As fishing quota is “property” and property is either “real” or “personal”, the conclusion that fishing quota is not real property leads also to the conclusion that it must be personal property. As fishing quota is personal property, it will fall within the words “all kinds of real and personal property” in the definition of “goods” in the Act. Therefore, it is considered that this first part of the definition is satisfied. The next question is whether either of the two exclusions to the definition applies. Is fishing quota a “chose in action”? On the issue of whether fishing quota is a chose in action, it is established by the cases that the fundamental characteristic of a chose in action is that one cannot take the right into physical possession. Fishing quota appears to possess this characteristic. The right to catch fish cannot be taken into possession. While an argument could be made that a person could simply catch the fish under the quota, this seems to confuse the fish (which could be taken into possession) with the right to catch those fish (which, it is considered, cannot be taken into possession). The end result is that it is concluded that fishing quota is a chose in action. While fishing quota is capable of satisfying the first part of the definition of “goods”, being a form of personal property, it is then excluded from the definition of “goods” by reason that it is a chose in action. The effect of this is that fishing quota cannot be regarded as being “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. Given that it is concluded that fishing quota is not “goods”, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether the fishing quota could be regarded as being “secondhand”. Therefore, as it is concluded that fishing quota is not “goods”, it is also concluded that fishing quota cannot be “secondhand goods”. Application to marine farming authorisations Are marine farming authorisations “goods”? This question needs to be addressed in respect of the three types of marine farming authorisations: • The old marine farming leases; • The old marine farming licences; and • The new combination resource consent and marine farming permit. Marine farming leases It is accepted that marine farming leases are property. The marine farming lease is definable, has a degree of permanence (being the term of the lease) and is capable of being transferred. This means that marine farming leases are property for the first part of the definition. However, in terms of whether marine farming leases are real or personal property, it is not certain that all marine farming leases would give rise to a leasehold estate. To the extent that a marine farming lease is a leasehold estate, it will be real property. If the particular marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate, it will then constitute personal property. An issue exists as to whether marine farming leases might be excluded from being goods on the basis that they are choses in action. As noted above in relation to fishing quota, because choses in action are a subset of personal property, this will only be relevant if it is determined that the particular marine farming lease is not a leasehold estate (and thus not real property). If the marine farming lease is real property, then it will be “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that are not real property and are thus personal property, it needs to be determined whether they would be choses in action. The key distinguishing characteristic between choses in action and choses in possession, is the ability of the item to be “taken into possession”. Marine farming leases are like fishing quota in this regard in that they do not have a physical aspect to their nature. They encompass a number of rights, but these rights cannot be taken into possession. The only way to enforce these rights is to sue to enforce them. The effect of this is the conclusion that those marine farming leases that are not real property would be choses in action. This means that if a marine farming lease does not give rise to a leasehold estate it will be a chose in action and excluded from the definition of “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. For those marine farming leases that constitute real property and are “goods”, the further issue of whether they are “secondhand” so as to be “secondhand goods” needs to be considered. The marine farming leases being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. The only other issue to consider is the “use” issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16. The intrinsic purpose of a marine farming lease is to farm the particular species specified in the lease. If a farming operation has been carried out pursuant to the lease, then the conclusion appears inescapable that the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. However, situations could arise in respect of marine farming leases where a person never actually exercises the rights under the lease and simply sells it without ever having attempted to farm the particular aquatic life in question. In such a case, an issue exists as to whether the lease has been used for its intrinsic purpose. On the basis of the case law, it appears that it has not been used for its intrinsic purpose. As this is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis, the Ruling only applies to marine farming leases that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the lease. Marine farming licences Under section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act, it seems clear that marine farming licences are property. The licences are defined in that Act, they have a degree of permanence (being the term of the licence) and are capable of being transferred. Therefore, it is concluded that marine farming licences are property. The next issue is whether marine farming licences are real or personal property. The nature of a marine farming licence is not entirely clear from the Marine Farming Act. Section 11(3) of the Marine Farming Act provides that the right received under a marine farming licence is “the exclusive right during the currency of the licence to farm within the licensed area the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence”. It seems possible that the rights created under this provision could constitute an interest in land depending on the particular terms of any given licence. If the licence is defined by reference to a particular area of land and the licence provides the exclusive right to farm this area, it is possible that an interest in land (being a leasehold interest) would have been created despite the use of the term “licence”. On this basis, it is concluded that some marine farming licences may constitute an interest in land and will thus be real property. As it has been concluded that marine farming licences are “property”, those licences that are not real property will be personal property. The next matter to be considered is whether the exclusion for choses in action in the definition of “goods” applies. This issue will only be relevant to those licences that are personal property. The key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. It is a right that can only be enforced through court action. In respect of those marine farming licences that are personal property, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that constitute the marine farming licences into possession. If the rights are not real property, the licence will not provide an exclusive right to “possess” the particular area. The marine farming licence will provide for the exclusive right of being able to farm in the particular area, but it does not appear to provide the right to exclude others from the area. Therefore, it seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears as if the marine farming licences that are personal property would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that these marine farming licences are excluded from the definition of “goods” for GST purposes. However, the marine farming licences that are real property are not subject to the exclusion for choses in action, and thus will constitute “goods” for the purposes of the Act. For those marine farming licences that are real property, the next question is whether these “goods” are “secondhand” so as to qualify for the secondhand goods input tax credit under the GST Act. The marine farming licences being considered are interests in land, and it is settled on the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in Coveney that land can be secondhand goods. In terms of the “use” issue from cases LR McLean and Case N16, the same conclusion that applied to marine farming leases applies to marine farming licences. Whether the marine farming licence has been used for its intrinsic purpose is a question of fact to be determined on a case by case basis. For this reason, the Ruling only applies to marine farming licences that have been used for their intrinsic purposes, namely used to farm the species of fish or marine vegetation specified in the licence. Resource consents and marine farming permits The definition of “goods” requires that the item concerned be either real or personal property. It has been concluded that the GST Act will regard the supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit as a single supply. The nature of the property comprised in this supply needs to be considered. The nature of a resource consent and certificate of compliance Section 139(6) deems a certificate of compliance to be a resource consent with the result that the provisions of the Resource Management Act are to apply accordingly. Being a “resource consent” means that the rights attaching to the resource consent are governed by section 122 of the Resource Management Act. Section 122 states that “a resource consent is neither real nor personal property”. This statement is interesting. It is well established that all property is either real or personal property. On this basis, the only sensible interpretation which can be placed on this provision is that Parliament did not want all of the common law and other rights which would automatically attach to property of this nature to attach to resource consents. Parliament must have wanted to regulate the rights that attach to a resource consent. This is consistent with the rest of the section, which goes on to deal with the characteristics of resource consents for the purposes of other legislation. Unfortunately, there is no statement regarding the revenue Acts. The issue, therefore, is whether the statement in section 122 of the Resource Management Act applies to the GST Act. Not real nor personal property In determining whether or not the statement in the Resource Management Act 1991 impacts on the classification of a resource consent under the GST Act, there are a number of observations which can be made. The first observation is that the statement in section 122 is not a standard definition. It is not contained in section 2 of the Resource Management Act along with all the other definitions that are prefaced with the words “for the purposes of this Act”. Therefore, Parliament may well have intended section 122 to have wider application than simply the Resource Management Act. A second point can be derived from the wording of section 122 itself. After making the initial statement, the section goes on to address a number of specific Acts and circumstances where the resource consents are to be regarded as having the characteristics of personal property. The GST Act is not one of those situations. This seems a clear indication from Parliament that the opening statement was intended to apply to the Acts that are dealt with in the section. To take the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 as an example, it seems from the plain wording of the section that Parliament intended that the opening words of the section would have meant that resource consents were not real or personal for the purposes of that Act. This was why Parliament inserted subsection (4) to make it clear that for the purposes of that Act, it was appropriate for a resource consent to be regarded as goods within the meaning of that Act. This does not make a resource consent goods or personal property for other purposes though. On this basis, it seems that the statement in section 122 would apply for the purposes of the GST Act also. By not making a specific exception for the GST Act, it is only possible to assume that Parliament were content with the initial statement applying to the GST Act. The third observation, which follows from the second, is the intention of the section that is apparent from the words used. By making the statement that a resource consent is neither real nor personal property, Parliament has created a legal fiction. A resource consent has the general characteristics of property, and the law only knows two categorisations of that property – real and personal. Therefore, in discerning the intention of Parliament in making this statement, the most logical intention is that Parliament did not want the natural common law rights to attach to a resource consent which would attach as a matter of course if the resource consent were either real or personal property. The consequences of section 122 of the Resource Management Act then need to be applied to the definition of “goods” in the GST Act. “Goods” means “all kinds of personal or real property ...”. It has been established that resource consents and certificates of compliance are deemed not to be “personal or real property”, and that the deeming provision operates for purposes outside the Resource Management Act and so affects the GST Act as well. This means that resource consents and certificates of compliance do not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act as they are not personal or real property. Effect of the marine farming permit There is one further matter to consider, and that is the effect that the marine farming permit might have on any ultimate conclusion regarding the combined property right, being the resource consent or certificate of compliance and a marine farming permit. It has already been concluded that for GST purposes, the supply of these items should be treated as a single supply. It has also been noted that the issuing of a marine farming permit is dependent on having a resource consent or certificate of compliance. Based on these conclusions, it is possible to conclude that the marine farming permit would have no effect on the issue of whether the combined property right is goods. However, if the marine farming permit were considered in its own right, it seems that the same conclusion would be reached. It appears that a marine farming permit would constitute property. Marine farming permits are capable of being owned, and the rights of ownership are capable of being transferred under section 67M of the Fisheries Act 1983. There is nothing in any of the relevant legislation to suggest that a marine farming permit is real property. While a marine farming permit provides a right to farm within the permit area, it does not typically provide any right to occupy the seabed. It is considered that without such a right, the marine farming permit is unlikely to be an interest in land and thus real property. That a marine farming permit does not provide any right to occupy the seabed seems reflected in section 67L(3), which provides that the marine farming permit does not authorise the permit holder to take any naturally occurring aquatic life in the area subject to the permit. Thus, it is considered that marine farming permits do not give rise to an interest in land and are accordingly concluded to be personal property. As the marine farming permits are not “money” the only other exclusion to be considered is that for choses in action. From the earlier analysis, the key characteristic of a chose in action is that it cannot be taken into possession. In respect of marine farming permits, it does not seem possible to take the bundle of rights that comprise a marine farming permit into possession. It seems that the only way to enforce the right would be to commence legal proceedings. On this basis, it appears that marine farming permits would more properly be regarded as choses in action rather than choses in possession. The result of this is that marine farming permits are excluded from the definition of “goods” for GST purposes. Therefore, it is concluded that the existence of a marine farming permit as part of a supply of a resource consent or certificate of compliance in conjunction with a marine farming permit will not affect the status of the supply for GST purposes. Regardless of whether the resource consent or certificate of compliance and the marine farming permit are considered together or separately, it is concluded that a supply of such items will not be a supply of “goods” as defined in the GST Act. Summary for marine farming authorisations Some marine farming leases and some marine farming licences may constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. These will be leases and licences that are defined with reference to a particular area of land, and that provide for exclusive rights in respect of that land. Such marine farming leases and licences are likely to be interests in land and thus real property. As real property, neither of the exclusions relating to “money” and “choses in action” will apply so that they will not be excluded from the definition of “goods”. The marine farming leases and licences that are not real property and so are personal property will not constitute “goods” for the purposes of the GST Act. The reason for this is that they are choses in action. Because the rights under these marine farming leases and licences cannot be taken into possession, the leases and licences that are personal property will constitute choses in action rather than choses in possession and so will be excluded from the definition of “goods”. In relation to resource consents and marine farming permits, it appears as if the declaration in section 122 of the Resource Management Act that resource consents are neither real nor personal property is intended to apply outside the Resource Management Act. As there is no legislative modification of the statement in respect of the GST Act, the resource consents and marine farming permits will not qualify as being “goods” because they do not satisfy the opening words of the definition of being real or personal property. Therefore, there is no need to consider the further issue of whether they are “secondhand”. One further matter Before concluding in respect of marine farming authorisations, it needs to be noted that there is presently a Bill before Parliament that, if enacted in its present form, would affect the three different statutory permissions set out above. The Bill is the Resource Management (Marine Farming and Heritage Provisions) Amendment Bill. This Bill has been reviewed by the Transport and Environment Committee (which reported back on 30 April 1999), and there are a number of useful comments in the Committee’s report as to the existing situation and the proposed legislation. The Bill is currently awaiting its second reading. Under the proposals, marine farming leases and licences will be incorporated into the Resource Management Act and deemed to be resource consents. According to the Committee there will be no diminution of rights for the holders of leases under the Marine Farming Act and the rights of marine farming licence holders may well increase. It certainly appears that the nature of the rights held by marine farmers under the Marine Farming Act will be affected. Instead of a marine farming lease or licence potentially being an interest in land as discussed above, marine farming leases and licences will be deemed to be resource consents. If the Bill is enacted in this form, this will mean that, based on the previous analysis, the marine farming leases and licences will be neither real nor personal property under section 122(1) of the Resource Management Act. Such a conclusion will mean that all of the various types of “marine farming authorisations” will be treated in the same manner for GST purposes, namely that no secondhand goods input tax credit will be available.
1 SUPPLIES PAID FOR IN FOREIGN CURRENCY—GST TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 04/01 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 95/12, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996), and public ruling BR Pub 00/04, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000). BR Pub 95/12 applies when the time of supply occurred prior to 1 March 1999, BR Pub 00/04 applies when the time of supply occurred on or after 1 March 1999 until and inclusive of 29 February 2004. This ruling’s period of application is from 1 March 2004 for an indefinite period. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 9(1), 10(2), 14(1)(a), 77, the definition of “money” in section 2(1) and the definition of “financial services” in section 3(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the acceptance by a registered person of payment in foreign currency for a taxable supply of goods or services made in New Zealand. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The value of the taxable supply is the amount of foreign currency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange “buy rate” applying at the time of supply. • The appropriate exchange rate is the “buy-rate” offered by an approved bank or an approved bureau de change at the time of supply. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 March 2004 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10 th day of March 2004. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 04/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 04/01 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in this Ruling was previously dealt with by BR Pub 95/12 published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996), at page 17 and BR Pub 00/04 published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 6 (June 2000), at page 4. This Ruling applies for the period from 1 March 2004 for an indefinite period. Background Public Ruling BR Pub 95/12 dealt with the GST consequences of receiving payment in foreign currency for taxable supplies of goods and services made in New Zealand. A number of registered persons, particularly those involved in tourism, accept foreign currency as payment for supplies of goods and services. Often a registered person will offer the customer an “in-house” exchange rate. This exchange rate is less favourable to the customer than other exchange rates. That is, the customer gets less New Zealand currency for the foreign currency than that obtainable at a bank or a bureau de change. The registered supplier will exchange the foreign currency at a bank and receive New Zealand currency. Because the bank exchange rate is better than the exchange rate the registered person gave the customer, the registered person will make a profit on the conversion of the foreign currency. The Ruling considers the GST treatment of such a profit. In particular, the Ruling considers whether the profit is consideration for an exempt supply, or whether the profit is part of the consideration for a taxable supply. Public Ruling BR 00/04 was essentially a re-issue of Public Ruling BR Pub 95/12. Legislation Section 2(1) defines “money”: “Money” includes- (a) Bank notes and other currency, being any negotiable instruments used or circulated, or intended for use or circulation, as currency; and (b) Postal notes and money orders; and (c) Promissory notes and bills of exchange,- whether of New Zealand or any other country, but does not include a collector’s piece, investment article, or item of numismatic interest. Section 3(1) defines “financial services”: For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a) The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise)... 3 Section 14(1)(a) exempts supplies of financial services from GST. Section 9 defines the time of supply. Section 9(1) states: Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier \[or the recipient\] or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. Section 10 is the section providing for the value of supply. Section 10(2) states: Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,- (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: Section 77 states: For the purposes of this Act, all amounts of money shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency, and in any case where and to the extent that such amount is consideration in money for a supply, that amount shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency as at the time of that supply. Application of the legislation Number of supplies When a registered person sells goods and services to a customer who pays in foreign currency, there is only one supply. That supply is the supply of goods and services. A possible alternative view is that there are two supplies in these circumstances: the first supply being a supply of goods and services from the registered person to the customer, the second supply being an exempt supply (under section 3(1)(a) and section 14(1)(a)) of the exchange of currency, also from the registered person to the customer. However, as already stated that is not the position where a sale of goods and services occurs with the customer paying in foreign currency – there is only one supply in this situation. The position is different if a customer, having already completed an exchange of foreign currency for New Zealand currency with a registered person, in a separate transaction then chooses to use that New Zealand currency to purchase goods and services from the same registered person. It will be a question of fact in each case whether there are one or two supplies. In the ordinary commercial situation there can be no reconstruction of the transaction to recharacterise two supplies as one or vice versa, nor is it appropriate to apply principles of economic equivalence to achieve similar results between one supply and two supply situations. When a registered person accepts foreign currency in payment for supplies, there is no exempt supply of the exchange of currency. To be an exchange of currency under section 3(1)(a) one currency must be exchanged for another. Section 3(1)(a) does not cover the situation when currency is exchanged for goods and services. The fact that 4 the registered person will later exchange the currency with a bank or bureau de change does not alter this. The transaction between the bank or bureau de change and the registered person involves an exempt supply of the exchange of currency by the bank or bureau de change to the registered person. There is no such exempt supply from the registered person to the customer paying with foreign currency. In situations where there is only one supply, a supply of goods and services, the value of supply is important, particularly since the registered person usually makes a profit from the low exchange rate. Value of supply When a registered person sells goods and services to a customer, the value of supply is determined using the rules in section 10. Under section 10(2)(a), when consideration for the supply is an amount of money, the value of supply is the amount of money. “Money” is defined in section 2(1) and includes foreign currency. Therefore, when a customer tenders foreign currency as consideration for a supply, the value of supply is the amount of foreign currency. However, section 77 requires all amounts of money tendered in consideration of a supply to be “expressed in terms of New Zealand currency as at the time of that supply”. “Expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” Three interpretations of the phrase “all amounts of money shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” are possible. It could mean that: • The parties must state their transaction, or document it, in New Zealand currency and the supplier returns that amount for GST purposes; or • The supplier must convert foreign currency to New Zealand currency at the current market exchange rate and return that amount for GST purposes; or • The supplier may convert foreign currency to New Zealand currency at the rate agreed between the parties and returns that amount for GST purposes. The first interpretation does not require any type of conversion, whereas the second and third do. Section 20(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 refers to income being “expressed in terms of Australian currency”. Section 77 is expressed in the same terms for New Zealand currency. Section 20(1) had been accepted as embodying the decision of the Privy Council in Payne v Deputy FCT \[1936\] 2 All ER 793 (see, for example, Dixon J in Adelaide Electric Supply Co Ltd v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 557). In the Payne decision, Lord Russell said at page 796 of the judgment: ...the assessable income of the taxpayer must, whatever be the currency in which he derives it, all be expressed in terms of Australian currency; in other words if any portion of his assessable income is derived by him in French or Belgian currency, it must before he can be properly assessed to Australian income tax be converted into its equivalent, at the time it was derived, in Australian 5 currency. In exactly the same way, any income derived by him in British currency must be converted into its equivalent in Australian currency. In short when an Australian statute tells the taxpayer to state his derived income in order that a fraction thereof (i.e., so many pence in the pound of derived income) may be taken as tax, this can only mean that his derived income is to be stated and dealt with in terms of Australian currency. From this it would accordingly follow that the commissioner was right in including the amount of £1,097 in the appellant’s assessment. \[Emphasis added.\] Lord Russell interpreted the words subsequently adopted in section 20(1) to mean that the foreign currency must be converted to the currency of the taxing country at the current market exchange rate. This is considered to be the preferred approach. That is, the phrase “expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” in section 77 requires the amount of foreign currency tendered as consideration for a supply to be converted into an amount of New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. The above interpretation is also consistent with the use of the same phrase by the New Zealand legislature in the now repealed section KF 2(5) (definition of “effective rate of domestic income tax”). The relevant part of the former section KF 2(5) stated: “Effective rate of domestic income tax”, in relation to a company that is not resident in New Zealand and to an accounting year of that company, means the rate ascertained in accordance with the following formula: a b where- a is the total income tax (expressed in terms of New Zealand currency at the rate of exchange in force on the last day of that accounting year) payable by that company in the country or territory in which it is resident, in respect of the total income derived by it in that accounting year, being the total income upon which the total income tax is levied; and b is that total income (expressed in terms of New Zealand currency at the rate of exchange in force on the last day of that accounting year): \[Emphasis added.\] This definition is an equivalent use of the phrase in section 77, and supports the interpretation that the phrase requires some type of conversion. As already outlined, the decision in Payne supports the interpretation of the phrase in section 77 as requiring the conversion of the foreign currency (tendered as consideration for a supply) at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. Exchange rate applying at the time of supply Section 77 requires the amount of money that is consideration for a supply to be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency “as at the time of that supply”. Section 9 determines the time at which any supply takes place. Section 9(1) states the general rule, i.e. that a supply shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued or the time any payment is received by the supplier. Generally, in the circumstances to which the Ruling applies, the time of supply is the time of payment. Accordingly, it is the exchange rate applying at the time of payment that is to be used to convert the foreign currency to New Zealand dollars for GST purposes and not an exchange rate applying at the date the registered person converts the foreign currency to New Zealand dollars. Nor is the rate of exchange actually 6 obtained on the conversion of the foreign currency to be used if this differs from the exchange rate applying at the time of payment. Where an invoice is issued before a payment is made, the exchange rate applicable on the date of issue of the invoice is the correct date to be used to convert the foreign currency to New Zealand dollars for GST purposes. The Commissioner will accept the exchange rates offered by an approved bank or an approved bureau de change. In this connection, all registered banks in New Zealand are approved. American Express and Travelex Australasia Group, which includes Thomas Cook, are approved bureaux de change. The value of supply is not the value of foreign currency tendered as consideration exchanged at the registered person’s low exchange rate. Instead, it is the value of foreign currency tendered as consideration converted at the exchange rate determined by the approved banks and bureaux de change operating in the foreign exchange markets at the time of supply (payment). The applicable exchange rate in all cases is the “buy-rate”. Examples Example 1 Hotel Guest wishes to exchange some foreign currency for New Zealand currency. Hotel offers him a low exchange rate, which he accepts. Hotel exchanges the foreign currency at a bank and makes a profit. The profit is consideration for an exempt supply, being the exempt supply of an exchange of currency. Hotel has exchanged New Zealand currency for foreign currency. The consideration for the supply is the difference between the exchange rate Hotel receives from the bank, and the exchange rate Hotel gave Hotel Guest. For example: Approved exchange buy rate: NZ$1=Foreign$3 or Foreign$1=NZ$0.33 Hotel exchange rate: NZ$1=Foreign$4 or Foreign$1=NZ$0.25 Hotel Guest exchanges Foreign$300 at Hotel exchange rate, and receives NZ$75. Hotel exchanges the Foreign$300 at the bank for the approved exchange buy rate and receives NZ$100. The NZ$25 profit is consideration for an exempt supply and does not have to be returned for GST purposes. Example 2 Hotel Guest checks out of Hotel and settles his bill using foreign currency. Again Hotel offers him a low exchange rate which he accepts. Hotel exchanges the money at a bank and makes a profit. 7 The profit on the currency exchange at the bank is part of the consideration for the taxable supply of goods and services by Hotel to Hotel Guest. The value of supply is the amount of foreign currency tendered in consideration for the supply. As the amount of money is foreign currency, it needs to be expressed in amounts of New Zealand currency. That change to New Zealand currency should take place at the approved exchange buy rate at the time of supply. That means the profit on the currency exchange is part of the consideration for the taxable supply Hotel makes. For example: Exchange rates as above. Bill of NZ$1,000. Hotel Guest tenders Foreign$4,000 to pay the bill. Hotel accepts the Foreign$4,000 in full payment of the bill, at Hotel’s exchange rate. Hotel then exchanges the Foreign$4,000 at the bank for the approved exchange buy rate and receives NZ$1,333, making a profit of $333 on the currency. This profit is part of the consideration for a taxable supply and should be returned as such for GST purposes. The entire $1,333 is the consideration for the supply.
1 LICENSED PREMISES’ OPERATORS—DEDUCTIBILITY OF ENTERTAINMENT EXPENDITURE PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 04/02 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 99/3 previously published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 5 (May/June 1999), and BR Pub 96/5 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No12 (April 1996). BR Pub 04/02 applies from 1 April 2004 for an indefinite period.Some minor wording and formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 99/3 applied until 31 March 2004. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section DG 1 and Schedule 6A of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the incurring of expenditure by any person who carries on business as a licensed premises’ operator under the Sale of Liquor Act 1989 (“licensee”) and who, in the ordinary course of that business: • Incurs that expenditure on food or beverages and makes special offers of that food or beverage in arm’s length transactions with members of the general public. The special offers of food or beverages to which this Ruling applies include: • Happy hours where a licensee offers drinks to customers at reduced prices during a particular time period: • Offers of free drinks, or food or both on certain days or at certain times to customers or categories of customers selected from the general public: • Two meals offered to customers for the price of one: • “Toss the boss” competitions where for every drink purchased, the customer can toss a coin and has the chance to win a free drink; or • Pays an allowance to an employee (such as a bar manager) to cover the costs of the employee providing in the ordinary course of business, free drinks or food or both to customers on the licensee’s business premises but not at a party or similar social function or in a reserved area, or where there is other than an arm’s length relationship with the customer. 2 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The deduction available for expenditure on the special offers of food or beverages is not limited to 50% under section DG 1. • The deduction available for expenditure on the allowance paid to an employee is not limited to 50% under section DG 1. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 April 2004 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 5 th day of April 2004. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 04/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 04/02 (“the Ruling”). All references to a “licensee” are to any person who carries on business as a licensed premises’ operator under the Sale of Liquor Act 1989. Background Under section DG 1, the deduction allowed for expenditure or loss on “specified types of entertainment” set out in Part A of Schedule 6A is limited to 50% of that expenditure, unless the entertainment or benefit is “excluded entertainment” under Part B of the Schedule. If the entertainment or benefit is not of the specified types in Part A, or is excluded entertainment under Part B, the expenditure or loss is fully deductible, provided it is incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income or it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, pursuant to section BD 2(1)(b). Section DG 1 also treats an allowance paid to reimburse expenditure by an employee on specified types of entertainment that fall within Part A, as being expenditure by the taxpayer on the particular specified type of entertainment. Legislation Section DG 1 states: (1) This section and Schedule 6A are intended to limit the amount of the deduction allowed for expenditure or loss incurred on certain types of entertainment, being entertainment that generally involves a significant element of private benefit, to 50% of that expenditure or loss (but subject always to the express provisions of this section and Schedule 6A). (2) If a taxpayer incurs expenditure or loss on a type of entertainment or benefit (whether consumed or enjoyed by the taxpayer or anyone else) specified in Part A of Schedule 6A then, unless and to the extent that the entertainment or benefit is specified as excluded entertainment in Part B of that Schedule, the deduction allowed for that expenditure or loss will be limited to 50% of the amount that would be allowed as a deduction but for this section. (3) For the purposes of this section— (a) A taxpayer will be treated as incurring expenditure on a specified type of entertainment to the extent that the taxpayer pays an allowance for, or reimburses an employee’s expenditure on, the specified type of entertainment and the allowance or reimbursement is exempt income under section CB 12: .... Part A of Schedule 6A lists four “specified types of entertainment”: • Corporate boxes • Holiday accommodation 4 • Pleasure craft • Food or beverages. Effectively, a description of “food or beverages” for the purposes of Part A of Schedule 6A is contained in clause 4 of Part A, which states: Food or beverages— (a) Provided or consumed as an incidence of any of the types of entertainment specified in clauses 1 to 3; or (b) Provided or consumed off the business premises of the taxpayer; or (c) Provided or consumed on the business premises of the taxpayer - (i) At a party, reception, celebration meal, or other similar social function; or (ii) In an area of the premises, such as a boardroom or an executive or client dining room, reserved for use at the time only by those at a certain level of seniority and their guests and not open to all employees of the taxpayer working in the premises. The Schedule defines “Business premises” as: (a) The normal business premises; or (b) A temporary workplace,— of the taxpayer or of an associated person (not being premises or a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment). Part B of the Schedule lists excluded entertainment (i.e. entertainment which, being one of the specified types of entertainment under Part A of the Schedule, would otherwise be subject to the 50% deduction limit). Clause 9 of Part B states: Entertainment that is provided by the taxpayer for market value (or otherwise in an arm's length transaction) in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business which consists of providing one or more specified types of entertainment. Application of the Legislation The 50% deduction limit in section DG 1 applies to expenditure that is otherwise fully deductible but which is a “specified type of entertainment” under Part A and not “excluded entertainment” under Part B of Schedule 6A. Special offers of food or beverages to the public: A. As a “specified type of entertainment” When a licensee makes a special offer of food or beverages or both to the public, the expenditure on that food or beverages is, in most cases, not a specified type of entertainment under Part A of the Schedule (and thus not subject to the 50% deduction limit). This is despite the food or beverages being provided or consumed on the “business premises” of the licensee, in terms of clause 4(c) of Part A. Clause 4(c) has two sets of criteria, both of which must be met before such expenditure falls within a specified type of entertainment: 5 • The first requires that the food or beverages are provided or consumed on the “business premises” of the taxpayer; and • The second contains two alternatives, which require that the food or beverages be provided or consumed, either at a party (clause 4(c)(i)), or in an area of the premises reserved for a restricted class of employees and their guests (clause 4(c)(ii)). The special offers of food or beverages made to the public by licensees, although meeting the first set of criteria in clause 4(c), do not ordinarily come within either of the alternatives in the second set. In relation to the first set of criteria in clause 4(c), the licensed premises where the offer occurs are the licensee’s “business premises” as they are the normal business premises of the licensee. The definition of “business premises” in the Schedule excludes “premises or a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment”. It could be argued that licensed premises are established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment and so would not be the licensee’s “business premises”. However, it is considered that from the licensee’s perspective, the licensed premises are established principally for the purpose of running a business and not for the purposes of enjoying entertainment, and so are the licensee’s “business premises” in terms of the Schedule. Note that, for the purposes of the definition of “business premises”, licensed premises are not a temporary workplace of a person who merely conducts a business meeting at the licensed premises because, from that person’s perspective, the licensed premises are a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment. As already indicated in relation to the second set of criteria in clause 4(c), food or beverages provided or consumed on “business premises” (apart from food or beverages consumed in a corporate box, holiday accommodation, or a pleasure craft) are only included as a specified type of entertainment if the food or beverages are consumed either at a party or similar social function, or in a reserved area of the premises. In some situations, food and beverages consumed on licensed premises may be consumed at a party or similar social function or in an area reserved at the time for use by certain employees and guests. However, special offers of food and beverages of the type to which the Ruling applies that are made to the public by the licensee during ordinary opening hours of the licensed premises, would not ordinarily be consumed at a party or similar social function, or in an exclusive area as contemplated in clause 4(c) of the Schedule. B. As “excluded entertainment” However, if the special offers of food or beverages of the type referred to do come within Part A of Schedule 6A, they would be excluded entertainment under Part B of the Schedule (and thus not be subject to the 50% deduction limit). This is because those special offers of food or beverages would usually come within clause 9 of Part B. Clause 9 applies to expenditure on entertainment that is provided 6 at market value, or otherwise in an arm’s length transaction, in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business where that business consists of providing one or more of the specified types of entertainment. Expenditure on such excluded entertainment is therefore fully deductible if the entertainment is provided by a business at market value or in an arm’s length transaction. It follows that clause 9 applies to special offers of food or beverages made by a licensee to members of the general public if the food or beverages are provided either at market value, or are otherwise provided in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. Such special offers of food or beverages are made by way of promoting the taxpayer’s business and in the interests of future custom. In particular: • The cost to the licensee of “happy hours”, where reduced price drinks are provided to customers during a particular time period in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, will be fully deductible. • The cost to the licensee of free drinks or food or both, provided on certain days or at certain times to customers or categories of customers selected from members of the general public, is fully deductible if the provision of such free drinks or food occurs in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. • The cost of providing meals, offered in a “two meals for the price of one” deal, is fully deductible if the meals are provided in an arm’s length transaction with customers in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. • The cost to the licensee of drinks provided to customers in “toss the boss” competitions is also fully deductible if the competitor and the licensee have an arm’s length relationship. Where this occurs, the free drink prizes are provided in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of business. Allowances to an employee providing free food or drinks for customers A licensee may pay a hospitality allowance to an employee, such as a bar manager, to cover the costs of providing free drinks or food or both to customers in the ordinary course of business. The expenditure on such an allowance is not subject to the 50% deduction limit. This is because the drinks or food or both are being provided or consumed on the licensee’s business premises but not at a party or similar social function or in an area of the premises reserved for select staff and their guests as contemplated under clause 4(c) of Part A to Schedule 6A. Further, the allowances are excluded from the 50% deduction limit by clause 9 of Part B to Schedule 6A as the free food or drinks or both are not being provided where there is other than an arm’s length relationship with the consumer. The allowance is fully deductible if it is incurred by the licensee in deriving the licensee’s gross income or if it is necessarily incurred by the licensee in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, pursuant to section BD 2(1)(b). 7 Examples Example 1 A licensee offers half-price drinks on Saint Patrick’s Day to all patrons who wear a green hat. All other drinks are provided at full price. As the half-price drinks are provided to the green hat wearers in arm’s length transactions in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, the expenditure on the drinks is excluded from Part A of Schedule 6A, by clause 9 of Part B to the Schedule, and is fully deductible to the licensee. Example 2 A licensee offers the next round of drinks free for a period of one hour on a Friday night to any customer who, following the purchase of a round, is able to score more than 10 by throwing a single dart at a dartboard. As the free rounds of drinks are available to all customers in arm’s length transactions in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, the expenditure on the drinks is excluded from Part A of Schedule 6A, by clause 9 of Part B to the Schedule, and is fully deductible to the licensee.
1 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX AND MOTOR VEHICLE MULTI-LEASES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 04/03 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (“the Act”) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of clause 1(c) of Schedule 2 Part A, and sections CI 2, GC 15, GC 17 and BG 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of a motor vehicle under a multi-lease product, to a lessee who in turn provides the motor vehicle to an employee of the lessee, for their private use or enjoyment, or makes the motor vehicle available for such private use or enjoyment. A “multi-lease product”, for the purposes of this Ruling, is a lease product that exhibits the following characteristics: • it is a lease of a motor vehicle for a specified period, with the option or possibility of the lessee entering into a further or multiple further leases of that vehicle for specified periods, or periods to be specified prior to their commencement; • separate and comprehensive written contracts are required to be executed in respect of each period under the multi-lease product; • any rental rate for a lease period under the multi-lease product is calculated on the same basis as it would be for any other customer who was entering into the lease of the vehicle otherwise than under a multi-lease product; • the lease period to which any entitlement relates is able to be clearly identified in the relevant lease documentation; • there is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) at the time of entering into any lease under the multi-lease product, or prior to that time, or thereafter, which directly or indirectly concerns, relates to, or otherwise affects the Arrangement and is: • in any way inconsistent with the characterisation of the leases under the multi- lease product as separate and distinct, or • in any way indicative of the specific terms and conditions of any potential further leases being agreed or determined at a time earlier than the time of entering into such further lease or leases; 2 • it does not constitute a finance lease, as defined in section OB 1 of the Act; and • it does not involve a lease between parties who are associated persons pursuant to section OD 7 of the Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The market value of motor vehicles leased under the Arrangement, for the purposes of calculating the value of any fringe benefit arising in respect of those vehicles, in accordance with section CI 3(1) and clause 1(c) of Schedule 2 Part A, is determined on the date on which each lease under the multi-lease product commences. • Section GC 15 does not apply in respect of the Arrangement. • Section CI 2 does not apply in respect of the Arrangement. • Section GC 17 does not apply in respect of the Arrangement. • Section BG 1 does not apply in respect of the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 29 March 2004 to 28 March 2009. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of March 2004. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 04/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 04/03 (“the Ruling”). Background A number of motor vehicle lessors offer products whereby a lessee enters into a lease for a specified period (for example, 12 months), with the option or possibility of entering into further leases for pre-specified periods (for example, two further possible leases of 12 months each). There are similar “multi-lease” products available whereby the lease periods are flexible, usually varying in period from 6 months to 75% of the vehicle’s depreciable estimated useful life. The lease periods under these “flexible term” multi-lease products are specified prior to their commencement, and are only flexible in the sense that the lessee may assess their requirements toward the end of any given stipulated period, and select an appropriate term for the next period, if one is desired. Where a lessee under a multi-lease product in turn provides the motor vehicle to one of their employees, for their private use or enjoyment, or makes the motor vehicle available for such private use or enjoyment, a “fringe benefit” arises for the purposes of the FBT rules, by virtue of section CI 1(a) or (b) of the Act. Section CI 3(1) of the Act provides formulae for calculating the value of any fringe benefit, being a benefit that consists of the private use or enjoyment, or the availability for private use or enjoyment, of a motor vehicle. The variable “z” in the formulae in section CI 3(1) is the amount that is the value of the benefit that would be able to be enjoyed by the employee if they had unlimited private use or enjoyment of the motor vehicle during the relevant period. This amount is to be calculated in accordance with Schedule 2 Part A, which relevantly provides that the value of such a benefit, where the motor vehicle is leased or rented and the lessor and lessee are not associated persons, is a stipulated percentage of the market value of the motor vehicle on the date on which the period of that leasing or renting commenced. The relevant issue for the purpose of this Public Ruling is whether the period of leasing of a vehicle under a multi-lease product commences at the beginning of the initial period under the product, and concludes at the end of however many further periods under the product are taken up by the lessee, or alternatively, each period under the relevant product constitutes a separate lease, the period of leasing of a vehicle therefore commencing at the beginning of the relevant period (i.e. whether the successive periods under multi-lease products constitute separate leases, or together form one lease). The Ruling also deals with the application of sections GC 15, CI 2, GC 17 and BG 1 to the Arrangement. The Commissioner has issued a number of product rulings on variations of these types of lease products and accordingly considers that a general Public Ruling is warranted. 4 Legislation Section CI 1 provides (relevantly) as follows: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, means any benefit that consists of− (a) The private use or enjoyment, in relation to the employee, at any time during the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, of a motor vehicle owned, leased, or rented by the person who makes the motor vehicle available to the employee: (b) The availability for the private use or enjoyment of the employee, at any time during the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, of a motor vehicle that is so owned, leased, or rented: ... being, as the case may be, private use or enjoyment, availability for private use or enjoyment, a loan, subsidised transport, a contribution to a fund referred to in paragraph (e), a specified insurance premium or a contribution to an insurance fund of a friendly society, a contribution to a superannuation scheme, a service referred to in paragraph (ga), or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee; but does not include ... \[Emphases added\] Section CI 3 provides (relevantly) as follows: (1) For the purposes of the FBT rules, the value of any fringe benefit, being a benefit that consists of the private use or enjoyment, or the availability for private use or enjoyment, of a motor vehicle, shall, in relation to each motor vehicle the private use or enjoyment of which or the availability for private use or enjoyment of which constitutes that benefit, be— (a) Where the benefit is subject to fringe benefit tax on a quarterly basis, an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: y X z ——— 90 where— ... z is the amount, calculated in accordance with Schedule 2, Part A, that in relation to the quarter and to the motor vehicle is the value of the benefit that would be able to be enjoyed by the employee if the employee had unlimited private use or enjoyment of the motor vehicle in that quarter: ... 5 (c) Where the benefit is subject to fringe benefit tax on an income year basis under section ND 14, an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: 6 y X z ——— 365 where— ... z is the amount, calculated in accordance with Schedule 2, that in relation to the income year and to the motor vehicle is the value of the benefit that would be able to be enjoyed by the employee if the employee had unlimited private use or enjoyment or availability for private use or enjoyment of the motor vehicle in that income year. \[Emphases added\] Schedule 2, Part A provides (relevantly) as follows: 1. Subject to clause 3, in relation to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 14) to any income year, and to any motor vehicle that in the quarter or income year is provided by any person for the private use or enjoyment of an employee or is available for such private use or enjoyment, the value of the benefit that would be able to be enjoyed by the employee, if the employee had unlimited private use or enjoyment or availability for private use or enjoyment of the motor vehicle in that quarter or income year, shall be,— ... (c) Where the motor vehicle is leased or rented by that person from any other person, where that person and that other person are not associated persons, 6% or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 14) 24% of the market value of the motor vehicle on the date on which the period of that leasing or renting commenced: \[Emphasis added\] Section GC 15 provides (relevantly) as follows: (1) For the purposes of the FBT rules, where any benefit which, if it were provided for or granted to an employee would be a fringe benefit, is provided or granted by the employer of the employee, or is provided or granted by another person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for the providing or granting of that benefit, for or to a person other than the employee of the employer, the employee of the employer and the other person being associated persons, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. Section CI 2 provides (relevantly) as follows: (1) For the purposes of the FBT rules, where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. 7 Section GC 17 provides as follows: Where the Commissioner is satisfied that an arrangement has been entered into between persons and a purpose or effect of the arrangement (not being a merely incidental purpose or effect) is to defeat the intent and application of the FBT rules, or of any provision of the FBT rules, the Commissioner may, notwithstanding the arrangement, deem— (a) A person who is a party to that arrangement (that person being referred to in this section as the “participant”) to be the employer in relation to such other person or such other persons as the Commissioner specifies by notice in writing to the participant; and (b) Any person so specified to be, in relation to the participant, an employee (that person being referred to in this section as the “deemed employee”); and (c) Any benefit that— (i) Is obtained by the deemed employee and is provided or granted by the participant; or (ii) The deemed employee would have, or might be expected to have, or would in all likelihood have, obtained if that arrangement had not been made or entered into,— to be a benefit provided or granted by the participant to the deemed employee by virtue of the employment of the deemed employee,— for the purposes of the FBT rules; and the FBT rules shall apply accordingly throughout such period or periods (each being a period during which that arrangement is in force) as the Commissioner determines. Section BG 1 provides as follows: (1) A tax avoidance arrangement is void as against the Commissioner for income tax purposes. (2) The Commissioner, in accordance with Part G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), may counteract a tax advantage obtained by a person from or under a tax avoidance arrangement. Section OB 1 provides (relevantly) as follows: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— ... “FBT rules” is defined in section OZ 1(1) for the purposes of this Act: ... “Finance lease” means a lease of a lease asset that is entered into on or after the date that the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 receives the Royal assent under which— (a) The ownership of the lease asset is transferred to the lessee or an associate of the lessee at the end of the lease term; or (b) The lessee or an associate of the lessee has the option of acquiring the lease asset for an amount that is likely to be substantially lower than the lease asset's market value on the date of acquisition; or (c) The lease term is more than 75% of the lease asset's estimated useful life as that term is used in the formula applied by the Commissioner under section EG 4(3) 8 ... “Lease”— ... (f) In paragraph (b) of the definition of “cost price”, paragraph (b) of the definition of “lessee”, and paragraph (a) of the definition of “lessor”, and in the definitions of “finance lease”, “guaranteed residual value”, “initial period”, “instalment”, “lease asset”, “lease payment”, “lease term”, “outstanding balance”, and “specified lease”, and in sections CG 11(23), CG 11(23A), EO 2, EO 2A, FC 6 to FC 8, and FC 8A to FC 8G— (i) Means an agreement under which a lessor transfers to a lessee for a lease term a lease asset or the right to possess a lease asset in consideration for a lease payment; and (ii) Includes a hire or bailment, and a sublease; and (iii) Does not include a hire purchase agreement as defined in section 2 of the Hire Purchase Act 1971, or an assignment of a hire purchase agreement; and (iv) If the same lease asset is leased to the same lessee or an associated person of the lessee under 2 or more consecutive or successive leases, and the Commissioner, having regard to the tenor of this paragraph, regards the consecutive or successive leases as one lease, that lease: ... “Operating lease” means a lease, other than a finance lease, that is entered into on or after the date that the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 receives the Royal assent: ... “Tax avoidance arrangement” means an arrangement, whether entered into by the person affected by the arrangement or by another person, that directly or indirectly— (a) Has tax avoidance as its purpose or effect; or (b) Has tax avoidance as one of its purposes or effects, whether or not any other purpose or effect is referable to ordinary business or family dealings, if the purpose or effect is not merely incidental: ... “Tax avoidance”, in sections BG 1, EH 1, EH 42, GB 1, and GC 12, includes— (a) Directly or indirectly altering the incidence of any income tax: (b) Directly or indirectly relieving any person from liability to pay income tax: (c) Directly or indirectly avoiding, reducing, or postponing any liability to income tax: \[Emphases added\] Section CI 8 provides as follows: Subject to the FBT rules, the other provisions of this Act and of the Tax Administration Act 1994, so far as they are applicable and with any necessary modifications, shall apply with respect to fringe benefit 9 tax as if it were income tax imposed under section BB 1, and as if every reference to an income year were a reference to a quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) an income year; but nothing in the FBT rules shall be so construed as to include fringe benefit tax in the expressions “income tax” or “tax” for the purposes of,— (a) The provisions listed in section OZ 1(3)(a) to (o); or (b) Sections 121 and 122 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. \[Emphasis added\] Section OZ 1 provides (relevantly) as follows: (1) In this Act— ... “FBT rules” means Part ND and sections CI 1 to CI 6, CI 8 to CI 10, and GC 15 to GC 17 of this Act and sections 93, and 139B, and Part VII of the Tax Administration Act 1994; and includes section CI 11 (being a provision inserted after the original enactment of this Act): ...

(q) Fringe benefit tax; or ... \[Emphases added\] Section OB 6 (which defines the term “income tax” for the purposes of the Act) provides (relevantly) as follows: (2) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), the term “income tax” does not include the taxes specified in section OZ 1(3)(p) to (u) when the term is used in the provisions listed in section OZ 1(3)(a) to (o). Section ND 1 provides (relevantly) as follows: (1) Subject to section CI 5, an employer who has provided or granted a fringe benefit to an employee is liable to pay a special tax by way of an income tax to be known as fringe benefit tax. 10 Application of the Legislation Date of market value determination In determining whether the successive periods under multi-lease products constitute separate leases, or together form one lease, authorities in relation to the distinction between variation and rescission of contract are of some assistance. It is, however, noted that the question in this case is not one of rescission versus variation of contract, but rather of whether a new contract is entered into upon the natural conclusion of another, versus variation of the original contract. The House of Lords considered the distinction between variation and rescission of contract in Morris v Baron and Company \[1918\] AC 1 (“Morris v Baron”), which was applied in New Zealand Needle Manufacturers Ltd v Taylor and Another \[1975\] 2 NZLR 3. Lord Dunedin in Morris v Baron stated the test for making this distinction as follows (at pp. 25-26): The difference between variation and rescission is a real one, and is tested, to my thinking, by this: In the first case there are no such executory clauses in the second arrangement as would enable you to sue upon that alone if the first did not exist; in the second you could sue on the second arrangement alone, and the first contract is got rid of either by express words to that effect, or because, the second dealing with the same subject-matter as the first but in a different way, it is impossible that the two should be both performed. Viscount Haldane, in the same case, noted (at p. 19) that for a contract to rescind an earlier contract: ... there should have been made manifest the intention in any event of a complete extinction of the first and formal contract, and not merely the desire of an alteration, however sweeping, in terms which still leave it subsisting. Lord Atkinson also noted in Morris v Baron (at p. 31) that rescission of a contract will be implied “... where the parties have entered into a new contract entirely, or to an extent going to the very root of the first inconsistent with it”. It is the Commissioner’s view that the same sorts of considerations as these are relevant to determining whether a new contract is entered into upon the natural conclusion of another, or the original contract is varied. However, in relation to this particular question, it is the Commissioner’s view that in considering whether a party can be sued on a subsequent agreement alone, as if the earlier agreement did not exist, it is not necessary to inquire as to whether both that and an earlier agreement purport to deal with the same subject matter but in different ways. Further, in the Commissioner’s opinion, changes going to the very root of a contract for the lease of a motor vehicle would not necessarily be suggestive of a new contract being entered into upon the natural conclusion of another, as opposed to the original contract being varied. For instance, it could well be that toward the conclusion of the contract for the first, say, 12 month period under a multi-lease product, the parties decide to vary that contract by extending its term for an additional, say, 9 month period, for which the rental rate per month will be decreased. In this situation, the change of period and rental rate would arguably go to the very root of such a contract. However, this does not mean that a new lease contract is entered 11 into as opposed to the original lease contract being varied. It is clear in such a situation that the parties’ intention is to vary the contract by extending the lease period and setting an appropriate rental rate to take the extended period into account. As an agreement to vary a lease contract for personal property by extending its term will not alter the legal interest that the lessee has (as the lessee’s legal interest arises by virtue of possession, not the lease agreement), but rather will simply alter the lessee’s possessory entitlement, the variation would not give rise to a surrender and regrant by operation of law. Accordingly, it is the Commissioner’s view that the rationale behind the considerations relating to inconsistency between different agreements concerning the same subject matter, and whether there are changes going to the very root of a contract, in determining if a contract has been varied or rescinded, is only relevant to the extent that both agreements purport to deal with the same subject matter at the same time. The Commissioner is satisfied that the characteristics set out in the description of a multi- lease product in the Arrangement (discussed further below) ensure that each lease entered into for a further successive period constitutes a distinct lease. Therefore, the market value of motor vehicles leased under the Arrangement, for the purposes of calculating the value of any fringe benefit arising in respect of those vehicles, in accordance with section CI 3(1) and clause 1(c) of Schedule 2 Part A of the Act, is determined on the date on which each lease under the multi-lease product commences. Option or possibility of further lease periods The description of a “multi-lease product” in the Arrangement requires there to be a lease of a motor vehicle for a specified period, with the option or possibility of the lessee entering into a further or multiple further leases of that vehicle for specified periods, or periods to be specified prior to their commencement. The Arrangement would cover lease products with pre-specified potential lease periods (for example a 12 month lease with two further possible leases of 12 months each), and also products with flexible potential lease periods (where if the lessee decides to enter into a further lease they may select the period of that lease, usually within some parameters, prior to its commencement). Any lease documentation which refers to further potential leases under a multi-lease product should clearly identify that the further leases are options or possibilities only. Separate and comprehensive written contracts The description of the “multi-lease product” in the Arrangement requires that separate and comprehensive written contracts are required to be executed in respect of each period under the multi-lease product. Consecutive or successive leases under multi-lease products are generally (but not necessarily) entered into by execution of a schedule or supplement to a master hire / lease agreement. The schedule or supplement is generally required to be read and construed by reference to a master hire / lease agreement, as if each provision of the master hire / lease agreement were set out in the particular schedule or supplement. The schedule or supplement will contain all particulars of the vehicle being leased, including any options, allowances and accessories etc., and will specify the lease term and rate, and any excess kilometre or other 12 charges. The terms and conditions imported by the master hire / lease agreement are the standard generic terms and conditions for motor vehicle leases that the lessor wishes to have in all of its leases, including, for example, provisions with respect to term and payment (usually with reference to the specifications in the relevant schedule or supplement), lessor and lessee obligations and warranties, liabilities and indemnities, termination, and rights arising upon default. Provided that the schedule or supplement, read and construed by reference to a master hire / lease agreement constitutes a comprehensive contract which is separate from contracts for any other period or periods under the product, the Commissioner will be satisfied with respect to this requirement in the description of a “multi-lease product”. Calculation of rental rate The description of the “multi-lease product” in the Arrangement requires that any rental rate for a lease period under the multi-lease product is calculated on the same basis as it would be for any other customer who was entering into the lease of the vehicle otherwise than under a multi-lease product. This requirement is to be considered taking account of all factors which may impact upon the lease rate offered for the particular vehicle, apart from whether the vehicle is leased under a multi-lease product or otherwise. For instance, it is appropriate to have regard to things such as the lease period; customer credit rating; customer fleet size; kilometre allowances; replacement tyre allowances; options; accessories; and general service requirements of the lease, including vehicle maintenance. The fact that the vehicle may have been previously leased under the multi-lease product or may potentially be leased again under the product, should not be taken into account in formulating the applicable rental rates. Entitlements The description of a “multi-lease product” in the Arrangement requires that the lease period to which any entitlement relates is able to be clearly identified in the relevant lease documentation. Such entitlements may include kilometre allowances; replacement tyre allowances; options; accessories; general service components of the lease, including vehicle maintenance; or any other entitlement or extra. For example, a quotation may be given for a 12 month lease of a vehicle under a multi-lease product, with projected lease rates for two further possible 12 month leases of the vehicle. If the quotation stipulated, for example, 4 replacement tyres, 2 services and a 60,000 kilometre allowance, the period to which these entitlements relates must be apparent. If the entitlements relate to a period longer than the immediate lease term (i.e. if the anticipated needs over the life of the lease and any further leases of the vehicle which may be taken up were identified in order accurately to project lease rates for further potential periods), the documentation should identify what portion of the entitlements is available for each period or potential period. The lessee is to be entitled to the full amount or value of the entitlements which relate to each 13 lease period entered into, irrespective of whether any further potential lease or leases of the vehicle is or are taken up. 14 Inconsistent agreements etc The description of a “multi-lease product” in the Arrangement requires that: “there is no contract, agreement, arrangement, plan, undertaking or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) at the time of entering into any lease under the multi-lease product, or prior to that time, or thereafter, which directly or indirectly concerns, relates to, or otherwise affects the Arrangement and is: • in any way inconsistent with the characterisation of the leases under the multi-lease product as separate and distinct, or • in any way indicative of the specific terms and conditions of any potential further leases being agreed or determined at a time earlier than the time of entering into such further lease or leases.” In particular, such an inconsistent agreement, understanding, etc. under the first limb may include the following: • that any party will, or will if requested, renew, extend or vary the lease term; • that the parties will enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle; or • that there will be penalties for choosing not to enter into a further lease in respect of the vehicle. The second limb may include, for example, anything which suggests that rental rates for any potential further lease have been agreed in advance of that lease being taken up, as opposed to simply being estimated or projected. The specific terms and conditions of any potential further lease should be determined at the time such lease is taken up, and take account of all relevant factors in existence at that time (see above, for example, in relation to calculation of rental rate). Section GC 15 Section GC 15(1) of the Act applies where a relevant benefit is provided for or granted to a person other than an employee of the employer (that person and the employee being associated persons), by either the employer, or a third party with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for the providing or granting of that benefit. Section GC 15(1) then operates to deem that benefit to be provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. The description of the Arrangement is limited to the leasing of a motor vehicle under a multi- lease product, to a lessee who in turn provides the motor vehicle to an employee of the lessee for their private use or enjoyment, or makes the motor vehicle available for such private use or enjoyment. As the benefits are provided directly to the lessee’s employees, rather than any person associated therewith, section GC 15 does not apply in respect of the Arrangement. 15 Section CI 2 Section CI 2 of the Act applies where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted. Section CI 2 then operates to deem that benefit to be provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. The description of the Arrangement is limited to the leasing of a motor vehicle under a multi- lease product, to a lessee who in turn provides the motor vehicle to an employee of the lessee for their private use or enjoyment, or makes the motor vehicle available for such private use or enjoyment. As the benefits are provided to the lessee’s employees by the lessee, rather than any person with whom the lessee has entered into an arrangement for the provision of the benefit, section CI 2 does not apply in respect of the Arrangement. Section GC 17 Section GC 17 of the Act allows the Commissioner to deem certain persons to be in an employment relationship, and to deem benefits to be provided or granted, for the purposes of the FBT rules, by virtue of the deemed employment, where the Commissioner is satisfied that an arrangement with a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the FBT rules, or any provision thereof, has been entered into. The relevant question for the purpose of this Public Ruling is whether the Arrangement has the effect of defeating the intent and application of the FBT rules. The intention of the relevant FBT rules is found by ascertaining what was Parliament’s intention in this regard. As stated by the Privy Council in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Auckland Harbour Board (2001) 20 NZTC 17,008 at 17,011 per Lord Hoffmann “... for this purpose, the only available material is the language in which Parliament has expressed itself, properly construed according to currently accepted notions of how a taxing act should be interpreted and with due regard to s 5(j) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 as amended”. The Commissioner is satisfied that an Arrangement as described in the Ruling cannot be said to defeat the intent and application of the FBT rules, or any provision thereof. The Act provides that the market value of motor vehicles for FBT purposes, in accordance with section CI 3(1) and clause 1(c) of Schedule 2 Part A, is determined at the commencement of a lease. The general scheme of these provisions is to set out how to calculate the value of the benefit enjoyed by the employee where the motor vehicle is leased or rented. The statutory language makes it clear that the relevant calculations are based on stipulated percentages of the motor vehicle’s market value on the date the period of leasing or renting commenced. The Arrangement as described in the Ruling involves separate leases of the motor vehicle, and as such, the market value of the vehicle is correctly determined as at the commencement of each lease. A taxpayer is free to choose, based on valid and reasonable commercial reasons, whether to enter into an extended period lease, or enter into a shorter lease with the possibility of further leases, which may be decided upon as and when required. Further, on the basis of the description of “multi-lease products” in the Ruling, there is nothing which would be indicative of the lease documents constituting a sham. The Commissioner is therefore of the view that section GC 17 does not apply in relation to the Arrangement. 16 Section BG 1 Section BG 1 of the Act provides that a tax avoidance arrangement is void as against the Commissioner for income tax purposes, and that the Commissioner may counteract a tax advantage obtained by a person from or under a tax avoidance arrangement. Section CI 8 relevantly provides that “... nothing in the FBT rules shall be so construed as to include fringe benefit tax in the expressions ‘income tax’ or ‘tax’ for the purposes of ... the provisions listed in section OZ 1(3)(a) to (o) ...”. Of paragraphs (a) to (o) of section OZ 1(3), the only relevant paragraph for present purposes is paragraph (a), the provisions listed therein being “Part B, except for sections BB 3(2) and BH 1”. Accordingly, section CI 8 operates to preclude FBT from inclusion in the expressions “income tax” or “tax” for the purposes of section BG 1 (contained in Part B of the Act). Further, section OB 6(2) states that the term “income tax”, when used in the provisions listed in section OZ 1(3)(a) to (o), does not include the taxes specified in section OZ 1(3)(p) to (u) (paragraph (q), being the relevant paragraph for present purposes, lists “Fringe benefit tax”). Fringe benefit tax is specified in section OZ 1(3)(q), and, as noted above, the provisions listed in section OZ 1(3)(a) are “Part B, except for sections BB 3(2) and BH 1”, which includes section BG 1. The Commissioner is therefore satisfied that section BG 1 does not apply in relation to the Arrangement.

The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale or other disposition of land by a non-natural person where the land had been acquired or used for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by that person and where the sale or disposition would otherwise be subject to section CD 1(2)(e), or section CD 1(2)(f) and (g). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The words “the taxpayer’s spouse” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) do not restrict the meaning of “taxpayer” to natural persons. “Taxpayer” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) includes non-natural persons such as companies and trusts. Accordingly, the exemptions provided by section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) apply to a taxpayer that is a non-natural person if the other requirements of the exemptions are met. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 June 2004 for an indefinite period. 2 This Ruling is signed by me on the 10 th day of May 2004. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 04/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 04/04 (“the Ruling”). Background Amounts derived from certain sales or other dispositions of land that would otherwise be gross income under section CD 1(2), are subject to a number of exemptions. This Ruling considers whether the exemptions contained in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a), that are available in respect of sales of farm or agricultural land in certain circumstances, apply where the taxpayer disposing of the land is not a natural person. Legislation Section CD 1(4) states: Subsection (2)(e) shall not apply to any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in any case where— (a) The land was acquired by the taxpayer, and used or intended to be used— (i) By the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s spouse, or both of them; or .... Section CD 1(7) states: Subsection (2)(f) and (g) shall not apply to any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in any case where— (a) That land is a lot resulting from the division into 2 or more lots of a larger area of land which, immediately before that division, was occupied or used by the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s spouse, or both of them; and .... Application of the Legislation The meaning of the words “by the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) does not require the taxpayer to be a natural person. On a literal interpretation, by considering each alternative in section CD 1(4)(a) separately, a non-natural person taxpayer, e.g. a company, could 4 clearly come within the words: “The land was acquired by the taxpayer, and used ... by the taxpayer... principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer”. Alternatively however, it is possible for the reference to the “taxpayer’s spouse” to be interpreted as colouring the word “taxpayer” and limiting its meaning to natural persons. It is the Commissioner’s view that “taxpayer” as used in the exemptions is not restricted to natural persons. This interpretation is supported by the ordinary meaning of the words, and the legislative history of the exemptions. Prior to 1983, the exemptions only referred to “taxpayer”, and it was clear that a company or other non- natural persons could come within the exemptions. In 1983, the exemptions were amended to include taxpayers’ spouses. The intention at that stage was to extend the exemptions, rather than to narrow them to natural persons.
1 THE PROVISION OF BENEFITS BY THIRD PARTIES: FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) CONSEQUENCES—SECTION CI 2(1) PUBLIC RULING—BR Pub 04/05 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 2(1) and the definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of a benefit by an employee from a third party where there is an arrangement between the employer and the third party and where the benefit would be subject to FBT if it had been provided by the employer. The Arrangement does not include situations where the remuneration given by an employer to an employee is reduced due to a benefit being received from the third party, or otherwise takes the receipt of a benefit provided by a third party into account (including salary sacrifice situations). There cannot be any trade-off between the benefits provided and the remuneration that would otherwise have been received by the employee, or any difference between the remuneration levels of employees who receive benefits and those who do not. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of section CI 2(1), there will be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit to employees where: (a) consideration passes from the employer to the third party in respect of the benefit being provided; or (b) the employer requests (other than merely initiating contact), instructs, or directs, the third party to provide a benefit; or (c) there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party which (explicitly or implicitly) involves the threat or suggestion that the employer would withhold business or other benefits from the third party unless a benefit is provided to the employees; or 2 (d) the third party and the employer are associated parties, and there is a group policy (whether formal or informal), or any other agreement between the associated parties, that employees of the group will be entitled to receive benefits from the other companies in the group. • Provided that none of the above exists, there will not be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit to employees for the purposes of section CI 2(1) where: (a) there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that results in no more than: (i) the employer granting the third party access to the premises or work environment to discuss the benefit with employees; and/or (ii) agreement between the parties as to the level of benefit that is to be offered by the third party to employees; and/or (iii) the employer agreeing to advertise or make known the availability of the benefit; or (b) the employer has done no more than initiate contact or discussions with the third party; or (c) there is no significant contact between the employer and the third party. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 20 May 2004 until 19 May 2007 This Ruling is signed by me on the 20 th day of May 2004. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 04/05 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 04/05 (“the Ruling”). This Ruling relates to an issue arising in the context of Fringe Benefit Tax, and has been under preparation for some time. Fringe Benefit Tax is currently the subject of a Government review. It is not known whether section CI 2(1), as presently enacted, will be amended as a result of this review. The Commissioner has decided to issue this Ruling at this time, notwithstanding the current review of FBT, as he considers that it is still likely to be of assistance to taxpayers in any event. It is likely to be some time before any resulting legislation is enacted. The Commissioner notes that if section CI 2(1), or the law in relation to the provision of benefits by third parties, is amended as a result of this review or otherwise this Ruling may cease to apply from the date that legislation is effective. Background This Ruling arises from a number of private ruling applications that the Rulings Unit has considered. It considers the scope of section CI 2(1), and what will be an “arrangement” that falls within the scope of the section. Legislation Section CI 2(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. “Arrangement” is defined in section OB 1 to mean, unless the context otherwise requires: ...any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect: Application of the Legislation Liability for FBT Under section CI 1, an employer is liable to pay FBT on fringe benefits provided or granted to an employee by the employer. However, under section CI 2(1) an employer can be liable for FBT if the employer enters into an arrangement with 4 another person (the “third party”) for the provision of fringe benefits to the employer’s employees. Section CI 2(1) is an anti-avoidance provision. For it to have any application there must be an arrangement between the employer and the third party (the provider of the benefit), and that arrangement must provide for or grant a benefit to the employee of the employer entering into the arrangement. It is clear that section CI 2(1) applies where any form of consideration passes from the employer to the third party to compensate for, or is otherwise in relation to, the benefit provided by the third party to the employee. The wording of section CI 2(1) is very broad and seems to apply in a range of cases wider than this obvious one. The issue is: where there is no direct or indirect consideration (in any form) provided by the employer to the third party, in what circumstances will the provision apply? Conclusion on the application of the section It is concluded that section CI 2(1) will apply, as there will be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit, in each of the following situations: • Where consideration passes from the employer to the third party in respect of the benefit being provided; or • Where the employer requests (other than merely initiating contact), instructs, or directs, the third party to provide a benefit; or • Where there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party which (explicitly or implicitly) involves the threat or suggestion that the employer would withhold business or other benefits from the third party unless a benefit is provided to the employees; or • Where the third party and the employer are associated parties, and there is a group policy (whether formal or informal), or any other agreement between the associated parties, that employees of the group will be entitled to receive benefits from the other companies in the group. Provided that none of the above situations exists, it is concluded that there will not be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit, and section CI 2(1) will not apply, in the following situations: • Where there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that results in no more than: (i) the employer granting the third party access to the premises or work environment to discuss the benefit with employees; and/or (ii) agreement between the parties as to the level of benefit that is to be offered by the third party to employees; and/or (iii) the employer agreeing to advertise or make known the availability of the benefit; or • Where the employer has done no more than initiate contact or discussions with the third party; or • Where there is no significant contact between the employer and the third party. 5 What is meant by the term “arrangement”? The definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1 makes it clear that the term “arrangement” is very wide in its application, and that it encompasses not only legally binding contracts, but also even unenforceable understandings. It is clear that what is required for an arrangement to exist is less that that required for a binding contract. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (10 th Edition, 1999) defines the individual words referred to in the section OB 1 definition as follows: • “contract” – a written or spoken agreement intended to be enforceable by law. • “agreement” – a negotiated and typically legally binding arrangement. • “plan” – a detailed proposal for doing or achieving something. • “understanding” – an informal or unspoken agreement or arrangement. The above definitions show that the words used to describe an “arrangement” in section OB 1 form a sequence that descends in formality from a legally enforceable contract to a mere informal, unenforceable “understanding”. These words all appear to be slightly differing concepts, each one less strict than the previous term. The meaning of “arrangement” has been considered by the courts in a number of cases, and generally the cases have found that the term “arrangement” applies in a wide range of situations. The High Court of Australia in Bell v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 87 CLR 548, (1953) 10 ATD 164 considered the meaning of “arrangement” and, at page 573, stated: ...it may be said that the word “arrangement” is the third in a series which as regards comprehensiveness is an ascending series, and that the word extends beyond contracts and agreements so as to embrace all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or so as to produce a particular effect. The Privy Council in Newton and others v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1958\] 2 All ER 759 held (at page 763): Their Lordships are of opinion that the word “arrangement” is apt to describe something less than a binding contract or agreement, something in the nature of an understanding between two or more persons – a plan arranged between them which may not be enforceable at law. But it must in this section comprehend, not only the initial plan but also all the transactions by which it is carried into effect – all the transactions, that is, which have the effect of avoiding taxation, be they conveyances, transfers or anything else. This passage was quoted and applied by Eichelbaum J in the High Court decision in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,155. The Court of Appeal subsequently approved this. The Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the term “arrangement” in CIR v BNZ Investments (2001) 20 NZTC 17,103. The majority judgment of Richardson P and Keith and Tipping JJ was delivered by Richardson P. He stated, at page 17,116: 6 \[43\]...As did the former s108, s99 bites on an “arrangement made or entered into”. It presupposes there are two or more participants who enter into a contract or agreement or plan or understanding. They arrive at an understanding. They reach a consensus. ... \[50\]...In short, an arrangement involves a consensus, a meeting of minds between parties involving an expectation on the part of each that the other will act in a particular way. ...The essential thread is mutuality as to content. The meeting of minds embodies an expectation as to future conduct. There is consensus as to what is to be done. A number of other cases in the area of income tax avoidance are consistent with the comments made in the above case law. Besides income tax cases, some other case authorities on the meaning of “arrangement” in other statutory contexts are considered relevant by the Commissioner. The Court of Appeal in Re British Basic Slag Ltd’s Agreements \[1963\] 2 All ER 807, stated, at page 814: Though it may not be easy to put it into words, everybody knows what is meant by an arrangement between two or more parties. If the arrangement is intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings, as in the case where it is made for good consideration, it may no doubt properly be described as an agreement. But the statute clearly contemplates that there may be arrangements which are not enforceable by legal proceedings, but which create only moral obligations or obligations binding in honour...For when each of two or more parties intentionally arouses in the others an expectation that he will act in a certain way, it seems to me that he incurs at least a moral obligation to do so. An arrangement as so defined is therefore something “whereby the parties to it accept mutual rights and obligations”. In Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd (1980) 31 ALR 53, the Federal Court of Australia considered whether it was sufficient for an “arrangement” or “understanding” that only one party is under an inhibition in respect of his or her future conduct. The Court stated (at page 66): Unless there is reciprocity of commitment I do not readily see why the parties would come to an arrangement or understanding. Particularly is this so when it is remembered that the alleged parties to the agreement or understanding in the present case are two large companies. Presumably if they were to reach an understanding or arrangement each would have some commercial objective beneficial to itself in mind. I see no point in an arrangement bare of reciprocity. Although there is much force in the submissions on behalf of the respondents that it is difficult to imagine a practical example in trade or commerce of a party to an arrangement being subjected to a burden qua the other and that other being under no obligation himself, I incline to the view that there is no necessity for an element of mutual commitment between the parties to an arrangement or understanding such that each accepts an obligation qua the other; although in practice such cases would be rare. The Privy Council in New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields Ltd \[1991\] 1 NZLR 257 stated, at page 261: “Arrangement” is a perfectly ordinary English word and in the context of section 27 \[of the Commerce Act 1986\] involves no more than a meeting of minds between two or more persons, not amounting to a formal contract, but leading to an agreed course of action. 7 To summarise, the following principles or characteristics can be extracted from these cases on the meaning of “arrangement” in other statutory contexts than income tax to indicate when an “arrangement” exists: • A meeting of minds on an agreed course of action for a particular purpose (see New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields). • The parties to agree to mutual rights and obligations in respect of the course of action to be undertaken (see Re British Basic Slag Ltd’s Agreements). • An arrangement is unlikely to exist when only one party makes a commitment to the proposed course of action (see Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd). An “arrangement” encompasses various degrees of formality, and the case law in the areas of tax avoidance and competition law reinforces this conclusion. In the context of section CI 2(1), the term “arrangement” will include situations where the employer arranges with the third party to provide a benefit, where the employer agrees to allow the third party to approach the employees, or where the employer agrees to allow an employee to join a scheme promoted by the third party. In terms of the application to section CI 2(1), for there to be an “arrangement” which is caught under the section, it must be an arrangement “for” a benefit to be “provided” to an employee. This means that not every “arrangement” that exists between an employer and a third party will be caught by section CI 2(1). Similarly, not every instance where a benefit is provided to an employee by a person who is not their employer will be caught by the section. However, the arrangements that will be subject to FBT under section CI 2(1) will be limited by the requirement that it must also be “for” the provision of a “benefit” to an employee. What is the meaning of “for” as used in the section? The word “for” can have a wide variety of meanings depending on its context. The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 stated (at page 12,330): Reference to any standard dictionary brings home the wide variety of senses in which the preposition “for” may be employed. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed) identifies 11 separate categories of meaning and many distinct usages within particular categories. The discussion in the text extends over 9 columns in the dictionary. Again the Tasman Dictionary which as its name suggests is directed to Australian English and New Zealand English, lists 33 meanings of the word. The particular meaning intended necessarily hinges on the context in which the word is used and how it is used in that context. (Emphasis added) The use of the word “for” was interpreted in the case of Patrick Harrison & Co. v AG for Manitoba \[1967\] SCR 274 as imposing a purpose test. In this case, the Court held that “for the extraction of minerals” meant “with the object or purpose of extracting minerals”. 8 In G v CIR \[1961\] NZLR 994, McCarthy J held that the word “for” points to intention, which is similar to looking at a person’s purpose. At page 999, McCarthy J stated: “For” points to intention. ...the essential test as to whether a business exists is the intention of the taxpayer as evidenced by his conduct, and that the various tests discussed in the decided cases are merely tests to ascertain the existence of that intention. I think that it conforms with this approach to construe the word “for”, when considering a phrase such as “carried on for pecuniary profit” used in relation to an occupation, as importing intention. These cases show that in a number of statutory contexts the word “for” has been interpreted by the courts to mean “for the purpose” or “with the object of” something. It is noted that in this context, a person’s purpose is similar to looking at his or her intention. However, to determine the word’s meaning in the current section, it is necessary to look at the section’s wording. Section CI 2(1) states that “...the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided...”. Section CI 2(1) requires there to be an arrangement between the persons for the appropriate benefits to be provided or granted to the employees. The use of the term “for” in this context can only mean that the arrangement entered into is concerned with the provision of these benefits. That is to say that the “arrangement” must have been entered into “for” the provision of a benefit to an employee. In the Commissioner’s opinion, based on the case law and dictionary definitions, the “arrangement” entered into pursuant to section CI 2(1) must be “for the purpose” of providing the appropriate benefit to the employees, or “with the object” of providing the benefit. Does the section require consideration of the purpose of the “arrangement” or the purpose of a party to the arrangement? Two possible interpretations of this section result from the conclusion that the word “for” points to purpose. The first is that the section could mean that one, or both, of the parties to the “arrangement” (being the employer and the third party) have the purpose of providing a benefit to the employee. The other interpretation is that the purpose of the “arrangement” that has been entered into is to provide an employee with a benefit. The latter interpretation potentially requires an objective inquiry into the arrangement itself, as opposed to an inquiry as to the purpose of one or more individuals. The first interpretation above could be considered to be supported by the case law relating to what is now section CD 4, where the word “purpose” has been interpreted by the courts to mean the dominant purpose of the taxpayer (see, for example CIR v Walker \[1963\] NZLR 339). The second interpretation could be seen as being supported by the interpretation the courts have given to the phrase “tax avoidance arrangement” (as defined in section OB 1) in the context of section BG 1 and earlier corresponding provisions. The courts have held that in this context the test for purpose should be determined by looking at 9 the intended effect of the arrangement (see, for example, Newton v FC of T (1958) 11 ATD 442). In the context of section CI 2(1), it would appear that the better interpretation is to consider the purpose of the parties to the “arrangement” to determine if the “arrangement” was entered into for the provision of a benefit. The section could not logically be considered to be referring to the purpose of the “arrangement”. It would appear to be an unusual interpretation of the section to require consideration of the purpose of the “arrangement”, as section CI 2(1) does not actually include the word “purpose”. Therefore, the purpose of one or both of the parties needs to be looked at when considering whether the “arrangement” was entered into “for” the benefit to be provided. It may be argued that, as section CI 2(1) is an anti-avoidance provision, the test for purpose should be the same as that used in the general anti-avoidance provision, section BG 1. However, section CI 2(1) does not refer to the arrangement having a particular purpose or effect, as does the section OB 1 definition of “tax avoidance arrangement”. That definition refers to “its” purpose or effect, that is, the arrangement’s purpose or effect. Therefore, the word “for” in section CI 2(1) does not refer to the purpose of the “arrangement” itself, but to the purpose of one or both of the parties who have “entered into” the “arrangement”. This conclusion is reinforced by the use of the phrase “entered into” in section CI 2(1). The section requires that the employer and the third party have “entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be provided”. This indicates that the reason the “arrangement” was “entered into” by the parties to it must have been “for” the provision of a benefit. In other words, the parties’ “purpose” in entering into the “arrangement” must have been to provide a benefit. Therefore, the relevant purpose to be determined for the purposes of section CI 2(1) is that of one (or both) of the parties to the “arrangement”, and not the purpose of the “arrangement” itself. Whose “purpose” is relevant for section CI 2(1), the employer’s, the third party’s, or both? As previously mentioned, for section CI 2(1) to apply there must be an “arrangement” between the employer and a third party. It is therefore necessary to determine whose purpose must be considered when applying the section. When a benefit has been provided to an employee by a third party under an “arrangement”, section CI 2(1) imposes FBT liability on an employer as if the benefit had been provided by the employer. This implies that the “arrangement” between the employer and the third party must be one where it is appropriate for the employer to be liable for FBT. If the employer does not have the purpose of providing a benefit to the employee, then it would seem unfair, and illogical, to impose FBT liability. 10 Section CI 2(1) is an anti-avoidance provision. The prospective liability to tax is the employer’s (FBT), which liability the employer is seeking to avoid. The third party is not seeking to avoid tax liability because it has no prospective liability. At most, a third party would be a knowing assister in the employer’s avoidance. More likely perhaps, the third party, whatever the employer’s motivations, would be seeking to enter into commercial arm’s length dealings with an employer and employees ignorant of, or indifferent to, the employer’s tax liability. This suggests that, from a policy perspective, it might be expected that the employer’s, not the third party’s purpose, would be the more relevant. Also, it is likely that the third party will always have the requisite purpose of providing a benefit to an employee, whether this is determined objectively or subjectively, as the third party is the party that provides the benefit to the employee. If the purpose of the third party alone were considered, all benefits would appear to be caught under the section: an illogical interpretation of the section. It could be argued that the use of the words “entered into ... for” suggests that both parties must have the purpose of providing a benefit, as both parties must have “entered into” the “arrangement”. However, this interpretation would not seem entirely sensible, as the third party will most likely have this purpose, and the result would be no different from considering the employer’s purpose alone. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider the purpose of both parties, and the purpose of the employer alone should be considered. Therefore, the party to the “arrangement” whose purpose should be considered in determining whether section CI 2(1) applies, is the employer. Should the test to determine whether the employer has “entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided” be objective or subjective? The above conclusions combine to show that for an “arrangement” to be caught under section CI 2(1), the purpose of the employer must have been to provide the employee with a benefit. This part of the commentary considers whether the test to determine if the employer has entered into the arrangement for the purpose of providing a benefit should be a subjective or an objective one. A subjective approach requires consideration of the intention or motive of the parties in entering into the arrangement. In the current context, a subjective test will look at what the particular employer had in mind when the arrangement with the third party was entered into. An objective approach however may consider what a reasonable person in the position of the employer ought to have had in mind. Additionally, case law, particularly in the area of GST, indicates that the correct test for determining purpose is a mixed subjective/objective test, considering both subjective and objective factors in reaching a conclusion as to the taxpayer’s purpose. In a number of cases the courts have held that the test for purpose is dependent on the statutory context in which it is found (see, for example CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198). 11 It is therefore obvious that it is necessary to look closely at the wording of the section. Section CI 2(1) does not contain the word “purpose”. Section CI 2(1) requires that the employer and the third party have “entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided”. In the Commissioner’s view, section CI 2(1) requires consideration of the reason that the employer “entered into” the “arrangement” with the third party. This means that the test to determine the employer’s purpose in entering into the arrangement should be a subjective one, looking at the particular reasons that the employer had in mind. However, objective factors can be taken into account to aid in this interpretation. This approach could be seen as being supported by McCarthy J in G v CIR \[1961\] NZLR 994 where he held that the word “for” points to intention, clearly indicating a subjective approach. At page 999, McCarthy J stated: “For” points to intention. ...the essential test as to whether a business exists is the intention of the taxpayer as evidenced by his conduct, and that the various tests discussed in the decided cases are merely tests to ascertain the existence of that intention. I think that it conforms with this approach to construe the word “for”, when considering a phrase such as “carried on for pecuniary profit” used in relation to an occupation, as importing intention. Therefore, the test to determine the employer’s purpose is a subjective one looking at the intention of the employer, but objective factors should be considered to ensure that the employer’s stated purpose is honestly held. That is to say that for section CI 2(1) to apply, the reason that the employer entered into the arrangement must have been to provide a benefit to its employee. What test should be used to determine the employer’s purpose? This part of the commentary considers the appropriate test to be used in determining the purpose of the employer in entering into the “arrangement” with a third party. There is a spectrum of tests that could be used to determine the purpose of the employer in entering into the arrangement. At one end of the spectrum is a sole purpose test, which would require that the sole or only purpose of the employer in entering into the arrangement must be the provision of the benefit. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this would be an unduly restrictive test for section CI 2(1), as it would not apply in any situation where there was another purpose, no matter how secondary or minor. At the other end of the spectrum is the test that the section will apply if any of the purposes of the employer in entering into the arrangement is that the employee be provided with a benefit. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this is also not an appropriate test in the context of section CI 2(1), as the section would catch all benefits that were provided to employees if the employer had some form of arrangement with the third party, and the fact that the employees were receiving a benefit had crossed the employer’s mind when they entered into the arrangement with the third party. If the provision of the benefit is not a part of the arrangement between 12 the parties, but is truly incidental to the purpose of the employer, then the section should not apply. Between these two extremes are the dominant purpose test and the more than incidental purpose test. A dominant purpose test would require that the main reason for the employer entering into the arrangement be the provision of the benefit to the employee. This test would allow the employer to have other purposes in entering into the arrangement, but that, in order for the section to apply, the main purpose of the employer in entering into the “arrangement” needs to be the provision of a benefit. This test would also mean that if the employer had more than one purpose in entering into the “arrangement” and the provision of a benefit to employees was not the most important purpose, then section CI 2(1) would not apply. There are a number of cases that have determined that the word “purpose” used on its own in statutory language without any apparent qualifier means the dominant purpose of the taxpayer, for example, in relation to the third limb of section CD 4 (and predecessor provisions) and in relation to section 108 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (the former section BG 1). In the Commissioner’s opinion, there is no reason to conclude that section CI 2(1) requires a dominant purpose test. There is no indication on the words of section CI 2(1) that a dominant test is necessary. This can be contrasted with section CD 4, where the section clearly refers to the purpose. Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s opinion that it would not be appropriate to apply a dominant purpose test in determining whether section CI 2(1) applies. A more than incidental purpose test would be similar to the test contained in section BG 1, where, as long as the purpose of providing a benefit is more than incidental to any other purpose of the employer in entering into the “arrangement”, the section will apply. In the context of section CI 2(1), this means that if the provision of the benefit is incidental to other purposes of the “arrangement”, such as the provision of credit cards to employees, or obtaining a good package deal for the employer, then the section would not apply. The use of this test could be seen as being supported by the fact that section CI 2(1) is an anti-avoidance provision, and that it is appropriate to have a similar test as in other avoidance contexts. Alternatively, it could be argued that a more than incidental test is not appropriate, as the language of section BG 1 explicitly provides for the test of more than merely incidental in the legislation itself, whereas section CI 2(1) does not. Overall, it is the Commissioner’s opinion that this is the appropriate test to be adopted in interpreting section CI 2(1). This approach would mean that if the purpose of providing a benefit to the employees is no more than incidental to some other purpose of the employer in entering into the arrangement, the arrangement would not be caught within the section. A more than incidental test means that the purpose of the employer must be significant in order for the benefit to be caught within the section, but does not need to be the most important (or dominant) reason or purpose of the employer in entering into the “arrangement”. 13 In the Commissioner’s opinion, if an employer has more than one purpose when they enter into the “arrangement” with the third party, it is considered appropriate to exclude incidental purposes from section CI 2(1), but there is no reason why an employer with a significant, but not dominant, purpose of providing a benefit to employees should not be caught by the section. Therefore, to establish if section CI 2(1) applies, it is necessary to look at what the arrangement between the employer and the third party is for, and whether the provision of the benefit to employees is incidental to another purpose of the employer, or whether it is a separate, significant, purpose in its own right. If the provision of a benefit is no more than incidental to some other purpose of the employer in entering into the arrangement with the third party, then section CI 2(1) will not apply. It is noted that the relevant consideration is whether the purpose of the employer of providing a benefit to employees is incidental to another purpose of the employer, not whether the benefit received is incidental to the arrangement entered into. It is the purpose of the employer that is relevant, not the purpose of the arrangement. If the employer does not have a purpose of providing a benefit to employees (or the purpose is not more than incidental), section CI 2(1) will not apply to any benefit that may be provided by a third party. Which “arrangement” must be the one “for” the benefit? In most cases where a benefit is provided to an employee by a third party, there will be an “arrangement” between the employee and the third party that is “for” that benefit to be provided. It could be argued that because the arrangement between the third party and the employee may be “for” the benefit to be provided, then no matter what degree of negotiation or other interaction occurs, the third party/employer arrangement will not also be “for” the provision of a benefit unless consideration is provided to the third party by the employer. This argument focuses on which arrangement actually provides for the benefit to be provided. If the “arrangement” between the employer and the third party is not for a benefit, then section CI 2(1) will not apply. Any arrangement that may exist between the third party and the employee will be “for” a benefit, as it is the third party that must provide a benefit to the employee for the purposes of the section. Section CI 2(1) requires that the third party must be a person “with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided”. This does not require consideration of any arrangement that may exist between the third party and the employee. The fact there is an arrangement between the third party and the employee which is “for” the provision of a benefit, does not mean that it is not also possible for the employer to be party to that or another such arrangement. For there to be an “arrangement” between the employer and the third party “for” the provision of a benefit, in the Commissioner’s view, as a minimum, the employer 14 must request or instruct a third party to provide a benefit. When this has occurred, it is the Commissioner’s opinion that the subjective purpose of the employer in entering into the arrangement is to provide a benefit, and therefore the arrangement is “for” the provision of a benefit, as required by the section. The employer’s activity in requesting or instructing is, in the Commissioner’s view, a sufficient level of involvement or activity by the employer to make the employer/third party arrangement an arrangement that is “for” the benefit to be provided. The arrangement will obviously also be “for” the benefit to be provided where consideration passes between the employer and the third party. There appears to be no reason to conclude that merely because the arrangement between the third party and the employee is for the provision of a benefit, that it is not also possible for the employer to be party to that or another such arrangement. What is required for there to be a benefit to the employees? Under section CI 1, the definition of what amounts to a fringe benefit is very broad, and is intended to include all non-cash payments made by an employer to an employee in respect of their employment. However, it is not clear whether, given that section CI 2(1) is an anti-avoidance provision, what the employee receives from the third party needs to be a benefit that the employee would not usually be able to receive or if something else is needed. The issue arises of whether a benefit under section CI 2(1) must be something that the general public are unable to receive. In Case M9 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,069, Bathgate DJ held that the provision of the motor vehicle was subject to FBT and stated (at page 2,073) that: A benefit is often regarded as being given voluntarily, rather than compulsorily. A benefit may however be given under compulsion in some circumstances – Yates v Starkey \[1951\] 1 All ER 732...“Fringe benefits” are defined in s 336N(1) of that Act as the benefits “received or enjoyed”, in the sense that it is from the employee’s view they are to be considered a benefit, which is the object and purpose of such. In Case M59 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,339 Bathgate DJ stated (at page 2,343): Only the receipt or enjoyment occurred after FBT was imposed, but that was not sufficient, as that is only a part of a fringe benefit, and not the whole fringe benefit. By 31 March 1985 the objector had provided a benefit, although it was not enjoyed by B and C until after that date. That enjoyment however was not for the purposes of the Act a fringe benefit. Although the objectors would be taxable in that period after 1 April 1985, they were not subject to the tax because when the benefit was provided by them it was not chargeable to FBT. This means that there are two separate elements that must exist in order for there to be a “benefit” for FBT purposes: provision to the employee and enjoyment by that employee. Accordingly, for a benefit to exist under section CI 2(1), there must be both the provision of something by a third party who has entered into an arrangement with the employer to provide that benefit, and enjoyment by the employee. Accordingly, on the basis of the above cases, all that is necessary for there to be a benefit to an employee under section CI 2(1) is for the employee to receive, or be provided something by a third party, and to enjoy, or take advantage of, that thing. 15 There is no requirement that a fringe benefit must be something that the employee could not receive on his or her own account, or that the general public cannot receive provided that the requirements of the definition in section CI 1 are met and the benefit is provided in respect of the employment of the employee. This interpretation is supported by the scheme of the FBT rules. Section CI 1 defines the term “fringe benefit” very broadly. It is not necessary for the purposes of the FBT rules for the benefit to be something that the employee could not otherwise be able to receive or that the public is unable to receive. All that is required is that something needs to be provided to the employee that falls within the definition of “fringe benefit” in section CI 1. In the Commissioner’s opinion, this applies equally to section CI 2(1). If something is provided to the employee by a third party that would have been a fringe benefit had it been provided by the employer, it will be subject to FBT by virtue of section CI 2(1). Therefore, for there to be a benefit under section CI 2(1) all that is required is that a “fringe benefit” (as defined in section CI 1) is provided to the employee by a third party (in addition to regular salary or wages) pursuant to an arrangement between the employer and the third party for the provision of that thing, and the employee must take advantage of or use that thing. Meaning of “Provision” Another requirement of section CI 2(1) is that the arrangement be for the benefit to be so “provided”. For a benefit to be caught under section CI 2(1) it must have been provided to the employee by the third party. It is not sufficient that there is an “arrangement” between the parties that is merely for access to premises, the “arrangement” must be “for” the provision of a benefit for section CI 2(1) to apply. The Oxford English Dictionary (10 th Edition, 1999) defines the term “provide” as “make available for use; supply”. There have been a number of cases that discuss the meaning of the word “provide”. These cases show that the meaning of “provide” depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, in Ginty v Belmont Building Supplies Ltd \[1959\] 1 All ER 414, Pearson J stated, at page 422: I do not think that there is any hard and fast meaning of the word “provided”; it must depend on the circumstances of the case as to what is “provided” and how what is “provided” is going to be used. In Norris v Syndi Manufacturing Co Ltd \[1952\] 1 All ER 935, an employee had removed the safety guard from a machine in order to carry out tests. His employer was aware that the employee took the guard off to test the machine, and had told him to replace it “after testing and before operation”. The employee inadvertently injured himself while working without the guard one day. The Court of Appeal found that the guard had been “provided” by the employer, and that the duty to provide the guard did not require that the employer should have to order the workmen to use it. Romer LJ stated, at page 940: 16 The primary meaning of the word “provide” is to “furnish” or “supply”, and accordingly, on the plain, ordinary interpretation of s. 119 (1), a workman’s statutory obligation is to use safety devices which are furnished or supplied for his use by his employers. The meaning of “provide” has been considered by the Employment Court of New Zealand in Tranz Rail Ltd (T/A Interisland Line) v New Zealand Seafarers’ Union \[1996\] 1 ERNZ 216. In that case, the issue was whether a statutory requirement that the employer provide food and water to the seafarers meant that the employer had to provide them with free food and water, or just ensure facilities were available for the employees to have access to food and water. Colgan J, at page 227, stated: The applicant’s principal argument is that the plain words of the statute allow an employer of seafarers either to agree to provide food and water without cost to an employee or to do otherwise whether by negotiation as part of a collective employment contract or by the imposition of charges for such provisions. Ms Dyhrberg submitted that to achieve an interpretation as sought by the respondents, the Court would be required to add to the statutory words a phrase such as “without cost to such employees” or the like. Ms Dyhrberg submitted that the word “provide” means make available but no more. Counsel conceded that this interpretation would mean that an employer of seafarers would be entitled to charge an employee for water consumed, although stressed that such an outcome would be unlikely in any event. Ms Dyhrberg submitted that to “provide” is to provide the opportunity of having the appropriate supplies of food and water. I find however that in this context the natural and ordinary meaning of the word “provide” in relation to food and water on ships is to supply without cost to the recipient seafarer. The Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Pierce v FCT 98 ATC 2240, considered whether a car had been provided to an employee. At page 2247, the Tribunal stated: There is no reason why “provides” should not be given its ordinary English meaning, namely “to furnish or supply” (Macquarie Dictionary). In order for something to have been “provided” to an employee by a third party in the context of section CI 2(1), it must be supplied, furnished or made available to that employee. Conclusion on the scope of section CI 2(1) For an “arrangement” to fall within section CI 2(1), it is not necessary that consideration passes from the employer to the third party. The section will apply and FBT be payable where less has occurred. However, if consideration does pass between the employer and the third party in respect of the benefit, then the section will apply. For section CI 2(1) to apply, the “arrangement” between the employer and the third party must have been entered into by the employer “for” the benefit to be provided to the employee. The term “arrangement” is very wide in its application. The word “for” means that the relevant consideration is the subjective purpose of the employer in entering into the “arrangement”, and that the purpose of providing a benefit to employees must be more than incidental to some other purpose of the employer. The word “provide” means to supply, furnish or make available. 17 It is concluded that these requirements will be fulfilled, and that section CI 2(1) will apply in the following situations: • Where consideration passes from the employer to the third party in respect of the benefit being provided. • Where the employer requests (other than merely initiating contact), instructs or directs, the third party to provide a benefit. • Where there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party which (explicitly or implicitly) involves the threat or suggestion that the employer would withhold business or other benefits from the third party unless a benefit is provided to the employees. • Where the third party and the employer are associated parties, and there is a group policy (whether formal or informal), or any other agreement between the associated parties, that employees of the group will be entitled to receive benefits from the other companies in the group. It is noted that the Commissioner does not consider that all situations involving associated persons will necessarily fall within section CI 2(1). It is only in those situations where there is a group policy, or any other agreement between the associated parties, regarding the provision of benefits that the Commissioner considers that the section will apply. Provided that none of the above situations exists, it is concluded that section CI 2(1) will not apply in the following situations: • Where there is negotiation or discussion between the employer and the third party that results in no more than: (i) the employer granting the third party access to the premises or work environment to discuss the benefit with employees; and/or (ii) agreement between the parties as to the level of benefit that is to be offered by the third party to employees; and/or (iii) the employer agreeing to advertise or make known the availability of the benefit. • Where the employer has done no more that initiate contact or discussions with the third party. • Where there is no significant contact or arrangement between the employer and the third party. It is noted that a consequence of this conclusion may be that the employer is required to put into place systems to enable them to obtain the relevant information required to fulfil their FBT obligations. In the Commissioner’s opinion, where the employer is involved in the types of arrangement contemplated by the first four of the bullet points set out above, the employer will generally be in a sufficient relationship with the third party to obtain the information they require to fulfil their obligations. The onus is on employers who are involved in arrangements for the provision of benefits in any of these ways to ensure that they can do so (for example, by requiring this of the third party). Salary Sacrifice Situations 18 This Ruling does not consider or rule on the taxation implications of salary sacrifice situations. In the context of the Ruling, this would include situations where the remuneration given by an employer to an employee is reduced due to a benefit being received by the employee from the third party (or due to the possibility of a benefit being received), or where the remuneration of the employee otherwise takes the receipt of a benefit provided by a third party into account. It is considered that different considerations may apply to the tax treatment of such situations, for example, the benefit may have been provided by the employer in such a situation, or there may be other relevant aspects of the arrangement, and this Ruling has not considered the taxation implications of salary sacrifice situations. COMMENTS ON TECHNICAL SUBMISSIONS RECEIVED Submissions were received from a number of commentators that the conclusion reached in the previous draft ruling would lead to enforceability or workability problems in practice. These matters have been given serious consideration. It is the Commissioner’s opinion that the conclusions reached in this draft ruling should not generally give rise to unworkable or unenforceable results. If the circumstances referred to in the first four bullet points referred to in the draft ruling exist, it is considered that the employer will be in a sufficient position to require that systems be put into place to ensure that they have access to the relevant information required to fulfil their FBT obligations. Therefore, it is considered that the conclusions will not give rise to unworkable or unenforceable results. As noted previously, the onus is on employers who are involved in arrangements for the provision of benefits in any of these ways to ensure that they can obtain the necessary information (for example, by requiring this of the third party). One submission was received regarding the use of the FBT prescribed rate of interest in the examples. It was considered that this would mean that there would technically often be a benefit to employees, even if the interest rate offered was what was considered to be a market rate. This submission has also been given serious consideration. It is considered that this result is a consequence of the normal way in which the FBT rules operate, by prescribing a rate of interest to be used in determining the value of the benefit, and is not due to the conclusions reached in the draft ruling. We also received a number of comments regarding the interaction between section CI 2(1) and the FBT valuation provisions. However, these issues are outside the scope of this Ruling. EXAMPLES The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. These examples all assume that there has been no sacrifice of salary by the employee receiving the benefit. 19 Example 1 ABC Bank wishes to offer the employees of XYZ Ltd a low interest loan facility. ABC approaches XYZ, who agrees to ABC’s offer, and also agrees to pay ABC the difference between the interest rate offered to employees, and the current market interest rate. This is clearly subject to section CI 2(1), and FBT will be payable on the difference between the rate paid by XYZ’s employees and the FBT prescribed rate of interest. An “arrangement for” exists between ABC and XYZ, and the purpose of the employer is to allow the provision of a benefit to XYZ’s employees. This is evidenced by the fact that consideration has been passed between the employer and the third party in respect of the benefit being provided. Example 2 A credit card company approaches the manager of BCE, and asks whether BCE would allow them to approach BCE’s employees to offer them credit cards (for the employees’ personal use). The credit card company proposes that all staff members who choose to receive cards will be allowed to join the credit card company’s loyalty scheme (which has no joining fee, but is only available to selected cardholders). BCE agrees to this request, but suggests that the credit card company might wish to provide a slightly discounted interest rate to the employees, so that the offer does not waste the employees’ time. The credit card company agrees to this change. BCE provides no consideration to the credit card company. The credit card company is keen to secure BCE employees as customers and is happy to agree to offer the employees the additional benefits. Here, there is an “arrangement” between the employer and the third party. There is a meeting of minds, and that meeting of minds extends to future action. However, section CI 2(1) will not apply in this situation. The meeting of minds does not include the provision of a benefit, but merely allows the credit card company access to BCE’s employees to offer them a benefit. The main purpose of the employer in entering into the arrangement is to allow the credit card company to offer a benefit to their employees which will be of potential interest to the employees. The provision of a benefit, if it is a purpose of the employer, will be incidental to this. Therefore section CI 2(1) will not apply and no FBT will be payable on any benefit received by the employee from the credit card company. Example 3 A local retailer approaches MNO Ltd, and asks permission to display advertising brochures on MNO’s premises, and for MNO to place an advertisement on the company’s intranet. MNO agrees, after only a cursory inspection of the brochures and advertisement. MNO also agrees to allow the retailer to email interested staff with updated specials (staff are given the opportunity not to receive the email updates). The brochures, and subsequent emails, invite the employees to join a loyalty programme, which gives them the possibility of receiving rewards. 20 As above, there will be an “arrangement” between the employer and the third party, as there is consensus as to future action. However, the arrangement will not be “for” the provision of a benefit. The employer has only agreed to allow the third party access to its employees, and this is their main purpose in entering into the arrangement. Any purpose the employer may have of benefiting their employees is incidental to this purpose. The “arrangement” is “for” access to the employer’s premises or to allow the third party to communicate with the employees directly or by electronic means, not to provide a benefit to employees. Hence, section CI 2(1) will not apply, and no FBT will be payable on any reward received by an employee under the loyalty programme. Example 4 BB Ltd is a large company with a number of high net worth employees. BB contacts its Bank and requests that the Bank offer a low interest mortgage facility to the employees of BB, which also permits an employee to obtain a mortgage with a smaller deposit than would normally be required. BB believes that the Bank will agree to this request as BB has a lot of business with the Bank. Additionally, it is expected that the Bank will get a great deal of business from the employees of BB, as BB have told the Bank that they are aware of a reasonable number of staff members who would be interested in such a facility. The Bank is attracted by the level of business it may achieve with the employees, and is also keen to maintain the good relationship it has with BB, so puts together a proposal which it presents to BB. BB considers that the proposal is worthwhile, so asks the Bank to make the facility available to employees. BB also agrees to help promote the facility by putting up posters and making brochures available in the workplace, and also by sending an email to staff informing them of the facility. Here, there is an “arrangement” between BB and the Bank which is “for” the provision of a benefit to employees. There is a meeting of minds between the parties that extends to the provision of a benefit to employees. BB has not simply entered into the arrangement with the purpose of allowing the Bank access to the employees. Rather, BB has entered into the arrangement with a more than incidental purpose of providing employees with a benefit. This is evidenced by the fact that BB has an expectation that the Bank would comply with their request and because they are aware of a number of staff members who would be interested in the facility. Therefore section CI 2(1) will apply, and FBT will be payable on the difference between the interest rate paid by employees and the FBT prescribed rate of interest. Example 5 STU and VWX are both companies in the same group of companies. The group has a widely understood policy that all companies in the group will provide discounted products or services to all employees of companies in the group, although this policy has never been put into writing. STU therefore provides interested employees of VWX with discounts on their products. 21 Here, there will an “arrangement” for the provision of a benefit, and VWX will be liable to FBT on any benefits received by its employees from STU. There is a group policy that each company will provide the employees of the other companies in the group with benefits. Therefore, there is an understanding between the employer and the third party that each will act in a particular way, that understanding extending to the provision of a benefit, and the purpose of the policy is to allow employees to be provided with benefits by a third party. Therefore section CI 2(1) will apply. 22 Example 6 DFG, a travel agent, employs a number of staff, and enters into a scheme with YTR, an airline, to strengthen their relationship. The scheme involves YTR agreeing to give a certain number of free domestic flights per year to employees of DFG who excel in promoting and selling YTR flights. In return, DFG agrees to have their employees promote YTR flights, and convert flights to YTR wherever possible. In order to determine which employees are entitled to free flights, DFG awards its staff with points for outstanding customer service. Once a staff member has accumulated the required number of points, they are entitled to a free flight from YTR. There is no cost to DFG for those flights. Here, section CI 2(1) will apply. There is an “arrangement” between the parties, as there is a consensus between DFG and YTR that involves the provision of a benefit to employees. One of the main purposes of DFG in entering into the arrangement is to provide the staff with free flights. Although DFG have another significant purpose in entering into the arrangement, which is to strengthen their relationship, the purpose of providing a benefit to employees is not incidental to that purpose. Therefore, FBT will be payable by DFG on the value of the flights. Example 7 HJK is a large nationwide employer with a large number of staff. A Senior Manager of HJK approaches LMN, a nationwide chain of retail stores, and suggests that they may like to consider offering a discount to employees of HJK. LMN agree to consider this idea, and later decide to allow a 10% discount to all staff of HJK at all of their stores (this is achieved by providing all employees with a discount card). HJK does not give any consideration for this, has made no suggestion that they will do business with LMN themselves if a discount is permitted, and have not been involved in discussions as to the level of the discount, or any other details of the offer. LMN has decided to offer the employees the discount as they believe they will obtain a substantial amount of business. Section CI 2(1) would not apply in this situation. There is no “arrangement” between the parties that encompasses the provision of the benefit, as the only consensus as to future action is that LMN agreed to consider the idea. HJK has done no more than initiate discussions with LMN, and the decision to offer a benefit to employees was made unilaterally by LMN. Although the purpose of HJK could be argued to be the provision of a benefit, there is no “arrangement” with LMN that is “for” such provision. Example 8 An employee works for a company. She obtains a personal credit card and joins its associated points reward scheme. Under that scheme she can accumulate points as goods and services are charged on the credit card. After the employee accumulates 10,000 points, she can transfer those points, at her option, to any one of a number of airlines’ Frequent Flyer Schemes affiliated to the credit card company’s points reward 23 scheme. Once she accumulates a specified number of points on the airline Frequent Flyer Scheme, she can exchange them for free or discounted travel. In the course of her work she incurs a number of employment related charges on the credit card as well as private expenditure. The employee accumulates points on the credit card points reward scheme for both types of expenditure. She very soon reaches the specified threshold of points, and transfers them to a particular airline’s Frequent Flyer Scheme, exchanging them for a free trip to Fiji. The company does not have an FBT liability, as section CI 2(1) will not apply. The receipt of the points under the credit card company’s points reward scheme is because of the contractual arrangement between the credit card company and the employee. No arrangement exists between the employer and the credit card company to provide the employee with entitlements under its points reward scheme or the associated airline’s Frequent Flyer Scheme. It does not matter that some of the points that give the entitlement result from employment related expenditure. Example 9 The following year the employee obtains promotion in the company and receives a corporate charge card on which she is specified as the cardholder. The charge card is from a different company to that which issued her personal cards. This particular charge card company also allows cardholders to join in its points reward scheme. The employee joins as an individual member and pays the membership fee personally. The employee’s employer is not involved in encouraging the employee to join the scheme. This scheme also allows an accumulation of points as goods and services are charged on the card and a transfer of points, subject to certain conditions, to a participating airline Frequent Flyer Scheme. Section CI 2(1) will not apply to this example and the employer does not have an FBT liability on any entitlement received by the employee under the credit card company’s points reward scheme. There is no arrangement between the employer and the credit card company to provide entitlements to the employee under the points reward scheme. The employee receives those entitlements because of her contractual relationship with the credit card company. Example 10 QRS is an employer, and wants to purchase a number of motor vehicles for use in their business. The company approaches a motor vehicle dealer and negotiates a discount on the vehicles it purchases. QRS tells the dealer that it has a substantial number of employees who would like to purchase vehicles, and who it expects would be induced to buy them from the dealer if they were offered the same discount. The dealer agrees that it will offer the employees the same discount if they wish to buy vehicles from it. Here, the employer has requested that the dealer provide their employees with a discount on any vehicles purchased. There is an arrangement between the third party and the employer that is for the provision of a benefit. Although the dominant 24 purpose of the employer may be to obtain a benefit for themselves, the purpose of the employer in asking the dealer to offer the same discount to their employees could not be said to flow from this purpose. Therefore a more than incidental purpose of the employer in entering into the Arrangement is the provision of a benefit, and the section will apply.
1 TRADING STOCK—TAX TREATMENT OF SALES AND AGREEMENTS TO SELL PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 04/06 ———————————————————————————————————— Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 98/8 previously published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 1 (January 1999). BR Pub 04/06 applies from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2008. BR Pub 98/8 applied until the end of the 2002 income year. ———————————————————————————————————— This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3, FB 3, and OB 1 (definition of “trading stock”) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to sales and dispositions of property (including contracts of sale of, and agreements to sell property) that is part of the trading stock of a business owned or carried on by the vendor. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • When stock is sold in the ordinary course of business, section CD 3 applies to include within gross income, amounts that are “derived” from that sale. For these purposes, such derivation occurs when the income is earned, being when a legally enforceable debt arises, or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises. • If trading stock is sold outside the ordinary course of business, and/or together with any other assets of the business (whether the whole of the business or only a part of the business), section FB 3 applies to include within gross income for that year, all amounts received from the sale or disposition of that trading stock, or as the case may be, the price at which the Act deems the trading stock to have been realised. The date of sale or disposition differs, depending on whether a clearly expressed intention of 2 the parties exists as to when property in the goods is to pass: • If a clearly expressed intention of the parties as to the time of passing of property is evident from the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case, the date of sale or disposition will be the date the parties intended property in the goods to pass. • If no clearly expressed intention as to the time of passing of property can be determined, the date of sale or disposition will be determined according to the appropriate statutory presumption contained in section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908. In short: • If there is an unconditional contract for goods that are specific and in a deliverable state - the date the contract becomes unconditional. • If the vendor must do something to make such goods deliverable - the date such action is completed, and the buyer is notified. • If the vendor must weigh, measure, or test such goods in order to ascertain the selling price - the date such action is completed and the buyer is notified. • If goods are delivered to a buyer on “sale or return” or similar terms - the time at which the buyer signifies his or her approval or retains the goods without notifying rejection within an agreed or reasonable timeframe. • If unascertained or future goods are sold by description - when the goods are in a deliverable state and unconditionally appropriated to the contract by either party with the assent of the other. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 April 2003 until 31 March 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 27 th day of May 2004. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 04/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 04/06. Background Where the trading stock of a business is being sold or disposed of, there has been some confusion about the point in time when the consideration is to be included in gross income. The confusion centres on whether the proceeds from the sale or disposal of trading stock should be included in gross income when delivery and payment occurs, or upon the sale and purchase agreement becoming unconditional. Inland Revenue became aware of this issue in the context of livestock sales, but the legal principles which determine this issue are applicable to trading stock per se and this public ruling applies to all trading stock. Further confusion arose in terms of the question of whether section CD 3 or FB 3 applied to sales of trading stock made in the ordinary course of business. In order to address the question, it has been necessary to look at the history of the sections, case law, and general principles of contract law as well as the effect of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 on contracts of sale of property. Legislation Part EE of the Act ensures that the value of trading stock at the beginning and end of the income year is taken into account when calculating the income of a business for tax purposes. Section CD 3 states: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section FB 3 states: Where in any income year the whole or any part of the assets of a business owned or carried on by any taxpayer is sold or otherwise disposed of (whether by way of exchange, or gift, or distribution in terms of a will or on an intestacy, or otherwise, and whether or not in the ordinary course of the business of the taxpayer or for the purpose of putting an end to that business or any part of it), and the assets sold or otherwise disposed of consist of or include any trading stock, the consideration received or receivable for the trading stock or, as the case may be, the price which under this Act the trading stock is deemed to have realised shall be taken into account in determining the taxpayer’s gross income for that year, and the person acquiring the trading stock shall, for the purpose of calculating the person’s taxable income for that year or for any subsequent income year, be deemed to have purchased it at the amount of that consideration or price. This section 4 shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in any case where a share or interest in any trading stock is sold or otherwise disposed of by any taxpayer. “Trading stock” is defined in section OB 1. It is defined slightly differently for the purposes of different sections of the Act, and over time. However, for the purposes of this discussion, it is sufficient to state that it includes anything produced or manufactured, anything held for sale or exchange, and livestock, but that it does not include land or financial arrangements to which the accrual rules apply. Application of the legislation and case law Which section applies? Section CD 3 includes within gross income amounts derived from any business. If sales of trading stock occurred in the ordinary course of business, it would be expected that section CD 3 would apply to include such amounts within gross income. However, a broad and literal interpretation of section FB 3 would include amounts received from the sale of trading stock, whether or not the sale occurred in the ordinary course of business. In order to resolve this apparent inconsistency, it is necessary to examine the history and interpretation of the sections and their overseas equivalents. History of section FB 3 Section FB 3 was introduced in 1939 as part of a whole stock sub-code. It was acknowledged by the Hon. Mr Nash (recorded in NZ Parliamentary Debates Vol 256, 1939: 537) that the whole of the sub-code followed, to a large extent, the procedure adopted in Australia. However, the equivalent Australian subsection was explicit that it applied only to sales that were not made in the ordinary course of business. By expressly including the extra words in the New Zealand subsection, it must be presumed that Parliament had intended to address every possible existing and future mischief. Prior to 1939, there was no stock sub-code in the Act, and the forerunner to section CD 3 operated to tax proceeds from the sale of trading stock. The case of Commissioner of Taxes v Doughty \[1926\] NZLR 279 dealt with a single sale of stock (soft goods and drapery) when assets were moved from a partnership into a company vehicle. The Court of Appeal held that a profit derived from the sale of trading stock was assessable to tax, regardless of whether the stock was sold in the ordinary course of business or in a wind-up of the business, relying for support on Anson v Commissioner of Taxes \[1922\] NZLR 330. The Privy Council reversed the decision and said the sale was a result of a “slump market” and this was the sale of the whole business unit, which must be distinguished and certainly was not a sale made in the course of the taxpayer's business. Accordingly, the increase in the value of stock sold was not subject 5 to tax. In 1924 (after the Doughty case had been brought to the Commissioner's attention, but before the Court of Appeal decision had been given), an amendment was made to (then) section 79(1)(a) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923, which included within assessable income “all profits or gains derived from any business”. The words added to the precursor to the current section CD 3 were “including any increase in the value of stock in hand at the time of transfer or sale of the business...”. The additional sentence remained in place long after the enactment of the precursor to section FB 3 in 1939. It appears that the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” included within section FB 3 had been included to prevent the section being circumvented, and to ensure that income from the sale of trading stock was always taxed, regardless of how it was effected. No consideration appears to have been given to the overlap between the application of the two sections. Interpretation of section FB 3 In Hansen and Ors v CIR \[1972\] NZLR 193, it was held by the Court of Appeal that the precursor to section FB 4 (which deals with apportioning the consideration attributable to trading stock where such trading stock is sold together with other assets) could be used to permit the Commissioner to calculate the value of stock sold along with any other assets of the business, whether or not the overall purchase price agreed to by the parties specifically attributed an amount to the stock value. Haslam J discussed the history of the introduction of the “stock sub-code” and also subsequent changes to what are now sections FB 3 and FB 4. At page 205, he stated that: ... the Legislature intended that sections 98 to 102 inclusive should constitute a sub code for dealing with liability for taxation when trading stock (including livestock) is disposed of with other assets. (emphasis added). Whilst the conclusion reached by Haslam J is practically workable, and would clarify the inter-relationship between sections CD 3 and FB 3, it does not necessarily reconcile with a literal interpretation of section FB 3. Even if the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” are read down, the section applies even where “... the whole or any part of the assets of the business ... \[that are\] sold or otherwise disposed of consist of or include trading stock”. Therefore, the section will apply where the assets consist solely of trading stock, and there is no requirement that they be sold along with different assets. What is required, however, is that the “whole or any part of the assets of a business” have been sold or disposed of. This appears to require more than merely the sale of individual items of trading stock in the ordinary course of business. It suggests that the section applies to larger transactions involving other assets, and/or multiple items of trading stock where the sale is more akin to the sale or disposal of a group of business assets. Whilst trading stock is technically an asset of the business, ordinary English language usage would not normally see the ordinary sale of an individual item of trading stock 6 described as a disposal of “part of the assets of a business”. In addition, it is relevant to note that the current structure of the Act clearly indicates that Part F deals with apportionment and re-characterisation of transactions. Such heading and structure of the Act imply that the section should not operate for sales of stock made in the ordinary course of business, but rather in more involved fact situations or where the Act treats transactions in a special way. Section AA 3(1) states that the meaning of a provision is to be found by reading the words in context and in light of the way that the Act is organised. The better view is that section FB 3 does not apply to normal sales of trading stock made in the ordinary course of business, and applies only where the whole, or part, of the assets of a business are sold (whether the trading stock is sold along with other assets, or a group of trading stock items are the only items sold). It is inherent in such a view that the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” are included in the section to effect the intent of Parliament that the section should not be rendered inapplicable by means of a taxpayer seeking to argue that it is in the ordinary course of their business to effect such compound sales. Such a conclusion arguably requires a degree of reading down of those words, but results in a workable operation of the Act, and seems to reflect the Parliament's intention. The result is that section CD 3 should apply to include within gross income all amounts derived from the sale of trading stock in the ordinary course of business, unless the trading stock is sold together with other items of trading stock, or assets of the business itself, in a way that suggests that (the whole or) a part of the business is being disposed of. Section FB 3 will apply to include within gross income the value of trading stock sold or disposed of outside of the ordinary course of the business operations, or along with other assets of the business in such a way. Specific instances when section FB 3 will operate will include instances where large blocks of different types of stock are sold to a purchaser, a part of the business is sold, or the entire business is sold by the owner. When determining the timing of gross income from stock sales, it will be important to ascertain which section applies. Section CD 3 includes proceeds from the sale of trading stock at the point in time they are “derived”. Section FB 3 includes such proceeds at the point in time the trading stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of”. This distinction can arguably be explained by the fact that ordinary derivation rules are to apply if usual trading stock sales occur in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business. If the circumstances are otherwise, however, the Act may be seen to be “tightening” the test of the time of assessability. When amounts from the sale of trading stock are “derived” Section CD 3 operates to include within gross income amounts from the sale of trading 7 stock sold in the ordinary course of business. It is settled law that the timing of derivation and the method of accounting “should be that which is calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer’s true income”. (C of T (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited (1938) 63 CLR 108 (Carden’s Case); CIR v Philips (NV) Gloeilampenfabrieken \[1955\] NZLR 868; CIR v Farmers Trading Company Limited (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200). It is also settled law that the word “derived” means more than merely received. It connotes the source or origin rather than the fund or place from which the income was taken, and means flowing, springing, or emanating from, or accruing (Philips). There are also established principles that in calculating income the method adopted should give the correct reflex of the taxpayer’s income. For most business taxpayers the most appropriate method will be the accrual method of accounting. This means income could be derived even if payment has not yet been received, or a bill even rendered. The general principle is that income is “derived” when it is earned, and has “come home” to the taxpayer. This will be the point at which a legally enforceable debt arises, or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises. In looking at whether a debt has been created, case law tends to show that this is in effect a two-stage enquiry. The first stage is to ascertain whether the parties have agreed, or a statute has imposed a requirement, as to when a debt is created. When this is clear, for the purposes of income tax, the income in question is considered to have been derived at that time. If there is no such agreement between the parties or statutory imposition, it is necessary to look at the general law to determine when a debt is created and thus when the income is derived. The leading New Zealand case on derivation is CIR v Farmers Trading Company Ltd (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200. This case dealt with the question of when business profits were derived from trading stock sold when the company made “budget” sales (where the customer paid the purchase price over a period of five months by way of monthly instalments). It was held that such sales were fundamentally different to hire purchase sales because the title and the property passed with the possession of the goods, and the vendor could only sue for outstanding instalments. It was held that the business profits were derived when the stock was sold and a debt in favour of the vendor was created. Richardson J (as he then was), cited Carden's Case with approval and, in particular, he restated that “the foundation of the accruals system is the view that the accounts should show at once the liabilities incurred and the revenue earned, independently of the date when payment is made or becomes due.” At page 61,208, his Honour stated: The real question in this case is when trading profits are derived. Where a sale is made in the course of trade during the year any profit on sale must be recognised. That involves having regard to the debt arising in favour of the vendor and bringing it into account if it is practicable to do so. ... On sale of trading stock a debt arises in favour of the vendor. The stock leaves his account and prima facie the debt for which it was exchanged should be brought into account in its place. It is implicit in the legislation that trading debts cannot be ignored in the calculation of business profits 8 and must be brought into account on a proper basis if that is feasible. ... \[T\]here may be no realistic way to reflect the debts in the trader’s account. But in principle debts arising from sale of trading stock during an income year must be recognised in arriving at the profits derived in that year. The Australian case of J Rowe and Son Pty. Ltd v FCT 71 ATC 4157 is consistent with the principles expressed in Farmers Trading. In this case the Full Court of the High Court considered when income was derived from the sale of stock by a retailer of household goods, in circumstances where the goods were purchased by customers but to be paid for by periodic instalments over an agreed term of 12 months or more. The sum to be paid was equal to the cash price plus 11% interest per annum, and the taxpayer included in assessable income returned for each year only the instalments received or receivable in that year. The Court held that for tax purposes a trader’s income is derived when it is earned, even though not received. The “profit emerging” method was considered inappropriate and the full cash price of the stock was considered earned and therefore derived during the year of the sale contract. Gibbs J stated at page 4,160: I agree that for taxation, as well as for business purposes, income of a trading business is derived when it is earned and the receipt of what is earned is not necessary to bring the proceeds of sale into account ... The method adopted should be that which is ‘calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer’s true income: Carden’s case.’ In delivering the majority judgment, Menzies J stated, at pages 4,158 and 4,159: It is implicit in the foregoing provisions that the proceeds of any sale of stock in the ordinary course of business will be brought into account in the year in which it is sold ... In a system of annual accounting, ordinary business considerations would indicate that what becomes owing to a company for trading stock sold during a year should, in some way, be brought into account to balance the reduction of trading stock which the transaction affects. Any other method of accounting would lead to a misrepresentation of the trader's financial position. ... Acceptance of the taxpayer’s contention \[that income was derived only when instalments were due and receivable\] would, of course, largely destroy the accepted basis for the taxation of most trading and business concerns. The general principle that income is derived when it is earned, and that such time will be when there is an entitlement to payment or a legally enforceable debt, was also applied in Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,226. In that case Richardson P delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal which essentially agreed with Goddard J’s conclusion in the High Court that the taxpayer’s income was derived at the contemporaneous point in time the electricity was supplied by the taxpayer and consumed by its customers. The Court of Appeal considered that the income earning process was complete on supply and sale of the electricity to the consumer. 9 Sales of land Section OB 1 provides that generally, land is not considered to be trading stock, however the definition also states that in limited circumstances (sections EE 19, FF 13, GD 1 and GD 2 when any amount derived from the sale or disposal would be gross income to which sections CD 1 applies) land may be trading stock. If a particular sale of land was within these provisions it would be considered for those purposes to be trading stock and therefore the ruling it may be applicable if it was unclear from the contract when the sale or disposal was to take place. Although land is not generally trading stock as defined in section OB 1 (or subject to the Sale of Goods Act), it is worth noting that the same general principles in relation to derivation apply to the sale of land, or where the contract is otherwise an executory contract. However, although the applicable derivation principles are the same for land as for other property, the exact timing of when income is earned and a legally enforceable debt arises may be different. The difference will arise where the contract has an executory nature, and the vendor is not legally entitled to sue for the purchase price until after settlement. For a more in-depth discussion of the principles of derivation in relation to “sales of land by business taxpayers who provide vendor finance” and the case of Gasparin v FCT (1994) 94 ATC 4,280, refer to the QWBA of this title which was published in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 5 (June 2004). The case of Gasparin v FCT (1994) 94 ATC 4,280 specifically addressed the question of when income from the sale of the land was “derived”. In delivering the judgment of the Full Federal Court, von Doussa J concluded that ordinary derivation principles applied, but on the facts of the case, a legally enforceable debt did not arise until the date of settlement and conveyance (when the executory contract was executed). Before this date, the vendor merely had a right to sue for specific performance of the contract, but not for the debt itself. His Honour stated that there was no difference between the sale of land or other executory contracts, and the sale of retail goods, in terms of the principles that apply to the question of derivation for tax purposes. He was satisfied that income is derived when it is earned and a debt is due, according to ordinary principles. The difference in the timing of derivation that occurred for the land in that case, compared to a sale of other goods, was caused by the fact that title did not pass to the purchaser, and there was no legal right for the vendor to sue for a debt prior to the settlement/conveyance. Because that was the only point at which a legal debt arose, derivation did not occur until that time. Von Doussa J also pointed out that his conclusions were consistent with judicial “sign posts” on derivation principles, such as Barratt v FCT (1992) 92 ATC 4,275, Farnsworth v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 504, Henderson v FCT (1970) 70 ATC 4,016 and FCT v Australian Gas Light Co (1983) 83 ATC 4,800. 10 It must be remembered however, that the facts of each case need to be examined, rather than assuming all executory contracts will automatically result in derivation occurring on settlement. If the facts of a case clearly show an earlier debt (rather than being able to sue for specific performance) and/or passing of property, the time of derivation will be earlier. 11 When stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” The question of when stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” becomes important when considering section FB 3, where stock is sold along with other assets of the business. This is a different question to when income is "derived". Sale of Goods Act 1908 The phrase “sold or otherwise disposed of”, as used in section FB 3, is not specifically defined for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, but some guidance is provided by case law and the Sale of Goods Act 1908 (“SGA”), which indicate that a sale of goods occurs when property in those goods passes to the purchaser. Although section 2 of the SGA states that “ ‘contract of sale’ includes an agreement to sell as well as a sale”, section 3 of that Act recognises a distinction between a “contract of sale of goods” and an “agreement to sell”. There is a “contract of sale of goods” when a seller agrees to transfer property in the goods for a consideration called the “price”. A sale is effected once the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer. In contrast, there is an “agreement to sell” when the transfer of property in the goods is to take place either at some future time or is subject to the fulfilment of some condition. A sale is effected either when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled. When property passes depends on whether the goods are specific or unascertained. The term “unascertained goods” is not defined in the SGA, but Butterworths Commercial Law in New Zealand (Borrowdale 3 ed, Butterworths) states at Chapter 12.3: ... it is clear that unascertained goods are goods which are not identified and agreed on at all. Unascertained goods become ascertained goods once they are identified and agreed on in accordance with the contract. Under section 18 of the SGA, no property is transferred in unascertained goods unless and until the goods are ascertained. Goods may be unascertained because they are generic goods sold by description (Re Gold Corp Exchange Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 385) or because they are not yet severed from part of a larger bulk (Re Wait \[1927\] 1 Ch 606). Specific goods are defined in section 2(1) of the SGA as “goods identified and agreed on at the time a contract of sale is made”. (a) The timing when the parties agree Section 19(1) and (2) of the SGA provide that property in specific goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intended to be transferred, and that when ascertaining the intention of the parties regard should be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the circumstances of the case. Accordingly, any explicit intention of the parties as to when property in the goods passes will be recognised as the date the sale occurs. 12 (b) The timing when the parties’ agreement is not evident However, in situations where the parties have either not formed an intention as to when property shall pass, or have not clearly expressed their intention, section 20 of the SGA sets out five rules for determining the moment when the property in the goods will be deemed to have passed from a seller to the buyer. Which rule applies depends upon such factors as whether the contract is for the sale of specific or unascertained goods, or the seller is bound to do something to the goods. For the purposes of this discussion, rule 1 in section 20 is considered the most relevant (and common). Section 20 states: Unless a different intention appears, the following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer: Rule 1. Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods, in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or both, is postponed. Rule 2. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the seller is bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof. Rule 3. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test, or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof. Rule 4. Where goods are delivered to the buyer on approval, or “on sale or return” or other similar terms, the property therein passes to the buyer – (a) When he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller, or does any other act adopting the transaction: (b) If he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the seller, but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection then, if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the expiration of such time, and if no time has been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact. Rule 5. (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made. (2) Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract. Date of sale for section FB 3 The general principle is therefore that the date of sale occurs when property in the goods 13 passes. When an express intention of the parties can be ascertained as to when property passes, that will be the date of sale. If no intention is expressed or can be ascertained, the date of sale will be ascertained according to the statutory rules/presumptions contained in section 20 of the SGA, (commonly the date an unconditional contract exists). This general approach has also been upheld in tax cases. Case law While there is no New Zealand case law on the effect of the SGA on section FB 3, the Australian Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review referred to the Australian Sale of Goods Act when deciding in Case 18 (1946) 12 CTBR 120 that property had been disposed of by way of sale when the contract became unconditional. The issue in Case 18 was whether the taxpayer’s property had for the purposes of section 36(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 been “disposed of by sale or otherwise howsoever...”. The Chairman of the Board of Review noted in relation to the sale of goods at page 125: The ownership of the goods will be transferred by the contract itself (in which case, the contract is the sale) if the parties express that intention but where the parties form no intention as to the time when the property is to pass, or fail to express their intention, the time when the property passes is determined by certain statutory presumptions. Of these presumptions the only one which deems the property in the goods to pass when the contract is made arises where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state. In view of these principles (... and most which are embodied in the Sale of Goods Act) it appears to me to be quite clear that the property in the goods which were included in the assets which where the subject of the contract under consideration did not pass from the taxpayer to the purchasers until 25 August 1943, when the last of the three necessary consents was given. The similarity of the SGA legislation in Australia and New Zealand (reflecting their common UK origins), coupled with the fact that the trading stock provisions in the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are very similar both in their treatment of trading stock and the wording in section 36(1), are factors which make Case 18 relevant, and good law in New Zealand on this particular issue. A similar result was arrived at in the context of when a sale of land had taken place, in Mills v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,025 when the High Court held that for a sale of land to take place there must be an unconditional agreement for the sale of the land. This principle was also upheld in Case K60 (1988) 10 NZTC 487. In Hansen v CIR \[1972\] NZLR 193, the Court considered the precursor to section FB 4 and whether the Commissioner could calculate the value of stock sold along with the other assets of the business, regardless of an overall price having been agreed to by the parties in relation to the stock value. Of interest to this discussion, the Court gave effect to the intentions of the parties in relation to when property in the livestock passed. In that case, prior to settlement the purchaser was not permitted to shear the sheep which were the stock of the business, and as such there was an implied lack of property in the sheep until that date. The Court concluded that settlement date was the appropriate date to value 14 the sheep for the purposes of calculating their sale price, as that was clearly the date the parties intended property in the sheep to pass to the purchaser, and so that was the date on which they were sold. Whilst the SGA determines when there is a sale of personal property in New Zealand, the same principles have been applied to real property in the above cases. Accordingly, for the purposes of section FB 3 trading stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” when property in the goods passes. This will occur when the parties intend property to pass, where an express intention can be ascertained. If no intention can be ascertained, the statutory presumptions contained in Rules 1 to 5 of section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act will determine when property passes, and therefore when a sale or other disposition occurs. When a contract is unconditional As Rule 1 will often be relevant, it is important to understand when a contract becomes unconditional. An unconditional contract is a contract that is not subject to a condition precedent. The contract may still be subject to a condition subsequent, but this will not prevent the contract from being unconditional. “Condition precedent” is a legal term for those conditions in a contract which suspend a contract until a specified event has occurred. A common example of a condition precedent is a contract that is subject to finance. In other words, the contract will be suspended until the buyer has advised the seller that he or she has obtained the necessary finance. A “condition precedent” is to be contrasted with a “condition subsequent”, which is a condition which can either bring a binding contract to an end (either totally or only partially) or entitle a party to damages. A common example of a condition subsequent is a contract that entitles a buyer to return dairy cattle if they prove not to be eczema free or sound on delivery. An unconditional contract can still be subject to conditions subsequent. The Courts of New Zealand have sought to establish the intentions of the parties to the contract to ascertain whether it was intended that the condition be one which needed to occur prior to the contract coming into existence (a condition precedent) or whether the condition was one which was to occur after the contract came into existence i.e. (a condition subsequent). The Court of Appeal in Hunt v Wilson \[1978\] 2 NZLR 261 was reluctant to simply rely on the labels “conditions precedent” and “condition subsequent”, and instead considered that it was necessary to look at the parties to the contract to ascertain whether or not a contract has come into existence. The accrual rules The ruling does not consider any potential operation of the accrual rules where the 15 arrangement attracts the operation of those provisions. This may occur when settlement is scheduled to take place more than 63 days from the date an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into, or if there is a trade credit debt permitting payment more than 63 days after the supply of the trading stock or date of a periodic invoice. In either case the arrangement will not be a “excepted financial arrangement”. If the accrual rules do apply, the approach in the ruling will apply in relation to the consideration that is effectively attributed by the Act to the property sold (as distinct from any deemed financial arrangement income or expenditure that arises by virtue of section EH 1 (Division One) or sections EH 33-36 (Division Two)). Examples Example 1 A customer enters a sporting goods store and purchases a tennis racquet, which comes with a 30 day money-back guarantee if not completely satisfied. The customer pays by cheque. The income from the sale is derived by the store in terms of section CD 3 on the day the customer enters the store and purchases the tennis racquet. The tennis racquet is sold in the ordinary course of business, and at that point the income has been earned (and therefore derived), regardless of whether the cheque is subsequently dishonoured or the customer returns at a later date seeking a refund under the guarantee. Example 2 A large appliance store and a purchaser sign a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of a refrigerator on the 12 th March, which permits the customer to take delivery of the refrigerator that day, on payment of a 25% deposit. The contract provides that risk passes to the purchaser upon delivery of the refrigerator, but property does not pass until payment of the balance of the purchase price, which occurs one month later. The income from the sale is derived in terms of section CD 3 on 12 March, as it is a sale of trading stock in the ordinary course of business, and on that day the income has been earned and a legally enforceable debt has arisen when the purchaser took delivery of the refrigerator. Example 3 On 20 May, Vendor and Purchaser enter into an agreement for the sale and purchase of a herd of dairy cattle, and a deposit is paid. The agreement states that the balance of the 16 purchase price shall be paid on the day of delivery/settlement, and that property in the cattle passes on that day. The agreement is subject to the buyer confirming finance on or before 15 June. The vendor is entitled to continue milking the herd (and retain any proceeds) until the stock is delivered. Both parties have a 31 May balance date. The vendor culls 20% of her herd each year, so it is within the vendor's usual business to sell individual herds of cattle, and she is left with other herds to continue her business operations. The purchaser confirms on 3 June that finance has been arranged. The contract becomes unconditional on 3 June. Payment is made and possession given and taken on 20 June. Section CD 3 applies, as the sale is made in the ordinary course of business, and for the purposes of section CD 3 the income is derived on 20 June. That is when the income is earned, the contract is no longer executory, and a legally enforceable debt first arises. This example illustrates the difference that is possible between the date of “derivation” and the date of “sale”. If this had not been a sale made in the ordinary course of business, the fact that the agreement explicitly stated that property in the goods passes on settlement would have resulted in the same date of 20 June being the date of sale. However, if there had been no express intention of the parties evident as to when property in the cattle passed (either by virtue of the agreement itself or the circumstances of the case/conduct of the parties), the date of sale for the purposes of section FB 3 would have been 3 June, when the contract became unconditional. (Unless Rule 4 or 5 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 applied, due to a delivery on an approval basis, or the goods being unascertained and sold by description.) Example 4 Vendor and Purchaser enter into an agreement for the sale and purchase of a plot of land and a herd of cattle on 15 April. The sale is subject to the buyer confirming finance on or before 20 May, with payment of the balance and possession being given on 19 June. Finance is confirmed on 20 May. The contract became unconditional on 20 May and payment is made and possession given and taken on 19 June. Both parties have a 31 May balance date. There is no clear indication in the contract as to when property in the goods passes. For the purposes of section FB 3, the cattle were sold on 20 May, when the contract became unconditional, as there is no express intention of the parties as to when property in the goods is to pass, and Rule 1 of the Sale of Goods Act applies. If the contract also stated that the cattle could be returned within 7 days if they were not 17 eczema-free on delivery, and the purchaser signified later that same day that the cattle were pronounced eczema-free and would not be returned, the date of sale will differ. The existence of such a condition in the contract is a condition subsequent (rather than a condition precedent), and accordingly the contract is not conditional upon the cattle being eczema-free, and there is no alteration of the date the contract became unconditional. However, it does mean that the cattle are delivered on “sale or return” (or similar) terms, as envisaged by Rule 4 of the Sale of Goods Act. This means the date of sale will be 19 June, when the purchaser signifies his approval and retention of the cattle. If the parties had included an explicit clause in the original contract described above (without the “sale or return” terms) that delivery did not occur and property did not pass until payment was made in full, this intent would be recognised, and the sale would be considered to have been made, for the purposes of section FB 3, on 19 June. Example 5 A customer orders a photocopier from his regular office equipment supplier, by way of mail order from a catalogue description. The order is posted on 12 September, and received by the vendor on 15 September. A photocopier is taken from the stock warehouse and shipped on 20 September, with delivery to the customer taking place the next day. The standard terms of sale are that goods are sent FOB (which, for the purposes of this example, are taken to mean that risk, title, and property in the goods pass when the goods are put onto the delivery truck), and the photocopier is delivered with an invoice indicating the terms of payment. As this sale is made in the ordinary course of operating an office equipment business, the gross income from the sale is subject to tax under section CD 3. The income is “derived” on 20 September, when the stock is shipped, and it can be said that the income has been earned and a debt become due and enforceable under the terms of the sale. If the sale contract conditions were that the goods are delivered COD (and clearly indicated that risk, title, and property in the goods did not pass until delivery), the income would be “derived” on 21 September. In such a situation, no debt is enforceable until delivery occurs. If the order was for a bulk supply of photocopiers and facsimile machines sold by a vendor who was ceasing trade in electrical office appliances, section FB 3 would apply and the time of “sale” is what is relevant. Such an order is for generic items which are unascertained goods at the time the order is made. The goods do not become specific goods until such time as the particular photocopiers are identified, and it is possible to say that such items are the customer’s. In the absence of any differing clear contractual intention, this would occur on 20 September, which is when the items are appropriated to the contract, property passes and the sale occurs. 18
1 BAD DEBTS—WRITING OFF DEBTS AS BAD FOR GST AND INCOME TAX PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING—BR Pub 05/01 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 00/03 published in Taxation Information Bulle tin Vol 12, No 5 (May 2000), and public ruling BR Pub 96/3A which was published in Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). BR Pub 00/03 applied until 31 March 2004. Some minor changes have been made to the description of the arrangement in the new ruling. BR Pub 05/01 applies from 1 April 2004 for an indefinite period. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references to the Income Tax Act are to the Income Tax Act 1994 and all references to the GST Act are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This Ruling applies in respect of section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act and section 26(1)(c) of the GST Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the writing off of a debt (or part of a debt) as a bad debt, for income tax and/or GST purposes, in the following circumstances: •An existing debt is owing to the taxpayer; and •The debt is adjudged as “bad” when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid; and •The bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the accountin g and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer if: •in the case of a large corporate or business taxpayer who maintains a computerised bad debts system, by an authorised person making the appropriate entry in that system recording the debt as written off; or •in the case of a company (other than one falling within the above class), by an executive or other responsible officer of the company with the authority to do so, WITHDRAWN - see BR Pub 18/07 2 making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the comp any recording the debt as written off; or • in the case of a taxpayer (other than a company) that maintains double-entry accounts, by an authorised person making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the business recording the debt as written off; or • in the case of a taxpayer who is an unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business taxpayer who does not maintain double-entry accounts, by the taxpayer noting, in the bookkeeping records of the taxpayer setting out the amount owed by the bad debtor, that the debt has been written off, and the date of the writing off. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the tax treatme nt of arrangements to which the avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act or the GST Act are applicable. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • An income tax deductio n is permitted in terms of section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act. • A deduction from GST output tax is permitted in terms of section 26(1)(c) of the GST Act. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 April 2004 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 3 rd day of March 2005. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel WITHDRAWN 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 05/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understan ding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 05/01 (“the Ruling”). The Ruling applies in respect of section 26(1)(c) of the GST Act 1985 and section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 1994. By way of the savings provisions in sections YA 3 and YA 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004, the Ruling and hence the reasoning in this commentary continue to apply in respect of the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 2004, section DB 23(1)(a), from the date the 2004 Act comes into force (this is dealt with in greater depth on page 25). Background The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons a deduction for bad debts if certain criteria are met. Criteria common to both Acts are the requirem ents that a debt must be both bad and written off before any deduction can be made. The issues that arise when claiming a bad debt deduction are: when a debt is considered bad, and what is required to write off a debt as bad. These issues were previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 00/03 and that public ruling is replaced by this Ruling from 1 April 200 4. The previous ruling concluded that a debt (or part of a debt) must be both bad and written off before any person can claim an income tax deduction or a deduction from GST output tax (assuming that other legislative requirements in the GST Act and the Income Tax Act are also satisfied). The Ruling sets out the tests to apply in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt. However, the Ruling does not apply to arrangements to which the tax avoidance provisions apply. Legislation —Income Tax Act 1994 Section BD 2(1)(b) allows a deduction for any expenditure or loss incurred by a taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. However, notwithstanding section BD 2(1)(b), section DJ 1(a) prohibits the deduction of bad debts, except where and to the extent that a numb er of requirements are met. Section DJ 1 The relevant part of section DJ 1 in force at the date of commencement of this Ruling (1 April 2004), states: WITHDRAWN 4 Except as expressly provided in this Act, no deduction is allowed to a taxpayer in respect of any of the following sums or matters: (a) Bad debts, except where and to the extent that,— (i) In the case of a debt which is an amount owing to the taxpayer in respect of a financial arran g ement where the accrual rules apply to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, a deduction is allowed under either section EH 54 or EH55; and (ii) In any case other than that of a debt which is an amount owing to the taxpayer in respect of a fina ncial arra ngement where the accrual rules apply to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, the bad debt is not a loss of capital subject to section BD 2(2)(e); and (iii) The debt is actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year; and (iv) In any case where— (A) The taxpayer is a company; and (B) The debt is owed by a company (referred to in this subparagraph as the “debtor”); and (C) The application of the amount giving rise to the debt is taken into account in calculating a net loss (referred to in this subparagraph as the “resultant loss”) of the debtor or any other company funded (directly or indirectly) by the debtor; and (D) Any one or more amounts have been offset under section IG 2 of this Act or section 191A of t he Income Tax Act 1976 by the taxpayer (or by any other company which is at any time in the income year in which the resultant loss is incurred in the same group of companies as the taxpayer), in any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1993 and preceding the income year in which the bad debt is written off, in respect of the resultant loss,— the debt exceeds the aggregate of the amounts so offset. Section DJ 1(a)(iii) sets out one of the requireme nts to be satisfied for a bad debt deduction to be allowed, namely that the debt must have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year. It is this part of the income tax bad debt deduction provision that is addressed in the Ruling and discussed more fully in the Application of the Legislation section of this commentary. Section DJ 1(a)(iii) was amended (effective from 24 October 2001, with application to the 2002-03 and subsequent income years) so that when a debt is actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year, there is no longer an express requirement that it be “proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner”. This change was considered in a Government discussion document titled Legislating for Self-Assessment of Tax Liability, first published in August 1998. The discussion document states that the Commissioner’s administrative discretions such as those found in section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the ITA are incompatible with a self-assessment regime. Administrative discretions are already embodied in the Commissioner’s general administrative and collection powers, such that specified administrative discretions are superfluous. The discussion document states that the Government’s view is that discretions of this type could be removed WITHDRAWN 5 without changing the effect of the law. Therefore, it is considered that this legislative change does not im pact on the issues dealt with in this public ruling in deciding whether or not a debt is bad and what is sufficient to write off a debt as bad. Other section DJ 1(a) requirements (in summary form) that must also be satisfied are: • Section DJ 1(a)(i) - If the debt is an amount owing under a financial arrangement and the accrual rules app ly to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, a deduction is allowed under either section EH 54 or EH 55. However, any such bad debt deduction is still conditional on satisfaction of the section DJ 1(a)(iii) requirement that the debt has been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year. \[NOTE: The accrual rules have been rewritten by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. Section DJ 1 as set out above has also been amended with effect from 20 May 1999 to take account of consequential changes made by that Act. A more detailed discussion about bad debts that arise where the accrual rules apply, and the changes made by the above Act, appears on pages 19 to 25 of this commentary\]; and • Section DJ 1(a)(ii)—If the debt is not an am ount owing in respect of a financial arrangement to which the accrual rules apply, the bad debt must not be a loss of capital that is subject to section BD 2(2)(e); and • Section DJ 1(a)(iv)— • If the taxpayer is a comp any and the debt is owed to that company by another company (“the debtor”) and • The amount giving rise to the debt is taken into account in calculating a loss incurred by the debtor or any other company funded by the debtor; and • Any amounts of that loss have been offset under the group company loss offset provisions in section IG 2, or section 191A of the Income Tax Act 1976, by the taxpayer (or any other company in the same group as the taxpayer in the year the loss is incurred), in any income years from 1993/94 and preceding that in which the bad debt is written off, - the deduction allowed for the bad debt is the amount by which the debt exceeds the total amounts offset. Bad debts recovered Under section CE 1(1)(d), amounts received by a person on account of a bad debt for which a deduction has previously been allowed to the person are included as gross income of the person. WITHDRAWN 6 Legislation—GST Act Section 26 Sections 26 and 26A of the GST Act state: 26. Bad debts— (1) Where a registered person— (a) Has made a taxable supply for consideration in money; and (b) Has furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributa b le and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under this Act; and (c) Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person,- that registered person shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of that portion of the amount of tax c h arged in relation to that supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply: Provided that where goods are supplied under a hire pu rchase agreem ent to which the Hire Purchase Act 1971 applies, the registered person shall only make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time that the hire purchase agreement was entered into) of that portion of the amount written off as a bad debt as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement: \[No te The proviso to subsection (1) is to be amended, as from 1 April 2005, by s 139 Credits Contracts and Con sumer Finance Act 2003 (2003 No 52) by omitting the words “to which the Hire Purchase Act 1971 applies”. See sections 141 to 143 of that Act as to the transitional provisions.\] (1AA) Subsection (1) also applies if a registered person sells a debt to a third party and then reacquires the debt . (1 AB) A registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis under either sect i on 19 or section 19A must apply this section only to supplies made by the person to which any one of sections 9(2)(b), 9(3)(b) and 26A applies. (1A) Where a registered person has, in respect of the supply by that registered person of any contract of in suran ce (being a supply charged with tax pursuant to section 8(1) of this Act),— (a) Paid any amount to the Earthquake and War Damage Commission pursuant to the Earthquake and W a r Damage Act 1944 or to the New Zealand Fire Service Commission pursuant to the Fire Service Act 1975; and (b) Sought to recover that amount, together with the consideration for that supply, from the recipient o f that supply; and (c) Written off as a bad debt the whole or part of that am o unt not paid to that registered person,— that registered person shall make a deduction under section 20(3 ) of this Act of the tax fraction of that amount or that part of that amount written off. (2) Where any amount in respect of which a deduction ha s been made in accordance with subsection (1) of this section is at any time wholly or partly recovered by the registered person, that portion of the amount of the deduction allowable under subsection (1) of this section as the amount of the bad debt recovered WITHDRAWN 7 bears to the bad debt written off shall be deemed to be the tax charged in relation to a taxable supply made during the taxable period in which the bad debt is wholly or partly recovered. 26A Fa ctored debts— A registered person who sells a debt to a third party must pay tax on the remaining book value of the debt on t he date that the debt is sold if the registered person accounts for tax payable on a payments basis. Section 26 is the main provision applying to bad debts for GST purposes. The section applies to registered persons who account for GST on an invoice or hybrid basis. It also applies to registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis when the relevant supply is by way of a hire purchase sale (section 9(3)(b)), a door to door sale (section 9(2)(b )), or where a registered person sells a debt to a third party (section 26A). Section 26(1) allows a registered person to ma ke a deduction from output tax for that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to a supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply. To claim the deduction, the registered person must satisfy a number of criteria. Section 26(1)(c) sets out one of these, namely that the registered person must have written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. The other section 26(1) criteria (in summary form) also to be s atisfied are that the registered person must have: • Section 26(1)(a)—Made a taxable supply for consideration in money (from which the bad debt arose); and • Section 26(1)(b)—Furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable, and properly accounted for the output tax on the supply. A proviso is effective if goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreeme nt as defined in the Hire Purchase Act 1971 (or as defined in the GST Act from 1 April 2005) . In this case the registered person makes a deduction from output tax of the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time the hire purchase agreement was entered into) of that portion of the amount written off as a bad debt as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. A special provision exists for registered persons who supply contracts of insurance relating to earthquakes, and fires (see section 26(1A)). Application of the Legislation As indicated earlier, criteria common to both the Incom e Tax and GST Acts are the requirements that a debt must be both bad and actually written off before any deduction WITHDRAWN 8 can be made. This section of the commentary is therefore divided into two parts, discussing firstly the tests to apply in deciding w hether or not a debt is “bad”, and secondly what is sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt. First requirement—Debt must be “bad” The relevant time of inquiry as to whether a debt is bad is the time that the decision is ma de to write off the debt. 1 A debt must be “bad” before it can be written off and before any deduction can be claimed for that debt. Whether or not a debt (or part of a debt) is bad is a question of fact to be determined objectively. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. The onus of proof is on the taxpayer. The standard to which the test must be proved is on the balance of probabilities: see Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263, at page 12,269; Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541, at page 3,548; Graham v CIR, Edwards Graham Ltd & Edwards v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,107, at page 12,111; Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188, at page 8,194; Case W3 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,014 at page 11,029. The expired public ruling refers to the “reasonably prudent bu siness person” whereas this public ruling refers to the “reasonably prudent commercial person”. This change adopts the wording of the High Court case Budget-Rent-A-Car. The term “commercial person” refers to people directly involved in commerce or business, and would also include people who have professional knowledge of commerce such as directors of a company, a loans manager of a bank, accountants, a business consultant, and lawyers with business experience. The term “commercial person” appears to be a wider term such that it includes “business persons” as well as professionals with knowledge of commerce. At the time of deciding whether a debt is bad, a person will therefore need to have sufficient inform ation to enable a reasonably prudent commercial person to form the view that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. This requires a bona fide assessment based on sound commercial considerations, that the debt is bad. Sound commercial judgment cannot be exercised in relation to determining that a debt is bad if there is still a real and continuing dispute in as to whether or not the debt is payable. 2 In such a situation, a taxpayer cannot at that point in time, on any objective view, come to the conclusion that the debt was bad. The debt must be more than doubtful. Determining the question of fact as to whether a debt is bad depends on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. While no factor is decisive in itself, factors that are likely to be relevant in considering whether a debt is bad include 3 : 1 Case 45/93 93 ATC 486; AAT Case 9093 (1993) 27 ATR 1022. 2 Case 45/93 93 ATC 486; AAT Case 9093 (1993) 27 ATR 1022. Also see Australian Taxation Office Goods and Services Tax Ruling GSTR 2000/2 paragraphs 37 and 38. 3 Bullet points 4 - 7 are from Australian Taxation Office Tax Ruling 92/18 paragraph 31. WITHDRAWN 9 • The length of time a debt is outstanding—the longer a debt is outstanding the m ore likely it is that a reasonably prudent commercial person would consider the debt to be bad. This will of necessity vary depending upon the amount of the debt outstanding and the taxpayer’s credit arrangements (e.g. 90, 120 or 150 days overdue). However, a debt will not be considered bad merely because a set period of time for payment has elapsed with no payment or contact having been made by the debtor. Similarly, a debt may have only been outstanding for a short period and still be regarded as bad where other evidence exists that the debt will not be collected; • The efforts that a creditor has taken to collect a debt—the greater the extent to which a person has tried (unsuccessfully) to collect a debt, the more likely it is that a reasonably prudent commercial person would consider the debt to be bad; • Other information obtained by a creditor - a creditor m ay have obtained particular information about a debtor, e.g. through business or personal networks, that would be a factor in leading a reasonably prudent commercial person to conclude that a debt is bad. For example, a creditor may know that the debtor is in financial difficulties and has defaulted on debts owed to other creditors; • A debt may be considered bad if the debtor has died leaving no, or insufficient, assets out of which the debt m ay be satisfied; • The debtor cannot be traced and the creditor had been unable to ascertain the existence of, or whereabouts of, any assets ag ainst which action could be taken; • Where the debt has become statute barred and the debtor is relying on this defence (or it is reasonable to assume that the debtor will do so), for non-payment; • If the debtor is a company, it is in liquidation or receivership and there are insufficient funds to pay the whole debt, or the part claimed as a bad debt. A debtor does not need to be insolvent for a debt to be bad (although this will often be the case). Taxpayer’s opinion A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person concludes that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In ma ny instances, a taxpayer’s considered opinion will suffice. However, the Commissioner also recognises that taxpayers have a financial interest in treating a debt as bad. Wr iting off a debt as bad entitles a taxpayer to: • A deduction in calcula ting income for income tax purposes, worth up to 39% of the debt, depending on the taxpayer’s marginal income tax rate: WITHDRAWN 10 • A GST deduction from output tax of the tax fraction of the debt. Because of this, the Comm issioner may inquire into the decision to treat a debt as bad in the course of tax audits or other enquiries. It is desirable, therefore, th at taxpayers document and retain evidence in relation to their decisions to treat debts as bad to show that they made reasonable decisions. Documentation may include noting down the information from which the decision was made that the debt was bad, and keeping copies of any correspondence relating to the debt. It should be remembered that the onus of proof is on the taxpayer and the standard is on the balance of probabilities. Information required The amount of information required to decide whether a debt is bad depends on the particular circumstances of each case. If the amount involv ed is small, a reasonably prudent commercial person is likely to make limited enquiries and take limited recovery action. Particular knowledge or information obtained by a taxpayer may also reduce the need for enquiry. In the final analysis, however, the test is always whether the taxpayer has sufficient information to reasonably draw the conclusion that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid, even if further or any recovery actions were to be taken. Recovery steps taken A creditor is likely to have taken legal steps to try to recov er the debt in most cases before a deduction for a bad debt is made, although it is not a requirement that such action be taken before a decision is made that a debt is bad. However, it is through taking recovery action that most creditors will form an opinion as to whether a debt is bad. While recovery action is being taken, a debt can only be considered bad to the extent that a reasonably prudent commercial person would consider there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. To establish that there is no reasonabl e likelihood that the debt will be paid, a reasonably prudent commercial person would, in most situations, take steps to recover the debt instead of simply writing it off. This may encompass a range of actions including legal proceedings. The appropriate steps undertaken will vary according to the size of the debt and the resources available to the creditor to pursue the debt. A creditor might not take any steps in attempting to recover the debt where the information suggests that there is no hope of payment. The steps taken to recover the debt would generally be expected to include one or more of the following, depending upon the circumstances 4 : • Reminder notices issued and telephone/mail or e-mail contact is attempted; 4 See Australian Taxation Office Goods and Services Tax ruling GSTR 2000/2 paragraphs 41 and 42 and Australian Taxation Office Tax Ruling 92/18 paragraph 32. WITHDRAWN 11 • Allow a reasonable perio d of time to elapse since the original due date for payment of the debt. This will vary depending upon the amount of the debt outstanding and the taxpayer’s credit arrangements. • Formal demand notice is served; • Commencement of legal proceedings for debt recovery; • Judgment entered against the delinquent debtor; • Execution pr oceedings to enforce judgment; • The calculation and charging of interest is ceased and the account is closed (a tracing file may be kept open; also, in the case of a partial write-off, the account may remain open); • Valuation of any security held against the debt; • Sale of any seized or repossessed assets; While the ab ove factors are indicative of the circumstances in which a debt m ay be considered bad, ultimately the question is one of fact and will depend on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions. In some instances, taking recovery action may carry with it the reasonable expectation of recovery of som e part of the amount involved. However, this will not always be the case. The decision to take recovery action and the extent of that action will depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. In some cases, the creditor may take no or only limited recovery action because enough information is held to form a reasonable view that the debt is bad. The amount of information needed depends on the circumstances. Conversely, the creditor may take recovery action even when a reasonable view has been form ed that the debt is bad. For a number of reasons the creditor might take recovery action even when it is believed that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be recovered. This may be the case, for example, when the creditor has a policy of pursuing debtors to a certain extent to discourage customers defaulting on debt. Provision for doubtful debts Persons in business who provide credit often find it prudent to ma ke some provision for the likelihood that some of their debtors will not pay. This allowance is generally calculated by estimating a percentage on the basis of past history, and applying that percentage to the total amount of debts owed to the business at balance date. WITHDRAWN 12 Bad debts are individually identifiable debts that are unlikely to be recovered (in practical terms). The provision fo r doubtful debts is an estimate of the amount that will become bad debts in the future. The Income Tax Act and the GST Act do not allow any deduction for provisions for doubtful debts. Debts that are partially bad In some cases there may be no reasonable expectation that the debt will be fully recovered, but there m ay be a reasonable expectation of partial recovery. In this case the part that the creditor has no reasonable expectation of recovering is a bad debt. It is only that part of the debt that the creditor is entitled to write off as bad and claim as a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Examples of when a debt is bad or is not bad Example 1 A supplier has supplied goods on credit to Mr B. Mr B owes the supplier $2,000 for the goods. The supplier knows that Mr B has left town, and that ma il addressed to him is returned marked “Gone No Address”. In this case it is reasonable to assume that the debt will not be recovered. The money owed by Mr B is a bad debt. Example 2 C owes $100,000 to a company. The credit controller for the company has considered the likelihood of default on every loan currently owing to the company. The credit controller has estim ated the likelihood of default for C to be 5%, and wants to know if the company can consider $5,000 of that loan (5% of the $100,000 owing) to be a bad debt. Making an estimate of the likelihood of default on debts is not sufficient for a debt (or a percentage thereof) to be bad. It is not reasonable to assume that the debt is bad. Example 3 A local dairy has supplied $64 worth of bread and cigarettes to Mrs D on credit. Mrs D used to call into the shop every other day, but has not called into the shop for eight weeks and the dairy has heard that som eone else is living in the house Mrs D used to rent. The $64 is still owing. Given the relatively small amount owing and the information known to the dairy, it is reasonable for the dairy to m ake no further enquiries. On the basis of the dairy’s information, it can be assumed that the money is unlikely to be recovered. It is a bad WITHDRAWN 13 debt. However, if the sum involved was somewhat larger, it may be reasonable to expect the dairy to m ake some further enquiry. Example 4 A solicitor has done work for Mr O and billed him for $1,700. The solicitor is on the Board of Trustees of the school attended by Mr O’s children. The solicitor has sent out a numb er of reminder bills because the bill is 4-months overdue, but has had no response. Several of the solicitor’s friends and associates have mentioned that Mr O is in financial difficulty and has had one of his vehicles repossessed. The solicitor’s office clerk has noted that Mr O’s name has been cited in the Gazette several times over recent months in respect of court action for unpaid debts. It is reasonable for the solicitor to characterise Mr O’s debt as a bad debt. Example 5 A debtor of Mr F is a company in liquidation. Mr F has given the liquidator notice of a debt of $10,000 owed for goods and services supplied. Mr F is an unsecured creditor. The liquidator has held a m eeting of creditors. Mr F attended the meeting and received formal notice of the outcome of the meeting. The liquidator has stated that unsecured creditors will probably receive something between 45 and 50 cents in the dollar. It is reasonable for Mr F to assume that $5,000 of the total debt is bad. He is entitled to write off that part of the debt that is bad in the income year in which he received the formal notice, and to claim a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Example 6 The same facts exist as in Example 5, but at a later date Mr F receives a letter from the liquidator who advises that the estimate of the likely recovery has been revised. It is now expected that unsecured creditors will be paid between 70 and 75 cents in the dollar. This does not affect the answer given above in Example 5. Al so, it has no effect on Mr F’s GST return or income tax return if Mr F has claimed a deduction for the bad debt. If at any stage Mr F receives payment of any part of the 50 cents in the dollar written off, Mr F must: • Include it as gross income in the income tax return for the year in which it is received (this will give rise to an income tax liability unless there are losses to offset against it, and may give rise to a provisional tax liability, depending on the taxpayer’s circumstances); and • Account for GST on the amount recovered in the sam e proportion as Mr F was allowed a deduction from output tax when the bad debt was written off. WITHDRAWN 14 Second requirement—Debt must be “written off” The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons deductions for writing off bad debts. It is not enough that a debt is bad: the bad debt must also be ac tually written off. Writing off the bad debt is important because this will fix the time at which the deduction can be made. Note that there is no requirement that a debt be written off in the year it becomes bad. As Tompkins J in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (supra) at 12,271 stated: A debt is not normally deductible. It does not become a deductible debt if and when it becomes a bad debt. It becomes a deductible debt, if it has been incurred in the production of assessable income, when it is written off. It is the writing off that converts the debt into a deductible debt. It follows that the crucial time is the time of the writing off, not the time the debt becomes a bad debt. It also follows that the income year referred to in s 106(1)(b) is not the year the debt became bad. In my view, the income year referred to is the year during which the bad debt was “actually written off”. There is no provision in the Act that requires the bad debt t o be written off in the year the debt became bad. Had that been the intention of the legislature, it would have said so ... Barber DJ in the Taxation Review Authority discussed the requireme nt to write off bad debts in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541. Barber DJ said at 3,547: I consider it elementary that the writing off of a debt as bad requires something more than the mere recognition by the taxpayer, or one or more of its executives, that a debt is unlikely to be paid. It could be reasoned that only a decision of the taxpayer to write off a debt is needed, subject to the debt being bad. However, I consider that, in terms of sec 106(1)(b), book-keeping steps must also be taken to record that the debt has been written off. Desirably, the steps would comprise a directors’ resolution, if the taxpayer is a corporate, and appropriate book-keeping entries. However, it would be adequate for a responsible officer or executive of a corporate or business to merely make the appropriate book-keeping entries if he or she has that authority. An unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business would not, of course, have a directorate so that book entries by the trader or his or her manager will suffice. In my view, it is not possible to write off a debt as bad without the making of authorised journal entries in the books of account of the business. In Case T48 (1998) 18 NCTC 8,325 the Taxation Review Authority held that for a private individual trader, as distinct from an incorporated company, words on ledger cards such as “written off” with the relevant date are sufficient to indicate that the debt had been actually written off as bad. The taxpayers did not have to meet any other book- keeping requirements. Taxpayers must therefore be able to show clearly that the debt has been actually written off as bad rather than just making a decision in their mind. To meet the legislative requirement, there must be something written down in the books of account of the business stating that the debt is written off. Case law indicates that the minimum writing requirements to satisfy the actually written off as bad test may vary for different classes of taxpayer based on the differing nature and level of sophistication of the taxpayer’s accounting records. However, no matter what form a taxpayer’s books of account or accounting records may take, those existing in respect of a debt owed by a bad debtor WITHDRAWN 15 must record that the taxpayer, or an authorised person on behalf of the taxpayer, having decided the debt is bad, has written off the debt accord ingly. It is the writing off of the bad debt which converts it into a deductible debt. What will be sufficient to meet the wr itten off test for various classes of taxpayer are as follows. The classes and the writing requirements are based largely on Case N69, Case T48 and the earlier Case P53. The bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer if: • in the case of a large corporate or business taxpayer who maintains a computerised bad debts system, by an authorised person making the appropriate entry in that system recording the debt as written off; or • in the case of a company (other than one falling within the above class), by an executive or other responsible officer of the company with the authority to do so, making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the company recording the debt as written off; or • in the case of a taxpayer (other than a company) that m aintains double-entry accounts, by an authorised person making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the business recording the debt as written off; or • in the case of a taxpayer who is an unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business taxpayer who does not m aintain double-entry accounts, by the taxpayer noting, in the bookkeeping records of the taxpayer setting out the amount owed by the bad debtor, that the debt has been written off, and the date of the writing off. There may be very exceptional cases where less than the above writing off requireme nt is acceptable, such as in Case S73, where the taxpayer was unable to access the accounting records and a letter was sent to the Commissioner stating that the debt had been written off. Nevertheless, there remains a writing requirement in all cases. Further details of the specific form the necessary write off of a bad debt ma y take in the creditor taxpayer’s books are outlined in the next section of this commentary. It is the writing-off that determines the time when a deduction for a bad debt can be claime d. The necessary writing-off must therefore take place before the end of the income year or GST taxable period in relation to which the bad debt deduction is claimed. Writing-off a bad debt cannot be backdated. Therefore, if there are numerous debts to review, it is important to allow sufficient time for this exercise, as well as for completing all necessary “writing-off” accounting entries before the end of an income year or GST taxable period, to enable any bad debts to be deducted in that year or GST taxable period. WITHDRAWN 16 In all cases the business records kept by the taxpayer must comply with the requirem ents of section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section 75 of the GST Act. Accounts kept by taxpayers Most taxpayers in business keep double-entry accounts. If a person keeps double-entry accounting records, the bad debt must be struck out of the records on which the double- entry a ccounts are based. If debtors ledgers are maintained, the writing-off will be able to be clearly shown by the appropriate bookkeeping entries having been made in the debtors ledger by authorised persons. Generally, this means that the balance in the debtors ledger for the individual debtor must be reduced by the amount of the bad debt. No matter what processes are followed in the course of preparing a person’s double-entry accounts, it is the completion of the appropriate authorised entry/entries actually writing- off a debt (which it has been decided is bad in accordance with the tests already outlined) that is essential to deductibility. In cases where a taxpayer does not keep double-entry accounting records and/or does not keep a debtor s ledger, the person must write the debt off according to the form of records used. This means that whatever the form of records used, those showing the amount owed by the bad debtor must clearly record that the creditor, having made the decision that the debt is bad (in accordance with the tests already outlined), has written the debt off accordingly. Particular examples of bad debts accepted by the Commissioner as having been written off are: • If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices issued, placing the invoice in a “bad debts” file and indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad and the date, is sufficient. • If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices and copies of statements of account issued from a duplicate account book, marking the copy of the final statement sent out “bad debt – written off” (noting the amount of the debt that is bad and the date) is sufficient. Alternatively, it would also be sufficient for the taxpayer to place the relevant invoice in a “bad debts” file indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad and the date this was done. Keeping records for credit control or other purposes For a variety of reasons, a creditor may keep a separate record of bad debts written off. For exam ple, the records may be necessary if the creditor should ever have the opportunity of collecting the debt in the future, or the creditor may want to keep a record of problem customers to avoid future difficulties. WITHDRAWN 17 As long as these records are quite separate from the accoun ting base records they will not affect the write-off. If the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. More than one set of accounts Some businesses have more than one set of accounts. For example, a company m ay prepare: • Financial accounts for financial reporting purposes to satisfy the requirements of the Com panies Act 1955 or 1993; and • Management accounts as a basis for management decision-making and control. The sets of accounts may be prepared in quite different ways. For example, statutory requirements are set out in the Financial Reporting Act 1993 for preparing financial reports that are not required when preparing management accounts; and management accounts may be prepared on the basis of estimates for some elements in order to provide very quick reports. When the different sets of accounts rely on the same underlying debtor records, no difficulty arises. As long as the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. However, if the debt is still recognised as an asset in the underlying records, it is not written off. If the different sets of accounts rely on different underlying debtor records (which is very rare), the creditor should refer to the accounts that are relied on to represent the firm’s financial po sition. For a company, these will be the accounts used to satisfy the company’s financial reporting obligations under the relevant Companies Act. Examples of when a bad debt is or is not writte n off General facts The following facts apply to all the following examples: • The taxpayer’s income tax balance date is 31 March. • The only question is whether a debt has been written off. All other criteria are satisfi ed. • The debt is for goods and services supplied for money. WITHDRAWN 18 • The supply has been included in the taxpayer’s gross income for income tax purposes. In the examples where the taxpayer is a GST registered person, the following additional facts apply: • GST returns are filed on a two-monthly invoice basis. • The supply has been included in a GS T return. Example 1 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is updated on 31 March 2003. The entries ma de include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 2003. Example 2 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is written up on 1 April 2003. The entries written up include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 2004. Example 3 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is registered for GST. There is no indication on her underlying debtor records to show the status of the debt. She has claime d a deduction from output tax for the bad debt in her GST return for the taxable period ending 31 January 2003. That return was prepared in February 2003. The taxpayer is not entitled to the deduction from GST output tax. She is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the income year ending 31 March 2003. Claim ing the deduction from output tax for GST purposes is not a sufficient writing-off of the bad debt. Example 4 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The taxpayer’s only records of debts owing to him are copies of issued invoices. The taxpayer m aintains only rudimentary books of account, and his unpaid debtors are represented by loose-leaf filing of accounts and/or invoices issued in a ring-binder file. When a debt is paid it (the account and/or invoice) is transferred to a separate file. The taxpayer ceases sending accounts for the debt in question in February 2003, putting a line WITHDRAWN 19 across the copy of the last statement sent out in respect of the debt and marking it “Final” and leaves it in the unpaid debtors’ file. The taxpayer is not entitled to a deduction for the bad debt in the year ended 31 March 2003. Sim ply marking the last statement issued as “Final” and leaving it in the unpaid debtors’ file does not amount to writing off of the debt. Example 5 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. His only records of debts owing are copies of invoices and statem ents issued. In February 2003 the taxpayer became aware that a debt was bad. He stopped sending out statements for the debt and took no other action on it. In particular, he sent out no statements on the account in February and March 2003. The taxpayer continued to send out statements on all the other debts owing, including overdue accounts. The taxpayer keeps carbon copies of the statements of account in the duplicate account book from which the statements for issue are prepared. The taxpayer has tagged the final statement sent out in respect of the debt, circling the amount payable and marking it “bad debt - written off - February 2003”. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the year ending 31 March 2003. The cessation of statem ents of account, recorded by their absence in the duplicate account book, and the tagging and marking of the final statement, amount to writing off the debt in his accounting system. Example 6 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. She wrote up the debtors ledger on 31 March 2003. The entries w ritten up include a journal entry writing off a bad debt. Her accountant prepares her accounts in June 2003. In the course of preparing the accounts, the accountant makes a general ledger entry recognising the bad debt as a result of the debtors ledger entry made by the taxpayer on 31 March 2003. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 2003, because the underly ing accounting record of the debt was altered to recognise the bad debt on 31 March 2003. Example 7 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. Her only records of debts owing are copies of invoices issued. On 15 March 2003 she placed the invoice for the debt in question in a file ma rked “BAD DEBTS” noting on the invoice next to the total amount “debt bad – filed 15/3/03”. The amount of trade creditors in the taxpayer’s balance sheet as at 31 March 2003 includes the bad debt. The taxpayer’s profit and loss statement for the year ending 31 March 2003 includes as income the sale WITHDRAWN 20 that has become a bad debt. The profit and loss statement does not recognise any expense for bad or doubtful debts. The taxpayer’s income tax return for the year ending 31 March 2003 includes the profit and loss st atement and a “tax reconciliation statement” showing the difference between the accounting income and the amount she believes to be income for income tax purposes. The tax reconciliation statement includes a deduction for the bad debt. The taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt. Although the debt has arguably been written off in the underly ing accounting records, she has not ceased to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes. Accrual(s) rules General The accruals rules in Subpart EH of the Income Tax Act provide rules for the timing and recognition of income derived and expenditure incurred in respect of “financial arrangements”. The accruals rules have been rewritten by the Taxation (Accru al Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. The amendments made by this Act apply, in general, to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. The changes made in relation to the allowable deductions for bad debts are discussed later in this item. Two general changes made by the amendment Act are: • The creation of divisions of rules, one applying to financial arrangeme nts entered into before 20 May 1999, and those that were entered into on or after 20 May 1999. These are referred to as Division 1 and Division 2 respectively. • Division 1 financial arrangeme nts are referred to as coming within the accruals rules, while Division 2 financial arrangements are referred to as coming within the accrual rules. The requirement in section DJ 1(a)(iii) that “the debt is actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the in come year”, must be satisfied before any deduction can be claimed for a bad debt under the accrual(s) rules (sections EH 6(4) and EH 54(1)). Accordingly, the tests used in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt, apply equally to debts for which a bad debt deduction arises under the accrual(s) rules. DIVISION 1: Financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 WITHDRAWN 21 Although the significant accrual(s) rules change s made by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999, the rules as they affect arrangements entered into before that date have also been rewritten. As part of this process, the accruals bad debt deduction provisions, formerly in section EH 5, have been re-enacted as section EH 6. Apart from the inclusion of headings for each subparagraph and necessary updating of some references to other new section and subsection numbers referred to, there are no wording changes between the former section EH 5 and the new section EH 6. What is a financial arrangement? A “financial arrangement” is widely defined and means a debt or debt instrum ent or an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for the provision of money to any person, either at a future time, or when an event occurs (or does not occur) in the future. Essentially, a financial arrangement is any transaction that involves deferral of the giving of consideration. Mortgages, bank and other loans, commercial bills, and treasury stock are examples of debt type financial arrangements. Certain specific exceptions are created, and they are designated as “except ed financial arrangements”. This category includes equity type instruments (debentures, shares), insurance contracts, employment contracts, games of chance, short term credit agreements and options. Those debts falling within the “excepted financial arrangement” definition have their deductibility as bad debts considered under section DJ 1(a). The main type of financial arrangement, in relation to bad debts, that is excluded from the Division 1 definition of “financial arrangeme nt”, is likely to be a short term trade credit. Short term trade credits are an “excepted financial arrangement”. “Short term trade credit” is defined as: .... any debt for goods or services where payment is required by the vendor- (a) Within 63 days after the supply of the goods or services; or (b) Because the supply of the goods or services i s continuous a nd the vendor renders periodic invoices for the goods or services, within 63 days after the date of an invoice rendered for those goods or services: Therefore, a short term trade credit is a debt for goods or services owed to a vendor within 63 days after supply or, where the supply is continuous, the vendor expects payment within 63 days after the date an i nvoice is issued for those goods and services. Arrangements entered into before the introduction of the accruals rules are also excluded from the definition of “financial arrangem ent”. What this means as far as a deduction for bad debts is concerned is that the deduction for bad debts arising in respect of a short term trade credit is considered under the general bad debt deduction provision in section DJ 1(a) and not under the accruals rules’ section EH 6. WITHDRAWN 22 Revenue bad debts Section EH 6(1) will only apply in limited circu mstances to a cash basis holder. A cash basis holder is a natural person for whom either the total value of all financial arrangements held by that person will not exceed $600,000 or the income derived during the income year from financial arrangements does not exceed $70,000. Furthermore, the difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules, and the income returned as a cash basis holder, must not exceed a $20,000 deferral threshold. Section EH 6(1) permits a person to deduct an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangeme nt where and to the extent that: • The person derives gross income in respect of the financial arrangement under: • Section EH 1—one of the me thods of calculating accrual income; or • Section EH 3(4)—the adjustment required in any year when a person ceases to be a cash basis holder; or • Section EH 4—the base price adjustme nt calculated in the year a financial arrangement matures or is transferred; or • Section EH 8—the post facto adjustme nt for financial arrangements which have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the accruals regime; and • The amount written off is attributable to that gross income. In other words, a bad debt com prising income from a financial arrangement previously returned by the taxpayer under the accruals rules is allowed as a deduction under section EH 6(1). The purpose of the base price adjustment is to ensure that all income derived and all expenditure incurred is taken account of for that financial arrangement when it is either sold, matures, is remitted, or transferred. The post facto adjustment is used to recalculate assessable income or any loss incurred in respect of the financial arrangement using the yield to maturity method in certain circumstances where: • any amount payable under the financial arrang ement is determined, according to the terms of the financial arrangement, at the discretion of the holder or the issuer, or any other person who is an associated person of the holder or the issuer; and WITHDRAWN 23 • when exercising this discretion the change in the amounts payable under the financial arrangem ent does not reflect changes in economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or banking or commercial rates; and • the making of such a financial arrangement is not a generally accepted commercial practice; an d • the effect of the arrangeme nt is to defeat the intent and application of the accruals rules. “Yield to maturity” is a method of spreading incom e and expenditure over the life of the financial arrangement. Under the Income Tax Act, where the parties to a transaction are in a clos e relationship with each other they are classed as associated persons: for example relatives, partnerships, and individuals that hold majority interests or voting rights in a company. Association is measured by reference to voting and, where applicable, market value interests, rather than to nominal and paid-up capital. The relationship of association is defined in section OD 7(1). Section EH 6(4) provides that the requireme nt in section DJ 1(a)(iii), that “the debt is actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year”, must still be satisfied before any deduction can be claimed. Capital bad debts Section EH 6(2) provides for the deduction of the capital or principal element of a financial arrangement in certain circum stances. Section EH 6(2) allows a person a deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount deductible under section EH 6(1)) where: • The person carries on a business comprising the holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and the person is not associated with the person owing the amount written off (see section OD 7 for test of association); or • The financial arrangeme nt is a trade credit and the person carries on the business of dealing in the goods or services for which the trade credit is a debt. Section OB 1 provides that “Trade credit” is defined in section EH 14 for Part EH Division 1. Section EH 14 provides that, “trade credit”, in the qualified accruals rules means any debt for goods and services, other than a short term trade credit. As with Revenue bad debts above, section EH 6(4) requires (through section DJ 1(a)(iii)) that “t he debt is actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year” before any deduction can be claimed. WITHDRAWN 24 Security payments Under section EH 6(3), if a person receives a security paym ent for a loss and a deduction is not otherwise allowable for the loss, the person may be allowed a deduction for the loss up to the amount of the security payment. The purpose of section EH 6(3) is to avoid the situation where the person is taxed on the security payment but does not receive a deduction for the loss incurred. A “security payment” means money received by, and that is gross income of, the holder of a security arrangement for any loss suffered because that arrangement is not performed. A “security arrangement” is a financial arrangement that secures the holder against failure of a person to perform their obligations under another arrangement. That other arrangement does not need to be a financial arrangement. A payment made under a guarantee is a security payment. DIVISION 2: Financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999 This section briefly outlines the effect of the changes ma de by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 in the context of deductions allowed for bad debts under the accrual rules. As stated above, the amendments apply, in general, to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. Allowable deductions for bad debts Deductions for bad debts under the accrual rules are now contained in section EH 54. Section EH 54, by and large, replicates the bad debt deduction provisions from the form er section EH 5 (now re-enacted as section EH 6), while the security payments and share loss deduction provisions from these sections are now contained in section EH 55. The most significant changes as they relate to the deduction of bad debts, are: • The cash basis threshold is increased from $600,000 to $1,000,000 and incom e from investments from $70,000 to $100,000. In addition, the $20,000 deferral threshold, the maximum allowable difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules and the income returned as a cash basis holder, has been increased to $40,000. • There is only one excepted financial arrangement for short-term agreem ents for the sale and purchase of property or services, unless a person elects otherwise, and this is for those agreements where settlement or performance must occur within 93 days. • Deductions are allowed for dealers or providers of goods and services when credit is extended under an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services. Revenue bad debts WITHDRAWN 25 Section EH 54(2) permits a person to deduct an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangeme nt where and to the extent that: • The person derives gross income in respect of the financial arrangement; and • The amount written off is attributable to the income. Capital bad debts Section EH 54(3) provides for the deduction of the capital or principal element of a financial arrangem ent in certain circumstances. Section EH 54(3) allows a person a deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount deductible under section EH 54(2)) where: • The person carries on a business that includes holding or dealing in financial arrangem ents that are the same or similar; and • The person is not associated with the person owing the amount written off. Bad debts—agreements for sale and purchase of property or services Section EH 54(4) allows a person a bad debt deduction (for an amount that is not allow ed as a deduction under section EH 54(2) or (3)) where: • The financial arrangeme nt is an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services; and • The person carries on a business of dealing in the property or services that are the subject of the agreem ent. Previous rules applying to trade credits have been integrated with the rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property, and these have also been extended to apply to the provision of services. As a result of the integration, the bad debt provisions are extended to taxpayers in the business of dealing in the goods or services that are the subject of the agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. Transitional adjustments As mentioned earlier, the amended accrual rules (Division 2) apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. However, under section EH 17 taxpayers are able to elect to app ly these new rules to financial arrangements entered into before that date (i.e. Division 1 financial arrangements). This will be useful if taxpayers wish to account for all arrangements on a similar basis. Further details of this option, and other changes to the accruals rules, are included in the full discussion on the amending legislation in TIB Vol.11, No 6 (July 1999). WITHDRAWN 26 Income Tax Act 2004 The Ruling is not in respect of the Income Tax Act 2004. However, section YA 3(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides that the provisions of this Act are the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 in rewritten form, and are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 except in the case of a new law specified in Schedule 22A (identified policy changes). Section YA 3 provides: YA 3 Transitional provisions— Reference to this Act can include earlier Act (1) A reference in an enactment or document to this Act, or to a provision of it, is to be in terpreted as a referen ce to the Income Tax Act 1994 (or to the Income Tax Act 1976), or to the corresponding provision of the earlier Act, to the extent necessary to reflect sensibly the intent of the enactment or document. Reference to earlier Act can include this Act (2) A reference in an enactment or document to the Income Tax Act 1994 (or to the Income Tax Act 1976), or to a provision of that earlier Act, is to be interpreted as a reference to this Act, or to the corresponding provision in this Act, to the extent necessary to reflect sensibly the intent of the enactment or document. Intention of new law (3) Except when subsection (5) applies, the provisions of this Act are the provisions of the In co me Tax Act 1994 in rewritten form, and are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. Old law is interpretation guide (4) Except when subsection (5) applies, in ci rcum stances where the meaning of a taxation law that comes into force at the commencement of this Act (new law) is unclear or gives rise to absurdity,— (a) the wording of a taxation law that is repealed by section YA 1 and that co rresp onds to the new law (old law) must be used to determine the correct meaning of the new law; and (b) it can be assumed that a corresponding old law provision exists for each new law p r ovision. Limits to subsections (3) and (4) (5) Subsections (3) and (4) do not apply in the case of— (a) a new law specified in schedule 22A (Identified policy changes); or (b) a new law that is amended after the commencement of this Act, with effect from th e d ate on which the amendment comes into force. Section DB 23(1)(a) in the Income Tax Act 2004 corresponds with section DJ 1(a)(iii) and provides for the same legal tests in that a debt must be both bad and written off in the income year for a deduction to be allowed. The requirements in section DB 23(1) are WITHDRAWN 27 referred to in section EZ 37 (which concerns accrued income written off) and correspond with section EH 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Sections DB 23 and EZ 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 provide: Bad debts DB 23 Bad debts DB 23(1) No deduction (with exception) A person is denied a deduction in an income year for a bad debt, except to the extent to whic h— (a) the debt is written off as bad in the income year; and (b) in the case of the bad debts described in subsections (2) to (5), the requirements o f the relevant subsection are satisfied. DB 23(2) Deduction: financial arr a ngement debt: amount of income A person who derives assessable income from a financial arrangement to which the fina ncial arrangements rules apply is allowed a deduction for an amount owing under the financial arrangement, but only to the extent to which— (a) the amount is a bad debt and subsection (1)(a) is satisfied; and (b) the amount is attributable to the income; and (c) subsection (5) does not limit the deduction. DB 23(3) Deduction: financial arrangement debt: dealers in arrangements A person is allowed a deduction for an amount owing under a financial arrangement to wh ich the financial arrangements rules apply, but only to the extent to which— (a) the amount is a bad debt and subsection (1)(a) is satisfied; and (b) the person carries on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income th at in cludes dealing in or holding financial arrangements that are the same as, or similar to, the financial arrangement; and (c) the person is not associated with the pers on owing the amount written off; and (d) subsection (5) does not limit the deduction. DB 23(4) Deduction: financial arrangement de bt: de alers in property or services sold A person is allowed a deduction for an amount owing under a financial arrangement to wh ich the financial arrangements rules apply, but only to the extent to which— (a) the amount is a bad debt and subsection (1)(a) is satisfied; and (b) the financial arrangement is an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services; and (c) the person carries on a business of dealing in the property or se rvices that are the subject of the agreement; and (d) the person carries on the business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; and (e) subsection (5) does not limit the deduction. DB 23(5) Deduction: bad debt re presenting loss already offset A person is allowed a deduction for a bad debt only to the extent to which it is more than th e total of the amounts offset under section IG 2 (Net loss offset between group companies) that are described in paragraphs (e) and (f) if— (a) the person writing off the amount of debt is a company (company A); and (b) the debt is owed to it by another company (company B); and (c) company B— (i) itself uses the amount giving rise to the debt; or WITHDRAWN 28 (ii) uses it to fund directly or indirectly another company (company C) that uses the amount; and (d) company B or company C has a net loss, in the calculation of which the amount use d is taken into account; and (e) company A, or a company that is in th e sam e group of companies as company A at any time in the income year in which company B or company C has the net loss, offsets an amount for the net loss under section IG 2 (Net loss offset between group companies); and (f) the offset is in a tax year before the tax yea r that corresponds to the income year in which company A writes off the amount of debt (but not before the 1993–94 tax year). DB 23(6) Link with subpart DA The link between this section and subpart DA (Ge neral rules) is as follows: (a) subsection (1) overrides the general permission; and (b) for subsections (2) to (5),— (i) they supplement the general permission, to the extent to which they al l ow a deduction that is denied under the general permission; and (ii) they override the general permission, to th e extent to which they deny a deduction that is allowed under the general permission; and (iii) the other general limitations still apply. Defined in this Act: ag reement for the sale and purchase of property or services, amount, assessable income, associated person, business, company, deduction, financial arrangement, financial arrangements rules, general limitation, general permission, group of companies, income year, net loss, supplement, tax year EZ 37 Accrued income written off EZ 37(1) \[Deduction for bad debt — general\] A deduction is allowed to a person for an amount written off by the person as a bad debt in res p ect of a financial arrangement where and to the extent that— (a) the person derives income in respect of the financial arrangement under any of sections EZ 32, EZ 34(4), EZ 35, and EZ 39; and (b) the amount written off is attributable to that income. EZ 37(2) \[Deduction for bad debt — dealers\] A deduction is allowed to a person for an amount written off by the person as a bad debt i n respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount allowed as a deduction under subsection (1)) where— (a) the person— (i) carries on a business which comprises holding or dealing in such fin a ncial arrangements; and (ii) is not associated with the pe rson owing the amount written off; or (b) the financial arrangement is a trade credit and th e person carries on a business of dealing in the goods or services for which the trade credit is a debt. EZ 37(3) \[Deduction for security payment\] Where a person receives a security payment in relation t o a loss and a deduction is denied to the person for the loss other than under this subsection, the person is allowed a deduction for the loss no greater than the amount of the security payment. WITHDRAWN 29 EZ 37(4) \[Requirements for bad debt deduction\] A deduction for bad debts is allowed under this section only where the requirements of secti on DB 23(1) and (5) have been met. EZ 37(5) \[Requirements for share loss deduction\] A deduction for a share loss (within the meaning of section DB 18) is allowed under sub s ection (3) only where the requirements of section DB 18 have been met. Section EZ 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is identical word for word with section EH 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994, other than in respect of section cross-references where the section numbers have changed. The new section DB 23 is an amalgam of sections DJ 1(a)(i), (iii), (iv) and EH 54 – there are some wording and layout changes, but it does not appear that the law has changed. The Ruling applies in respect of section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 1994 which sets out one of the requirements to be satisfied for a bad debt deduction to be allowed: that “the debt is actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year”. In the Income Tax Act 2004 section DB 23(1)(a) states the requirement in the following terms: that “the debt is written off as bad in the income year”. While the word “actually” is not included in the rewritten provision, the two provisions provide for the same legal tests that a debt must be both bad and written off in the income year for a deduction to be allowed. The conclusion that these are corresponding provisions is confirmed as sections DB 23 and EZ 37 are not listed in schedule 22A of the Income Tax Act 2004 which sets out any identified policy changes in the new Act. While this commentary is concerned with the deductibility of bad debts for the creditor, not remission income of the debtor, it is noted, however, that there has been a change implemented in section CG 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 such that an amount that is remitted is treated as income in the year it is recovered, rather than in the year the deduction was allowed. Saving of binding rulings The new Income Tax Act 2004 states in section YA 4 that certain binding rulings issued in relation to the Income Tax Act 1994 are preserved and continued. This applies where a binding public ruling is issued before 1 April 2005 in relation to a provision in the Income Tax Act 1994 (old law) that corresponds to the Income Tax Act 2004 (new law). The binding ruling about the old law is treated as if it were made about the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 2004. In such circumstances where the application of the binding ruling is continued, a binding ruling on how the new law applies cannot be made. Section YA 4 provides: YA 4 Saving of binding rulings YA 4(1) When, and extent to which, this sectio n applies Th is section applies when, and to the extent to which,— (a) either— (i) an applicant has applied for a private ruling, a product ruling, or a st at us ruling before 1 April 2005 on an arrangement that is entered into, or that the applicant seriously contemplates will be entered into, before the commencement of this Act; or (ii) a public ruling is issued before 1 April 2005; and WITHDRAWN 30 (b) the binding ruling is about a taxation law that is repealed by section YA 1 (old law); and (c) a new taxation law that corresponds to th e o ld law (new law) comes into force at the commencement of this Act; and (d) if this section did not exist, the commencement of this Act would mean that the binding ruling would cease to apply because of section 91G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. YA 4(2) Ruling about new law The binding ruling is treated as if it were made ab ou t the new law, so that the effect of the ruling at the commencement of this Act is the same as its effect before the commencement. YA 4(3) No confirmation rulings To the extent to which a binding ruling continued by subsection (2) applies to an arra ngem ent, or to a person and an arrangement, the Commissioner must not make a binding ruling on how— (a) the new law applies to the arrangement or to th e person and the arrangement; or (b) this subsection applies to the arrangement or to the person and the arrangement. Therefore, because it is considered that sections DJ 1(a)(iii) and EH 6 in the Incom e Tax Act 1994 are corresponding provisions to sections DB 23(1)(a) and EZ 37 in the Income Tax Act 2004, the Ruling and the reasoning in this commentary which relate to section DJ 1(a)(iii) in the Income Tax Act 1994 will be deemed to also relate to section DB 23(1)(a) in the Income Tax Act 2004 from the date the 2004 Act comes into force.

1 DISPOSITIONS WHERE THE TRANSFEROR RESERVES OR RETAINS A BENEFIT OR ADVANTAGE IN REAL PROPERTY—GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): These nine rulings are essentially the same as the previous public rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10, published in Tax Inform ation Bulletin Vol 14, No 12 (December 2002). However, these rulings apply for an indefinite period from 1 April 2005 (the previous rulings expired on 31 March 2005) and apply the Income Tax Act 2004 provisions rather than the Income Tax Act 1994 provisions. The Income Tax Act 2004 came into force on 1 April 2005. The changes between the 1994 and 2004 provisions affecting these rulings are minor wording changes. These changes do not affect the conclusions previously reached. As before, nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings.

Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel WITHDRAWN 1 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 05/02 TO 05/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statem ent, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 05/02-05/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty im plications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 2004. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties A ct 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where som eone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. W ithout section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparen tly similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. WITHDRAWN 2 The new rulings and commentary apply on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. The previous nine rulings on this matter applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2005. The rulings and commentary were published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 12 (December 2002). The main change in these nine rulings is the applicability of the Incom e Tax Act 2004 which came into force on 1 April 2005. The previous nine rulings were under the Income Tax Act 1994. The changes between the 1994 and 2004 Acts provisions affecting these rulings are minor in nature. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Comm issioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 05/02-05/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transf eror grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2.

It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seem ingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. WITHDRAWN 3 The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this comm entary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total am ount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (November 2003) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz . The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transfer ring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor gran ts an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 05/02 and BR Pub 05/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 05/04-05/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. WITHDRAWN 4 A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 05/07-05/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or m oney’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a defini tion of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section– “Ascertainabl e” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: WITHDRAWN 5 “B enefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of an y contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revo cation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as th e annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable peri od, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) B y a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for th e sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as t he original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. WITHDRAWN 6 Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the am ount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapm an J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or char ge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a co nsideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is in adequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in C ommissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to WITHDRAWN 7 prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift m eans. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout CJ notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person m aking the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. WITHDRAWN 8 Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property tr ansferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assum ing the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet poin ts is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distin ction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Diction ary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a ri ght or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation ”, the cases dealing with gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very WITHDRAWN 9 narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapm an J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Comm issioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “res erved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the WITHDRAWN 10 children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and th at, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is no t sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one han d, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has re tained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). Applying these same principles, a number of Aus tralian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where som e property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, WITHDRAWN 11 where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a sim ultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be sim ultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA co ncerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case—when is a transfer simu ltaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords (\[1999\] 1 All ER 297). The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with WITHDRAWN 12 reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded tha t the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was stru ctured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property abs olutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20- year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases ) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlem ent of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to m ake the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the w hole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the WITHDRAWN 13 lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of th e transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High C ourt\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancin g form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and benef iciaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was WITHDRAWN 14 supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the tim e of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situatio n where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgm ents in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. WITHDRAWN 15 The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the fam ily home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an imm ediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffm an in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgm ent in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols , a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for exam ple, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram WITHDRAWN 16 The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property inte rest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, the British Parliam ent enacted anti-avoidance legislation. Section 104 of the Finance Act 1999 inserted sections 102A-102C into the Finance Act 1986 in order to counteract the “lease carve out” scheme which had been held by the House of Lords to be successful in Ingram. This legislation treats gifts of land (or interests in land) on or after 9 March 1999 as property subject to a reservation, where the donor enjoys a “significant right, interest, or is a party to a sign ificant arrangement in relation to the land ...” which entitles or enables the donor to occupy or otherwise enjoy the land. These provisions will not apply where: • The gif t is within the spouse exemption; • The right retained is so negligible that the donor is excluded, or virtually excluded from enjoyment of the land; • The donor pays full consideration for use of the land; In addition, where the donor has acquired their interest in the land m ore than seven years before making the gift, the new provisions will not apply. However, the New Zealand Parliament has not enacted similar legislation to sections 102A–102C of the UK Finance Act 1986. Therefore, the House of Lords reasoning in interpreting section 102 is still an important aide in interpreting our section 70(2) of the EGDA. It is considered that the f act that the British Parliament made a legislative change following the House of Lords’ interpretation of section 102 does not diminish the reasoning of the House of Lords. In New Zealand, where there has been no legislative amendment to section 70(2) of the EGDA, it is considered that the House of Lords reasoning in Ingram is valuable in interpreting section 70(2). Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: WITHDRAWN 17 • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers m ay sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgm ent in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Sim ultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently sim ultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farm s and commercial buildings. After the initial rulings were issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. WITHDRAWN 18 Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interes t to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Sectio n 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 05/ 02 and BR Pub 05/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then tran sfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Comm issioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, (In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146). However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). WITHDRAWN 19 At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which im poses gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal perm ission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. The arrangement in BR Pub 05/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant ba ck to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. WITHDRAWN 20 Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 05/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Comm issioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangem ents which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, th ere is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 05/02 and BR Pub 05/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a sim ultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where th e transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable WITHDRAWN 21 will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 05/04-05/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer w ants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her fam ily home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life. She intends to tr ansfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on dem and. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 com pared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and sim ultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ing ram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the WITHDRAWN 22 transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reve rsionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 05/ 08 and BR Pub 05/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant them selves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be sim ultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 05/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 05/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 05/10 is similar to the arrangem ent in BR Pub 05/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 05/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will WITHDRAWN 23 be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the docum ents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfe rs It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a sim ultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a sim ultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a sim ultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The docum ents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. • There is never a tim e, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the tr ansferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in th e property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants WITHDRAWN 24 Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 05/07-05/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by m aking sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estim ated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the m eaning of section 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. WITHDRAWN 25 Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed am ount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) m ight otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may per mit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the m aking of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all ar e entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life WITHDRAWN 26 expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, m ay be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage com prised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. WITHDRAWN 27 Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B an d reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of tra nsfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $4 2,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is red uced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) i s original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) val ue of the original gift $42,000 (c) gi ft duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 $738.60 738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 WITHDRAWN 28 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CC 1 of the ITA includes within a person’s incom e all rent, a fine, a premium, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any leas e, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CC 1 to the arrang ements. The new rulings and commentary apply on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. The previous nine rulings on this m atter, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2005. They were published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 12 (December 2002). The main change in these nine rulings is the applicability of the Incom e Tax Act 2004 which came into force on 1 April 2005. The previous nine rulings were under the Income Tax Act 1994. The changes between the 1994 and 2004 Acts provisions affecting these rulings are minor in nature and the Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings under the Income Tax Act 1994. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transfero r does not constitute income of the transferee or the transferor under section CC 1(1). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserv ing an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive income under section CC 1(1). The transferee will derive income if the transfe ree grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer WITHDRAWN 29 If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute income to the transferee or the transferor under section CC 1(1). Legislation Under sections CC 1(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Act 2004, income can be derived as f ollows: CC 1(1) An amount described in subsection (2) is income of the owner of land if they derive the amount from— (a) a lease, licence, or easemen t affecting the land; or (b) the grant of a right to tak e the profits of the land. CC 1(2) The amounts are— (a) rent; or (b) a fine; or (c) a premium; or (d) a payment for the goodwill of a business; or (e) a payment for the benefit of a statutory licence; or (f) a payment for the benefit of a statutory privilege; or (g) other revenues. Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: For the purposes of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: lease — (a) means a disposition that c reates a leasehold estate: ... leasehold estate incl udes any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate ... WITHDRAWN 30 estate, for land,— (a) means an estate in the land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and (b) includes a right, whether direct or through a trustee or otherwise, to— (i) the possession of the land; or (ii) the receipt of the rents or profits from the land; or (iii) the proceeds of the disposal of the land; and (c) does not include a mortgage interest,— ... (f) for land, has the same meaning as estate Application of the legislation Section CC 1 deems a person’s income to include all rent, a fine, a prem ium, payment for the goodwill of a business, payments for the benefit of a statutory licence or privilege or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included as income. However, in the arrangements in these rulings only the amounts “rent, a fine, a premium or other revenues” are potentially applicable, and therefore considered. Pre-transfer grant of an interes t in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not aris e under section CC 1. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or revers ionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive rent, a fine, a premium, or other revenues from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications fo r the transferor WITHDRAWN 31 The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive rent, a fine, a premium, or other revenues from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 05/ 02 and BR Pub 05/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reve rsionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CC 1(1) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CC 1(1) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rents, a fine or a prem ium from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or leas e over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a sim ultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an incom e tax liability may arise under section CC 1(1). Post-transfer grants— implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CC 1(1) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CC 1(1) and (2) th at are relevant to the arrangements, to be considered in the following order: • There m ust be rent, a fine, a premium, or other revenues. • The income must be derived by a land owner. WITHDRAWN 32 • The incom e must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1— amoun ts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CC 1(1) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within section CC 1(2); that is: (a) rent; or (b) a fine; or (c) a premium; or (d) a payment for the goodwill of a business; or (e) a payment for the benefit of a statutory licence; or (f) a payment for the benefit of a statutory privilege; or (g) other revenues. The arrangements potentially subject to section CC 1 (the arrangem ents in BR Pub 05/05 and BR Pub 05/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive income if the other two requirements of section CC 1 are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there m ay be no payment made to the transferee. Under section BD 3(4) of the ITA, a person derives income when an amount has been, for example, credited in their account or, in some other way, dealt with in their interest or on their behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transfero r reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to th e transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease o r licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 05/ 05 and BR Pub 05/06 will be subject to section CC 1(1) if they are within section CC 1(2) i.e.: WITHDRAWN 33 (a) rent; or (b) a fine; or (c) a premium; or (d) a payment for the goodwill of a business; or (e) a payment for the benefit of a statutory licence; or (f) a payment for the benefit of a statutory privilege; or (g) other revenues. However, in the arrangements in these rulings only the am ounts “rent, a fine, a premium or other revenues” are potentially applicable. These words in the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 05/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2004, para. 11.087), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangem ent, which is potentially subject to section CC 1(1), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to th e transferor; or • any other paym ent by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This paym ent arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the cons ideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangem ent, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the WITHDRAWN 34 Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental paym ents appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangem ent is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CC 1(2) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The C ommissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margarine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. • Other reven ues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a prem ium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CC 1(2). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CC 1(2) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” m eans revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the m eaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CC 1(2). • Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the sam e as section CE 1(1)(e) ITA 1994, now sections CC 1(1) and (2) ITA 2004) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which WITHDRAWN 35 would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to paym ents that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Henry J did not make any finding about whether or not capital payments may be within section CC 1(2). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CC 1(2), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CC 1 is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CC 1(2) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Mille r and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenues” in section CC 1(2) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. • The context of the s ection The context of the word “revenues” within section CC 1(2) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of paym ents related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by a list, including the words “rent”, “a fine” and “a premium”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing WITHDRAWN 36 goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The first three amounts, “rent”, “a fine” and “a premium” are not linked because they are revenue in natu re. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this list of amounts before “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the com parable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. • Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CC 1(2) m eans revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CC 1). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aim ed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CC 1) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CC 1(2) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment i s best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CC 1. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CC 1(2). • Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) s aid that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: WITHDRAWN 37 Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CC 1\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it h as been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy in tention is to include in section CC 1(2) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CC 1(2). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CC 1(2). • Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CC 1(2) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CC 1(2) is intended to capture am ounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CC 1(2). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J—London Midland and Scottish Rail Co —appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary argum ents are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. • Reliance on Capel v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,195 In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or WITHDRAWN 38 for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CC 1(2) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). Similarly in Capel, the court decided that one goodwill payment attached to the site, and that goodwill payment was within section CC 1(2). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the argum ents already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CC 1(2), are in fact intended to be included in the section. • Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CC 1 In summary, the conclusions are that the am ounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CC 1, because • The am ount is rent or a premium; or • The am ount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not m ean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. • Is the licence arrangement subject to section CC 1(1)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CC 1(1) to the arrangem ent involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CC 1(1) applies involves a licence: the arrangement in BR Pub 05/06. The words listed in section CC 1(2) – “rent”, “fine” and “premium” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CC 1(1) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “a lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor t ransfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • whe re: • th e transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or • t he transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • th e transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and WITHDRAWN 39 • t he amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. • Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CC 1(2)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CC 1(2). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenu es” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 —the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirem ent of section CC 1, that is, whether there are amounts of “rent”, “a fine”, “a premium”, or “other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangem ents in BR Pub 05/05 and BR Pub 05/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3—inco me derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 05/ 05 and BR Pub 05/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family hom e to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life. She transfers the house to the trustees of the trus t. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on dem and. WITHDRAWN 40 The trust has derived income under section CC 1(1) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. • Life es tate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CC 1. The reason is that section CC 1(1) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take the profits of the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 05/04. • Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a “lease for life” is not a lease, but a life esta te. An essential characteristic of a lease is that it has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate: see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life m ay have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by g iving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. Th ey wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives. They transfer the house to the truste es of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on dem and. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived income under section CC 1(1), because the grant of a life estate is not incom e derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take the profits of the land. Post-transfer grants— income tax implications for the transferor WITHDRAWN 41 There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CC 1. Section CC 1 applies to rents, a fine, a premium, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, a fine or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur sim ultaneously, no income tax liability under section CC 1(1) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purp orts to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers— implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rent, a fine, a premium, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transf er includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers— implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rent, a fine, a prem ium, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 05/07-05/10. Spreading income WITHDRAWN 42 When a taxpayer derives income under section CC 1(1), section EI 6 of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and any five later income years.

1 TERTIARY STUDENT ASSOCIATION FEES PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 05/11 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 03/02 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003), and BR Pub 99/1 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 1 (January 1999). BR Pub 03/02 applied up until 31 March 2005. The Income Tax Act 2004 came into force on 1 April 2005, and legislative references are now to that Act. BR Pub 05/11 applies on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section KC 5 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment by a student at a tertiary institution, of a tertiary student association fee as a membership fee to that tertiary student association. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The payment of a tertiary student association membership fee is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4) where any rights arising from membership are conferred by the payment, and/or where the payment is compulsory. Accordingly, a rebate will not be available under section KC 5. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8 th day of June 2005. Susan Price 2 Senior Tax Counsel COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 05/11 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 05/11 (“the Ruling”). For the purposes of this commentary, reference to “associations” includes reference to societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts or funds. Background Section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the Act”) provides a rebate to a donor of a gift of money in certain circumstances, where the recipient of the gift is a non-profit body whose funds are applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purpose(s) within New Zealand. The issue dealt with in the Ruling is whether a tertiary student association membership fee is a “gift” within the meaning of section KC 5 of the Act. The subject matter was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 03/02, which expired on 31 March 2005. This public ruling replaces BR Pub 03/02, effective 1 April 2005. The previous ruling concluded that if a student pays a single fee to the student association to become a member of the student association, and the fee as a whole confers some rights on members, the payment is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4). As the payment of the fee is not a gift, the student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. Legislation Section KC 5 provides: (1) A taxpayer, other than an absentee, or a company, or a public authority, or a Maori authority, or an unincorporated body, or a trustee liable for income tax under sections HH 3 to HH 6 and HZ 2, is allowed as a rebate of income tax the amount of any gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more made by the taxpayer in the tax year to any of the following societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts, or funds (being in each case a society, an institution, an association, an organisation, a trust, or a fund in New Zealand), namely: (aa) a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab) a public institution maintained exclusively for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac) a fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa), 3 by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (ad) a public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any 1 or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ae) - (cl) \[provide a list of organisations.\] (2) The rebates provided for in this section must not, in the case of any taxpayer, in any tax year exceed in the aggregate the smaller of— (a) 33 1 / 3 % of the aggregate of all gifts described in subsection (1): (b) $630. (3) No rebate is allowed under this section in respect of any gift unless the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner in support of the taxpayer's claim for the rebate a receipt evidencing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the making of the gift by the taxpayer. (3AA) Despite subsection (3), a rebate is allowed under this section if a tax agent makes an application for a refund under section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on behalf of a person and— (a) the tax agent sights the receipt evidencing the making of the gift for which a claim is being made; and (b) the person retains the receipt for 4 tax years after the tax year to which the claim relates. (3A) A refund may be made under this section only if section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is complied with. (4) In this section, gift includes a subscription paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, only if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. Application of the Legislation Under section KC 5, a taxpayer other than an absentee, company, public authority, Maori authority, unincorporated body, or trustee liable for income tax (sections HH 3 to HH 6, HZ 2), can claim a rebate if: • that person makes a gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more; • the gift is made to any of the associations listed in section KC 5(1); • the recipient, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”), applies its funds wholly or principally for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes, or is maintained (subparagraphs (ab) and (ac)) or established and maintained exclusively for one or more of those purposes (subparagraph (ad)); 4 • the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner a receipt evidencing the making of the gift by the taxpayer to the recipient, or a tax agent makes the refund application on behalf of the taxpayer and the requirements of section KC 5(3AA) are satisfied; and • section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is complied with. Furthermore, if the gift is a subscription paid to any association specified in section KC 5(4), the Commissioner must be satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other association. Tertiary student association fees are considered “subscriptions” for the purposes of section KC 5(4), as students receive the services provided by the student association, and the rights attaching to membership of that association in return for the fee, or can be said to be applying to participate in the association. As such, any rights arising from membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee, will preclude such fee from the definition of “gift” in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. The definition of “gift” in section KC 5(4) Section KC 5(4) operates as an exhaustive provision with respect to when subscriptions will constitute “gifts” for the purposes of section KC 5, and includes only subscriptions paid to an association if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other association. In Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825, the Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) noted that the Commissioner had allowed the general school activity fee paid to State schools as a deduction, because such fees came within the expanded definition of “gift”. However, the Authority held that payments to a school for camp fees, a school trip, stationery, and a manual were not gifts, as they conferred particular rights on the pupil. Tertiary student association fees will only be a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5(4), and will only qualify for a rebate, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment does not confer any rights arising from membership. Such rights may include things such as rights to do anything, receive anything, or have access to anything in return for the payment. If no rights are received, the payment of a subscription is considered to be in the nature of a donation, because the payer does not get any direct rights in return for the payment. The requirement that a subscription confer no rights does not contain words of apportionment (i.e. “to the extent to which”), but is absolute in its terms. Accordingly, if any rights are conferred by any part of the subscription, section KC 5 does not apply, and no rebate is available. It should be noted that section KC 5(4) refers only to rights being conferred: the rights do not have to be exercised or enjoyed by the taxpayer. 5 Students attending tertiary institutions may pay a sum for membership of a student association or union. Tertiary student association fees will commonly give rise to the following types of rights or benefits: • Access to advice, welfare, and counselling services. • Access to liaison services between students and teaching staff. • Access to newsletters and other information. • Access to facilities on campus, such as library, health, or sport and recreation facilities. • Discounts on various goods and services. • Voting rights in respect of the election of association executives, and also at general meetings. In addition, it may also be that the payment of a student association fee (or a substitute payment to a charity of the student’s choice) 1 is one of a number of payments a student must make, or things a student must do, in order to qualify for enrolment at the particular tertiary institution. The payment of a student association fee may, therefore, confer a further right on students – the right to enrolment if the other conditions of enrolment are met. Any of the above, or any other rights arising from membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee will preclude such a fee from the definition of “gift” in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. The Education (Tertiary Students Association Voluntary Membership) Amendment Act 1998 (“the 1998 EAA”), which came into force on 11 August 1998, abolished compulsory student association membership, except where a referendum of students at an institution determined that membership of the association at that institution would be compulsory. The 1998 EAA was subsequently repealed, from 8 July 2000, by the Education Amendment Act 2000 (“the 2000 EAA”). The 2000 EAA also inserted new provisions into the Education Act 1989, to the effect that tertiary student association membership is now prima facie compulsory, with the ability for a vote of all students at a particular institution to make membership of that association voluntary. Where tertiary student association fees are voluntary, it may well be that some or all of the services listed above are available to all students, whether paying association members or not. However, students who pay association fees may also be accorded 1 The Education Act 1989 provides that a student association may exempt any student from membership of the association on the grounds of conscientious objection; and, if exempted, the association must pay the student’s membership fee to a charity of its choice. 6 the right to vote to elect association executives, and at general meetings. Further, students who pay association fees may have access to discounts not available to non- paying students. As stated above, any rights arising from association membership, which are conferred by the payment of a tertiary student association fee will preclude such a fee from the definition of “gift” in section KC 5(4), and accordingly no rebate will be available under section KC 5. Where tertiary student association fees are voluntary, it may be that there are in fact no rights arising from membership in that or any other association, conferred upon students who elect to pay association fees. It is only in this circumstance that the payment of such fees will constitute a gift within the meaning in section KC 5(4), and a rebate will be allowable accordingly, provided the other criteria of section KC 5 are satisfied. Any right conferred by the payment of student association fees will be sufficient to prevent the rebate from being available. It should be emphasised that it will only be in the very limited circumstances detailed above that a rebate will be available. In the event that there are in fact no rights arising from membership in a tertiary student association with compulsory fees, the payment of such fees will also not be considered a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4), as it would fail to meet the fundamental precept that a gift must be something transferred voluntarily, and not as a result of a contractual or other obligation to transfer it 2 . Given that section KC 5(4) operates to extend the definition of the term “gift” to include certain subscriptions, the general common law requirement for a gift to be voluntary remains applicable, and it is only the common law consideration of whether any advantage or benefit of material character is received in return, which is modified by section KC 5(4). Example 1 A student enrols at a university, the student association of which has compulsory membership. The student pays the association fees, and is able to use the gym facilities, counselling services, and the subsidised health care programme. The student association has charitable status. As the payment of the student association fees confers certain rights upon the student, the payment does not qualify for a rebate as a donation to the student association. However, if a person who is not a student makes a donation to the student association at the university and no rights are conferred because of the payment, a gift is made and a rebate is allowed. Example 2 2 In this regard, see for instance Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, Federal Commissioner of Taxation v McPhail (1968) 117 CLR 111, Lawson Klopper & Anor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 97 ATC 4179, Hodges v FC of T (1997) 97 ATC 2158, Australian Dairy Corporation v FC of T (1998) 98 ATC 2059, and Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451. 7 A student enrols at a polytechnic, the student association of which has voluntary membership. The student believes in and wishes to support the work of the association, and so elects to pay the association fees. The services provided by the association are available to all students at the polytechnic, regardless of whether they are paying members or not. No discounts are available to students who have contributed association fees. The association’s Constitution deems all students at the polytechnic to be “members”, and accordingly able to exercise all membership rights, for instance the right to vote at general meetings. The student association has charitable status. As the payment of the student association fee does not confer any rights upon the student, a rebate will be available, provided the other criteria set out in section KC 5 are satisfied (these criteria are listed under the heading “Application of the Legislation”, above).
1 TAXABILITY OF PAYMENTS UNDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1993 FOR HUMILIATION, LOSS OF DIGNITY, AND INJURY TO FEELINGS PUBLIC RULING—BR Pub 05/12 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as Public Ruling BR Pub 01/09 published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). However, the new ruling has been updated to take into account amendments to the Human Rights Act 1993 as a result of the Human Rights Amendment Act 2001. This new ruling also applies the Income Tax Act 2004, which came into force on 1 April 2005, rather than the Income Tax Act 1994 provisions. The changes between the 1994 and 2004 provisions affecting this ruling do not affect the conclusions previously reached. The ruling applies for an indefinite period. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CA 1 and CE 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: • The payment of an award of damages to a complainant or aggrieved person as granted by the Human Rights Review Tribunal for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 92M(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993, where the complaint involves an employer/employee relationship; or • The making of a payment to a complainant or aggrieved person for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings pursuant to an out of court settlement genuinely based on the complainant or aggrieved person’s rights to damages under section 92M(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 where the complaint involves an employer/employee relationship. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Payments for damages or out of court settlements that are genuinely and entirely awarded for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 2 92M(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are not income under section CE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. • Payments for damages or out of court settlements that are genuinely and entirely awarded for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 92M(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are not income under ordinary concepts under section CA 1(2). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received on and after 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of June 2005. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 05/12 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 05/12 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/09 published in TIB Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). This Ruling applies for an indefinite period. Background The Human Rights Act 1993 (“the HRA”) provides protection for people against discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, religious or ethical belief, race, colour, ethnic or national origins, age, disability, political opinion, employment status, family status, and sexual orientation. Under the Act people can make a complaint to the Human Rights Commission (“the Commission”) regarding breaches of the provisions of the Act. If the Commission is unable to settle the complaint, the matter may proceed to the Human Rights Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”). The Tribunal is an independent body that hears and determines complaints that have been made to the Commission. The Tribunal has the power of a court similar to the District Court, and its decisions can be enforced in the District Court if parties fail to comply with its orders or directions. Significant changes were made to the HRA in 2001, including changes to the functions and powers of the Commission, the merging of the office of the Race Relations Conciliator with the Human Rights Commission and establishing the Office of Human Rights Proceedings. Changes were made to the way complaints are received and resolved. The Complaints Review Tribunal also became the Human Rights Review Tribunal following the amendments. The Government’s exemption from full compliance with the HRA also expired on 31 December 2001. The new Part 1A makes the Government, government agencies and anybody who performs a public function accountable, subject to certain exceptions, for unlawful discrimination. There were certain consequential changes to the sections of the HRA referred to in BR Pub 01/09 and the Ruling now refers to the current sections. Legislation Section 92I of the HRA provides a number of remedies for the Tribunal when the Tribunal determines that a breach of any of the provisions of Part 1A and Part 2 of that 4 Act has been committed or where there has been a breach of the terms of a settlement of complaint. Section 92I of the HRA provides: 92I. Remedies— (1) This section is subject to sections 92J and 92K (which relate to the only remedy that may be granted by the Tribunal if it finds that an enactment is in breach of Part 1A). (2) In proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal brought under section 92B(1) or (4) or section 92E, the plaintiff may seek any of the remedies described in subsection (3) that the plaintiff thinks fit. (3) If, in proceedings referred to in subsection (2), the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint, the Tribunal may grant 1 or more of the following remedies: (a) a declaration that the defendant has committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint: (b) an order restraining the defendant from continuing or repeating the breach, or from engaging in, or causing or permitting others to engage in, conduct of the same kind as that constituting the breach, or conduct of any similar kind specified in the order: (c) damages in accordance with sections 92M to 92O: (d) an order that the defendant perform any acts specified in the order with a view to redressing any loss or damage suffered by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person as a result of the breach: (e) a declaration that any contract entered into or performed in contravention of any provision of Part 1A or Part 2 is an illegal contract: (f) an order that the defendant undertake any specified training or any other programme, or implement any specified policy or programme, in order to assist or enable the defendant to comply with the provisions of this Act: (g) relief in accordance with the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 in respect of any such contract to which the defendant and the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person are parties: (h) any other relief the Tribunal thinks fit. (4) It is no defence to proceedings referred to in subsection (2) or subsection (5) that the breach was unintentional or without negligence on the part of the party against whom the complaint was made, but, subject to section 92P, the Tribunal must take the conduct of the parties into account in deciding what, if any, remedy to grant. (5) In proceedings before the Human Rights Review Tribunal brought, under section 92B(3), by the person against whom a complaint was made, that person may seek a declaration that he or she has not committed a breach of Part 1A or Part 2. Section 92M(1) of the HRA provides the circumstances in which damages may be awarded under the Act, including damages payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings: 92M. Damages— (1) In any proceedings under section 92B(1) or (4) or section 92E, the Tribunal may award damages against the defendant for a breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint in respect of any 1 or more of the following: 5 (a) pecuniary loss suffered as a result of, and expenses reasonably incurred by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person for the purpose of, the transaction or activity out of which the breach arose: (b) loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, that the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person might reasonably have been expected to obtain but for the breach: (c) humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person. (2) This section applies subject to sections 92J, 92N, and 92O. Part 1A of the HRA provides for the compliance and accountability of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of the government of New Zealand; or by any person or body in the performance of any public function, power, or duty conferred or imposed on that person or body by or pursuant to law. Part 2 of the HRA sets out what constitutes “unlawful discrimination” under that Act. Section 21 of that Act sets out the general prohibited grounds of discrimination, and sections 22 to 74 go on to deal with discrimination in specific situations. Section 92M(1) of the HRA also refers to “the breach of Part 1A or Part 2 or the terms of a settlement of a complaint”. Section 83 of that Act provides that the “Commission must use its best endeavours to assist the parties to secure a settlement”. “Settlement” is defined in that section to mean “the agreement of the parties concerned on actions that settle the matter, which may include the payment of compensation” and includes “a satisfactory assurance by the person to whom the complaint relates against the repetition of the conduct”. Section 89 provides that a “settlement between parties to a complaint may be enforced by proceedings before the Tribunal brought under section 92B(4)” of the HRA, which provides: 92B. Civil proceedings arising from complaints— ... (4) If parties to a complaint under section 76(2)(a) have reached a settlement of the complaint (whether through mediation or otherwise) but one of them is failing to observe a term of the settlement, another of them may bring proceedings before the Tribunal to enforce the settlement. In respect of section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA, any such breach of a settlement of a complaint would equally relate to damages for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings. The Ruling considers whether payments granted under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee are “amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service”, for the purposes of section CE 1 or, alternatively income under ordinary concepts under section CA 1(2). Section CE 1 provides: The following amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service are income of the person: (a) salary or wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay, or gratuity: (b) expenditure on account of an employee that is expenditure on account of the person: 6 (c) the market value of board that the person receives in connection with their employment or service: (d) a benefit received under a share purchase agreement: (e) directors' fees: (f) compensation for loss of employment or service: (g) any other benefit in money. Section CA 1(2) states that “\[a\]n amount is also income of a person if it is their income under ordinary concepts”. Application of the Legislation If payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings, under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA were “amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service”, they would be included under section CE 1 as income of the person. Section CE 1(g) includes in income amounts that are “any other benefit in money”, if they are “amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service”. Payments under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA are a benefit in money. The issue is, therefore, whether these payments are “amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service”. While many of the categories of discrimination in the HRA may relate, directly or indirectly, to an employer/employee relationship, it is clear that many of them are intended to apply to much wider situations. Consequently, in many instances of complaints under the HRA, payments awarded will be completely outside any employment relationship and will clearly not be, in respect of a recipient taxpayer, “in connection with their employment or service”. In such cases payments under section 92M(1)(c) will not fall within the income of the person under section CE 1. The Ruling does not consider such situations. However, it is likely that complaints heard by the Tribunal under the HRA will often involve an employee/employer relationship. The question to be answered in the Ruling, therefore, is whether payments under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA where the complaint involves an employee/employer relationship are made “in connection with their employment or service”. Relationship with Income Tax Act 1994 The Income Tax Act 2004 introduces the concept of an amount received by a person “in connection with their employment or service” being income of a person. Previously, the 1994 Act referred to an amount being monetary remuneration, and thus gross income, if it was an amount derived by a person “in respect of or in relation to” their employment or service. The wording of the 2004 Act provision is different to that in the 1994 Act. However, while the 2004 Act has replaced the 1994 Act, section YA 3(3) of the 2004 Act nevertheless provides that provisions of the 2004 Act are the provisions of the 1994 Act 7 in rewritten form. The provisions of the 2004 Act are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provision of the 1994 Act. The exception is, pursuant to section YA 3(5), where an “identified policy change”, as specified in schedule 22A, exists. In this instance no identified policy change has been specified in schedule 22A. Therefore, the presumption is that the adoption of the term “in connection with” was not intended to give rise to an interpretation that differs from that which would apply if the term “in respect of or in relation to”, as used in the definition of “monetary remuneration” under the 1994 Act, still applied. It is therefore relevant to consider the meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” in the interpretation of the phrase “in connection with” in this situation. The meaning of “in connection with” The phrase “in connection with” is not defined in the Act. However, it has been considered in other contexts. In Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272, Hardie Boys J stated, at page 279: “In connection with” may signify no more than a relationship between one thing and another. The expression does not necessarily require that it be a causal relationship: Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465, 479 per Wilcox J. But, as Davies J warned in Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487, at p 491: “Expressions such as ‘relating to’, ‘in connection with’ and ‘in respect of’ are commonly found in legislation but invariably raise problems of statutory interpretation. They are terms which fluctuate in operation from statute to statute.... The terms may have a very wide operation but they do not usually carry the widest possible ambit, for they are subject to the context in which they are used, to the words with which they are associated, and to the object or purpose of the statutory provision in which they appear.” In Case E84, Bathgate DJ noted at page 59,445: It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. In Hatrick (A) & Co v R \[1923\] AC 213, the Privy Council considered the meaning of “in connection with” in the context of section 10 of the Government Railway Act 1908, which empowered the Minister of Railways to fix charges to be paid for goods stored in any shed or store “in connection with a railway”. Their Lordships stated, at page 225: In the view of their Lordships these words cannot apply to something done on a space or in a building merely contiguous to or abutting upon a railway, even though it be the property of a railway; if the thing done forms no part of or has no connection with the property business or a railway, as a carrier of passengers and goods by rail, or in other words that the expression “in connection with a railway” means connect with, subserving and being ancillary to, the business of a railway as such carriers ... These words ... must be direct to something different from propinquity or contiguity, and in their Lordships’ view, having regard to all the provisions of the statute, mean in s 10 in connection with the business and operations of a railway as a carrier of goods by rail. 8 In Hammington v Ross (1992) 2 NZ ConvC 191,150, the High Court considered whether a lawyer’s omission to disclose his investment in the client’s product to the client was a “civil liability incurred in connection with the provision of professional services”. McGechan J stated, at page 191,162: One next goes to the operative clause. It provides cover for claims arising from civil liability incurred “in connection with” provision of “professional services”. The clause is a broad one. It extends to “civil liability”, not mere classical “neglect, error or omission”. It extends to claims incurred “in connection with” the provision of professional services, as contrasted with “in the” provision of professional services. It is not limited to strict integral components of those very services themselves. With that wider wording it was conceded, and rightly, that activity covered would include omission to provide, and “ancillary conduct not strictly professional work – eg, the business advice here”. Clearly however there must be a nexus between such wider activity giving rise to liability and the professional services. The wider activity must be related, and not merely co-existent. In Pan Pacific Forest Industries (NZ) Ltd v Norwich General (1997) 7 TCLR 560, the High Court considered whether an insurance policy applied where the product supplied was faulty. The relevant policy applied to “accidental loss of...property...resulting from accidents in connection with the business”. Paterson J stated at page 569: The operative provisions of the policy apply of the accident was “in connection with the business”. Giving those words their natural and ordinary meaning the accident did arise in connection with the business if it arose because the business supplied faulty materials and parts and gave faulty advice. The phrase “in connection with”, has also been considered in the context of section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994, a provision that allows a tax deduction for costs incurred “in connection with” the determination of a liability to tax. In that context, Bathgate DJ found in Case E84 that the term required a narrow interpretation. He said, at page 59,445: It may be that only an empirical and common sense approach to the interpretation of the words can be applied in each particular case to determine where, if at all, the line should be drawn to allow or not allow expenditure “in connection with” an assessment. However I believe that a narrow interpretation of the words “... any expenditure ... in connection with ... the assessment ...” is the correct interpretation: only expenditure closely and immediately connected to the assessment itself is intended to be allowed as a deduction, and expenditure more remote, as for instance in this case, the expenditure of O in making his trip to visit A, is not expenditure allowed as a deduction under the section. This case suggests that, in the context of section DJ 5, the phrase “in connection with” requires a close linkage between the expenditure and the “determination” or “calculation” of a liability to tax. The above cases suggest that for something to be “in connection with” something else, a relevant nexus is required, and that the two things must be related to each other in some way. Overall, the Commissioner considers that they suggest a broad interpretation should be given to the term. The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” It is also necessary to consider the relevant words that were used in the Income Tax Act 1994. As noted, in that Act the relevant test was whether an amount was “in respect of or in relation to” employment, and thus “monetary remuneration”. 9 The Court of Appeal endorsed a very wide meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. In Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, where lump sum payments had been made by Shell to employees who transferred at the request of Shell, the Court discussed the relevant part of the definition of “monetary remuneration”. McKay J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 11,306: The words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. Although McKay J acknowledged that the payments in Shell were not made under the contract of employment in that case, this did not mean that the employees received the payment outside the employee relationship. The learned Judge had earlier referred to the fact that the payments were not expressly provided under the employees’ written employment contracts, but were made pursuant to Shell’s employment policy as a matter of discretion. They were still made “because he or she is an employee”. Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject-matters to which the words refer. Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. Other New Zealand cases (Case U38 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,361 and CIR v Kerslake (2001) 20 NZTC 17,158) have also considered the phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. Both cases are consistent with the authorities cited above in this commentary. Context may affect the meaning However, many cases have demonstrated that the meaning to be given to the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” may vary according to the context in which it appears. In State Government Insurance Office v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in determining whether the debt due to the Government Insurance Office fell within section 292(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1961-1975 (Q.) as “amounts ... due in respect of workers’ compensation under any law relating to workers’ compensation accrued before the relevant date”. The Court held that amounts which could be recovered by the Government Insurance Office from an uninsured company pursuant to section 8(5) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1916-1974(Q.) for money paid to workers employed by the uninsured company were not amounts due “in respect of” workers’ compensation under the Companies Act. At page 561 Mason J observed that: 10 ... as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to “in respect of” depends very much on the context in which it is found. Stephen J also discussed the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”, noting at pages 553- 554 that it was capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity, and went on to say: Were the phrase devoid of significant context, it could, I think, be taken to be descriptive of the relationship between the present indebtedness owed to the State Government Insurance Office and the subject matter of workers’ compensation. However a context does exist which is in my view sufficient to confine the operation of s 292(1)(c) to bounds too narrow to be of service to the appellant. In TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190, certain payments were made to a New Zealand distributor by its overseas parent in relation to repairs which had to be made to cars sold to the New Zealand subsidiary and then sold to dealers. The issue was whether the payments were zero-rated for GST purposes. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was relevant. Part of the definition of “consideration” states: ...any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services ... The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: A sub-issue is whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer (MC) was made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the repair work in the sense required by the definition of “consideration” in s 2 of the Act. ... Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, commonsense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, i.e, whether the link is strong enough. The High Court’s decision on the appeal of Case R34 is CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819, which was later upheld by the Court of Appeal. In the High Court McGechan J said: ...it is necessary there be a genuine connection. The legislature is not to be taken as taxing on an unrealistic or tenuous connection basis. In Cleland v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,086, the High Court considered the tax treatment of sums awarded to the taxpayer by the Employment Court for a personal grievance he brought against his employer. The Employment Court awarded a total amount of $126,000, comprising $46,000 for loss of wages, $50,000 for loss of benefits, and $30,000 for humiliation. There was no issue regarding the amount paid for humiliation before Hammond J in the High Court, and accordingly he made no comment on this amount. He concluded that the amount paid for lost wages was therefore assessable as “monetary remuneration”. In respect of the further amount of $50,000, Hammond J concluded that it was compensation for loss of office or employment. In order to reach this conclusion Hammond J had to consider whether the amount was “in respect of or in relation to” the taxpayer’s employment or service. 11 Hammond J referred to the Court of Appeal decision in Shell and noted that those words are to be interpreted widely. Counsel for the taxpayer relied heavily on the Full Federal Court decision in Rowe. Hammond J stated at paragraphs 46 to 48 of his judgment: The award is clearly a “rolled up” one by the Employment Court in respect of or in relation to Mr Cleland’s past employment. ... As a sub-part of the argument, it was said for Mr Cleland that, because the award was calculated on future wages and benefits, it was not compensation for (past) loss of office or employment. That is not the test. The test is whether the wages and benefits actually awarded arose out of Mr Cleland’s employment. It does not at all follow that, because the award was made relating to a period after the termination of the employment, it was not made in respect of, or in relation to, the employment. As Mr Almao said, “compensation for loss of office or employment by its very nature encompasses future benefits; benefits that an employee might have received had his or her employment continued”. Similarly, the meaning of the words “in connection with” can be affected by the context in which they are used. In this regard, the context in which the words “in connection with” are used is to provide that a benefit in money will be income of a person where it is derived “in connection with their employment or service”. Therefore, as noted above the term “in connection with” has a wide meaning, but only, in this context, in respect of “employment or service”. Not all payments to employees are “in connection with” employment or service However, there is authority to support the view that not all payments made by an employer to an employee are in connection with employment, or previously within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. In Fraser v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,356, at page 12,363, Doogue J in the High Court said: There is no dispute that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” are words of the widest possible scope: see Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 at page 11,306, and Smith v FC of T 87 ATC 4883; (1987) 164 CLR 513; (1987) 19 ATR 274. Mr Harley does, however, submit, correctly, that it does not follow that all payments made are necessarily income and refers, for example, to reimbursement payments. In FC of T v Rowe (1995) ATC 4,691 the taxpayer was employed as an engineer for the Livingston Shire Council. As a result of a number of complaints against him he was suspended. An inquiry was commenced, and he incurred legal costs as a result of engaging counsel to defend himself against dismissal during the course of the inquiry. The taxpayer was cleared of any charges of misconduct but was dismissed a year later. The taxpayer claimed his legal costs as a deduction. Although the Council refused to reimburse the taxpayer for his legal costs, the Queensland government subsequently made an ex gratia payment. The Full Federal Court considered, amongst other things, whether the ex gratia payment constituted assessable income. By majority, the Court concluded that the payment was not assessable under section 25(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as income in accordance with ordinary concepts, nor was it assessable under section 26(e) of that Act as being compensation “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to” any employment. Accordingly, Burchett and Drummond JJ (with 12 Beaumont J dissenting) held that the payment was not assessable. Burchett J held that the payment was not a reward for the taxpayer’s services but was a recognition of the wrong done to him. The payments were not remuneration but a reparation, and they were not sufficiently related to the performance of income-earning activities. On the same reasoning, it was too remote from the employment to be caught by section 26(e). Further, the payment was not assessable under section 26(e) because the employer/employee relationship between the Council and the taxpayer was merely part of the background facts against which the ex gratia payment was made. On appeal, the majority of the Full High Court confirmed the Federal Court’s decision: FC of T v Rowe (1997) ATC 4,317. In the Australian case of FCT v Dixon (1954) 5 AITR 443, the taxpayer received payments from his prior employer topping up his military pay. It would appear from the judgment that the Australian Commissioner argued that even a slight relationship to employment was sufficient to satisfy the test in section 26(e) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \[which made assessable certain sums granted to the taxpayer “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment...”.\]. This argument was rejected by Dixon CJ and Williams J, who stated at page 446 that: We are not prepared to give effect to this view of the operation of s.26(e) ...There can, of course, be no doubt that the sum of £104 represented an allowance, gratuity or benefit allowed or given to the taxpayer by Macdonald, Hamilton and Company. Our difficulty is in agreeing with the view that it was allowed or given to him in respect of, or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of, or services rendered by him ...We are not prepared to give s.26(e) a construction which makes it unnecessary that the allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium shall in any sense be a recompense or consequence of the continued or contemporaneous existence of the relation of employer and employee or a reward for services rendered given either during the employment or at or in consequence of its termination. In the same case, at page 450, McTiernan J stated that: The words of paragraph (e) are wide, but, I think, not wide enough to prevent an employer from giving money or money’s worth to an employee continuing in his service or leaving it, without incurring liability to tax in respect of the gift. The relationship of employer and employee is a matter of contract. The contractual relations are not so total and all embracing that there cannot be personal or social relations between employer and employee. A payment arising from those relations may have no connexion with the donee’s employment. These principles have also been applied by the courts in cases involving contracts for services. In Scott v FCT (1969) 10 AITR 367, Windeyer J in the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the words “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him” in section 26(e) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1961. The case concerned a solicitor who received a gift of £10,000 from a grateful client. Windeyer J stated at page 374 that the meaning of the words of the legislation “must be sought in the nature of the topic concerning which they are used”. Windeyer J at page 376 referred to a passage from the judgment of Kitto J in Squatting Investment Co Ltd v FCT (1953) 5 AITR 496, at 524, where Kitto J (speaking of certain English cases) said: The distinction these decisions have drawn between taxable and non-taxable gifts is the distinction between, on the one hand, gifts made in relation to some activity or occupation of the donee of an income- producing character ... and, on the other hand, gifts referable to the attitude of the donor personally to the donee personally. 13 Adopting this as a general principle, his Honour held that the £10,000 was not given or received as remuneration for services rendered and it did not form part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. J & G Knowles & Associates Pty Ltd v FC of T (2000) ATC 4,151 discusses the words “in respect of the employment” in the Australian FBT legislation. This case concerned interest-free loans to directors of a corporate trustee. Units in the trust fund were held by discretionary family trusts established by the directors. The lower courts were satisfied by a causal relationship, or a discernible and rational link between the loans and each director’s employment. However, the Full Federal Court said that there had to be more than just any causal relationship between the benefit and the employment: the link had to be sufficient or material. In the Commissioner’s view, the term “in connection with”, in the context of a payment being made “in connection with” a person’s employment or service, is to be given a very broad interpretation and has a very wide operation. However, it is still necessary for there to be a sufficient relationship or nexus between the payment and the person’s employment or service. The nature and context of the payments For an amount to be “in connection with employment” there must be a sufficient or material relationship between the payment and the employment. Under section 92M of the HRA, damages may be awarded by the Tribunal for a breach of any of the provisions of Part 1A and Part 2 of that Act or where there has been a breach of the terms of a settlement of a complaint. As discussed above, breaches may not necessarily be in an employee/employer situation. If a claim is brought in the Tribunal which does not involve an employee/employer relationship it is clear that payment under section 92M(1)(c) cannot be described as monetary remuneration. Where the complaint brought before the Tribunal does occur in the context of an employee/employer relationship, the connection of the employment relationship with payments under the HRA is tenuous. The HRA is not “employment legislation”, although it may often operate in the employment context. Payments under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the employment relationship. Rather the payments would be in the nature of reparation for a wrong done to the complainant and so would not be in respect of employment. Payments of damages awards under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA differ markedly from the situation in Shell v CIR. In that case at page 11,306, McKay J said: It is true ...that the payment is not made under the contract of employment....It is nevertheless paid to an employee only because he or she is an employee, and is paid to compensate for the loss incurred in having to change the employee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the company. (Emphasis added) 14 Thus, in the Shell case, the employees received the payments as employees, and in order to compensate for the loss sustained as a result of the employment-related relocation. The Commissioner considers payments under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA to be too remote from the employment relationship to be regarded as being an amount derived by a person “in connection with their employment or service”. This is consistent with the view previously reached that such amounts are not within the definition of “monetary remuneration” under the Income Tax Act 1994. If a complaint is brought in the Tribunal which involves an employee and an employer, the employment relationship in such instances is merely part of the background facts against which the damages payments are made. The payments are not made “in connection with their employment or service”. Income under ordinary concepts Payments for damages made under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA are not “income under ordinary concepts” under section CA 1(2). Although the legislation does not define “income under ordinary concepts”, a great number of cases have identified the concept by reference to such characteristics as periodicity, recurrence, and regularity, or by its resulting from business activities, the deliberate seeking of profit, or the performance of services (Scott v C of T (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 21 and Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176). It is clear that payments under section 92M(1)(c) will not generally be made periodically or regularly, or generally recur. Nor as we have seen above, are they compensation for services. Capital receipts do not form part of a person’s income unless there is a specific legislative provision to the contrary. And by analogy with common law damages, damages payments under section 92M(1)(c) of the HRA are of a capital nature as Barber DJ acknowledged in Case L92, where he stated at page 1,536 that: I appreciate only too well that it is possible to interpret the evidence as showing that the $7,179.30 was formulated as a payment in the nature of common law damages for human hurt and breach and unfairness... I appreciate that the latter concepts are akin more to payments of capital than to wage revenue. Out of court settlements The Commission endeavours to settle disputes between parties and sometimes, the parties negotiate a settlement before the dispute is referred to the Tribunal. The settlement agreement may state that the payment is for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. In return for the complainant or aggrieved person surrendering his or her rights under the HRA, the other party will agree to pay a sum of money. There should be no difference in the tax treatment of the payments dependent on whether or not the parties use the Tribunal. A payment can be for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the complainant or aggrieved person whether the Tribunal is involved or not. Shams 15 The Ruling will not apply to payments which are akin to sham payments. A sham is a transaction set up to conceal the true intention of the parties and is inherently ineffective. The nature of a sham was discussed by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Investment Ltd \[1967\] 1 All ER 518 at 528 where he stated: I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the “sham”, which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. Richardson J, in the New Zealand case of Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, stated that the “essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged” in a sham situation. It is noteworthy that, in the Taxation Review Authority decision, Case S 96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603, Judge Barber stated at page 7,606: Of course, seemingly excessive allocations to compensation for feelings injury should be reopened by the IRD. If the parties to an agreement agree to characterise or describe payments as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings when they are in reality for lost wages, this transaction would be a sham which would be open to challenge by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, he may ask the parties to an agreement what steps they took to evaluate objectively what would be a reasonable amount to attribute to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement and whether or not the agreement is settled by the Human Rights Commissioner under the HRA. The onus of proof regarding the taxability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer.
1 DIRECTORS’ FEES AND GST PUBLIC RULING—BR Pub 05/13 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 00/11 which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 11 (November 2000). BR Pub 00/11 applied until 31 March 2005. BR Pub 05/13 applies on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 6(3)(b), 8, and 57(2)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement, occupation, or employment of a person as a director of a company. The engagement may either be by direct contract between the director and the company for whom the person acts as a director, or by a third party appointing, or agreeing to provide, a director to a company. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • If a natural person is engaged as a director and the services are not undertaken as part of carrying on the person’s own taxable activity, the engagement will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity. • If a natural person is engaged as a director as part of carrying on his or her taxable activity, the proviso to section 6(3)(b) will apply and the services will be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the person will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services. 2 • If a natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company and the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity: • the engagement of the natural person as a director will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity; • the provision by the third party of the services of the natural person director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party has not been engaged as a director of a company. If the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that third party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s services as a director of the company under section 8. • If a natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company and the engagement is part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity: • the engagement of the natural person director will fall within the proviso to section 6(3)(b) and the services will be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity; • the provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. If the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that third party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s services as a director of the company under section 8. • If an employee, as part of his or her employment, is engaged as a director of a third party company by way of a contract between his or her employer and the third party company: • the engagement of the employee will fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on a taxable activity of the employee; • the provision by the employer of the services of a director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the employer is not engaged as a director of a company. If the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that employer will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the employee’s services as a director of the company under section 8. 3 • If an employee is engaged by a third party company to be a director of that company, where: the employee is required to account to the employer for the director’s fees received; there is no contract between the employer company and the third party company; and where the employee does not undertake the services as part of carrying on his or her own taxable activity: • the engagement as director will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity; • if the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the employer is required to account for GST on the consideration received for the supply of services to the employee under section 8, i.e. permitting the employee to be a director. • If a partner in a partnership accepts an engagement as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business: • the activity of the partner, in accepting the engagement as a director, falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b); • the provision by the partnership of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the partnership is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s services as a director of the company as it is considered to be part of the normal taxable activity of the partnership. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the day of 2005. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 4 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 05/13 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 05/13 (“the Ruling”). Background Section 6 defines the term “taxable activity” for the purposes of the Act. Under section 6(1), a person conducts a taxable activity when all the following characteristics are present: • There is some form of activity. • The activity is carried on continuously or regularly. • The activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. Section 6(3) provides certain exclusions from the term “taxable activity”. Under section 6(3)(b), the activities of a salary and wage earner or of a person in receipt of directors’ fees are excluded from the term. Under the proviso to section 6(3)(b), if a person in carrying on a taxable activity accepts any office, any services supplied by that person in holding that office are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Therefore, if a GST registered sole trader who, in carrying on his or her taxable activity, takes on a company directorship, the proviso applies and GST is chargeable on the directors’ fees paid. Public Information Bulletin (PIB) 164 issued in August 1987 contained an item titled “GST on Directors’ Fees”. The item concerned the circumstances in which directors’ fees did and did not attract GST. The item listed indicators that could be used in identifying the correct GST treatment to be applied to directors’ fees. These indicators were: 1. Directors’ fees paid to directors personally, and retained by them. Not subject to GST—excluded from the meaning of taxable activity by section 6(3)(b). 2. Directors’ fees paid to directors personally, but applied by them to their partnership or business income, where the partnership or business is a registered person. Subject to GST—subject to the proviso to section 6(3)(b). 5 3. Directors’ fees paid directly to director’s partnership or company, where that partnership or company is a registered person. Subject to GST—a normal taxable supply. In July 1988 the Department issued PIB 175 containing, at page 26, a further item “GST on Directors’ Fees”, restricting the policy set down in PIB 164. The item advised that the proviso to section 6(3)(b) applies only to a sole trader, e.g. an accountant (being a registered person) who, in carrying on his or her taxable activity, is appointed a director of a company. The statement said that directors’ fees paid to a partner in a partnership or to a shareholder, director, or employee of another company are not therefore subject to GST. The reason given for this interpretation was that, in terms of the Companies Act 1955, a director could only be a natural person. Therefore, directors’ fees either paid to directors on behalf of their companies or partnerships, or paid direct to the company or partnership for directorship services carried out by their employees or partners, do not attract GST under this policy. In September 1996 Inland Revenue published an interpretation statement in Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 8, No 4 on “Tax deductions from directors’ fees paid to GST registered persons”. This interpretation statement is also relevant to the subject matter of this Ruling, even though it deals with tax deductions under the Income Tax Act 1994. The statement says, at page 3, that if an employee is acting as a director of a company on behalf of another company, the directors’ fees paid are for services rendered by the employer company. Regulation 4(2) of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“the Regulations”) states that payments for work done or services rendered by a company are not withholding payments. Therefore, tax deductions are not required to be made from the payments. Similarly, if a company pays directors’ fees to a partnership account in return for the partner performing partnership services, the fees are business income of the partners and the Commissioner will not require tax deductions to be made under section NC 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Therefore, if it is the company or partnership that is providing the services of its employee or partner as a director, the question arises as to whether GST should be charged on these services as they would normally be supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of the company or partnership. In September 2000 Inland Revenue published public binding ruling BR Pub 00/09 in TIB Vol 12, No 9 to replace the policy items on “GST on Directors’ Fees” contained in PIBs 164 and 175. Inadvertently, BR Pub 00/09 contained an application period that could be seen to be retrospective, as the period of the ruling issued was effective from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2005. As the ruling was intended to apply prospectively, BR Pub 00/09 was withdrawn in November 2000 in TIB Vol 12, No 11 and BR Pub 00/11 was issued in its place for the period 26 October 2000 to 31 March 2005. This ruling, with similar content, replaces BR Pub 00/11, which expired 31 March 2005, and is effective on 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. 6 Legislation Section 2(1) defines the words “person”, “registered person” and “unincorporated body” as follows: “Person” includes a company, an unincorporated body of persons, a public authority, and a local authority: “Registered person” means a person who is registered or is liable to be registered under this Act: “Unincorporated body” means an unincorporated body of persons, including a partnership, a joint venture, and the trustees of a trust: Section 6 states: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term “taxable activity” means— (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the activities of any public authority or any local authority. (2) Anything done in connection with the beginning or ending, including a premature ending, of a taxable activity is treated as being carried out in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity. (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, for the purposes of this Act the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to any person,— (a) Being a natural person, any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (aa) Not being a natural person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (b) Any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company: Provided that where any person, in carrying on any taxable activity, accepts any office, any services supplied by that person as the holder of that office shall be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity; or... (Emphasis added) Section 8(1), dealing with the imposition of goods and services tax, states: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 57(2), dealing with unincorporated bodies, states: 7 (2) Where an unincorporated body that carries on any taxable activity is registered pursuant to this Act,— (a) The members of that body shall not themselves be registered or liable to be registered under this Act in relation to the carrying on of that taxable activity; and (b) Any supply of goods and services made in the course of carrying on that taxable activity shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be supplied by that body, and shall be deemed not to be made by any member of that body; and ... (Emphasis added) Section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1993 states: A person that is not a natural person cannot be a director of a company. Application of the Legislation Section 8(1) provides that GST is charged on the supply (but not an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Therefore, one of the determining features in ascertaining whether there is a liability to account for GST, is the existence of a “taxable activity”. Another determining feature is whether the person is a “registered person”. Section 6(1) defines a “taxable activity” as an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. The section also includes within the term “taxable activity” the activities of any public or local authority. Under section 6(2), anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Paragraphs (a), (aa), (b), (c), and (d) of section 6(3) exclude from the term “taxable activity” such activities as hobbies, employment under a contract of service and engagement as a director of a company, certain Government-type and local authority appointments, and the making of exempt supplies. The proviso to paragraph (b) states that if a person, in carrying on a taxable activity, accepts any office, services supplied by that person in holding that office are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Therefore, if a person is carrying on a taxable activity, and accepts an engagement as a company director in carrying on that taxable activity, the proviso will apply. If it is established that a taxable activity is in existence after applying section 6, the question of whether the person is liable to account for GST will depend on the application of the remaining criteria set down in section 8. One of these criteria is whether the person is a “registered person”, i.e. whether the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, which includes whether the taxable activity threshold amount in section 51 has been satisfied. 8 Section 57(2)(b) provides that where an “unincorporated body”, which by definition under section 2(1) includes a partnership, carries on a taxable activity, any supply of goods and services made as part of carrying on that taxable activity are deemed to be supplied by the partnership and not by any of the partners. Section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1993 provides that only a natural person can be a director of a company. The following scenarios illustrate how section 6(3)(b) is applied in respect of a person engaged as a director of a company, i.e. whether a taxable activity is in existence. It is important to note that the Ruling itself deals specifically with section 6(3)(b). If it is established that an activity does not fall within the exclusion from a “taxable activity” set down in that section, the remaining criteria under section 8 must be applied in order to determine the existence of a liability to account for GST. Finally, it should be mentioned that it is the contractual relationship between the parties, founded on a genuine basis, that determines the GST treatment of the relevant transactions (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325). A. Personal capacity A natural person is engaged as a director of a company in that person’s personal capacity and not as part of carrying on any taxable activity. The activity of this person falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) in that it involves a person who is engaged as a director of a company. The activity is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso does not apply, as the person has not accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity. B. Carrying on a taxable activity A natural person is engaged as a director of a company as part of carrying on that person’s taxable activity. The activity of this person falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) in that it involves a person who is engaged as a director of a company. The activity is therefore prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity”. However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity, the proviso deems the services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the person will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services. C. Person contracted as a company director A natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company. The person is not undertaking the directorship as part of carrying on 9 any taxable activity. The third party invoices the company for its services in providing it with a director. The engagement of the person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity. The provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the third party is registered for GST, or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the services of the person as a director of the company. D. Person contracted as a company director in carrying on a taxable activity A natural person, as part of carrying on a taxable activity, is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company. The third party invoices the company for providing the services of the director, who in turn invoices the third party for his or her services. The engagement of the person as a director of a company is prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on his or her taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his or her taxable activity. The natural person’s liability for GST will therefore depend on satisfying the remaining requirements of section 8. The provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the third party is registered for GST, or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s directorship services. E. Employee engaged as director An employee of an employer is engaged as a director of a third party company as part of the person’s employment duties. The engagement of this person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity— the person is merely carrying out his or her employment duties. The provisions of section 6(3)(b) do not apply to the employer who is supplying the services of its employee as the employer is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the services of the person as a director of the company. F. Employee required to pay over directors’ fees to employer 10 Sometimes an employee is permitted to accept directorships of third party companies provided that the employee accounts to the employer for the fees received. This might occur with family companies. In this type of scenario there would not be a contract between the employer and the third party company. In this situation, the engagement of the person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. The employer company, provided it is registered for GST or liable to be registered for GST, will be required to account for GST on the supply of services by the employee. These services could best be described as allowing the employee to undertake directorship duties in work time or permitting the employee to be a director. G. Partner in a partnership engaged as a director A partner in a partnership accepts an engagement as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business. The engagement of this person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply in the case of the partnership as the partnership is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership supplies the services of one of its partners to the company as part of its taxable activity. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s directorship services. Examples Example 1 Taxpayer A, who is not registered for GST, is a partner in a firm of chartered accountants. Company B engages taxpayer A as a director, and pays him fees for his services. Taxpayer A’s appointment as a director is not connected with his involvement in the partnership nor has he accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. He retains the fees, having received them in his personal capacity. Taxpayer A is engaged as a director of a company, an activity that is excluded from the term “taxable activity” by section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply, as taxpayer A is not providing directorship services as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Taxpayer A is not required to account for GST on the fees received for directorship services. Example 2 11 Taxpayer B is a human resources consultant in business on her own. She is registered for GST. She accepts a company directorship as part of carrying on her taxable activity, and receives fees for her services. Taxpayer B’s engagement as a director is prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity” in terms of section 6(3)(b). However, as she has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on her taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity. She should therefore account for GST on the fees she is paid. Example 3 A GST-registered financial management company supplies the services of one of its specialist employees as a director of another company. Directors’ fees are paid to the company for the services provided. The engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the employee has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, the employee is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the activity of the management company as that company is not engaged as a company director. The fees are paid in consideration of the management company providing the services of one of its employees to the other company. This is a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of the management company and that company will be required to account for GST on the fees received for this supply. Example 4 A partner of a GST-registered legal partnership is elected on to the board of directors of a client company as a representative of the partnership. The partnership is providing legal advice to the company, which in turn pays fees into the partnership’s account. The engagement of the partner as a director of a company falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. The provisions of section 6(3)(b) do not apply to the partnership as it is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees it receives from the company. Example 5 A GST-registered accountant in business on his own is contracted by a consulting firm to take up an engagement as a director of a company with the object of monitoring the company’s financial systems. 12 The engagement of the accountant as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on his taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity. The accountant will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees he receives in respect of these services. The provision by the consulting firm of the services of the accountant does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the firm is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the consulting firm is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, it will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services of the accountant. Example 6 Company A agrees to one of its employees taking up a directorship position with Company X on the proviso that the employee hands over the directors’ fees payable to the employee by Company X. There is no contract between Company A and Company X. The engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the employee has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, the employee is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. If Company A is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, it is required to account for GST on the supply of services, i.e. permitting the employee to be a director of Company X.
1 “ANYTHING OCCURRING ON LIQUIDATION” WHEN A COMPANY REQUESTS REMOVAL FROM THE REGISTER OF COMPANIES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 05/14 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “liquidation” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the liquidation of a company where a request is made under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 that the company be removed from the New Zealand register of companies. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation where a request is made to the Registrar of Companies to remove a company from the New Zealand register under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 is a resolution by the shareholders or board of directors or, where applicable, another overt decision-making act provided for in a company’s constitution, to adopt a course of action that will culminate in removal from the register. That step starts the period specified in paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of “liquidation” in section OB 1, and anything done after that step for the purpose of enabling liquidation occurs “on liquidation” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 8 th November 2005 to 31 December 2008. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8th day of November 2005. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 05/14 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 05/14 (“the Ruling”). Background This ruling concerns the meaning of “anything occurring on liquidation” in paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. “Liquidation” includes removal from the register of companies which can either follow the full liquidation process, or can be an alternative means of ending the life of a company in itself. Under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 a request for removal from the register can be made by an authorised shareholder, or by the board of directors or any other person required or permitted to do so by the constitution of the company, after the company has paid its debts and distributed any surplus to its members. Removal from the register under this section is sometimes referred to as “short form liquidation” and is a cheaper and simpler option than a full liquidation. Paragraph (b) of the definition of liquidation prescribes the period during which anything can occur on liquidation, saying that it starts with “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”. Establishing the beginning of that period – by the first legally necessary step – is critical in determining what things may occur on liquidation. Paragraph (b)(i) gives two examples of steps, one of which is a request under section 318(1)(d), and this has given rise to some uncertainty as to whether the request is the first step legally necessary when that process is followed. One important practical result of this relates to the ability of companies to make tax-free distributions “on liquidation” under section CD 18(2) of the Income Tax Act. If the request is the first step of that section 318(1)(d) removal process, as some commentators have suggested, distributions cannot be made “on liquidation” as all surplus assets must have been distributed before the request is made. So while amounts could be distributed tax-free under section CD 18(2) of the Income Tax Act on a full liquidation, they could not be exempt on a “short form liquidation”. Legislation Section OB 1 provides: OB 1 For the purposes of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,- liquidation, for a company, - (a) includes - (i) removal of the company from the register of companies under the Companies Act 1993; and (ii) dissolution of the company under the Companies Act 1955; and (iii) termination of the company's existence under any other procedure of New Zealand or foreign law; and 3 (b) includes, in references in this Act to anything occurring on liquidation, anything occurring - (i) during the period that starts with a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation, including the appointment of a liquidator or a request of the kind referred to in section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993; and (ii) for the purpose of enabling liquidation A request to remove a company from the New Zealand register of companies can be made under section 318 of the Companies Act 1993, paragraph (d) of which provides: 318(1) Subject to this section, the Registrar must remove a company from the New Zealand register if— ... (d) There is sent or delivered to the Registrar a request in the prescribed form made by— (i) A shareholder authorised to make the request by a special resolution of shareholders entitled to vote and voting on the question; or (ii) The board of directors or any other person, if the constitution of the company so requires or permits— that the company be removed from the New Zealand register on either of the grounds specified in subsection (2) of this section; ... Section 318(2) provides the grounds for making such a request: 318(2) A request that a company be removed from the New Zealand register under subsection (1)(d) of this section may be made on the grounds— (a) That the company has ceased to carry on business, has discharged in full its liabilities to all its known creditors, and has distributed its surplus assets in accordance with its constitution and this Act; or (b) That the company has no surplus assets after paying its debts in full or in part, and no creditor has applied to the Court under section 241 of this Act for an order putting the company into liquidation. Application of the Legislation A request to remove a company from the register of companies under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 can be made by a shareholder authorised by shareholders’ special resolution, or by the board of directors or any other person where the constitution requires or permits them to do so. It is clear from the two alternative grounds for requesting removal under this section (set out in section 318(2)) that at the time the request for removal is made any surplus assets must have already been distributed. The function of paragraph (b) of the definition of “liquidation” in the Income Tax Act is to set out when anything may occur on liquidation. Subparagraph (i) defines the period. The beginning of the period is most important and starts with “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”. This puts the focus on the first of such steps. Subparagraph (ii) limits the “anything occurring on liquidation” to things occurring within that period that are for the purpose of enabling liquidation. Things that occur for another purpose will not occur “on liquidation”. What is meant by “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”? 4 The phrase “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation” distinguishes between steps that are legally necessary and any other steps, and between steps that are to achieve liquidation and those taken for any other purpose. The ordinary meaning of the word “step” implies an “action” so the focus is on overt acts rather than, for example, the existence of circumstances or beliefs. Some steps necessary to achieve liquidation in practice may not be legally necessary. For example, a step that is necessary in practice for a liquidation by special resolution of shareholders is to decide who the liquidator will be. That decision is not a legally required step even though it must have occurred. The closest legally necessary step would be appointing the liquidator or obtaining the liquidator’s written consent to appointment. The words “to achieve liquidation” further narrow the range of steps that are legally necessary that can commence the period. Some steps legally necessary to achieve liquidation may be taken for some other purpose than to achieve liquidation. For example, paying all creditors is necessary before making a section 318(1)(d) request, but may be done in the ordinary course of business rather than for the purpose of enabling liquidation. Other steps may not reach the required threshold to be “to achieve liquidation”. For each liquidation procedure, the series of steps involved will largely be settled by the governing legislation – usually the Companies Act 1993. However, in relation to each procedure there will be some preliminary activities, which will culminate in the decision to act being made, followed by a series of acts in implementation. Potential early “steps” include the formulation of a belief, the existence of certain circumstances, giving of notices, holding of meetings, making decisions, and passing resolutions. The word “achieve” requires that an end or goal is established and committed to. In paragraph (b) this means that the steps are taken with liquidation as the established end. Until that goal is established and the path to it committed to, steps cannot be taken “to achieve liquidation”. Essentially this requires that the decision has been made to liquidate. This emphasis on the established goal of liquidation means that steps that are preparatory to the liquidation process proper (for example, the exercise by the liquidator of his or her functions) are capable of being the first step to achieve liquidation. However, a decision must have been made. Preliminary activities such as investigating circumstances, exploring and evaluating options and the mere formulation of an idea will not suffice. The silent making of a decision is not an overt act so will not be a “step” as required by paragraph (b). Further, while a decision has to be made in practice, the step required by law in relation to a company’s decision is usually the passing of a resolution. It is an overt act - a “step” - and in most cases is the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation, and for the purpose of enabling liquidation. The first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation where a request is made to remove a company from the register under section 318(1)(d) One of the two grounds in section 318(2) must be satisfied before making a request for removal from the register under section 318(1)(d). Only ground (a) applies where the company will have surplus assets to distribute, and so only this ground is considered here. 5 It requires that the company has ceased business, paid its creditors and distributed any surplus assets in accordance with its constitution and the Companies Act. Therefore the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation when a request is made to remove the company from the register under this ground will relate to ceasing business, paying all creditors and distributing surplus assets, but there is no set order that these must occur in. To be the first step legally necessary in terms of the definition of “liquidation” in section OB 1, the relevant step under section 318(1)(d) must be an overt act on or following the decision to carry out the necessary actions to satisfy the grounds in section 318(2)(a) with the aim of achieving liquidation. It will usually be a resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets and to then request removal. The Commissioner will be satisfied that a resolution in these terms is the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. A company’s constitution may provide another means of making that decision which, where it is an overt act, can also be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. Other steps may be taken that are the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation, for example, the company may act less formally than by passing a resolution to carry out the grounds in section 318(2). If the step is overt and carried out with the aim of achieving removal from the register it could be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation. The significance of the parenthetical examples in paragraph (b)(i) After the phrase “a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation”, paragraph (b)(i) sets out two parenthetical examples: “including the appointment of a liquidator or a request of the kind referred to in section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993;”. The examples can be read as being first steps of relevant processes put in the section by Parliament specifically as illustrations of first steps that commence the period. However, in the Commissioner’ view, the wording of paragraph (b) is ambiguous. The examples could be either of: a) a step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation: or b) the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation; in respect of relevant liquidation processes. Probably the more obvious meaning is that the examples are of first steps – it is suggested by the immediate context, and the emphasis in the section. The focus of paragraph (b)(i) is on determining “the period” and its commencement which suggests that the examples are of first steps rather than any steps of the processes which they are relevant to. However, this is not conclusive. Whether the examples should be taken to be the first steps or just any steps in the processes they are relevant to becomes clear when the examples are examined. 6 In the processes of “liquidation” in which a liquidator is appointed, the appointment of a liquidator is not the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. For example, where the shareholders resolve to appoint a liquidator, obviously the resolution is a legally necessary step that precedes the appointment. Regarding the second example, where removal from the register is requested under section 318(1)(d), the request is also not the first step legally necessary. Passing a resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets and to then request removal will usually be the first step that is legally necessary to achieve liquidation, and for the purpose of enabling liquidation. Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary, it is clear that the steps given as examples in paragraph (b)(i) are not the first steps legally necessary to achieve liquidation in the liquidation processes that they relate to, but are examples of a step (in fact fundamental steps) in the processes. Exemption of distributions upon liquidation where a request is made to remove a company from the register under section 318(1)(d) One situation where this is important is in relation to the exemption of dividends “on the liquidation” of a company under section CD 18(1). Under section CD 2 of the Income Tax Act 2004, the term “dividends” includes a wide range of payments, distributions, or transactions where essentially value is transferred to shareholders. Section CD 18(2) excludes any amount distributed that is essentially of subscribed capital (“available subscribed capital per share”) and capital gains (“excess return amount”) where the distributions are made “on the liquidation of the company”. To be excluded from being dividends by section CD 18(2), amounts distributed in relation to a request to remove a company from the register under section 318(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1993 must be made during the period which starts with a step that is legally necessary to achieve removal from the register. Accordingly, there may be an extended period between the initial step legally necessary to achieve liquidation and the removal. In some situations, as the period may span different tax years, a distribution may be made in a period preceding removal from the register. The Commissioner will assume that such distributions are made pursuant to a bone fide intention to liquidate. However, it should be noted that, if the liquidation is not completed then such a distribution will not have occurred “on liquidation” and the exclusion under section CD 18 (and the ruling) will not apply. As discussed above, the Commissioner’s view is that the first step is not the making of the request under section 318(1)(d), but is ordinarily the passing of the resolution to cease business, pay all creditors, distribute surplus assets and to then request removal. It is noted that a company’s constitution may provide another means of making that decision which, where it is an overt act, can be the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. Amounts distributed in respect of shares in the company following that step will be distributed “on liquidation” and be eligible for exclusion from being dividends under section CD 18(2). The other criteria of section CD 18(2) would also have to be met. 7 A company taking some other overt action with the aim of achieving removal from the register under section 318(1)(d) may be able to show that this is the first step legally necessary to achieve liquidation. However, a company taking such a course of action may be required to produce evidence establishing the taking of the step was carried out with the aim of achieving liquidation. Taxpayers making distributions should ensure that they keep adequate records of relevant resolutions or other decision-making acts so that they can demonstrate that the essential genuineness of the resolution or other act preceded distribution of the company’s assets, and that the distributions were for the purpose of enabling liquidation.
1 DEBT FACTORING ARRANGEMENTS AND GST PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 06/01 —————————————————————————————————— Note (not part of ruling): This Ruling is essentially the same as Public Ruling BR Pub 00/07, previously published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 8 (August 2000). BR Pub 00/07 applied from 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2005. Some minor changes have been made to the description of the arrangement in the new ruling. Some issues that were covered in the commentary to the previous ruling are now covered comprehensively in Public Ruling BR Pub 05/01 “Bad debts – writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes” published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 2 (March 2005). BR Pub 06/01 is to apply on 1 August 2005 for an indefinite period. —————————————————————————————————— This is a Public Ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 8(1), 20(3) and 26(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale, by a GST registered person (the “Assignor”) on an invoice basis, to a third party (“the Factor”), on a recourse or non-recourse basis, of an outstanding debt at a price less than the debt’s face value. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The difference between the face value of the debt and the price received from the Factor is not a bad debt for the purposes of section 26. Accordingly, section 26 has no application and the registered person cannot claim an output tax deduction under section 20(3)(a)(iii); and • If a portion of a debt is written-off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether this write-off meets the requirements of section 26(1) depends on whether the amount written off was “bad” according to the conventional tests as outlined in Public Ruling BR Pub 05/01. 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply on 1 August 2005 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19 th day of April 2006. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 06/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 06/01 (“the Ruling”). Background Section 26 and section 20(3)(a)(iii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”) allow a registered person to make a deduction from output tax if the registered person has made a taxable supply, returned output tax in respect of that taxable supply, and subsequently written off as a bad debt, all or part of the debt. If a registered person factors (i.e. sells) a debt owing for less than its face value to a third party (“the Factor”), the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount written off as a bad debt. A debt can be factored either on a recourse basis or on a non-recourse basis. Debt factoring on a non-recourse basis means that the Factor has no claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to him or her become doubtful or uncollectable (i.e. the Factor assumes all of the risk). In contrast, debt factoring on a recourse basis means that the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to them prove to be doubtful or uncollectible. Debt factoring was previously dealt with in PIB No 164 (August 1987) “GST and debt collection agencies – debt factoring” and in Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4 under an identical heading. Those statements concluded that if a registered person accounting for GST on an invoice basis subsequently sold a debt for less than its face value, the Commissioner would allow the registered person a bad debt deduction under section 26 for the difference between the debt’s face value and the sale proceeds. The inference being that the difference between the two amounts was a bad debt. Barber DJ in Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188 reached a different conclusion from that set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. In particular, the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) concluded that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. Public Ruling BR Pub 00/07 changed and superseded the earlier policy set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. BR Pub 00/07 confirmed that the Commissioner accepted the view of Barber DJ in Case T27. In particular, it is now the Commissioner’s view that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. Accordingly, section 26 has no application, and a registered person cannot claim a deduction from output tax under section 20(3)(a)(iii). This Ruling replaces BR Pub 00/07. 4 The Ruling only applies in respect of taxpayers registered for GST on an invoice basis. Under section 26A taxpayers registered for GST on a payments basis are required to pay GST on the remaining book value of a debt when it is factored. Section 26A, therefore, establishes parity between the two GST accounting bases. Legislation Section 8(1) states: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 9(1) states: Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. Section 20 states: (1) In respect of each taxable period every registered person shall calculate the amount of tax payable by that registered person in accordance with the provisions of this section. ... (3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period— (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of the following: (i) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) Input tax in relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) Input tax invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Any amount calculated in accordance with any one of sections 25(2)(b), 25(5), 25AA(2)(b) or 25AA(3)(b); and (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of the following: (i) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 5 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii) Input tax paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Any amount calculated in accordance with any one of sections 25(2)(b), 25(5), 25AA(2)(b) or 25AA(3)(b), to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount, ... The provision relating to bad debts is in section 26, which states: (1) Where a registered person— (a) Has made a taxable supply for consideration in money; and (b) Has furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under this Act; and (c) Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person,— that registered person shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to that supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply: Provided that where goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement, the registered person shall only make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time that the hire purchase agreement was entered into) of that portion of the amount written off as a bad debt as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement: (1AA) Subsection (1) also applies if a registered person sells a debt to a third party and then reacquires the debt. ... Section 3(1) defines “financial services” as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term financial services means any one or more of the following activities: (a) The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise): (b) The issue, payment, collection, or transfer of ownership of a cheque or letter of credit: (c) The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d) The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: (e) Underwriting or sub-underwriting the issue of an equity security, debt security, or participatory security: (f) The provision of credit under a credit contract: 6 (g) The renewal or variation of a debt security, equity security, participatory security, or credit contract: (h) The provision, taking, variation, or release of a guarantee, indemnity, security, or bond in respect of the performance of obligations under a cheque, credit contract, equity security, debt security, or participatory security, or in respect of the activities specified in paragraphs (b) to (g) of this subsection: (i) The provision, or transfer of ownership, of a life insurance contract or the provision of re-insurance in respect of any such contract: (j) The provision, or transfer of ownership, of an interest in a superannuation scheme, or the management of a superannuation scheme: (k) The provision or assignment of a futures contract through a defined market or at arm’s length if— (i) The contract does not provide for the delivery of a commodity; or (ii) The contract provides for the delivery of a commodity and the supply of the commodity is an exempt supply; or (iii) The contract provides for the delivery of money: (kaa) The provision of a financial option: (ka) The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l) Agreeing to do, or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon. Application of the Legislation Under section 26, a registered person can make a deduction under section 20(3)(a)(iii) if that person has: • made a taxable supply for consideration; and • furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under the Act; and • written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. The amount that may be deducted is the same amount of GST charged as the amount written off bears to the total consideration for the supply. If the supply is the supply of goods under a hire purchase agreement, the proviso to section 26 limits the deduction to the portion of the amount written off as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. Further, section 26 does not apply to a registered person accounting on a payments basis under section 19 or 19A, unless either section 9(2)(b) (door to door sales) or section 9(3)(b) (hire purchase agreements) applies to the supply. 7 Section 26 only applies when the registered person has already accounted for GST on a supply and subsequently has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. If a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount “written off as a bad debt”. The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. Whether the debt is written off as “bad”, according to the requirements in section 26(1), depends on the application of the tests outlined in Public Ruling BR Pub 05/01 “Bad debts – writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes” published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 2 (March 2005). Public Ruling BR Pub 05/01 confirms that a debt (or part of a debt) is a bad debt where: • an existing debt is owing to the taxpayer; and • the debt is adjudged as “bad” when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid; and • the bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer. The debt must exist Cases indicate that before a debt can be written off, a debt must be in existence at the time the debt is written off (Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263 and GE Crane Sales Pty Ltd v FC of T 71 ATC 4268). Accordingly, for section 26 to apply, the registered person must be able to show that at the time of writing off the debt, a debt was then in existence. In terms of non-recourse debt factoring, at the time the debt is sold, the debt between the registered person and debtor is extinguished and replaced with a separate and distinct debt between the Factor and debtor. In such situations no debt exists at the time the amount is written off, which will be after sale of the debt. Therefore, after the sale of the debt to the Factor, no further debt exists and according to both Budget Rent A Car Ltd and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd no amount can be written off as a bad debt. In terms of recourse debt factoring arrangements when a debt is sold by the Assignor on a recourse basis, the title to the debt passes to the Factor unless the Factor exercises a recourse option or right by which the debt can be transferred back to the Assignor. Therefore, until the recourse is exercised and the debt is transferred back, a bad debt deduction is not available under section 26(1), as after the sale there is no debt owed to the Assignor. 8 However, if the Factor exercises an option or right to transfer some portion of the debt back to the Assignor after the sale then, once this has occurred, a debt exists that is owed to the Assignor that may be able to be written off by the Assignor. Whether it can be written off depends on the application of the tests for determining whether a debt is bad in BR Pub 05/01. The debt must be “bad” When assessing whether a bad debt exists, BR Pub 05/01 indicates that a debt is bad when a reasonably prudent commercial person would have concluded, based on the information available about the debtor’s ability to repay the debt, that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In the absence of such a circumstance, if a registered person chooses to sell a debt for below its face value, no bad debt exists and no deduction is available under section 20(3)(a)(iii). The debt must be “written off” BR Pub 05/01 establishes that, to write-off a debt as bad under section 26(1), reasonable steps must be taken to determine whether that particular debt owed by that particular debtor is likely to be paid (Case P53 (1992) 14 NZTC 4370 and Budget Rent A Car v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12263). Writing-off a portion of debt on this basis involves seeking a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. As noted in BR Pub 05/01, the GST Act does not allow a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. Writing off the debt before sale to the Factor In the past we have received submissions which noted that the issue of whether the discount to the Factor might be written off as a bad debt under section 26(1) would not arise if this amount were written off prior to the sale of the debt to the Factor. The Commissioner agrees that this is the case. If a portion of a debt is written off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether the debt is written off as bad according to the requirements in section 26(1) depends on the application of the tests outlined in Public Ruling BR Pub 05/01. In conclusion, the Commissioner believes that the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor cannot be an amount written off as a bad debt under section 26. Rather than being a bad debt, the discount from face value is simply a result of the process of agreeing the consideration for the debts that is acceptable to both the Assignor and the Factor. The reasons for this view are: • Cases considering the meaning of bad debt focus on whether the creditor can recover the outstanding amounts owing. That is, a bad debt arises when the creditor is unable or unlikely to recover the debt owing. If the creditor could recover the full amount owing but chooses not to (as in a debt factoring situation), any “loss” suffered by the creditor is not due to a bad debt. 9 • Cases also indicate that for an amount to be written off as a bad debt, a debt must exist at the time the debt is written off. If a registered person factors a debt, no further debt exists between the registered person and debtor, and no amount can be written off as a bad debt.

The Commissioner’s view, as expressed in this ruling, is not intended to differ from BR Pub 01/03. Any changes between this ruling and the previous ruling are only intended to assist the reader’s understanding and reflect the new terminology used in the Income Tax Act 2004. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections GD 10, DA 1 and DA 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies is a “lease” of property (whether real property or personal property) at less than an “adequate rent,” only if and to the extent the leased property is used by the lessee, in the derivation of assessable income or exempt income. This Ruling applies where any property, owned by any person or by two or more persons (whether jointly or in common) or by any partnership, is leased: • to a “relative” of any of those persons or of any member of the partnership, or • to a “related company”, or • by a company to any person. For the purposes of this Ruling, the terms “lease”, “adequate rent”, and “related company” have the meanings attributed to them by section GD 10(4), and “relative” has the meaning attributed to it by section OB 1. 1 How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: For the purposes of section DA 1, rent deemed under section GD 10 to be payable by the lessee to the lessor is expenditure incurred by the lessee. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period to leases entered into on or following 1 February 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 28th day of April 2006. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 06/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 06/02 (“the Ruling”). Background Section GD 10 applies to leases between a lessor and certain specified classes of lessee, where the rent payable under the lease is “less than an adequate rent”. Section GD 10 allows the Commissioner to notionally increase the amount of rent payable by the lessee to the lessor, to an amount equal to an “adequate rent”. The section deems the rent thus payable to be income derived by the lessor on the days the rent is deemed to be payable. Section GD 10 is directed against tax avoidance. It controls the shifting of income between family members to take advantage of different marginal tax rates, but is not limited to familial transactions. Progressive tax scales give advantages to the family unit to spread income, resulting in a reduction in the overall amount of tax paid by that unit, or the rate of tax applying to an income stream. Section GD 10 operates to limit this opportunity when related parties lease income-producing property. The effect of deeming income to be derived, based on a rent that should have been paid rather than what was paid, unwinds any advantage. Section GD 10 applies where property (both personal and real), owned by any person or by two or more persons (whether jointly or in common) or by any partnership, is leased: • to a relative of any of those persons • to a relative of any member of the partnership • to a related company • by a company to any person and the rent is either less than an adequate rent for the property or the lease makes no provision for the payment of rent. Where those circumstances apply, section GD 10 allows the Commissioner to determine an amount of “adequate rent”, being in broad terms an amount of rent considered by the Commissioner to be adequate for the property being leased. This Ruling does not consider the basis of such a determination or what is meant by either adequate or inadequate rent. Under section GD 10, the amount of adequate rent so determined is deemed to be payable by the lessee to the lessor, and is deemed to be income derived by the lessor. This Ruling considers the position of the lessee and, specifically, whether the adequate rent, that is deemed payable by the lessee to the lessor, is also an amount deemed payable by the lessee for the purposes of sections DA 1 and DA 2. The Ruling concludes that rent deemed to be payable is an expenditure or loss incurred by the lessee under section DA 1(1). For the rental to be deductible by the lessee, the expenditure or 3 loss must meet all of the requirements of the “general permission” in section DA 1 and not be excluded by the “general limitations” in section DA 2. Legislation DA 1 GENERAL PERMISSION DA 1(1) NEXUS WITH INCOME A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation loss) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is - (a) incurred by them in deriving - (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving - (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income.

Defined in this Act: amount, assessable income, business, deduction, depreciation loss, excluded income, general permission, loss, DA 2 GENERAL LIMITATIONS DA 2(1) CAPITAL LIMITATION (1) A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. DA 2(2) PRIVATE LIMITATION A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. This rule is called the private limitation.

This rule is called the employment limitation. DA 2(5) WITHHOLDING TAX LIMITATION A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving schedular income subject to final withholding. This rule is called the withholding tax limitation. DA 2(6) NON-RESIDENTS’ FOREIGN-SOURCED INCOME LIMITATION A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving non-residents’ foreign- sourced income. This rule is called the non-residents’ foreign-sourced income limitation. DA 2(7) RELATIONSHIP OF GENERAL LIMITATIONS TO GENERAL PERMISSION Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission. Defined in this Act: amount, capital limitation, deduction, employment limitation, exempt income, exempt income limitation, general limitation, general permission, income from employment, loss, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income, non-residents’ foreign-sourced income limitation, private limitation, schedular income subject to final withholding, withholding tax limitation. GD 10 LEASES FOR INADEQUATE RENT GD 10 1) \[Deemed adequate rental\] Where any property owned by any person or by two or more persons (whether jointly or in common) or by any partnership is leased to a relative of any of those persons or of any 4 member of the partnership or to a related company or by a company to any person and the rent is less than an adequate rent for that property or the lease makes no provision for the payment of rent, - (a) there is deemed to be payable under the lease a rent that is equal to an adequate rent for the property, and that rent is deemed to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days provided in the lease for payment of the rent, or, if no rent is payable under the lease, on each day of the term of the lease on a pro rata basis, and is deemed to be income derived by the lessor on the days on which the rent is deemed to be payable under this paragraph; and (b) the rent deemed to be payable under paragraph (a) is deemed to accrue from day to day during the period in respect of which it is payable, and is apportionable accordingly. GD 10(2) \[Use of property\] This section applies with respect to any leased property only if and to the extent that it is used by the lessee in the derivation of assessable income or exempt income. GD 10(3) \[Section to apply\] This section applies whether the lease was granted before or after the commencement of the tax year. GD 10(4) \[Definitions\] In this section, - adequate rent in relation to any property, means the amount of rent that the Commissioner determines to be adequate for that property during the period in respect of which the determination is made. lease means a tenancy of any duration, whether in writing or otherwise; and includes a sublease; and also includes a bailment; and lessor and lessee have corresponding meanings. related company means a company that is under the control of the lessor or any relative or relatives of the lessor or any 1 or more of them, or, where there are several lessors or the lessor is a partnership, under the control of any of the lessors or partners or any relative or relatives of any of the lessors or partners. rent includes any premium or other consideration for the lease. “RELATIVE” The definition of relative was amended by section 3(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 2005. The amendment added “civil union” to paragraph (c)(ii), this came into force on 26 th April 2005. Section 3(2) of the Amendment Act also provides for a future amendment to OB 1 by replacing the expression "marriage or civil union" in paragraph (c)(ii) with the expression "marriage, civil union or de facto relationship". This amendment comes into force 1 April 2007. OB 1 “RELATIVE” ... (c) except in the provisions referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), means a person connected with another person by - (i) blood relationship, that is, one is within the fourth degree of relationship to the other: (ii) marriage or other partnership, that is, one is in a marriage or civil union with the other or with a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other (iii) adoption, that is, one has been adopted as a child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other: (d) except in the provisions referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b), includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit Application of the legislation How section GD 10 operates When does the section apply? Section GD 10 operates, in limited circumstances, following a determination by the Commissioner. For section GD 10 to apply, the following requirements must be satisfied: 5 • There must be the leasing of property • The owner of the property must be: o a person (as defined in the Interpretation Act 1999, and includes a company), or o any two or more persons (whether jointly or in common), or o a partnership. • The lessee must be: o a relative of an owner (where the owner is a natural person), or o a relative of any member of the partnership that owns the property, or o a related company of the owner, or o where the lessor is a company, any person. • The stipulated rent must be less than adequate or the lease must be silent on the payment of rent. • The lessee must use the property in the derivation of assessable income or exempt income. What leased property is covered? “Property” is not defined for the purposes of section GD 10, but in the Commissioner’s view it includes both real property (land and buildings) and personal property (property other than land and buildings). This is the usual legal meaning of “property”. The definition of “lease” in section GD 10 supports this interpretation. “Lease” is defined in section GD 10(4) as a tenancy of any duration, including a sublease, and a bailment. A lease and a tenancy usually only relate to land, i.e. real property. A bailment only ever refers to personal property. Therefore, it is clear that section GD 10 is intended to apply to, and the word “property” is meant to refer to, both real and personal property. Who is a relative? “Relative” is defined in section OB 1. A relative is a person connected with another person by “blood relationship”, adoption, marriage or other partnership, that is, one is in a marriage or civil union with the other or with a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other. “Blood relationship” means a relationship that is within the fourth degree which is ascertained by counting the relationship steps between the two people. For example, A and B are first cousins, so they are within the fourth degree of relationship, as follows: A – A’s parent (1) – grandparent (2) – B’s parent (3) – B (4). Any person who marries or is in a civil union with another person, within the fourth degree of relationship, automatically assumes the same relationship. For example, B’s spouse is within the fourth degree of relationship to A. Similarly, both A and B’s spouses are within the fourth degree of relationship to each other. Children adopted by a person within the third degree of relationship are also relatives. 6 The deeming effect of section GD 10 If the section applies to a transaction, section GD 10(1)(a) explicitly deems: • an adequate rent to be payable under the lease • that adequate rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days provided in the lease for rent payment, or, if no rent is payable under the lease, on each day of the term of the lease on a pro rata basis; and • the rent to be income derived by the lessor on the days on which the rent is deemed to be payable. “Deemed” means adding to the normal meaning of words If the Commissioner determines an adequate rent, the amount of rent payable by the lessee to the lessor is increased by the deeming effect of section GD 10, to reflect the Commissioner’s determination. In a Canadian decision, R v Verrette \[1978\] 2 S.C.R. 838 at page 845, the Supreme Court of Canada gave a useful description of the legal effect of a deeming provision. It said: A deeming provision is a statutory fiction; as a rule it implicitly admits that a thing is not what it is deemed to be but decrees that for some particular purpose it shall be taken as if it were that thing although it is not or there is doubt as to whether it is. A deeming provision artificially imports into a word or expression an additional meaning which they would not otherwise convey beside the normal meaning which they retain where they are used; it plays a function of enlargement analogous to the word “includes” in certain definitions; however, “includes” would be logically inappropriate and would sound unreal because of the fictional aspect of the provision. In this case, section GD 10 deems an amount of adequate rent to be payable, even though in terms of the contract between the lessor and the lessee it is not. The section then further deems the fictional rent to be payable on specified days and finally deems the rent to be income derived by the lessor. The section applies to a lessee Although the section deems the rent determined by the Commissioner to be income derived by the lessor, it does not expressly state that the deemed rent is expenditure incurred by the lessee. The absence of a specified mirror treatment for the lessee could arguably support an interpretation of the section based on the proposition that it does not apply to a lessee. However, in the Commissioner’s view, this is not a correct interpretation because: 1. An adequate rent is deemed by the section to be payable under the lease. The section further deems the rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor. 2. The application of the section is dependent on the lessee’s use of the leased property for the derivation of assessable income or exempt income. 3. Section GD 10(2) is directly concerned with the use of leased property by the lessee in the derivation of assessable or exempt income. 7 4. Section GD 10 was originally introduced as section 17 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1951. Introductory Notes supplied to the Minister on introduction of the Bill said: This clause is designed to cover the position where a taxpayer owning an income producing property, enters into a lease under which a relative becomes entitled to the full rent or income from the property, and is required to pay to the lessor only a nominal or peppercorn rental. ...The provisions of the clause will not be applied to bona fide leases of property, even though the lessee is a relative, and will be operated by the Commissioner only where it is evident that the lease has the effect of transferring income from the taxpayer to a relative. This demonstrates that the purpose of the provision was to prevent income splitting and the consequential reduction of tax paid. Allowing a deduction to the lessee would not negate this purpose. The above points also support the conclusion that section GD 10 is intended to apply to both the lessee and lessor in the relevant transaction. Deeming not limited to section GD 10 The application of the deeming provisions contained in section GD 10 is not limited by the inclusion of any qualification. Elsewhere in the Act, where the effect of a provision is intended to be restricted, such sections contain a qualification such as, “For the purposes of this section...”. Section GD 10 is not an independent charging provision, and must be read in conjunction with other relevant parts of the Act. For example, rent is included in income by section CC 1. The deemed rent is therefore relevant for other purposes of the Act such as for section DA 1. Section DA 1: “incurred” requires a legal obligation to pay An amount is an allowable deduction under section DA 1, only if it is “incurred” by the taxpayer. For the deemed adequate rent to be an allowable deduction, it must have been “incurred” by the lessee. The term “incurred” has been held to mean that the taxpayer has either paid the expenditure or loss, or is otherwise definitively committed to pay it: (see CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351). A taxpayer is said to be definitively committed when a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. Section GD 10 does not specifically deem the adequate rent to have been incurred by the lessee. Rather, the section deems the rent to be payable. In Re Howell’s Application \[1972\] Ch. 509, the phrase “payable by way of rent” was interpreted as meaning “... rent the tenant is under an enforceable obligation to pay...”. New Zealand courts have taken the same view. In AM Bisley & Co Ltd v C of IR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,082 at page 5,096, Henry J said: ...that the expenditure is not payable until some future date does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation. 8 Therefore, where an amount is said to be “payable”, it means that the payer has an enforceable obligation to pay the amount, even where that obligation does not crystallise until some future date. Under section GD 10(1)(a), an adequate rent is deemed to be payable on the days provided in the lease for payment, or on each day of the term of the lease on a pro rata basis. This means that the Act operates as if there was an obligation to pay the rent. The Commissioner’s view is that deeming the amount to be payable has the same effect as deeming that a legal obligation has been created and, therefore, as far as section DA 1(1) is concerned an expenditure has been incurred. The obligation in Bisley was an existing legal obligation to make expenditure that became payable on a future date. Thus, there are two types of expenditure that qualify as “incurred”: existing legal obligations payable now, and those that will become payable in the future. For expenditure either to be payable or to become payable, there must be an existing obligation to pay either now or later. Rent deemed to be payable falls within the first category i.e. an existing legal obligation payable now, and is clearly “incurred”. The nexus between expenditure and income is not affected by deeming If the leased property is used in the derivation of assessable or exempt income, any rental deemed payable by the lessee, including a less than adequate rent, is deemed “incurred” by the lessee for the purposes of section DA 1(1). However, the ruling does not go so far as to deem deductibility. For the deemed “incurred” rental to be deductible by the lessee the expenditure must also meet the express requirements of section DA 1 and not be excluded by the “general limitations” (section DA 2): • The expenditure must have a “nexus with income” in terms of section DA 1(1) and be incurred by the lessee in “deriving” “assessable” or “excluded” income (section DA 1(1)(a)) or, incurred by them “in the course of carrying on a business” for the purpose of deriving “assessable” or “excluded” income (section DA 1(1)(b)). • The expenditure must not be excluded from being deductible due to the “general limitations” of section DA 2. Conclusion Rent deemed to be payable, under section GD 10, is expenditure incurred by the lessee under section DA 1(1). Examples Example 1 A (lessor) leases a flat to her daughter B (lessee) for $10 per week. B then rents it to tenants for $400 per week. A has other income of $50,000 and is on a marginal tax rate of 33 cents in the dollar. B has no other income and pays 19.5 cents in the dollar. As B’s tax bracket is 9 lower than A’s, there is less tax being paid overall than if A rented the flat to the tenants directly. The Commissioner may determine that an adequate rent is higher than $10 per week. Section GD 10 will apply to deem the adequate rent to be the rent payable by B to A. The adequate rent is deemed to be income derived by A. The rent deemed payable is expenditure “incurred” by B, as there is deemed to be a legal obligation to pay. Example 2 C Ltd, a company (lessor) leases a property to X (lessee), a charitable body, at an inadequate rental. X uses the property in the derivation of exempt income. A “person” includes a company and an unincorporated body of persons (section 29 Interpretation Act 1999) and therefore X. Section GD 10(1) applies to a lease of property “by a company to any person” at a less than adequate rent. Under subsection (2), the section applies to the extent that the property is used by the lessee in the derivation of assessable income or exempt income. Therefore, an adequate rent determined by the Commissioner is deemed payable and is also deemed to have been “incurred” by X for the purpose of section DA 1. However, in this example, the “exempt income limitation” rule in section DA 2(3) will operate to deny X any deduction, because the expenditure is incurred in deriving exempt income. 10
1 IMPORTERS AND GST INPUT TAX DEDUCTIONS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 06/03 \[Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as Public Ruling BR Pub 97/10, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 11 (November 1997) which replaced Public Ruling BR Pub 95/9, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996). Public Ruling BR Pub 97/10 was extended by Gazette notice until 31 March 2005 and published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 5 (May 2000). This Ruling is to apply for an indefinite period.\] This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 20(3) and the definitions of “invoice” and “document” in section 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the importing of goods into New Zealand by registered persons for the purposes of making taxable supplies, the levying of GST on those goods by the New Zealand Customs Service under the Customs and Excise Act 1996, and the subsequent claiming of input tax deductions on that GST. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: A registered person who accounts for GST on an invoice basis may support a claim for a GST input tax deduction under section 20(3) for GST levied by the New Zealand Customs Service on goods imported into New Zealand with: •the New Zealand Customs Service Electronic Entry document; or •a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement or a Cash Statement. Withdrawn and replaced by BR Pub 22/07 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to claims for input tax deductions on GST levied by the New Zealand Customs Service on goods imported into New Zealand on and following 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by m e on the 19 th day of June 2006 Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel WITHDRAWN 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 06/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 06/03 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter of the Ruling was previously considered in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/9 published in TIB Vol 7, No. 7 (January 1996). After the New Zealand Customs Service moved to a partly electronic system for lodging and clearing imports Public Ruling BR Pub 97/10 was published in TIB Vol 9, No 11 (November 1997) to replace the earlier ruling. It was extended by Gazette notice until 31 March 2005 and published in TIB Vol 12, No 5 (May 2000). This Ruling replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 97/10. Background In December 1995, following the Court of Appeal decision Shell New Zealand Holding Co. Ltd. v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,163, Public Ruling BR Pub 95/9 was issued and published in TIB Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996). It provided that: A regi stered person may use either a Customs Import Entry Form or a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement to support a claim for a GST input tax deduction under section 20 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for GST levied by New Zealand Customs on goods imported into New Zealand. When that ruling was made the Customs Act 1966 was in force. On 1 October 1996 the Customs and Excise Act 1996 came into effect, repealing and replacing the Customs Act 1966. The Customs and Excise Act 1996 specifically provided for an electronic entry system (referred to as the Electronic Direct Import system in the previous ruling). Under this system an entry is made electronically by the agent and sent, electronically, either over the internet or using Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) software, to the New Zealand Custom s Service where the entry is confirmed and cleared and delivery given. Once the import entry is cleared, an electronic message is sent back to the agent, along with a delivery order. The agent can then print out the electronic documents for the importer. From 1 March 2004, every entry is required to be lodged electronically, either over the internet or through the EDI software. Legislation Section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 defines “invoice” as m eaning: A docum ent notifying an obligation to make payment: Section 2 also defines “document” as including: Any electronic data, computer programmes, computer tapes, and computer discs. Section 12 imposes GST on the importation of goods into New Zealand. It states: WITHDRAWN 4 (1) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a tax to be known as goods and services tax shall be levied, collected, and paid in accordance with the provisions of this section at the rate of 12.5 percent on the importation of goods (not being fine metal) into New Zealand, being goods that are— (a) Entered therein, or delivered, for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; or (b) Entered for delivery to a manufacturing area licensed under section 12 of the C ustoms and Excise Act 1996; or (c) B efore their entry, or delivery, for home consumption or, as the case may be, entry for del ivery to a manufact uring area licensed under section 12 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, dealt with in breach of any provision of the Customs and Excise Act 1996,— by reference to the value of the goods as determined under subsection (2) of this sect ion. ... (3) Subject to thi s section, tax levied under subsect ion (1) of this section shal l be collected and paid in accordance with the Customs and Excise Act 1996. Section 20(3) states: Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period— (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basi s pursuant to section 19 of thi s Act, the amount of the following: ... (ii) Input tax invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act duri ng that taxable period. ... Section 2 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 defines “duty” as: A duty, additional duty, tax, fee, charge, or levy imposed on goods by any of the provisions of this Act, and includes— ... (d) A duty or tax imposed by section 12 of t he Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Under section 39 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, goods to be imported must be entered in a prescribed form (including by electronic means): Entry of imported goods— (1) Subject to any regulations made under sect ion 40 of this Act, goods th at are imported or that are to be imported must be entered by the importer— (a) In such form and manner (including by electronic means into a computer or other device) as m ay be prescribed; and (b) Within such time as may be prescribed or such further tim e as the Chief Executive may allow. ... WITHDRAWN 5 Section 86(1) of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 states: Duty on imported goods a Crown debt— (1) The duty on all goods imported constitutes, immediately on im portation of the goods, a debt due t o t he C rown. (2) Such duty i s owed by the importer of the goods, and, if more than one (whether at or at any tim e after the time of importatio n) then jointly and severally by all of them . (3) Subject to this Act, such debt becomes due and payabl e when— (a)Goods have been entered in accordance with section 39 of this Act and the ent ry has been passed for home consumption; or (b) Goods have been entered in accordan ce with section 39 of this Act for removal to a manufacturi ng area; or (c) Goods have been wrongfully landed or otherwise wrongfully dealt with without having been entered pursuant t o section 39 of this Act; or (d) An offence has been committed agai nst this Act in respect of the goods. (4) Such debt is recoverable by action at the suit of the Chief Executive on behalf of the Cr own. ... Under section 88 of the Custom s and Excise Act 1996, an entry for goods is deemed to be an assessment for the purposes of that Act: Assessment of duty— (1) An entry for goods made under this Act is deemed to be an assessment by the importe r or l i censee, as the case may be, as to t he duty payable in respect of t hose goods. (2) If the Chief Executive has reasonable cause to suspect that duty is payable on goods by a person who has not m ade an entry in respect of t he goods, the Chief Executive may assess th e dut y at such amount as the Chief Executive thi nks proper. (3) The person liable for the payment of the duty shall be advised of the assessment by notice in writin g. ... Application of the Legislation Section 12 provides that GST shall be levied and paid on goods im ported into New Zealand. Section 2 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 defines the GST on imported goods as a duty and section 86 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996 provides that this duty is a debt due to the Crown and is recoverable under the Customs and Excise Act. Under section 20(3)(a)(ii), registered persons who account on an invoice basis are perm itted to claim input tax at the earlier of invoicing or payment. Registered persons who account on a payments basis are not affected by the subject ma tter of the Ruling. Unlike other claims for input tax deductions, section 20(3)(a)(ii) only requires the importers to hold invoices to support their claims rather than tax invoices. This is because the New Zealand Custom s Service does not make any supplies when it is levying GST on goods imported into New Zealand, and so is not required to issue tax WITHDRAWN 6 invoices under section 24 of the Act. Given the electronic entry procedure, the question arises as to what documentation issued by the New Zealand Customs Service is acceptable as an “invoice” for the purposes of the Act. The Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Holding Co. Ltd v CIR considered the issue of when an importer could claim an input tax deduction for GST levied on goods imported into New Zealand. The Court of Appeal noted that an “invoice” is defined in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act as “a document notifying an obligation to make payment”. The Court held that when the goods are entered, this constitutes the duty as a debt due to the Crown. Theref ore, at the point that the Customs Im port Entry Form was signed by the Customs Officer, the Court considered this to be notice to the importer of the obligation to make payment. As a result, the Customs Import Entry Form, which stated the total duty, total GST and the total amount payable, fell within the GST definition of “invoice”. BR Pub 95/9 confirmed that an importer could use a Customs Import Entry Form to support a claim for a GST input tax deduction. As of 1 March 2004, all commercial entries are now required to be lodged and cleared electronically. The issue is whether the electronic entry used is an invoice sufficient to support a claim for input tax deduction claims. The electronic entry is cleared by the New Zealand Customs Service when the “Lodgement” and “Delivery” numbers are issued, rather than being signed by a Customs Officer. The debt due to the Crown is created when the entry is confirmed in this way and consequently the clearing of the entry can be considered equivalent to the previous procedure of the signing and stam ping of a manual import entry. W hen the agent receives the electronic entry document they are notified of the total duty and GST owing on each entry. The information received on the electronic version of an import entry has not changed materially from that of the manual entry. The electronic entry document shows the total duty, total GST, and total payable. It identifies the supplier and the recipient of the goods and services, describes the goods supplied with a detailed coding system, and quantifies the consideration for the supply. Therefore, the electronic entry document contains the inform ation thought necessary by the Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Holding Co. Ltd v CIR to establish and identify the customs duty and GST owed by the importer to the Crown. Therefore, the electronic entry document constitutes an “invoice” for GST purposes so as to trigger the time of supply and the resulting input tax entitlement for GST invoice-based importers under section 20(3). The New Zealand Customs Service also operates an optional deferred payment scheme for importers, under which it issues a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement for the duty owed by importers on all the goods they import during a particular month. The Deferred Paym ent Scheme has four billing cycles within a one-month period. Payment is deferred for 21 working days from the end of an importer’s allocated billing cycle. The Deferred Payment of Duty Statement is created from the information contained in the electronic entry document and so is also acceptable documentation to support a GST input tax deduction claim. WITHDRAWN 7 If an agent is not on the Deferred Paym ent Scheme, the New Zealand Customs Service issues Cash Statements. Under the Cash Statements scheme, the duty owed must be paid before the imported good is released. Again, the Cash Statement is created from the information contained in the electronic entry docum ent and so is also acceptable documentation to support a GST input tax deduction claim. Example A taxpayer imports and sells European cars. She is registered for GST, accounts for tax payable on an invoice basis, and files GST returns on a two-monthly basis. The taxpayer imports cars worth $300,000 on 28 September. Her agent enters the details of the cars she has imported and their values into the correct electronic entry form and sends it electronically to the New Zealand Customs Service. Within a few minutes the New Zealand Custom s accepts the import entry as correct, issues lodgement and delivery numbers, and electronically sends the cleared entry and a delivery order back to the taxpayer’s agent stating the total duty, total GST, and total amount payable on the importation of those cars. The taxpayer’s agent prints out copies of the electronic entry document and delivery order and gives them to the taxpayer. The taxpayer retains these for evidentiary purposes. The taxpayer is on the Deferred Paym ent Scheme operated by the New Zealand Customs Service, and receives a Deferred Payment of Duty Statement on 23 October. The payment is deferred for 21 working days. The statement lists all the goods she has imported for the period 23 September to 23 October, and states the total amount of duty and GST payable. The taxpayer’s taxable period ends on 30 September. She is required to furnish her GST return for the m onths of August and September, stating the amount of GST she has to return for those two months. The taxpayer will include in her GST return for that taxable period an input tax deduction claim for the GST levied on the cars im ported on 28 September. The taxpayer only needs an invoice to substantiate her claim for an input tax deduction for the GST that the New Zealand Customs Service has levied on the imported cars. The taxpayer may claim the input deduction in the taxable period ending 30 September, because the electronic entry document contains all the necessary details to constitute an invoice for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. She does not need to delay the claim until the period in which she receives the Deferred Payment of Duty Statement. WITHDRAWN
“PAID-UP CAPITAL AMOUNT” DEFINITION Section CD 32(4) Public Ruling – BR Pub 06/04 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as Public Rulings BR Pub 96/6 published in TIB Vol 7, No 12, April 1996, BR Pub 98/1 published in TIB Vol 10, No 2, February 1998 and BR Pub 01/02 published in TIB Vol 13, No 4, April 2001. BR Pub 01/02 expired on 31 March 2006. This new ruling takes into account changes arising from the enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004. Its application period is on and following 1 April 2006 for an indefinite period. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies to the definition of “paid-up capital” within the “available subscribed capital amount” formula in section CD 32(4)(a). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to companies that liquidate on or after 1 July 1994 and distribute to shareholders the same class of capital that the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against its losses. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The “total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in the definition of “paid-up capital” within the “available subscribed capital amount” formula includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to liquidations (as defined in section OB 1), and to distributions from such liquidations, on and following 1 April 2006 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30th day of June 2006. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 06/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 06/04 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/02 (TIB Vol 13, No 4, April 2001 at page 8 under the heading “Definition of Transitional Capital Amount”) which was issued in accordance with the Income Tax Act 1994 (“1994 Act”). On 1 April 2005 the Income Tax Act 2004 (“2004 Act”) came into force. Under the 2004 Act the subject matter covered in BR Pub 01/02 is now found in the “available subscribed capital amount” formula in section CD 32. This Ruling applies on and following 1 April 2006 for an indefinite period. Background The Companies Act 1993 enacted major reforms in the company law area. One of the most significant was the removal of the concept of “paid-up capital”. Consequently the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 was enacted to accommodate the changes to company law. In particular, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 introduced, with application from 1 July 1994, a definition of “available subscribed capital” for tax purposes. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 also repealed section 4A(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 4A(1)(h) allowed the Commissioner to exclude from dividends such amount distributed to a shareholder of the company, as the Commissioner considered just and reasonable where: • the company had reduced the amount of the paid-up capital of the shareholder by writing off, with High Court approval, losses incurred by the company; and • the company was subsequently wound up; and • upon the winding up of the company, an amount (whether in money or money’s worth) was distributed to the shareholder in excess of the amount paid up on the shares of the shareholder. In effect, section 4A(1)(h) had allowed a company, upon winding-up, to restore a loss of paid-up capital without the shareholders suffering any tax consequences. The issue addressed in the previous rulings was whether the “available subscribed capital” formula, as prescribed in section OB 1 of the 1994 Act, performed the same function as, the now repealed, section 4A(1)(h). 2 This ruling updates the previous rulings by taking account of the 2004 Act, under which the “available subscribed capital” formula is now prescribed in section CD 32. Legislation Income Tax Act 1994 Section OB 1 states: “ Transitional capital amount”, of a share in a company means - (a) Unless paragraph (b) applies, the amount calculated using the formula: j + k x m l where j is the total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 for shares of the same class as the share (whenever issued and including the share), not being - (i) An amount paid up by a bonus issue made after 31 March 1982 and before 1 October 1988, except if - (A) The date of the acquisition, redemption, other cancellation, or liquidation falls more than 10 years after the date of the bonus issue; or (B) The amount was paid up by way of application of an amount of qualifying share premium; or (C) The relevant time is the time of liquidation of the company; or (ii) An amount paid up by a bonus issue (other than a taxable bonus issue) made on or after 1 October 1988, except if the amount was paid up by way of application of an amount of qualifying share premium; and k is the total of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994 for shares of that class (whenever issued and including the share), not being an amount that is later (but before 1 July 1994) applied to pay up capital on shares in the company; and l is the number of shares of that class (including the share) ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and m is the number of shares of that class (including the share) on issue at the close of 30 June 1994: (b) In the case of a company that is a group investment fund to which either section CZ 4A or CZ 4B applies, the value of the superannuation fund interest at the close of business on 31 March 1999. Income Tax Act 2004 The relevant part of section CD 32 provides: SECT CD 32 AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL AMOUNT 3 CD 32(1) FORMULA FOR CALCULATING AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL For a share (share) in a company at any relevant time (calculation time), the amount of available subscribed capital is calculated using the formula - 1 July 1994 balance + subscriptions - returns. CD 32(2) DEFINITION OF ITEMS IN FORMULA In the formula, - (a) 1 July 1994 balance is, - (i) if the company existed before 1 July 1994, the amount calculated under subsection (3); and (ii) in any other case, zero: (b) subscriptions, subject to subsections (6) to (20), is the total amount of consideration that the company received, after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time, for the issue of shares of the same class (the class) as the share: (c) returns, subject to subsections (21) to (24), is the total amount of consideration that the company paid, after 30 June 1994 and before the calculation time, on the cancellation of shares in the relevant class and that was not a dividend because of section CD 14 or CD 16 or a corresponding provision of an earlier Act. CD 32(3) 1 JULY 1994 BALANCE The 1 July 1994 balance is calculated using the formula - paid-up capital + premiums x 30 June 1994 shares all shares issued CD 32(4) DEFINITION OF ITEMS IN FORMULA In the formula, - (a) paid-up capital, subject to subsection (5) relating to bonus issues, is the total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 for shares in the class: (b) premiums is the total amount of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994 for shares in the class, but not including amounts applied before 1 July 1994 in paying up capital: (c) all shares issued is the number of shares in the class ever issued at the end of 30 June 1994: (d) 30 June 1994 shares is the number of shares in the class on issue at the end of 30 June 1994. Income Tax Act 1994 Under the 1994 Act, to calculate the available subscribed capital for companies existing prior to 1 July 1994, the “transitional capital amount” (as defined in section OB 1) had to be ascertained. 4 The terms “available subscribed capital” and “transitional capital amount” are discussed in more detail in TIB Vol 6, No 6 – Company Law Reform (December 1994). In the “transitional capital amount” definition is “factor j”, which section OB 1 of the 1994 Act prescribed as including “the aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994”. In Public Ruling BR Pub 96/6 (published in April 1996) the Commissioner ruled that: The “aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the formula within the definition of the “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. That ruling was reissued as Public Ruling BR Pub 98/1 (published in February 1998). The definition of "transitional capital amount" was amended in 1998 by adding a new paragraph (b) – which did not affect the previous ruling – and, at the same time, the wording was changed to bring it into line with the current legislative style. In particular the former wording of "aggregate amount of capital" was changed to read "total amount of capital". The Commissioner considered that this wording change did not affect the interpretation of the definition or the calculation of item "j" so the previous ruling was reissued, with the word “total” replacing the word “aggregate”, as Public Ruling BR Pub 01/02 (published in April 2001). Income Tax Act 2004 In the 2004 Act the “available subscribed capital amount” formula is set out in section CD 32. Included in that formula, at section CD 32(2), is factor “1 July 1994 balance”, which in turn contains factor “paid-up capital” that is defined in section CD 32(4)(a) as: (a) paid-up capital, subject to subsection (5) relating to bonus issues, is the total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 for shares in the class. \[Emphasis Added\] The Commissioner considers that the total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 in the definition of “paid-up capital” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. The reason for this view is that the factors “1 July 1994” and “paid-up capital” in section CD 32 are equivalent to the section OB 1 definitions of “transitional capital amount” and “factor ‘j’”, respectively, in the 1994 Act. Hence, despite the change in terminology, this ruling is equivalent to the previous rulings given in relation to ‘transitional capital amount’. 5 Further, it is observed that section OB 1 still contains a definition for ‘transitional capital amount’. However, that definition no longer forms part of the ‘available subscribed capital amount’ formula. Application of legislation The “total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in the definition of “paid-up capital” within the “available subscribed capital amount” formula includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. This allows a company to restore the written-off capital upon liquidation, without the distribution being treated as a dividend to the shareholders. Example 1990 M Ltd issues 1,000 fully paid-up shares of the same class at $1 each. 1992 Pursuant to High Court approval, M Ltd writes off $500 (50 cents per share) of paid-up capital from its accumulated losses. 1994 Paid-up capital at 30 June 1994 is $500. 2003 Shareholders decide to liquidate M Ltd. There have been no movements in the capital of M Ltd since the capital reduction in 1992. After the sale of assets the distribution will be $750 (75c per share). Because M Ltd existed before 1 July 1994, its “available subscribed capital amount” is calculated under section CD 32, as follows: 1. To calculate M’s “available subscribed capital amount”, the following formula from section CD 32(1) is used: 1 July 1994 balance + subscriptions – returns Assuming that the “subscriptions” and “returns” after 30 June 1994 are nil, the “available subscribed capital amount” will be the same as the “1 July 1994 balance”. 2. To calculate M’s “1 July 1994 balance”, the following formula from section CD 32(3) is used: paid-up capital + premiums x 30 June 1994 shares all shares issued where- paid-up capital is the paid-up capital at the close of 30 June 1994 $ 500 add back capital reduction $ \_ 500 total capital paid up before 1 July 1994 as $1,000 6 defined in this Ruling premiums qualifying share premium assume is 0 all shares issued number of shares ever issued before close of 1,000 30 June 1994 30 June 1994 shares shares on issue at close of 30 June 1994 1,000 $1,000 + 0 x 1,000 = $1,000 = “1 July 1994 balance” 1,000 The “1 July 1994 balance” and, on this occasion, the “available subscribed capital amount” both equal $1,000. The $750 (75c per share) distributed is not treated as a dividend as it does not exceed the “available subscribed capital amount” of $1,000 ($1.00 per share). 7
ASSESSABILITY OF PAYMENTS UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS ACT FOR HUMILIATION, LOSS OF DIGNITY, AND INJURY TO FEELINGS PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 06/05 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 01/04 published in TIB Vol 13, No 5, (May 2001). The preceding rulings were Public Rulings BR Pub 97/3 and 97/3A published in TIB Volume 9, No 3 (March 1997). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous ruling. However, the new ruling has been updated and applies the Income Tax Act 2004, which came into force on 1 April 2005, rather than the Income Tax Act 1994 provisions. The changes between the provisions of the 1994 and 2004 Acts affecting this ruling do not affect the conclusions previously reached. This ruling applies for an indefinite period. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections, CA 1(2), CE 1 and NC 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: • The making of a payment to an employee or former employee for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000; or • The making of a payment to an employee or former employee pursuant to an out of court settlement genuinely based on the employee’s rights to compensation under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000. This Ruling does not, however, apply to such payments that are in reality for lost wages or other income, but which are merely characterised by the parties as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings (irrespective of whether such an agreement is signed by a mediator under the Employment Relations Act). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Payments that are genuinely and entirely for compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are not income under section CE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. • Such compensation payments are not gross income under ordinary concepts under section CA 1(2) . • There is consequently no liability under section NC 2 for employers or former employers to deduct PAYE from these payments. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received on and following 1 October 2005 for an indefinite period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30th day of June 2006. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 06/05 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 06/05 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/04 published in TIB Vol 13, No 5, (May 2001)) at page 8. The Ruling applies for an indefinite period. Background The Employment Relations Act 2000 provides for a number of remedies when an employee has a personal grievance against a current or former employer. This includes compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee. The Employment Relations Act also establishes specialist institutions with exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the rights of parties litigating on employment contracts: the Employment Relations Authority and the Employment Court. The Employment Relations Service of the Department of Labour has jurisdiction to provide mediation services. Section 103(1) of the Employment Relations Act defines “personal grievance” as: For the purposes of this Act, personal grievance means any grievance that an employee may have against the employee’s employer or former employer because of a claim— (a) that the employee has been unjustifiably dismissed; or (b) that the employee’s employment, or 1 or more conditions of the employee’s employment (including any condition that survives termination of the employment), is or are or was (during employment that has since been terminated) affected to the employee’s disadvantage by some unjustifiable action by the employer; or (c) that the employee has been discriminated against in the employee’s employment; or (d) that the employee has been sexually harassed in the employee’s employment; or (e) that the employee has been racially harassed in the employee’s employment; or (f) that the employee has been subject to duress in the employee’s employment in relation to membership or non-membership of a union or employees organisation. Section 123(1) of the Employment Relations Act provides a number of remedies available to the Authority or Court when the Authority or Court determines that an employee has a “personal grievance” including: ... (b) the reimbursement to the employee of a sum equal to the whole or any part of the wages or other money lost by the employee as a result of the grievance: 3 (c) the payment to the employee of compensation by the employee's employer, including compensation for - (i) humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee; and (ii) loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, which the employee might reasonably have been expected to obtain if the personal grievance had not arisen: The Ruling considers whether such payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee are amounts derived “in connection with the employee’s employment” and thus “employment income” of the employee, pursuant to section CE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Section CE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides: CE 1 AMOUNTS DERIVED IN CONNECTION WITH EMPLOYMENT The following amounts derived by a person in connection with their employment or service are income of the person: (a) salary or wages or an allowance, bonus, extra pay, or gratuity: (b) expenditure on account of an employee that is expenditure on account of the person: (c) the market value of board that the person receives in connection with their employment or service: (d) a benefit received under a share purchase agreement: (e) directors’ fees: (f) compensation for loss of employment or service: (g) any other benefit in money. Section CA 1(2) states that “an amount is also income of a person if it is their income under ordinary concepts”. Application of the Legislation If payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are “employment income”, they would be included under section CE 1 as income of the person. They would be included in the calculation of “net income” under section BC 4 and would consequently form part of “taxable income” as calculated under section BC 5. Section CE 1 defines “employment income” to include “any other benefit in money”. Payments under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act are a benefit in money. The issue is, therefore, whether these payments are made “in connection with the employment or service” of the recipient. 4 Relationship with Income Tax Act 1994 The Income Tax Act 2004 introduces the concept of an amount received by a person “in connection with their employment or service” being income of a person. Previously, the 1994 Act referred to an amount being monetary remuneration, and thus gross income, if it was an amount derived by a person “in respect of or in relation to” their employment or service. The wording of the 2004 Act provision is different to that in the 1994 Act. However, while the 2004 Act has replaced the 1994 Act, section YA 3(3) of the 2004 Act nevertheless provides that provisions of the 2004 Act are the provisions of the 1994 Act in rewritten form. The provisions of the 2004 Act are intended to have the same effect as the corresponding provision of the 1994 Act. The exception is, pursuant to section YA 3(5), where an “identified policy change”, as specified in schedule 22A, exists. In this instance no identified policy change has been specified in schedule 22A. Therefore, the presumption is that the adoption of the term “in connection with” was not intended to give rise to an interpretation that differs from that which would apply if the term “in respect of or in relation to”, as used in the definition of “monetary remuneration” under the 1994 Act, still applied. It is therefore relevant to consider the meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” in the interpretation of the phrase “in connection with” in this situation. The meaning of “in connection with” The phrase “in connection with” is not defined in the Act. However, it has been considered in other contexts. In Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272, Hardie Boys J stated, at page 279: “In connection with” may signify no more than a relationship between one thing and another. The expression does not necessarily require that it be a causal relationship: Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465, 479 per Wilcox J. But, as Davies J warned in Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487, at p 491: “Expressions such as ‘relating to’, ‘in connection with’ and ‘in respect of’ are commonly found in legislation but invariably raise problems of statutory interpretation. They are terms which fluctuate in operation from statute to statute.... The terms may have a very wide operation but they do not usually carry the widest possible ambit, for they are subject to the context in which they are used, to the words with which they are associated, and to the object or purpose of the statutory provision in which they appear.” In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441 Bathgate DJ noted at page 59,445: It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. In Hatrick (A) & Co v R \[1923\] AC 213, the Privy Council considered the meaning of “in connection with” in the context of section 10 of the Government Railway Act 5 1908, which empowered the Minister of Railways to fix charges to be paid for goods stored in any shed or store “in connection with a railway”. Their Lordships stated, at page 225: In the view of their Lordships these words cannot apply to something done on a space or in a building merely contiguous to or abutting upon a railway, even though it be the property of a railway; if the thing done forms no part of or has no connection with the property business or a railway, as a carrier of passengers and goods by rail, or in other words that the expression “in connection with a railway” means connect with, subserving and being ancillary to, the business of a railway as such carriers ... These words ... must be direct to something different from propinquity or contiguity, and in their Lordships’ view, having regard to all the provisions of the statute, mean in s 10 in connection with the business and operations of a railway as a carrier of goods by rail. In Hammington v Ross (1992) 2 NZ ConvC 191,150, the High Court considered whether a lawyer’s omission to disclose his investment in the client’s product to the client was a “civil liability incurred in connection with the provision of professional services”. McGechan J stated, at page 191,162: One next goes to the operative clause. It provides cover for claims arising from civil liability incurred “in connection with” provision of “professional services”. The clause is a broad one. It extends to “civil liability”, not mere classical “neglect, error or omission”. It extends to claims incurred “in connection with” the provision of professional services, as contrasted with “in the” provision of professional services. It is not limited to strict integral components of those very services themselves. With that wider wording it was conceded, and rightly, that activity covered would include omission to provide, and “ancillary conduct not strictly professional work - eg, the business advice here”. Clearly however there must be a nexus between such wider activity giving rise to liability and the professional services. The wider activity must be related, and not merely co-existent. In Pan Pacific Forest Industries (NZ) Ltd v Norwich General (1997) 7 TCLR 560, the High Court considered whether an insurance policy applied where the product supplied was faulty. The relevant policy applied to “accidental loss of...property...resulting from accidents in connection with the business”. Paterson J stated at page 569: The operative provisions of the policy apply if the accident was “in connection with the business”. Giving those words their natural and ordinary meaning the accident did arise in connection with the business if it arose because the business supplied faulty materials and parts and gave faulty advice. The phrase “in connection with”, has also been considered in the context of section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994, a provision that allows a tax deduction for costs incurred “in connection with” the determination of a liability to tax. In that context, Bathgate DJ found in Case E84 that the term required a narrow interpretation. He said, at page 59,445: It may be that only an empirical and common sense approach to the interpretation of he words can be applied in each particular case to determine where, if at all, the line should be drawn to allow or not allow expenditure “in connection with” an assessment. However I believe that a narrow interpretation of the words “... any expenditure ... in connection with ... the assessment ...” is the correct interpretation: only expenditure closely and immediately connected to the assessment itself is intended to be allowed as a deduction, and expenditure more remote, as for instance in this case, the expenditure of O in making his trip to visit A, is not expenditure allowed as a deduction under the section. 6 This case suggests that, in the context of section DJ 5, the phrase “in connection with” requires a close linkage between the expenditure and the “determination” or “calculation” of a liability to tax. The above cases suggest that for something to be “in connection with” something else, a necessary degree of nexus is required, and that the two things must be related to each other in some way. For instance, in TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190 (on appeal CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819) the issue was whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer constituted a consideration for the warranty repair services provided by the taxpayer’s agent. The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, common sense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, ie, whether the link is strong enough. In Berry v FCT \[1953\] HCA 70; (1953) 89 CLR 653, the Australian High Court considered the meaning of “in connection with” in the context of a provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). Kitto J held (at para 12) that consideration will be “in connection with” property where “the receipt of the payment has a substantial relation, in a practical business sense, to that property”. Overall, the Commissioner considers that the above cases suggest that the phrase “in connection with” should be given a broad interpretation. The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” It is also necessary to consider the relevant words that were used in the Income Tax Act 1994. As noted, in that Act the relevant test was whether an amount was “in respect of or in relation to” employment, and thus “monetary remuneration”. The phrase “in respect of or in relation to” is capable of having a very wide meaning. For example, in Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, the Court of Appeal was dealing with certain lump sum payments made by Shell to employees who transferred at the request of Shell. The Court discussed the definition of “monetary remuneration”. The case concerned the part of the definition of “monetary remuneration” which says: ... emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer. McKay J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 11,306 that: The words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. Although McKay J acknowledged that the payments in Shell were not made under the contract of employment in that case, this did not mean that the employees received the payment outside the employment relationship. The learned Judge had earlier referred to the fact that the payments were not expressly provided under the employees’ 7 written employment contracts but were made pursuant to Shell’s employment policy as a matter of discretion. They were still made “because he or she is an employee”. Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject- matters to which the words refer. Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. Other New Zealand cases (Case U38 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,361 and C of IR v Kerslake (2001) 20 NZTC 17,158) have also considered the phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. Both cases are consistent with the authorities cited above in this commentary. Context may affect the meaning However, many cases have demonstrated that the meaning to be given to the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” may vary according to the context in which it appears. In State Government Insurance Office v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in determining whether the debt due to the Government Insurance Office fell within section 292(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1961-1975 (Q.) as “amounts ... due in respect of workers’ compensation under any law relating to workers’ compensation accrued before the relevant date”. The Court held that amounts which could be recovered by the Government Insurance Office from an uninsured company pursuant to section 8(5) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1916-1974(Q.) for money paid to workers employed by the uninsured company were not amounts due “in respect of” workers’ compensation under the Companies Act. At page 561 Mason J observed that: ... as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to “in respect of” depends very much on the context in which it is found. Stephen J also discussed the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”, noting at pages 553-554 that it was capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity, and went on to say: Were the phrase devoid of significant context, it could, I think, be taken to be descriptive of the relationship between the present indebtedness owed to the State Government Insurance Office and the subject matter of workers’ compensation. However a context does exist which is in my view sufficient to confine the operation of s 292(1)(c) to bounds too narrow to be of service to the appellant. 8 In TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190, certain payments were made to a New Zealand distributor by its overseas parent in relation to repairs which had to be made to cars sold to the New Zealand subsidiary and then sold to dealers. The issue was whether the payments were zero-rated. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was relevant. Part of the definition of “consideration” states: ...any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services ... The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: A sub-issue is whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer (MC) was made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the repair work in the sense required by the definition of “consideration” in s 2 of the Act. ... Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, commonsense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, i.e, whether the link is strong enough. The High Court’s decision on the appeal of Case R34 is CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819. In that case McGechan J said at page 15,831: ...it is necessary there be a genuine connection. The legislature is not to be taken as taxing on an unrealistic or tenuous connection basis. In Cleland v CIR, in respect of $50,000 awarded for loss of benefits, Hammond J concluded that it was compensation for loss of office or employment. In order to reach this conclusion Hammond J had to consider whether the amount was “in respect of or in relation to” the taxpayer’s employment or service. Hammond J referred to the Court of Appeal decision in Shell and noted that those words are to be interpreted widely. He stated at paragraphs 46 to 48 of his judgment: The award is clearly a “rolled up” one by the Employment Court in respect of or in relation to Mr Cleland’s past employment. ... As a sub-part of the argument, it was said for Mr Cleland that, because the award was calculated on future wages and benefits, it was not compensation for (past) loss of office or employment. That is not the test. The test is whether the wages and benefits actually awarded arose out of Mr Cleland’s employment. It does not at all follow that, because the award was made relating to a period after the termination of the employment, it was not made in respect of, or in relation to, the employment. As Mr Almao said, “compensation for loss of office or employment by its very nature encompasses future benefits; benefits that an employee might have received had his or her employment continued”. Similarly, the meaning of the words “in connection with” can be affected by the context in which they are used. In this regard, the context in which the words “in connection with” are used is to provide that a benefit in money will be income of a person where it is derived “in connection with their employment or service”. 9 Therefore, as noted above the term “in connection with” has a wide meaning, but only, in this context, in respect of “employment or service”. Not all payments to employees are “in connection with” employment or service While it is true that an employee would not receive a payment under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act if he or she were not an employee, it would seem clear that this type of “but for” approach to “in connection with” is not universally applied in the context of employment, and that not all payments made by an employer to an employee are in connection with employment, or previously within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. In Fraser v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,356, at page 12,363, Doogue J in the High Court said: There is no dispute that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” are words of the widest possible scope: see Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 at p 11,306, and Smith v FC of T 87 ATC 4883; (1987) 164 CLR 513; (1987) 19 ATR 274. Mr Harley does, however, submit, correctly, that it does not follow that all payments made are necessarily income and refers, for example, to reimbursement payments. In Shell, McKay J highlighted the fact that the payments in that case were both: • made to the recipients because they were employees; and • paid to compensate for the loss incurred by the employee in having to relocate in order to take up a new position with the employer. Many cases have concluded that, in appropriate circumstances, amounts received were not income, or assessable, even though paid by an employer to an employee. In FC of T v Rowe (1995) ATC 4,691, for example, the taxpayer was employed as an engineer for the Livingston Shire Council. As a result of a number of complaints against him he was suspended. An inquiry was commenced, and he incurred legal costs as a result of engaging counsel to defend himself against dismissal during the course of the inquiry. The taxpayer was cleared of any charges of misconduct but was dismissed a year later. The taxpayer claimed his legal costs as a deduction. Although the Council refused to reimburse the taxpayer for his legal costs, the Queensland government subsequently made an ex gratia payment to him. The Full Federal Court considered, amongst other things, whether the ex gratia payment constituted assessable income. By majority, the Court concluded that the payment was not assessable under section 25(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as income in accordance with ordinary concepts, nor was it assessable under section 26(e) of that Act as being compensation “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to” any employment. Accordingly, Burchett and Drummond JJ (with Beaumont J dissenting) held that the payment was not assessable. Burchett J held that the payment was not a reward for the taxpayer’s services but was a recognition for the wrong done to him. The payments were not remuneration but a reparation, and they were not sufficiently related to the performance of income- earning activities. On the same reasoning, it was too remote from the employment to be caught by section 26(e). Further, the payment was not assessable under section 26(e) because the employer/employee relationship between the Council and the 10 taxpayer was merely part of the background facts against which the ex gratia payment was made. On appeal, the majority of the Full High Court confirmed the Federal Court’s decision: FC of T v Rowe (1997) ATC 4,317. Other cases, relating to wartime service, have also shown that payments made to present or former employees for reasons unconnected with their service as an employee will not necessarily be assessable income on a “but for” basis. In Louisson v Commissioner of Taxes \[1943\] NZLR 1, at page 9 Myers CJ and Northcroft J said of payments made by an employer to a former employee who had enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in World War II: In our opinion, such payments were personal gifts to each of the employees coming within the description in the resolution - gifts made simply as an acknowledgment of personal appreciation of the sacrifice made in the service of the Country by persons whose employment with the company has ceased and who are under no engagement to return to that employment. Similarly, in the Australian case of FCT v Dixon (1954) 5 AITR 443, the taxpayer received payments from his prior employer topping up his military pay. It would appear from the judgment that the Australian Commissioner argued that even a slight relationship to employment was sufficient to satisfy the test in section 26(e) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \[which made assessable certain sums granted to the taxpayer “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment...”.\]. This argument was rejected by Dixon CJ and Williams J, who stated at page 446 that: We are not prepared to give effect to this view of the operation of s.26(e) ...There can, of course, be no doubt that the sum of £104 represented an allowance, gratuity or benefit allowed or given to the taxpayer by Macdonald, Hamilton and Company. Our difficulty is in agreeing with the view that it was allowed or given to him in respect of, or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of, or services rendered by him ...We are not prepared to give s.26(e) a construction which makes it unnecessary that the allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium shall in any sense be a recompense or consequence of the continued or contemporaneous existence of the relation of employer and employee or a reward for services rendered given either during the employment or at or in consequence of its termination. In the same case, at page 450, McTiernan J stated that: The words of paragraph (e) are wide, but, I think, not wide enough to prevent an employer from giving money or money’s worth to an employee continuing in his service or leaving it, without incurring liability to tax in respect of the gift. The relationship of employer and employee is a matter of contract. The contractual relations are not so total and all embracing that there cannot be personal or social relations between employer and employee. A payment arising from those relations may have no connexion with the donee’s employment. These principles have also been applied by the courts in cases involving contracts for services. In Scott v FCT (1969) 10 AITR 367, Windeyer J in the High Court of Australia, considered the meaning of the words “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him” in section 26(e) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936- 1961. The case concerned a solicitor who received a gift of £10,000 from a grateful client. Windeyer J stated at page 374 that the meaning of the words of the legislation “must be sought in the nature of the topic concerning which they are used”. Windeyer J at page 376 referred to a passage from the judgment of Kitto J in Squatting 11 Investment Co Ltd v FCT (1953) 5 AITR 496, at 524, where Kitto J (speaking of certain English cases) said: The distinction these decisions have drawn between taxable and non-taxable gifts is the distinction between, on the one hand, gifts made in relation to some activity or occupation of the donee of an income-producing character ... and, on the other hand, gifts referable to the attitude of the donor personally to the donee personally. Adopting this as a general principle, his Honour held that the £10,000 was not given or received as remuneration for services rendered and it did not form part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. J & G Knowles & Associates Pty Ltd v FC of T (2000) ATC 4,151 discusses the words “in respect of the employment” in the Australian FBT legislation. The case concerned interest-free loans to directors of a corporate trustee. Units in the trust fund were held by discretionary family trusts established by the directors. The lower courts were satisfied by a causal relationship, or a discernible and rational link between the loans and each director’s employment. However, the Full Federal Court said that there had to be more than just any causal relationship between the benefit and the employment: the link had to be sufficient or material. In the Commissioner’s view, the term “in connection with”, in the context of a payment being made “in connection with” a person’s employment or service, is to be given a very broad interpretation and has a very wide operation. However, it is still necessary for there to be a sufficient relationship or nexus between the payment and the person’s employment or service. The nature and context of the payments Looking at the nature and context of payments contemplated by section 123(1)(c)(i), it is strongly arguable that they do not intrinsically result from the employee and employer relationship. It is true that if the employee were not an employee then there would be no entitlement to receive the payment, but payments under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the employment relationship. They are based on the existence of a personal grievance. Provisions for such compensation can be seen as being included in the Employment Relations Act because the sometimes unequal power of the parties to the employment contract means that such personal grievances may be likely to occur in that setting. It is noteworthy that the Human Rights Act 1993 also includes provisions for dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment of employees, even though that is not “employment legislation” at all. C of IR v Smythe (1981) 5 NZTC 61,038 involved an employment context where the taxpayer retired from his employment. At the time of his retirement he was entitled to 26 weeks long service leave and to the equivalent of 26 weeks salary in lieu of long service leave to which he was entitled but had not taken. This was paid in one payment of $19,920.16. The issue before the Court was whether the payment was assessable income. At p 61,040, Richardson J said: 12 The first step in deciding the character in law of the lump sum payment in question is to determine the true nature of the legal arrangements pursuant to which the payment was made. It is that legal character of the transaction which is decisive - not the overall economic consequences to the parties, and not the legal consequences of an alternative transaction into which the taxpayer could have entered but chose not to do so. \[Italics added\] Payments of compensation under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act differ markedly from the situation in Shell v CIR. In that case at page 11,306, McKay J said: It is true ...that the payment is not made under the contract of employment....It is nevertheless paid to an employee only because he or she is an employee, and is paid to compensate for the loss incurred in having to change the employee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the company. (Emphasis added) Thus, in the Shell case, the employees received the payments as employees, and in order to compensate for the loss sustained as a result of the employment-related relocation. In the ordinary course, the Commissioner considers genuine payments under section 123(1)(c)(i) to be too remote from the employment relationship to be within the definition of monetary remuneration. The Commissioner considers that the employment relationship in such instances is merely part of the background facts against which the compensation payments are made. The payments are not made “in connection with” the employment or service of the taxpayer. At first glance, it may be thought that this approach conflicts with the outcome in Case L78 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,451, where Barber DJ held that an ex gratia payment, to compensate for the employer’s failure to give adequate notice of redundancy, was assessable as “monetary remuneration”. However, the result in that case turned substantially on the objector’s evidence as to the receipt being in the nature of “extra wages”. Barber DJ stated at page 1,455 that: The objector himself related the $7,009.52 to extra holiday pay and sick leave. ... At the end of his cross-examination he said that it was “really a bonus” and he regarded $7,009.52 as “extra wages”. The character of the payment must be of a revenue nature. It is not a payment in the nature of capital. I consider that it is clearly within the definition of monetary remuneration in sec 2. There is also the later TRA decision in Case L92 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,530, where Barber DJ again considered the definition of “monetary remuneration”. This case also concerned an employee who was made redundant and an employer who did not comply with the requirement to give adequate notice. Barber DJ held that the payment came within the definition of “monetary remuneration” and was assessable income. However, the Authority did not consider any cases (other than his own previous decision in Case L78) on the correct characterisation of receipts for tax purposes, but rather concentrated upon the need to interpret “monetary remuneration” in a “wide manner” and the fact that the amount was received as compensation for loss of employment. Such compensation is specifically referred to in the definition of monetary remuneration. Recognising that it was possible for some receipts of a capital nature to be assessable income under a specific provision, Barber DJ at page 1,537 stated: 13 In this case, the words in sec 2 “compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” must surely cover not only a revenue type of payment such as a payment for lost wages, but also any other form of compensation for loss of employment. It may also be relevant to observe that both of these TRA decisions concerned settlements under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. This earlier legislation made no specific and separate provision for compensation payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. It is also thought that payments of the type under consideration in this Ruling are to be distinguished from those considered in American cases such as the Commissioner v Schleier 95-USTC 50,309. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that certain punitive damages were assessable to the recipient employee. However, apart from the differing statutory context in the United States Internal Revenue Code, these damages were punitive because they related to a deliberate breach of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and that Act does not provide for a separate recovery of compensatory damages for pain and suffering or emotional distress. The New Zealand Court of Appeal in Air New Zealand Ltd v Johnston \[1992\] 1 NZLR 159 seemingly rejected the view that humiliation type payments to employees are punitive in nature rather than compensatory. In that case Cooke J held at page 168 that “the emphasis evidently placed by the Labour Court on the punitive aspect does justify, in my opinion, a radical interference with their award.” The award of $135,000 was replaced with one of $25,000, made up of $15,000 for future economic loss and $10,000 for injury to feelings. Income under ordinary concepts Compensation payments genuinely made under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are not income under ordinary concepts under section CA 1(2). Although the legislation does not define income under ordinary concepts, a great number of cases have identified the concept by reference to such characteristics as periodicity, recurrence, and regularity, or by its resulting from business activities, the deliberate seeking of profit, or the performance of services. Nor do capital receipts form part of “income” unless there is a specific legislative provision to the contrary. It is clear that payments under section 123(1)(c)(i) will not generally be made periodically or regularly, or generally recur. Nor as we have seen above, are they compensation for services. And by analogy with common law damages, they are of a capital nature. This point is acknowledged by Barber DJ in Case L92, where he stated at page 1,536 that: I appreciate only too well that it is possible to interpret the evidence as showing that the $7,179.30 was formulated as a payment in the nature of common law damages for human hurt and breach and unfairness... I appreciate that the latter concepts are akin more to payments of capital than to wage revenue. 14 Out of court settlements Sometimes, an employee and an employer negotiate a settlement out of court. The settlement agreement may state that the payment is for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. In return for the employee surrendering his or her rights under the Employment Relations Act, the employer will agree to pay a sum of money. There should be no difference in the tax treatment of the payments dependent on whether or not the parties use the Employment Relations Authority or Employment Court. A payment can be for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee whether the Authority or Court are involved or not. Shams The Ruling will not apply to payments which are akin to sham payments. A sham is a transaction set up to conceal the true intention of the parties and is inherently ineffective. The nature of a sham was discussed by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Investment Ltd \[1967\] 1 All ER 518 at 528 where he stated: I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the “sham”, which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. Richardson J, in the New Zealand case of Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, stated that the “essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged” in a sham situation. It is noteworthy that in the Taxation Review Authority decision Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603, Judge Barber stated at page 7,606: Of course, seemingly excessive allocations to compensation for feelings injury should be reopened by the IRD. If the parties to an agreement agree to characterise or describe payments as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings when they are in reality for lost wages, this transaction would be a sham which would be open to challenge by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, he may ask the parties to an agreement what steps they took to evaluate objectively what would be a reasonable amount to attribute to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement and whether or not the agreement is signed by a mediator under the Employment Relations Act. Further, as provided by section 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and section 136(16) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the onus of proof in a hearing regarding the assessability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer. 15
